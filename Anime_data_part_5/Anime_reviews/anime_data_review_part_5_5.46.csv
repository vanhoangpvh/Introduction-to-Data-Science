Tenkuu Senki Shurato: Sousei e no Anto,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2114/Tenkuu_Senki_Shurato__Sousei_e_no_Anto,"['An ok sequel to the original t.v serie´s , not too special i guess but the ova´s miss some things, The good late 80´s adventurous soundtracks, more attention to additional chara., power development , and the VERY FLASHY fights although some of it come´s back at times. The animation is bit improved unlike the t.v show and more colorful as well the armor they are wearing, but the violent stuff and the dark setting  is really toned down wich gave me the feeling that the story is somewhat rushed and should put in more potential, especially the dark storysetting. Characters are alright but have...been put in a lighter role for the time being until the end of the ova´s! overall it could do way better for my  likings, but its a nice atribution to my collection! been put in a lighter role for the time being until the end of the ova´s! overall it could do way better for my  likings, but its a nice atribution to my collection!']"

The boy keeps the feather in the hope of finding that girl again one day. The dreams described the realities that each one of them experienced in their worlds. The boy was always trying to find that...girl and on the other hand, she was waiting for him in eternal solitude. In the end, in a very metaphorical way, an elderly man reunites with the girl and gives her back the feather, I think it is an excellent representation of what death is, for me it was very beautiful.I want to highlight the art of this work, despite the fact that it is a sequence of images and not an animation, each image is pure art, handmade and with very small details that feed into the story, it was what I liked most of all. girl and on the other hand, she was waiting for him in eternal solitude.

Tori No Uta is really closer to an image book with the text being read out loud instead of written on the pages, given that the visual aspect of it consists of a succession of Yoshitaka Amano's paintings, with voice-overs for the narration and dialogue.It's a very surreal, quite literally dreamlike experience as most of the story revolves around exploring the two main characters' dreams. There's a lot of room for personal interpretation, a lot of elements are...clearly metaphorical and each dream gives you a lot of insight into the psyche of the characters, while also being strange and full of creativity. The broad strokes of the story are easy to follow though, and the art, despite the lack of animation, is extremely beautiful, intricate and expressive, which makes it easy to get invested.I don't think it's an anime for everyone, you have to be open to unconventional and experimental stuff, but if you are I think you might find it to be a very enchanting and intriguing experience, I know I did, and I think it has the potential to resonate with you quite deeply if you find a little bit of yourself in the characters and their dreams. And besides that, if you're into Yoshitaka Amano's art, it's just a pure visual treat. clearly metaphorical and each dream gives you a lot of insight into the psyche of the characters, while also being strange and full of creativity.

Xian Feng Jianyu Lu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42291/Xian_Feng_Jianyu_Lu,"[""The comment above is telling the truth but luckily i was skeptical about it because i was dead about to drop this within 2 episodes. Let me break this down for you the episode duration are 8 minutes however the opening song takes up 2 minutes which means the episode is actually 6 minutes and less. So from the 2 episodes the FL is a fox sprite and the ML is a tao but otherwise than that my perspective to what the above comment state is different from theirs don’t get me wrong there is truth to it but judging from this person's perspective they...might have a bias against this anime.Well, that’s what i think they do everything like the comment stated but they learn form each other first off both ML and FL have biases against each other race ML at start thinks all demons are bad and FL thinks all humans are trickers heck they didn’t even know that thor own race can sometimes be worst than each other race.So in like ep 9 it shows the FL slowly overcoming her own bias against her own race because in this episode she killed her own kind and thinks she did something bad but a bit more into the episode she learns that the demon bird had kidnapped innocent kids and she didn’t think that the demon would kidnap innocent children and from there we see her biases against her own race crumble. Don’t get me wrong she still thinks that her kind is good but she also knows that there are bad demons out there just like humans so at this point, the FL doesn’t see everything as black and white.Now going into ep 28 ML capture a rabbit demon girl was about to kill it but FL stops him saying that she is just a girl and that instead of killing her he should interrogate her on what really happened with Mr.Zhu being enchanted by her beauty and it seems like because she was beautiful the dude just lost and became enchanted it wasn’t the demon rabbit girl fault and with ep 28 ML learned that not all demons are bad and he even stated that his change of mind happens because of FL he only got to break his own bias because that nothing is absolute in the world as in just as there is bad humans there is good humans that can also be said for demons too. Right there in the episode, it shows that they both are learning from each other although their kind is supposed to be enemies they are learning from each other.In ep 29 FL got angry at rabbit girl because she was clinging to ML to follow him heck it i was starting to get a harem vibe but FL didn’t back down and chase the rabbit girl away but the rabbit girl was being persistence on following ML and then ML step in and chase away rabbit girl by remind her that he gives her a chance to run away and he took out his sword to scare her off.In ep 30 that’s when other Taoists is interested in FL like asking her question about what she likes or what she would want;Ep 31 piggybacks off of 30 and the Taoist line up every day giving her either presents or having tea with her.As we get closer to ep 40 and 50 it doesn’t give like hardcore romance its a slow-burning romance furthermore the ML is supposed to be a Taoist so even if he knows his feelings he ignores it because he wants to be something like a monk. On the other hand, FL doesn’t even know her feeling for ML too well. We did see them getting close to each other but it’s just getting to know one another. Also, FL and ML don’t cause trouble for each other maybe in the single eps like 1-9 but the fix the mistake that they cause for each other. Even if FL knows her feeling for ML she is in denial because they are enemies but she still thinks humans and demons can be together but maybe not them because he is literally her enemy he's a Taoist.Ep 51 ML went on a date with one of his colleague sisters which hits at FL's feelings of jealousy. In this ep, it doesn’t show that he’s gonna be a monk but later on although it seems like he has a crush on the colleague's sister he think she likes him but FL knocked some sense into him because she is a female she knows that the colleague doesn’t actually like ML and tell ML about it and ML was like what would she be after faking her affection because she doesn’t know about the fire sword or the ice sphere and FL went and said maybe what your investigation and ML was like she wouldn’t know because i wouldn’t tell her and the only reason why ML is kind of crushing on is that she was kind to him when everyone bullied him.Ep 55 is where ML believe what FL said was true about the colleague's sister because he’s being framed for setting fire to a place that keeps a record of the demon they also say hes on the demon's side. Keep in mind ML doesn’t even know FL is a demon heck he only let the rabbit girl go but the people framing him make it seem like he’s working for the demons when he actually isn’t. Ep 56-59 piggyback off of 55 so to prove that ML is innocent FL was there to save him mind you this is the only time she saves him.I watched the complete anime it was good from my perspective if you wanna watch it just watch 1-10 ep to give it a try also keep in min the episodes are really short so it doesn’t kill u just to watch up to 10ep to know if you like it or not. Also, the MCs don’t have commitment issues because they were never together, to begin with, it’s only at the closing in ep 69-70 that it seems like they will start to develop a relationship mind you ML don’t go to all girls that approach him also let me add if he does approach the opposite gender its either they cast their demonic charm but the incident with the colleague sister was where he led to his own demise that was the one time he was being wishy-washy that was it as for the FL she only uses her demonic charm to help in their demon hunt. If you don’t believe it just watch the dam 1-10 episodes to be your own judge if it's a good anime or not because we all have a different perspective.

She opens up a new world to him not just with a sutra but as a friend, potential lover in time, ally and student.The problem is the MC lacks common sense, everything has been about revenge so is the usual potential harem protagonist, who ignores most overtures or avoids them.   He doesn't pay attention to the people plotting within the temples against him,...and doesn't bring back the full truths from mission for fear of what will happen, as if he knows somethings wrong, but walks into again and again.I found the show watchable. with the mystery of his masters death the main underlying theme, but the characters just seem poorly written with their actions and although the animation and music can be counted as good, the plot in general, and things like him worrying about a persons reputation when possibly facing death, and the oversight of the elders or lack there off make it look like our MC doesn't really have a friend at all there bar one.   It was kinda depressing that way, and continued to get more depressing as i continued.    Sadly too much seems to rely on the cute fox girl, and filler seemed to take away from the story of the ghosts, even if they are trying to tie his prejudices being overcome and romance in, when he is pretty oblivious thinking she is just teasing him.Had heard this was great, but disappointing, a nice idea, poorly played out and doesn't bring back the full truths from mission for fear of what will happen, as if he knows somethings wrong, but walks into again and again.I found the show watchable. with the mystery of his masters death the main underlying theme, but the characters just seem poorly written with their actions and although the animation and music can be counted as good, the plot in general, and things like him worrying about a persons reputation when possibly facing death, and the oversight of the elders or lack there off make it look like our MC doesn't really have a friend at all there bar one.

Uchuu Senshi Baldios,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1737/Uchuu_Senshi_Baldios,"[""Baldios is basically a string of tragedies born from human greed and ambition. If you like old school space dramas, the chances are that you will enjoy this. I found it to be on par with the original Yamato, and even better in some ways.Like many shows of the era, it is heavily influenced by Uchuu Senkan Yamato. So much so that the plot of Baldios and the original Yamato are basically the same thing, with the only real differences being that the alien race isn't blue and there is mecha action involved. Well, there's a bit more to it than that, especially at the...end, but the set up is almost identical.The story is told at a mostly gripping pace. The first episodes are great and lock you in right away. Things inevitably slow down a bit, but there are some great two parters in there and overall I never felt like it came to a drag. The story is basically where this series is really going to shine. Trust and betrayal are a commonly occurring theme, as a big part of the show is about the struggle of the main character, Marin. He puts himself between a rock and a hard place as he decides to pilot the Baldios and fight against his own people on behalf of the people of Earth. The people of Earth are not very trusting of him though, including his own comrades, as he is one of the aliens. He goes through a lot of mental anguish over this and even goes back and forth between sides a bit. His motives and morality aren't really black and white, and he often succumbs to the overwhelming amount of stress put on him. He makes for an interesting, if not believable lead character, and is less one dimensional than the lead characters in these shows typically are.The music is fantastic. Being the handiwork of Kentarou Haneda, this is no surprise. Although it's not his best work, it's still very good. His style and signature guitar riffs permeate all throughout the series and truly make up much of the personality of the show. It wouldn't be the same without him. There are great insert songs as well, with the most memorable one being a Isao Taira (Ideon, Bryger, Daiohja) tune. The show was produced in the early 80s, but for the most part it looks (and feels) like it's straight out of the 70s. There isn't much that is remarkable about the art, you can pretty much assume what to expect if you've seen an Ashi/Reed show or any old mecha.One particularly weird thing about this show is the mecha elements. They are extremely tacked on. This show could easily exist without any mecha stuff, and whenever it comes up it feels forced. It really doesn't come up much to be honest though, and there are entire episodes with no mecha action. The beginning is a bit misleading with this. It feels like they wanted to make the mecha stuff feel important, but ultimately the emphasis put on the Baldios machine is all but completely dropped after the first half dozen episodes. You won't be coming out of this with many memories of the mecha using signature attacks and poses. Baldios certainly looks awesome though.The production history for Baldios is a bit wonky. According to whatever info I could dig up (there isn't much), this is yet another cancelled series. The show was originally planned to have 39 episodes, or at least storyboards were conceived for 39 episodes. Only 34 episodes were produced, and 31 of those episodes actually aired. When the series was released on video, all 34 episodes were included though. If the movie is the canon ending, then episode 34 is not canon. It is basically a completely different ending, that is simplistic and leaves important questions unanswered. It is probably the result of a rush job/cancellation. The movie does some recap, but essentially picks up at the end of the huge cliffhanger in episode 33.As for the movie itself, there are already some good reviews on it. It's great, and the best part of the entire experience. The grim atmosphere is at its most oppressive and the harsh reality of what has been going on is finally set in stone, and we watch everything crumble and hope completely fade. It's a powerful ending, and likely one you won't forget. I wouldn't really advise skipping the series if you want the full experience, as the characterization in the movie (recap parts) is weak, and not a very good substitute for the series. The recap parts also feel very janky and random, unfortunately. The new content in the movie though, is all excellent. Lastly, there are several versions of the movie. There is a lot of blood and violence, and it seems that most versions are edited. You'll want to watch the Japanese version if you want to see the original movie. end, but the set up is almost identical.The story is told at a mostly gripping pace.

You'll want to watch the Japanese version if you want to see the original movie."", 'Space Warrior Baldios is an anime TV series that originally aired from 1980 to 1981. At this time, the super robot genre from the 1970s was still raging on, and at first glance, Baldios looks to be yet another one of those shows. Three separate fighter crafts combine to form the titular mecha, which was quite the standard at the time. The well-known Mobile Suit Gundam, which premiered a year before hadn’t yet had have enough of a ripple effect on the industry to firmly establish the “real robot” genre. Despite this, Baldios does a fairly good job at distinguishing itself for the time.Baldios begins...on the planet S-1. Hopelessly polluted, the leaders of S-1 have two choices, either go along with military leader Gattler, who seeks to invade and take over another, less polluted planet, or the scientific community, led by Dr. Reigan, who are working on a device that they hope can help repair the environment. Gattler stages a military coup where S-1’s emperor is killed and he imposes himself as leader (or “fuhrer” as stated in the official US subtitles). Dr. Reigan is soon killed as well and his son, Marin is forced to flee in the craft Pulseburn. Gattler leads S-1’s populace and military forces, known as Aldebaran to space and Marin’s craft warps along with them to Earth.Gattler puts top underling, Aphrodia, in charge of Aldebaran’s forces as it seeks to take over Earth. Aphrodia has a personal grudge with Marin, who killed her brother while seeking escape. Marin makes his way down to Earth and becomes a key part of the Blue Fixer organization, the main force fighting off Aldebaran. Although initially doubted as an alien invader, Marin becomes a key part of Blue Fixer, who soon create the Baldios robot as their main fighting force.With the main narrative established, Baldios settles into its groove. Each episode tends to feature Aphrodia and the Aldebaran forces launching a new attempt to defeat Blue Fixer and take over Earth. And while the show is made up of mostly stand-alone episodes (with the occasional two—parter), it does a fairly good job at providing us with entertaining and non-repetitive storylines. In fact the mecha action of the show seems to take a back seat and is not a major part of each episode (although they do find a way to fit in the Baldios combining sequence in pretty much every episode). The character development of the show is fairly strong. Along with Marin, there’s approximately a half dozen central characters in the Blue Fixer organization and each gets some room for development and growth with their own focused episodes. Things rarely feel stale or repetitive. We also have several episodes that eschew the formula and focus largely on the Aldebaran side of things. While Gattler is pure evil, Aldebaran has several good people with in it as well and we meet several sympathetic characters in its ranks. Aphrodia gets a fair amount of development and it is interesting to see her views on Marin soften as the series goes on.Technically, the series is never going to really impress. The character animation is rather shoddy, the music is repetitive and the mecha design is nothing special. Technically, other shows of the same era like Gundam and Ideon outshine it here. Yet the story and characters more than make up for it.Things move to a head as we near the end of the show. The attacks by Aldebaran get more and more fierce, to a level where Gattler doesn’t care how much he environmentally damages the planet he is hoping to move his followers to. The show ends very abruptly (in the middle of a 2-parter in fact), and quite grimly. From what I have read, the show was cancelled, originally planning on 39 episodes, but only 31 got to air. This clearly shows. The recent US bluray release features 3 more episodes that were produced, one which acts as the penultimate episode and the latter 2 which take place after the aired finale and continue things. Although they don’t fully conclude the storyline they do feature a major plot twist which while shocking is also quite fitting. In order to see the complete ending, one will have to resort to the movie, which as of this writing I have yet to see.Anyway, for ones who like mecha/sci-fi shows, and anime from the late 70’s and early 80’s, this show is worth the experience and comes highly recommended. on the planet S-1. Hopelessly polluted, the leaders of S-1 have two choices, either go along with military leader Gattler, who seeks to invade and take over another, less polluted planet, or the scientific community, led by Dr. Reigan, who are working on a device that they hope can help repair the environment. Gattler stages a military coup where S-1’s emperor is killed and he imposes himself as leader (or “fuhrer” as stated in the official US subtitles). Dr. Reigan is soon killed as well and his son, Marin is forced to flee in the craft Pulseburn. Gattler leads S-1’s populace and military forces, known as Aldebaran to space and Marin’s craft warps along with them to Earth.Gattler puts top underling, Aphrodia, in charge of Aldebaran’s forces as it seeks to take over Earth. Aphrodia has a personal grudge with Marin, who killed her brother while seeking escape. Marin makes his way down to Earth and becomes a key part of the Blue Fixer organization, the main force fighting off Aldebaran. Although initially doubted as an alien invader, Marin becomes a key part of Blue Fixer, who soon create the Baldios robot as their main fighting force.With the main narrative established, Baldios settles into its groove. Each episode tends to feature Aphrodia and the Aldebaran forces launching a new attempt to defeat Blue Fixer and take over Earth. And while the show is made up of mostly stand-alone episodes (with the occasional two—parter), it does a fairly good job at providing us with entertaining and non-repetitive storylines. In fact the mecha action of the show seems to take a back seat and is not a major part of each episode (although they do find a way to fit in the Baldios combining sequence in pretty much every episode). The character development of the show is fairly strong. Along with Marin, there’s approximately a half dozen central characters in the Blue Fixer organization and each gets some room for development and growth with their own focused episodes.

That on itself wouldn't be much of a problem. What is a huge issue, however, is the tone of the story. You come in expecting the melancholic and tragic mood that the movie and the OP gives off - instead you get constant screaming and an overall atmosphere of chaos. Incompetent main characters...that act like children despite being adults, constantly bickering when the lives of others are at stake. By the end of each episodes countless are dead not because of the tragedy of war, but because of the aforementioned incompetence.What also ended up being very disappointing was the character of Roza Aphrodia. Once again, thank God for the movie. There she is made into an actual character torn between her will of wanting to be a loved woman and the goal of revenging her brother and being a heartless warrior. Heartless doesn't mean crazy though. And that's exactly how Aphrodia is in the show. I hate to repeat myself, but all she ever does is acts as much inhumane as possible and YELLS at the top of her lungs (literally). The later episodes try to make you feel sorry for her but considering all of the terrible things she's done it's simply impossible (in contrast, once again, with the movie, where she is cruel but not crazy, at least has some hope for her). These attempts feel really hypocritical and annoying.There simply is no point in watching this unless you're a hardcore mecha fan who just wants to see everything in the genre. The episodes are full of logical hoops, are disjointed and almost all disconnected from one another, the main characters you're supposed to root for act idiotic and due to that seem evil themselves sometimes. The charismatic female henchman (probably one of the earliest examples in anime) deserves no pity that is demanded due to acting insane. Any attempts at being melodramatic just look out of place in the TV-series, considering all the events that were prior. Corny, forced, these are the words that come to mind.As I said, if you want to experience the true meaning of Baldios - watch the movie. It's not corny nor chaotic, has the feel of an actual piece of art with its directing, melancholic and tragic tone that is consistent. that act like children despite being adults, constantly bickering when the lives of others are at stake.

One of the S-1 residents, Marin Reigan, is opposed to Gattler\'s plans following his father\'s murder during the coup and allies with the human members of the military organization Blue Fixer to combat them. Using the technology of his spaceship, Blue Fixer are able to use it to form the mecha Baldios to combat the threat from Gattler...and his regime.Much like several of famous Gundam director Yoshiyuki Tomino\'s mecha titles of the time period, Baldios carries a somber and bleak tone in focusing on the conflict between S-1 and Blue Fixer over the Earth\'s fate. There is a good deal of destruction and a high kill count that unfolds throughout the anime\'s run to show how conflicts such as war can lead to pointless death and destruction of all that we would care for. This is best reflected in Gattler\'s regime, as his single-minded desire to conquer Earth at any cost prevents him from realizing that he is leading Earth down the same path of destruction that led his home world of S-1 to the state that it was left in. As the series progresses, attacks from S-1 grow more merciless and causes friction internally within the military\'s ranks as the war between S-1 and Earth drags out. While the regime is mostly depicted as ruthless in their goals, some characters in their ranks are depicted in a more sympathetic light. This is most notably depicted with Gattler\'s second-in-command, Aphrodia, who is shown to gradually become more conflicted in her thoughts of Marin and her loyalty toward Gattler as episodes in the series progress.Outside of the anime\'s focus on the conflict between S-1 and Earth, Baldios also devotes time to exploring the personal lives of several of its major characters and how each are affected by the ongoing conflict. The various members of Blue Fixer have varying circumstances within their personal lives which affects them and that specific episodes within the series are devoted to exploring, particularly when an S-1 attack affects an element to said character\'s personal life. Marin also gets focus at a number of points in Baldios as he deals with prejudice from humanity at first for assuming he\'s a spy for S-1 and the hard decisions he is forced to make to ensure Earth\'s prosperity against his own race. For an early 80s mecha anime ran in a somewhat episodic format, Baldios is surprisingly solid with exploring how each of its characters are impacted by the conflict between S-1 and Earth.Praises aside, Baldios isn\'t without its issues. Due to the series being abruptly cancelled due to low TV ratings during its original airing, Baldios does lack a conclusive ending as it ends during a rather major point in the anime\'s ongoing conflict. While there was a compilation movie for Baldios that later came out to provide a proper conclusion to the series, said conclusion did alter some plot elements from the TV anime that affect its consistency with some plot details.The presentation for the series hasn\'t aged too well as the animation is rather rough to look at compared to modern titles and there are a good deal of animation shortcuts employed throughout its run. Plus, the anime\'s soundtrack is rather underwhelming at a number of points with properly conveying mood during key scenes. There are a couple lyrical tracks that do well at conveying a melancholic mood with Baldios\' developments, but the frequency of their use does get repetitive over time.The final issue stems from the titular mecha of the series. While many mech titles of the era prominently featured their mecha as a vital part of their premises, the presence of the Baldios mecha felt largely unnecessary throughout the show\'s run as any conflict it gets used in largely plays second fiddle to the anime\'s focus on exploring its characters and how Earth is affected by S-1\'s attacks. Some episodes of the series don\'t even feature Baldios, as the series is instead focused on exploring a plot element occurring with the conflict or the show\'s characters.These hiccups aside, Baldios is a solid entry in the mecha genre for its time period that depicts the brutality of war and how those involved in the war between S-1 and Earth are affected by the increased brutality of the conflict. If you\'re a fan of old-school mecha titles, I\'d at least recommend checking out the series at least once. and his regime.Much like several of famous Gundam director Yoshiyuki Tomino\'s mecha titles of the time period, Baldios carries a somber and bleak tone in focusing on the conflict between S-1 and Blue Fixer over the Earth\'s fate.

(it's a low-key kill 'em all show like Ideon)If you like vintage super robot shows regardless of animations quality, you will like Baldios. however, are pretty bad and might send people off but for those who don't mind (like Gundam 0079 animations) won't have much trouble enjoying this series.What I liked the most about this show is how the bad guys don't rely on their mechs all the time like in other super robot shows, but they even plan disasters like floods, poison crops to make people starve to death, mess with other planets to hurt Earth's gravity, etc... it's pretty much a series of brutal disasters.It also has a nice touch of random background characters contributing to the drama like how some of the good guys base employees try to threaten Marin for being an alien whenever they feel desperate to save their families.Since this show is canceled, the show ends with a cliffhanger but luckily there's a movie to fill in the ending.Overall, I give this show a 8/10 for having great drama, new ideas, and for its brutal nature.

Vatican Kiseki Chousakan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34368/Vatican_Kiseki_Chousakan,"['A fierce orange candle glow shatters the cold darkness of the night. Near a forest chapel, a group of strange hooded figures circle around the Ouija board, put forth their hands and begin their chant. Suddenly, a guard picks up on the sight, boldly confronting them with a blinding blue flashlight as they run off. “Damn brats! Playing demon rituals again, huh?” The guard continues his work. Craving a drink, he enters the large, creaky door of the nearby chapel.He gasps.DRAMATIC MUSIC rings out as he stands at the entrance gawking at something-or-other?! Several awkward seconds pass before the cameraman remembers to show what on...earth is so shocking!! INTENSE CLOSE-UPS ensue of... majestic, sparkling blonde hair? Buckets of deep red blood... gracefully drift down from some man’s hands like soft rose petals? In light of the HORRIFIC sight, the guard utters the first thing that comes to mind:“They’re floating in the air!!” …I mean…huh? Oh, yes, that is what he says, because that’s what the script demands that he point out to the audience. Never mind the blood; that apparently doesn’t faze a guard like him.This first minute hints at what the more enjoyable parts of Vatican Miracle Examiner are all about: campy mystery-horror shenanigans from a show trying its hardest to be dark, intriguing and dramatic, but more often coming off as plain silly; posing as if it knows what it’s doing when it clearly hasn’t a clue; sloppily trying to be well-directed and dramatically presented, while cutting corners wherever possible; masquerading as gripping mystery brilliance, while viewers just laugh at how absurd it all is. At its best, Vatican Miracle Examiner is enjoyable for almost entirely the wrong reasons… and I love it! Or at least, I love the first third of it. But that doesn’t mean I enjoyed all of it, nor do I consider it to be a well-made show... by any stretch.Shows dubbed “so bad, they\'re good” hold a rather niche appeal. Many viewers simply aren’t interested or amused by watching shows because they’re laughably bad, and even among those who are, what one finds hilarious may induce groans of annoyance or soul-numbing agony in others. But for those who do get a kick out of this sort of thing, I recommend trying out the first 4 episodes and then skipping the rest. I say first 4 because they, by far, best encapsulate what makes this show such a riot at times, while I found the rest far less consistently enjoyable. For now, let’s focus on the opening arc, and how it manages to be so extraordinarily good at being entertainingly bad!The premise of a mystery show where Josef and Robert, two miracle examiners for the Vatican, investigate reports of seemingly divine or supernatural incidents to uncover the truth, was a workable one. In the right hands, this could have made for a truly intriguing watch, but the series stumbles at just about every step, the first such step being its visual presentation. The animation and shot composition give off a constant sense that they\'re trying way too hard, while paradoxically being as lazy as possible… or just not knowing any better. Sometimes, it’s hard to tell.Imagine a teen who just started using a new curse word, whether to feel grownup or just to add emphasis to everything. But the person gets too excited and overuses it, throwing the word into every sentence multiple times, trying so hard to use it everywhere whether appropriate or not, without realizing that they’ve effectively destroyed its emphatic nature. The result just becomes silly. The word loses all its power when the person uses it all the time without rest.Apparently, the director’s new curse word was the Dutch angle, a cinematic technique in which the camera is positioned at an angle on its roll axis. This is often used to give a sense of psychological unease or tension… when used properly, anyway! Vatican uses so many Dutch angles, even in mundane situations, that it becomes downright ridiculous, like it wants to add as MUCH UNEASE AS POSSIBLE, failing to realize the importance of moderation!Sometimes it even ends up disorienting the viewer… or perhaps that’s just because in all the excitement about showing off this new skill, fundamentals like establishing shots or proper timing and lighting are often neglected. It also uses a lot of very noticeable cheap tricks to save on animation, chief among them being an excessive number of extreme slow-panning close-ups so only characters’ lips ever have to move. This excess of slow-panning Dutch tilt close-ups often leaves little sense of spatial awareness for the audience.At times this leads to hilarious failed attempts at a shocking or dramatic scene. I mentioned the intro scene above. In another episode, the show tried to pull off a SHOCKING CLIFFHANGER where… well, I think it was trying to make us believe one or more major characters had suddenly been killed by some Dagger Ex Machina figure in the woods (with absolutely no buildup). Beyond being a cheap suspense tactic to begin with, it was also so badly shot with disorienting tilted-sideways-panning-ultra-close-ups, that I genuinely couldn’t tell what on earth these yelling characters were doing until the scene ended on a vague slow-motion blood splatter that may or may not have been from one of the established characters. It was only then, that I realized, “wait, that was supposed to be a cliffhanger?” It’s safe to say it was a failed one.Adding to this sense of silly presentation is the soundtrack, which in fairness, almost manages to be good; it\'s pleasing to the ears with lots of mood-setting themes and safe but suitable instrument choices. The issue is that, like most things in the show, it tends to try a little too hard, frequently becoming overbearing or unsuitably dramatic without rest, and adding to the overall sense of pseudo-dark silliness.But beyond the presentation, the real riot comes from the show’s content, and in particular, how it handles its mystery elements!Throughout its first arc, Vatican Miracle Examiner reads like the mystery-horror equivalent of how an inexperienced student of Michael Bay might try to plot a series; it goes for spectacle and plot twists above anything else at the expense of integrity or non-superficial viewer interest. Vatican is far from the only anime or even mystery anime to do this, though the degree to which it does so in its first arc (almost) commands respect for its sheer, bullheaded commitment!The show’s modus operandi is to simply spout as much exposition in as short a time as possible, and act like it’s supposed to be intrigue. Then when it comes time to reveal the unbelievably over-the-top and ludicrous “answers”, you only occasionally get some semblance of proper buildup and deduction. More often than not, the show just asspulls extra information that somehow never made it into the expository typhoon for the viewer to be aware of, or be able to in any way reasonably deduce it for themselves. Usually it’s too out-there and stupid to cross the viewer’s mind anyway, yet still, the show acts like our main characters Josef and Robert are oh-so-clever for figuring it out!In addition, even in the more “fair-play” micro-mysteries, the solutions tend to either leave unanswered questions, or rely on real-world knowledge of physics or history, while fudging the details to the degree that it no longer makes sense. The weeping statue incident is a good example of this; it was seemingly an attempt to incorporate real-world miracle reports from the Vatican, but went with a scientifically not-quite-accurate explanation that ended up being hard to buy into.Other times, it will seem to contradict its own premise, with apparent “miracles”, which would normally be investigated to determine their validity, being either accepted or denied by its main characters without a second thought, just for the sake of the plot. One egregious instance of this was when one of the main miracle examiners had a dream about a hooded figure, then later accepted that dream as a premonition just because someone happened to say he might have seen a hooded figure in the distance one night, and apparently a person who happens to have a hood is just that unusual of a sight.Tying all this miss-tery together is a cast consisting entirely of sticks and mouthpieces, or, in more technical terms, walking plot devices and expository figures! They display minimal personality, minimal development, and minimal reason to exist other than to move the plot along, pull solutions to mysteries out of thin air, or become another *gasp* SHOCKING DEAD BODY COVERED IN BLOOD! Typically I’d complain about how this reduces its cast to shock puppets instead of emotional anchors, but here, it just made things funnier! Not only because the runaway plot train was part of the appeal, but because of the amusingly clumsy ways these expository fountains get used!The only thing to come out of any character’s mouth in a typical scene is a shotgun spray of expository verbal diarrhea on topics that often come up without any provocation! Character A will simply ask about someone’s name, and then Character B will go on an extended ramble about how much of a fantastic war hero and caretaker of children he was, among other backstory details that would never naturally come up in context. People randomly change subjects or go on unprompted tangents, with little attempt to maintain proper conversational flow. Everything in this show has to be spelled out in blood, no matter how inorganic it comes off; there’s no restraint to be found.This applies even to the most mundane topics of discussion, which are usually treated with the gravity expected of big, decisive evidence kick-starting a hot pursuit of a serial killer! The show’s unrestrained brand of dramatic music shines through to amplify this effect, and it fits right into the silliness of everything else!Making all this even better is the absolutely breakneck pacing of the first story arc! With no boring handcuffs like characterization or proper regard for logic to worry about, its barrage of ironic entertainment is nonstop! A crazy highlight reel of all the best-worst parts of the story, because who cares about expanding on the world or the cast? May as well just keep things insane and escalating constantly! Normally I’d say this was a problem, but in this case I think it was the right choice, as it helped eliminate even short moments of boredom that would otherwise exist in such an incompetently-written arc. It even adds to the otherwise limited non-ironic fun factor a fair bit. This show barrels through its early material blisteringly fast, bouncing between set pieces and piling on bad mystery after bad mystery that I knew by episode 2 would lead to some hilarious attempt to tie it all together, and likely a spectacular failure to do so with any sense of tact.Gosh, was I ever happy to be right!Episode 4 is the real goldmine; it was the pinnacle of my experience with this show, and one of the greatest “jump the shark” moments in anime! A series of reveals and resolutions so baffling, it’s absolutely amazing! All those insane mysteries, and all the forced exposition, get shoddily smashed together into an explosion of sex cults, faux-history, voodoo magic, physics-busting explanations, deranged psychopaths, ridiculous plot armor, and self-contradictions! Exorbitant amounts of information pulled from a zeppelin-sized ass to create a perfect storm of laughter and disbelief! It boisterously puffs out its mystery-writing chest, thinking it’s so amazingly clever for bringing all this together in a way its audience never could have seen coming! It proudly shows off answers more far-fetched than simply throwing one’s hands up and saying, “It was indeed a miracle after all!” I dare not spoil those answers here. They’re worth experiencing firsthand! Hypothetically, if Santa were to fly off to the moon with a giant cannon to fire moon dust at the earth, suffocating its population in lunar ash because climate change made him run out of snow, that would be a sensible story by comparison! This episode\'s story managed to set new standards for what I look for in ironically-enjoyable bad anime! One that could be summed up in 2 words: “Holy Crap!”The degree of ineptitude and absurdity were so high at times that I seriously questioned if the show was actually presenting and scripting itself this way on purpose – intentionally being as stupid and hilarious as possible while taking itself seriously as some sort of twisted satire of the mystery/horror genres, or just for the fun of it. I simply couldn’t fathom the idea that the show was somehow blissfully unaware of it all. Alas, nothing further emerged to support this theory, and I was forced to accept that it appeared to be genuine. It was actually meant to be taken seriously while handling such plainly outlandish concepts so poorly. Despite this, I was still on board with it, both for comedic reasons and just to see what lunacy it would come up with next! But alas, even on this front, the final result disappoints.The show never quite recaptures the side-splitting insanity of its first arc, becoming more hit-or-miss in its entertainment value. Ironically, this seemingly resulted from efforts to make something somewhat closer to being within sniffing range of competent. The pace drastically slows to something more conventional, but less fun. The dialogue is, at the very least, closer to believable, but less hilarious, and still almost entirely composed of exposition dumps. There\'s still no meaningful characterization or character development in sight, which just leaves little reason to remain invested.The series does come up with a few interesting ideas, like the psychological effects of having all of one’s wishes immediately granted against one’s control, but instead of leveraging them to create a more fleshed-out cast, it just explores these ideas in the same exaggerated, barely-thought-out fashion all the way through. The result is that little of it is able to resonate properly. The show had a glimmer of a chance to pull off its own miracle and obtain genuinely decent qualities, but ultimately fell short.Meanwhile, the questionable direction, hilariously stupid concepts, and bad mystery habits all remain, but are more sporadic in their appeal. The show still overuses Dutch angles and dark close-up pans even in the most mundane of discussions; still spouts nonsense desperately trying to be intrigue; still addresses the nonsense by pulling crucial information out of a hat when it decides to “solve” the mystery; still acts as though these implausible solutions are clever. And as always, the show still takes the idea of a golden life-size Jesus statue making weird horn sounds, glowing, and erupting in sparkles and rainbows each morning, just a little too seriously! That one\'s real, by the way, and the ""explanation"" is as dumb as ever! But this only makes up a fraction of the remainder of the show, with the rest being disappointingly dull.I’ll say that despite frequently leaving loose ends and forgetting plot threads, the later episodes were overall a technical improvement over the early ones. But even with these small improvements, it’s definitely not worth watching Vatican Miracle Examiner for its own merits, since it never manages to grasp the fundamentals of proper intrigue, presentation, or anything else. Instead, its first arc is best watched for a good laugh. Perhaps the show as a whole could also be examined to see how not to write a good mystery horror. But frankly, it’s a bore at points coming off the first arc, and it’s up for debate whether it’s worth sitting through its lows just for highs that don’t come close to episode 4’s gambits. To be honest, I’m a little disappointed.Enjoyment: 6/10 (8.5/10 for the first arc)At the end of the day, unintentional comedic gold is still comedic gold. Even when Vatican’s breakneck pace slowed down a bit after the first arc, there were still a few moments of entertainment, though still for the wrong reasons, and with many lackluster moments in between. As for the first arc, it’s a nonstop hilarious brand of stupid, and I had a blast with it! I encourage those interested to give the first 4 episodes a go for this very reason, though the rest is definitely skippable.Overall: 2/10Vatican Miracle Examiner loses steam fast after its first third, but that initial third is either the spawn of Satan, or a glorious gift from above, depending on one’s perspective! Between its clueless presentation, forced exposition, rushed and sloppy direction, mishandled cast, impressively clumsy script, and revelations too bafflingly ridiculous to articulate with words alone, Vatican Miracle Examiner’s first arc is the most spectacular mess I’ve seen all summer! And that’s exactly why I loved it! It tries SO hard to be dark and serious, but its inept absurdity and complete lack of subtlety just make it a campy 50-pound cheeseball, with tons of potential comedic value! The rest of the show, on the other hand can be safely discarded. earth is so shocking!! INTENSE CLOSE-UPS ensue of... majestic, sparkling blonde hair? Buckets of deep red blood... gracefully drift down from some man’s hands like soft rose petals? In light of the HORRIFIC sight, the guard utters the first thing that comes to mind:“They’re floating in the air!!” …I mean…huh? Oh, yes, that is what he says, because that’s what the script demands that he point out to the audience. Never mind the blood; that apparently doesn’t faze a guard like him.This first minute hints at what the more enjoyable parts of Vatican Miracle Examiner are all about: campy mystery-horror shenanigans from a show trying its hardest to be dark, intriguing and dramatic, but more often coming off as plain silly; posing as if it knows what it’s doing when it clearly hasn’t a clue; sloppily trying to be well-directed and dramatically presented, while cutting corners wherever possible; masquerading as gripping mystery brilliance, while viewers just laugh at how absurd it all is. At its best, Vatican Miracle Examiner is enjoyable for almost entirely the wrong reasons… and I love it! Or at least, I love the first third of it. But that doesn’t mean I enjoyed all of it, nor do I consider it to be a well-made show... by any stretch.Shows dubbed “so bad, they\'re good” hold a rather niche appeal. Many viewers simply aren’t interested or amused by watching shows because they’re laughably bad, and even among those who are, what one finds hilarious may induce groans of annoyance or soul-numbing agony in others. But for those who do get a kick out of this sort of thing, I recommend trying out the first 4 episodes and then skipping the rest. I say first 4 because they, by far, best encapsulate what makes this show such a riot at times, while I found the rest far less consistently enjoyable. For now, let’s focus on the opening arc, and how it manages to be so extraordinarily good at being entertainingly bad!The premise of a mystery show where Josef and Robert, two miracle examiners for the Vatican, investigate reports of seemingly divine or supernatural incidents to uncover the truth, was a workable one. In the right hands, this could have made for a truly intriguing watch, but the series stumbles at just about every step, the first such step being its visual presentation. The animation and shot composition give off a constant sense that they\'re trying way too hard, while paradoxically being as lazy as possible… or just not knowing any better. Sometimes, it’s hard to tell.Imagine a teen who just started using a new curse word, whether to feel grownup or just to add emphasis to everything. But the person gets too excited and overuses it, throwing the word into every sentence multiple times, trying so hard to use it everywhere whether appropriate or not, without realizing that they’ve effectively destroyed its emphatic nature. The result just becomes silly. The word loses all its power when the person uses it all the time without rest.Apparently, the director’s new curse word was the Dutch angle, a cinematic technique in which the camera is positioned at an angle on its roll axis. This is often used to give a sense of psychological unease or tension… when used properly, anyway! Vatican uses so many Dutch angles, even in mundane situations, that it becomes downright ridiculous, like it wants to add as MUCH UNEASE AS POSSIBLE, failing to realize the importance of moderation!Sometimes it even ends up disorienting the viewer… or perhaps that’s just because in all the excitement about showing off this new skill, fundamentals like establishing shots or proper timing and lighting are often neglected. It also uses a lot of very noticeable cheap tricks to save on animation, chief among them being an excessive number of extreme slow-panning close-ups so only characters’ lips ever have to move. This excess of slow-panning Dutch tilt close-ups often leaves little sense of spatial awareness for the audience.At times this leads to hilarious failed attempts at a shocking or dramatic scene. I mentioned the intro scene above. In another episode, the show tried to pull off a SHOCKING CLIFFHANGER where… well, I think it was trying to make us believe one or more major characters had suddenly been killed by some Dagger Ex Machina figure in the woods (with absolutely no buildup). Beyond being a cheap suspense tactic to begin with, it was also so badly shot with disorienting tilted-sideways-panning-ultra-close-ups, that I genuinely couldn’t tell what on earth these yelling characters were doing until the scene ended on a vague slow-motion blood splatter that may or may not have been from one of the established characters. It was only then, that I realized, “wait, that was supposed to be a cliffhanger?” It’s safe to say it was a failed one.Adding to this sense of silly presentation is the soundtrack, which in fairness, almost manages to be good; it\'s pleasing to the ears with lots of mood-setting themes and safe but suitable instrument choices. The issue is that, like most things in the show, it tends to try a little too hard, frequently becoming overbearing or unsuitably dramatic without rest, and adding to the overall sense of pseudo-dark silliness.But beyond the presentation, the real riot comes from the show’s content, and in particular, how it handles its mystery elements!Throughout its first arc, Vatican Miracle Examiner reads like the mystery-horror equivalent of how an inexperienced student of Michael Bay might try to plot a series; it goes for spectacle and plot twists above anything else at the expense of integrity or non-superficial viewer interest. Vatican is far from the only anime or even mystery anime to do this, though the degree to which it does so in its first arc (almost) commands respect for its sheer, bullheaded commitment!The show’s modus operandi is to simply spout as much exposition in as short a time as possible, and act like it’s supposed to be intrigue. Then when it comes time to reveal the unbelievably over-the-top and ludicrous “answers”, you only occasionally get some semblance of proper buildup and deduction. More often than not, the show just asspulls extra information that somehow never made it into the expository typhoon for the viewer to be aware of, or be able to in any way reasonably deduce it for themselves. Usually it’s too out-there and stupid to cross the viewer’s mind anyway, yet still, the show acts like our main characters Josef and Robert are oh-so-clever for figuring it out!In addition, even in the more “fair-play” micro-mysteries, the solutions tend to either leave unanswered questions, or rely on real-world knowledge of physics or history, while fudging the details to the degree that it no longer makes sense. The weeping statue incident is a good example of this; it was seemingly an attempt to incorporate real-world miracle reports from the Vatican, but went with a scientifically not-quite-accurate explanation that ended up being hard to buy into.Other times, it will seem to contradict its own premise, with apparent “miracles”, which would normally be investigated to determine their validity, being either accepted or denied by its main characters without a second thought, just for the sake of the plot. One egregious instance of this was when one of the main miracle examiners had a dream about a hooded figure, then later accepted that dream as a premonition just because someone happened to say he might have seen a hooded figure in the distance one night, and apparently a person who happens to have a hood is just that unusual of a sight.Tying all this miss-tery together is a cast consisting entirely of sticks and mouthpieces, or, in more technical terms, walking plot devices and expository figures! They display minimal personality, minimal development, and minimal reason to exist other than to move the plot along, pull solutions to mysteries out of thin air, or become another *gasp* SHOCKING DEAD BODY COVERED IN BLOOD! Typically I’d complain about how this reduces its cast to shock puppets instead of emotional anchors, but here, it just made things funnier! Not only because the runaway plot train was part of the appeal, but because of the amusingly clumsy ways these expository fountains get used!The only thing to come out of any character’s mouth in a typical scene is a shotgun spray of expository verbal diarrhea on topics that often come up without any provocation! Character A will simply ask about someone’s name, and then Character B will go on an extended ramble about how much of a fantastic war hero and caretaker of children he was, among other backstory details that would never naturally come up in context. People randomly change subjects or go on unprompted tangents, with little attempt to maintain proper conversational flow. Everything in this show has to be spelled out in blood, no matter how inorganic it comes off; there’s no restraint to be found.This applies even to the most mundane topics of discussion, which are usually treated with the gravity expected of big, decisive evidence kick-starting a hot pursuit of a serial killer! The show’s unrestrained brand of dramatic music shines through to amplify this effect, and it fits right into the silliness of everything else!Making all this even better is the absolutely breakneck pacing of the first story arc! With no boring handcuffs like characterization or proper regard for logic to worry about, its barrage of ironic entertainment is nonstop! A crazy highlight reel of all the best-worst parts of the story, because who cares about expanding on the world or the cast? May as well just keep things insane and escalating constantly! Normally I’d say this was a problem, but in this case I think it was the right choice, as it helped eliminate even short moments of boredom that would otherwise exist in such an incompetently-written arc. It even adds to the otherwise limited non-ironic fun factor a fair bit. This show barrels through its early material blisteringly fast, bouncing between set pieces and piling on bad mystery after bad mystery that I knew by episode 2 would lead to some hilarious attempt to tie it all together, and likely a spectacular failure to do so with any sense of tact.Gosh, was I ever happy to be right!Episode 4 is the real goldmine; it was the pinnacle of my experience with this show, and one of the greatest “jump the shark” moments in anime! A series of reveals and resolutions so baffling, it’s absolutely amazing! All those insane mysteries, and all the forced exposition, get shoddily smashed together into an explosion of sex cults, faux-history, voodoo magic, physics-busting explanations, deranged psychopaths, ridiculous plot armor, and self-contradictions! Exorbitant amounts of information pulled from a zeppelin-sized ass to create a perfect storm of laughter and disbelief! It boisterously puffs out its mystery-writing chest, thinking it’s so amazingly clever for bringing all this together in a way its audience never could have seen coming! It proudly shows off answers more far-fetched than simply throwing one’s hands up and saying, “It was indeed a miracle after all!” I dare not spoil those answers here. They’re worth experiencing firsthand! Hypothetically, if Santa were to fly off to the moon with a giant cannon to fire moon dust at the earth, suffocating its population in lunar ash because climate change made him run out of snow, that would be a sensible story by comparison! This episode\'s story managed to set new standards for what I look for in ironically-enjoyable bad anime! One that could be summed up in 2 words: “Holy Crap!”The degree of ineptitude and absurdity were so high at times that I seriously questioned if the show was actually presenting and scripting itself this way on purpose – intentionally being as stupid and hilarious as possible while taking itself seriously as some sort of twisted satire of the mystery/horror genres, or just for the fun of it. I simply couldn’t fathom the idea that the show was somehow blissfully unaware of it all. Alas, nothing further emerged to support this theory, and I was forced to accept that it appeared to be genuine. It was actually meant to be taken seriously while handling such plainly outlandish concepts so poorly. Despite this, I was still on board with it, both for comedic reasons and just to see what lunacy it would come up with next! But alas, even on this front, the final result disappoints.The show never quite recaptures the side-splitting insanity of its first arc, becoming more hit-or-miss in its entertainment value. Ironically, this seemingly resulted from efforts to make something somewhat closer to being within sniffing range of competent. The pace drastically slows to something more conventional, but less fun. The dialogue is, at the very least, closer to believable, but less hilarious, and still almost entirely composed of exposition dumps. There\'s still no meaningful characterization or character development in sight, which just leaves little reason to remain invested.The series does come up with a few interesting ideas, like the psychological effects of having all of one’s wishes immediately granted against one’s control, but instead of leveraging them to create a more fleshed-out cast, it just explores these ideas in the same exaggerated, barely-thought-out fashion all the way through. The result is that little of it is able to resonate properly. The show had a glimmer of a chance to pull off its own miracle and obtain genuinely decent qualities, but ultimately fell short.Meanwhile, the questionable direction, hilariously stupid concepts, and bad mystery habits all remain, but are more sporadic in their appeal. The show still overuses Dutch angles and dark close-up pans even in the most mundane of discussions; still spouts nonsense desperately trying to be intrigue; still addresses the nonsense by pulling crucial information out of a hat when it decides to “solve” the mystery; still acts as though these implausible solutions are clever. And as always, the show still takes the idea of a golden life-size Jesus statue making weird horn sounds, glowing, and erupting in sparkles and rainbows each morning, just a little too seriously! That one\'s real, by the way, and the ""explanation"" is as dumb as ever! But this only makes up a fraction of the remainder of the show, with the rest being disappointingly dull.I’ll say that despite frequently leaving loose ends and forgetting plot threads, the later episodes were overall a technical improvement over the early ones. But even with these small improvements, it’s definitely not worth watching Vatican Miracle Examiner for its own merits, since it never manages to grasp the fundamentals of proper intrigue, presentation, or anything else. Instead, its first arc is best watched for a good laugh. Perhaps the show as a whole could also be examined to see how not to write a good mystery horror. But frankly, it’s a bore at points coming off the first arc, and it’s up for debate whether it’s worth sitting through its lows just for highs that don’t come close to episode 4’s gambits. To be honest, I’m a little disappointed.Enjoyment: 6/10 (8.5/10 for the first arc)At the end of the day, unintentional comedic gold is still comedic gold.

There are a few other I won\'t bother naming, but this one does it quite well I think. It manages to present interesting plot arcs and stories that explore the idea of holy miracles but at the same it doesn\'t to shove it\'s religion in your face. What I mean is that anyone who isn\'t Christian can enjoy this show without ever feeling uncomfortable or offended.Story-8The show has a few distinct...arcs within it; in each arc the main characters travel to a different part of the world and do what Vatican Miracle examiners do. The story arcs are loosely tied together, but for the most part are separate. Not every story arc is created equal but none of them are ""boring"".One thing you will either love or hate about the show is how absolutely insane some of these story arcs are. You would be surprised how convoluted these things can get. Personally I love these over-the-top plots.Art-6Nothing too noteworthy or pleasing but it isn\'t bad by any standard.The settings are usually done pretty well and set a nice tone for what is going on.The main character designs are rather good, but the side characters are lacking. Too many of the side characters look the same or don\'t stand out.Sound-7OP and ED are quite good. The ED is sung by one of the main characters which I love and it\'s very cheerful and pleasant. It\'s especially good to hear the sweet ending right after a very dark and somber episode.The background music is not something worth talking about but it serves it\'s purpose. I never thought to myself ""this background music is bad"" so therefore it\'s fine by me.Characters-8The two main characters are really good and well fleshed out, but beyond that there is almost no other significant character besides the main villain.Hiraga- He is naiive, enthusiastic, intelligent, trusting, and kind.Hiraga is a real pleasure in this show as he is always in good spirits and he is so filled with faith and hope that it seems like almost nothing can ever get him down. He is incredibly attached to his co-worker Roberto and they share a very strong bond; the bond they share is really easy to appreciate and it is especially highlighted in the ED and the dialogue the MCs share after the ED.Roberto- Intelligent, calculating, strong. Roberto is Hiraga\'s rock. He is incredibly reliable and trustworthy. He is also endlessly knowledgeable about old books and runes, which is much more helpful than you would expect. Roberto had an incredibly difficult childhood and it is no wonder he works so differently than Hiraga.  The two main characters essentially complete each other so they can work in a perfect partnershipIt is lightly hinted at that Hiraga may be gay for Roberto but it is never mentioned directly or explored. Personally I\'m glad about that.Enjoyment-8Never was this anime boring. The characters are likable and the stories are interesting.

It’s wildly fun and falls somewhere between “so bad it’s good” and “better than it deserves to be.”Before I start picking Vatican apart, I want to say up front that, despite all the faults, it’s a lot of fun to watch. The eerie atmosphere and easy-to-like lead characters help make this anime more enjoyable, but what really makes it stand out (for better or worse) is the crazy plots and break-neck pace.Anime often flirts with Christianity, usually through very liberal use of well-known imagery or characters (like the devil), but hardly ever in a semi-realistic...light. So I was curious to see what Vatican would do with it.Thankfully, instead of just having exorcists stand in gothic cathedrals hunting down famous demons, Vatican incorporated other, creepier, and less well-known Christian mysteries including things like stigmata and incorruptible corpses. As someone who’s fascinated with that sort of mystery, it was a lot of fun seeing an anime deal with it.Likewise, our two priest characters were a refreshing change from the “hard boiled” priests about to give up on their faith or the “I’m just in it for the power” type priest characters Western media can’t seem to get enough of. Instead, Father Nicholas and Hiraga seem to actually believe in the religion they’re part of - which is nice. The anime actually strikes a good balance between letting their faith play a role in their motivations, but never getting preachy.Even outside of comparisons to their Western counterparts, Hiraga and Nicholas are both intelligent, decent people. At first, they start a little too plain (especially Nicholas), but later both continue to develop as the story progresses. They’re also heavily ship-teased, which is always a plus for me.Father Hiraga and Nicholas could’ve been even better characters if the anime ever gave them a chance to breathe. The anime moves at a breakneck pace most of the time, quickly jumping from one conversation to the other. Unfortunately, instead of actually seeing anyone solve any mysteries, we mostly get bombarded with characters summarizing their findings and given brief flashbacks showing them investigating while they’re talking. Information is often coming at you constantly, never really giving the viewer enough time to really immerse in any one scene.The solutions to the mysteries are either the best or worst part of the show pending your personal opinion. Why? Because they’re usually just barely within the realm of plausibility. This applies to the overall mysteries and the smaller ones. I have a healthy imagination, but at times, even I was left wondering “uh, what?”However, I don’t think this detracts from the story. I found the crazy theories and solutions and the almost unbelievably fast solutions our MCs came to a thrill to discover alongside them, because you never knew what would happen next.This aspect is where the “so bad it’s good” comes into play. Not everyone will enjoy it and might get frustrated by how out-there things can get, but, for me, it took the story from what would’ve been a generic mystery show to something that stands out. It’s up to the viewer to decide if it stands out in a good way or a bad one.The setting is cool and somewhat unique for anime, and the characters are solid enough to invest in. Sadly, the anime is weighed down heavily by it’s major pacing issues that keep it from being the fully immersive experience it should’ve been, but makes up for some of that with it’s crazy solutions that save it from being generic - for better or worse -  you decide. light.

Would you like to see what it would be like if mashed up with scooby-doo? Then this is just the show for you!Story (1/10)two priest hve to check wether reported miracles are actually true, yet all they find are drugs and evil secret societys. It\'s very ofer the top, each case ending in a conspiracy theory that makes the x-files seem like a research paper.And they play everything straight. Always serious. The characters just accept everything that\'s thrown at them. Not that they would have any time to process it; the show...is incredibly fast-paced, in the worst way possible. It\'s awful and absolutly hilarious.Art (1/10)Generic style, even though the LN it\'as based on has illustrations from Thores. Wierd textures, very little movement, bad eyeshadows instead of eyes and no regards for perspective are very common in this show. Also; a shitton of innapropriate dutch-angles and a constanly moving camera. It\'s hard to look at, but the incompetence is fun to witness.Sound (3/10)the OP is very early-2000ish, wich i liked, and they voice actors are pretty good. The background music is very dramatic and often used inaporpietly or too loud.Characters (2/10)The two MCs are a pretty generic Sherlock/Watson team, though their abilitys are way more balanced, so neither of them exsists to show how smart the other one is. They\'re also both always furthring the plot; you get the impression that they actualy need each other for their investigations.

The fast pacing is in so far good that it helps to move a long the boring stuff.OverallI would highly recommend this show. It\'s about as competend and entertaining as Tommy Wieso\'s ""The Room"". Watch it just too hear good, seasoned Voice actors say the most redicious lines full of honesty and passion. It\'s a beautiful mess, and i really hope we get a second season.Propably really good when watched drunk/high. is incredibly fast-paced, in the worst way possible. It\'s awful and absolutly hilarious.Art (1/10)Generic style, even though the LN it\'as based on has illustrations from Thores. Wierd textures, very little movement, bad eyeshadows instead of eyes and no regards for perspective are very common in this show. Also; a shitton of innapropriate dutch-angles and a constanly moving camera. It\'s hard to look at, but the incompetence is fun to witness.Sound (3/10)the OP is very early-2000ish, wich i liked, and they voice actors are pretty good. The background music is very dramatic and often used inaporpietly or too loud.Characters (2/10)The two MCs are a pretty generic Sherlock/Watson team, though their abilitys are way more balanced, so neither of them exsists to show how smart the other one is. They\'re also both always furthring the plot; you get the impression that they actualy need each other for their investigations. Both are man of science first and man of god second,one of them naive but cautious, the other sceptical and practical.That\'s about everything good i can say about them.Both have generic tragic Backstorys and someone in the production propably had  some kind of care taking fetish.... There is also a lot of queer baiting, so their dynamic ranges from wierd to boring.The main Villain is obvious, generic and doesn\'t make much sense. All other minor charcters are not really worth mentioning.Enjoyment (10/10)The mysteries turn to be increasingly stupid, and the explanations unpredictable.

Overall I thought the anime was good and it managed to maintain a decent balance when it came to the aforementioned religious elements and the story. The various mysteries throughout the course of the show were interesting and well written for the most part. The art was very good and when it needed to be, the same can be said for the animation. The way how the soundtrack was utilized was superb and many of the songs were perfect...for the situation they were used in. The characters were okay, nothing amazing.I enjoyed my time with Vatican Kiseki Chousakan. It's fairly unique and I thought the execution of everything was done well. However I don't know if i could recommend it to someone as I think the audience that would like it is a niche one. for the situation they were used in.

This makes this anime even more interesting because of it. By its nature the church will always be concerned with Miracles when they happen and here lies the story that...will be used as the overall plot.The overall plot of the show follows the duties of two such investigators of this secretive division who are Roberto Nicholas a man well versed in ancient knowledge and in Cryptanalysis and his partner Hiragi Josef Ko a genius scientist that also has a lot of faith in the church and in god.The overall theme that is used here is the investigation of miracles using both the traditional science based detective techniques and one’s faith in god. Settings wise each of the miracles that feature in the series take place in different parts of the world some of these areas being fictional while some are not which I feel only adds to the uniqueness of his case as these locations and culture often have a hand in effecting the background for the miracles themselves.  Common with most other animes produced in this period of time Vatican Kiseki features a number of sub story arcs which in this case are the individual cases that link into the overall plot of the series. These cases act as pieces of the puzzle for the larger overall plot something I felt matched pretty well with the premise of solving mysteries.Roberto NicholasRoberto Nicholas voiced by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe of Fate stay night fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the two investigators that serve as the main characters in this series. A member of the Vatican’s secretive but elite miracle investigation division the Seito no Za Roberto is a calm, logical and rational person that always tries to maintain a level head when out on the field which shows the experience that he has. Despite his rather serious nature Roberto doesn’t exhibit any of the traits that usually define such characters being able to joke when things get tense and maintain a positive attitude even when things get dire for him and his partner. Initially from first impressions Roberto can be seen and regarded as someone that is rather aloof and prefers to keep his own company however as the series goes on it is shown that he is a rather caring person that cares a great deal of not just of himself but his partner and any people that are caught in the cases that he and his partner investigate.In terms of pair dynamics Roberto serves as the overall leader of the pair that best makes use of his rational and logical mindset while also taking advantage of his vast knowledge that he gained from his love of books. As a result of Roberto’s personality traits within the story Roberto most often acts as the guiding hand of their investigations that when backed up by Hiraga’s scientific explanations proves to be a tough nut for the enemy to crack and is able to unravel even the most obscure and complex of lies. As a character, I liked the contrast that Roberto had with his partner Hiraga and the fact that he is able to remain calm even under the most exceptional of circumstances.Hiraga Josef KoHiraga played by veteran voice actor Nobuhiko Okamoto of Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as Roberto’s partner in the miracle investigation squad. A quiet, intelligent and focused person that also seems to be quiet shy at times Hiraga like Roberto is a priest of the Vatican and works within the same unit as Roberto. While Roberto prefers more traditional investigative and detective work when doing his investigations Hiraga differs in that he is more science based and prefers to verify miracles with tried and proven methods that’s provided by science. As a result of not just being a scientist but also a member of the Vatican Hiraga is noted to hold both his faith in science and his faith in god in equal regard something I find curious since priests are supposed to believe only in god. Personality wise Hiraga because of his personality can be rather trusting of others though he is intelligent enough to deduce when something is too good to be true. Despite his scientist background Hiraga has been noted to also find time to help others when he’s not hard at work which differs from traditional scientist type characters that usually stay in their labs day after day. The best example of this is in his relationship with his knowledge broker Lauren.Though Hiraga can be quiet at times he’s not someone that is scared of talking to others but rather he is someone that loves to get straight to the heart of the matter without having to muddle through something a trait that I think suits him. In terms of pair dynamics Hiraga unlike Roberto prefers to do investigative work with hard evidence and dislikes making hasty decisions without considering all of the facts. However, Hiraga’s deductions when he has made all the deductions can sometimes be surprisingly accurate.Arts and animationArts and animation for the series I felt was pretty good especially with regards to the miracles themselves. The varied scenery that we see for the individual cases I felt was also pretty nice. The character designs I felt were also done well but I felt that there could have been more variation in them.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty strong with the opening theme being especially so. The ending theme I felt had a calming almost soothing feeling to it that I felt was especially helpful after going through some of the more intense episodes.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was pretty strong with Junichi Suwabe and Nobuhiko Okamoto who voiced the characters of Roberto and Hiraga being especially strong.Overall conclusionIn overall, I thought that Vatican Kiseki was an interesting anime that was well thought out and did a great job of blending history, fiction and the church together a combination that can be rather tricky to do. The main strengths of the series I felt was its interesting premise, story and interesting cases that were tied in pretty well with the overall plot. The premise of the story I felt was particularly unique as though fictional it’s relatively rare to see the vaunted Vatican church get featured in something like an anime. The premise of creating a fictional elite investigation unit within the Vatican that has the express purpose of investigating miracles I felt was interesting and allowed the main characters to explore and investigate both a number of different areas and locales and also interact with the different types of cases that they will encounter. The Vatican Kiseki common to most modern anime series makes use of a number of sub story arcs that link together with the main plot line and in this I felt that it showcased one of its main strengths which was the uniqueness and variety of its cases. Each of these cases of which there were three in total last a few episodes at most and propel the two main characters in different locations throughout the world. These cases themselves I felt were well done as they made great use of the location and culture that its miracle was centered at and made great use of many supporting characters that resided there as well. These cases I noted also tackled many themes and subjects that many would consider unusual with regards to the church but not completely unrelated with the best examples being Satan worship, historic but fictional deals with Nazi’s and the often-gritty past behind some of its members. Of the overall story which soon becomes clear near the end the reveal of the identity of the actual main villain and the organisation that they work for I felt was well done with the identity of the villain being especially surprising. The blend of having a traditional detective story mixed in with the intrigues of both the church and foreign organisations I felt was an interesting combination that did an excellent job of creating an excellent storyline for the series.In overall Vatican Kiseki I felt was an interesting anime that had an interesting premise, interesting cases and story and a great example of friendship between the two main leads.  But I felt it was let down by its lack of effective character development and in my books, would put it at 8/10. Based on what we saw in the last episode the possibility that there will be a sequel I think is quite likely and though the series was far from perfect I think a sequel will be a good thing. will be used as the overall plot.The overall plot of the show follows the duties of two such investigators of this secretive division who are Roberto Nicholas a man well versed in ancient knowledge and in Cryptanalysis and his partner Hiragi Josef Ko a genius scientist that also has a lot of faith in the church and in god.The overall theme that is used here is the investigation of miracles using both the traditional science based detective techniques and one’s faith in god.

Vatican Kiseki Chousakan (Vatican Miracle Examiner) is an anime in which two priests explore “miracles” together, revealing incidents and conspiracies hidden behind them. When I found the anime, I was a little skeptical if it would turn out as well as it seems. Although the description seemed interesting to me, I couldn’t imagine what it would look like because anime aren’t usually about the church and the Vatican. This in turn made...the story more interesting. When I started watching it, I was really blown away. Since I otherwise love mystery, this anime is really well done. These “miracles” themselves are a mystery that the main characters need to unravel. They investigate them using traditional detective techniques based on science and one’s faith in God. The episodes were very interesting to me. Sometimes they used to be difficult for me to solve whether the ""miracles"" were real or not. Every “miracle” is happening in different parts of the world. This also affects the background of the ""miracles"" themselves, which were diverse and unique. I like that the cases are part of the puzzle of the whole plot in anime. Apart from the mystery, there is a lot of drama and supernatural. As far as faith is concerned, the anime also managed to portray it perfectly. It especially managed to portray the dark side of religion. The end of the anime might shock you. I did not expect such an end at all.I rated the anime with 10/10. I liked the story which was interesting and impressive. For the ""miracles"", they cited scientific reasons for solving them. I like the animation. It\'s a mystery, which I love to watch. Anime is really exciting and I think whoever watches it will want to know more after each episode. I watched it all at once, for that very reason. The only thing I don\'t like is that there are no more seasons, of which they could have done more. Especially because one part seems unfinished. Whoever watches will know about which character it is. If they make a second season I will be happy to watch it. I would recommend it even to those who are not Catholics, because if you like mystery, I think this anime will be as great for you as it was for me. Vatican Kiseki Chousakan (Vatican Miracle Examiner) is a combination of mystery, supernatural, drama, history, fiction and church. So far I have not watched a similar anime and that is why it is unique to me. That’s why it’s one of the best I’ve watched._____________________________________________________________________Hrvatski jezik: Ako volite misteriju, onda će vam se sigurno svidjeti ovo. Vatican Kiseki Chousakan (Vatican Miracle Examiner) je anime u kojem dva svećenika zajedno istražuju ""čuda"", od kojih otkrivaju incidente i urote skrivene iza njih. Kada sam pronašla anime, bila sam malo skeptična hoće li ispasti tako dobro kao što se čini. Iako mi je po opisu djelovao zanimljivo, nisam mogla zamisliti kako će to izgledati jer animei inače nisu o crkvi i Vatikanu. To je samim time učinilo priču zanimljivijom. Kada sam ga počela gledati, stvarno me oduševio. Pošto inače volim misteriju, ovaj anime je stvarno dobro odrađen. Sama ta ""čuda"" su misterija koju glavni likovi trebaju otkriti. Istražuju ih koristeći tradicionalne detektivske tehnike utemeljene na znanosti i nečijoj vjeri u Boga. Meni su epizode bile jako zanimljive. Baš su mi ponekad znale biti teške za riješiti jesu li ""čuda"" stvarna ili ne. Svako ""čudo"" se događa u različitim dijelovima svijeta. To utječe dosta i na pozadinu samih ""čuda"" koji su bili raznoliki i jedinstveni. Sviđa mi se što su slučajevi dio slagalice od cjelokupne radnje u animeu. Osim misterije ima dosta drame i nadnaravnog. Što se tiče vjere, i to je anime uspio odlično prikazati. Pogotovo je uspio prikazati mračnu stranu religije. Kraj animea bi vas mogao šokirati. Uopće se nisam nadala takvom kraju.Anime sam ocijenila sa 10/10. Svidjela mi se priča koja je bila zanimljiva i impresivna. Za ""čuda"" su navodili znanstvene razloge po kojima bi ih riješili. Sviđa mi se animacija. Misterija je, koju obožavam gledati. Anime je stvarno uzbudljiv i mislim da tko god bude gledao, da će nakon svake epizode htjeti znati više. Ja sam ga odjednom pogledala upravo zbog toga. Jedino mi se ne sviđa što nema više sezona, od kojih su i mogli napraviti više. Pogotovo jer se jedan dio čini nedovršenim. Tko bude gledao, znati će o kojem je liku riječ. Ako budu napravili drugu sezonu rado ću je pogledati. Preporučila bih ga čak i onima koji nisu katolici, jer ako volite misteriju, smatram da će vam ovaj anime biti odličan kao što je i meni bio.

Baš zbog toga mi je jedan od najboljih koje sam gledala.', ""This show falls into a very specific niche for me in anime  that I really like. So my enjoyment is way more than it might have any right to be based on other qualities. For starters this show so far falls more into a more horror, psychological, thriller genre than a fantasy or supernatural show. So it has a lot of the things you might expect when you think horror conspiracy and Christianity or Catholicism. The talks of religion or philosophy can seem a bit shallow and possibly grating, it feels unnecessary like it was added in because they figured they priests should do...typical preiist things. However its not the focus of the story so it doesn't feel overblown and more adds to the atmosphere than anything.I am not a christian so if it is highly inaccurate I wouldn't know but if you are and it is inaccurate I can see things kinda taking you out of the story but in this case I suppose ignorance is bliss. The first problem I found with the show is pacing. I have only seen 4 episodes so far but if you had made all that content 7 or even 12 episodes I would not be surprised. They put in a lot of interesting twists but they barely give you time to play with one twist before moving on to the next one which I think is a bit of a missed opportunity. With the tone this first arc took this could have helped really make a creepy tense atmosphere had it just taken things slower.This would have also helped with the characters, you see snippets of information that would make the characters and their relationships interesting and draw the audience in. These character and their friendship could have been explored more had they paced this better and not shoved in so much plot in four episodes. So instead you have kinda quirky characters that you don't really draw you in but seem fun enough to like watching.The amount they pack in also makes you wonder what they could possibly do next. They put in so many things in this first arc that they may have exhausted alot of ideas for future arcs, and they really didn't need to. Not only that but they introduce some twists in the first arc that might have felt like the escalated the story too much or just jumped the shark completely by the end of the first arc.But despite all this I am going to continue this show I am curious to see what they do next. Despite me complaining I did actually really like these episodes and I wasn't really sure where they were going for a bit so it was still entertaining but maybe just because it fills a specific niche for me that I don't get to enjoy very often. If you like shows involving the things I mentioned in the first paragraph and you crave them as much as me you willl probably find something to like about this show. If you aren't very interested in this kind of show then this might not appeal to you as much. typical preiist things. However its not the focus of the story so it doesn't feel overblown and more adds to the atmosphere than anything.I am not a christian so if it is highly inaccurate I wouldn't know but if you are and it is inaccurate I can see things kinda taking you out of the story but in this case I suppose ignorance is bliss. The first problem I found with the show is pacing. I have only seen 4 episodes so far but if you had made all that content 7 or even 12 episodes I would not be surprised. They put in a lot of interesting twists but they barely give you time to play with one twist before moving on to the next one which I think is a bit of a missed opportunity. With the tone this first arc took this could have helped really make a creepy tense atmosphere had it just taken things slower.This would have also helped with the characters, you see snippets of information that would make the characters and their relationships interesting and draw the audience in. These character and their friendship could have been explored more had they paced this better and not shoved in so much plot in four episodes. So instead you have kinda quirky characters that you don't really draw you in but seem fun enough to like watching.The amount they pack in also makes you wonder what they could possibly do next. They put in so many things in this first arc that they may have exhausted alot of ideas for future arcs, and they really didn't need to. Not only that but they introduce some twists in the first arc that might have felt like the escalated the story too much or just jumped the shark completely by the end of the first arc.But despite all this I am going to continue this show I am curious to see what they do next. Despite me complaining I did actually really like these episodes and I wasn't really sure where they were going for a bit so it was still entertaining but maybe just because it fills a specific niche for me that I don't get to enjoy very often. If you like shows involving the things I mentioned in the first paragraph and you crave them as much as me you willl probably find something to like about this show. If you aren't very interested in this kind of show then this might not appeal to you as much."", ""***This review may contain a little spoilerIf you are not the type of person who enjoys harem, romance, characters who only know how to burden others, nor the beautiful side of religion, this anime is a must try!This is a very rare type of anime with its interesting and impressive plot. It bluntly reviles the dark side of religion. This anime might make Christians feel uncomfortable watching it since it might make you doubt the existence of God.I love how this anime makes almost every miracle happens in the story solved by scientific reasons. Honestly, it makes me feel smarter after watching it.The...only flaw in this anime is it's ended too soon without reviling the real ending. It still can go a long way with its storyline. There are still many things need the answer but it just ended without answering them. I hope it will have a second season.

The most obvious choices would have been to either make it like a detective story or to go all out and into the supernatural. Vatican Miracle Examiner leans more towards the former, though the possibility of a supernatural (or in this case divine) explanation for the phenomena is always kept open for as long as possible. The religious belief of the main characters makes the whole thing a lot...more tolerable than the usual way of putting normal people into extreme situations and them suddenly believing that things exist that no normal person would believe in that easily. However, there are two severe problems this show has story wise. The first is the pacing, which is way too fast. Within only 12 episodes we get three different cases and two standalone episodes with rather complex revelations and executions. This makes it hard to follow more often than healthy and it also causes the second problem. The solutions feel like complete ass pulls. If you have a hard enough time to understand what’s going on, it’s not possible to grasp a bizarre twist ending. All it does is making it seem like a really bad mystery show, which it technically is not. In fact, if they had taken their time to explain the details of the cases better, it would have been a great mystery crime-drama, but what came out is a messy, too ambitious for its own good anime about homoerotic priests and insane supervillains. It’s still fun, it just could have been much more than that.7/10Art:This anime looks pretty good. The characters have a realistic look to them, though they have been prettified a lot, most likely to get the shounen ai crowd to check this one out. But it’s not like it’s pure Fujobait or anything, it’s still far away from stuff like Nanbaka. The colorization looks great, many of the backgrounds have a photorealistic feel to them. There seems to be some work done in researching locations, because at least the German village from the final episode looks way more real than usual. The animation is simplistic, but there isn’t much action to animate to begin with, so it doesn’t stand out. What really irritated me however were the camera angles and cuts. The camera seems to keep moving nonstop and rarely is a scene more than two seconds long before a cut is made. On top of that, many, many, MANY Dutch angles are used. That combination makes for a rather nauseous viewing experience and heavily disturbs the flow of the anime by distracting from its contents. Sadly, this outweighs most of the good things they did stylistically by a quite an amount.4/10Sound:The opening song is pretty cool, it has somewhat of a Gregorian feel to it, but it’s not really a choral song or filled with organs or anything else you might link to Christian religious music. It’s also quite intense and hectic, which fits the fast-paced cutting of both the opening and the show itself. The ending song is a nice, calm one, that is fittingly accompanied by imagery of what I assume is Rome. Very relaxing and smooth, I like it. It has a less poppy sound than many other anime endings, which is always welcomed by me. All the voice acting was solid and fitting, they even managed to nearly properly pronounce German, Italian and Hispanic names, which I’ve heard a lot worse in other anime. Soundtrack and sound effects were acceptable, though a little cheesy at times. That’s not really much of a problem though, since the show does not seem to take itself too seriously either quite often (at least that’s what I hope).8/10Characters:The two main characters were surprisingly likeable. I expected a pair of homoerotic zealots, but they were pretty down-to-earth and logically thinking. Roberto is a widely read intellectual who has the historic and mythological knowledge to lead the examiners on the right path to the solution, but he is not a cold-hearted thinker. I mean, he is a god-fearing priest after all. Despite his thirst to learn more and more, he is not easily tempted by worldly things. Joseph on the other hand is the more emotional of the two, but also the more sociable, so when it comes to getting information from people directly, he is the man. They make a great investigational duo and help this anime not to fall off the edge so quickly when the story aspects fail to keep your attention. There are very few other recurring characters, but the focus is mostly on Roberto and Joseph so they don’t get much of a characterization. The same goes for the story specific characters, again resulting from the outrageous pacing this show has. Julia (who is a guy, who the hell was in charge of naming?) is an interesting and mysterious person, who I’d have preferred to be explored in more detail, but again, we only get a glimpse of who exactly he is. At least in his case, this adds to the mystery, still I think he could have used a bit more screen time or being discussed about.7/10Enjoyment:The early stages of the individual storylines were pretty exciting, I like myself a well-structured crime story, but as I said, the further they went into it, the more confusing and inane it became. It was still enjoyable for its partially ludicrous reveals, but that’s not what I think it should have been. I am okay with the backgrounds behind the stories, but please, slow it down and follow a line of logic on your way to solve the case. There was a lot of potential wasted trying to accommodate all this into a one-cour series, it would have been better to either tell less stories or have a longer runtime (with the first solution being the more probable in terms of execution). As it is, Vatican Miracle Examiner is an okay anime with serious problems, yet still kinda enjoyable in its uniqueness.5/10Overall:6.2/10 more tolerable than the usual way of putting normal people into extreme situations and them suddenly believing that things exist that no normal person would believe in that easily.

So I went in with the assumption that maybe there'd be 4-5 cases with some over arching theme to build up the suspense and tension for a season two. I was so wrong. There were TWO cases, and episode 13 was some awful filler that had no relevance to the series or story line, plus only served to confuse the viewer. Plus, it felt like there were a lot of 'OH! How convenient, I'm already here to figure this out, or witness...it! Hurr durr so lucky!' in the season.I started out absolutely entranced with the series. The art was pretty good, the concept was kinda interesting, and I genuinely wanted to see where this story would go. However, after finishing the series, I felt like the second case wasn't really resolved, and episode 13 was just a confusing, hastily added place holder because the studio had no clue as to how they wanted to end the series.Plot holes were abundant in this series, as well as the lack of character growth. In fact, it felt very stagnant, despite all of these 'exciting' events happening around them. By the end, it felt like a chore to finish this series.

I\'ll be making my review spoiler-free. I\'ll also try to make it short and sweet, but I have a lot to say about this show.While this anime definitely wouldn\'t be considered ""good"" it is one of the most enjoyable things I\'ve watched in a long time. There\'s a lot of cheesiness in the beginning, but the plot line and sub plots are genuinely interesting and had plenty of unexpected twists, turns, and answers.the character dialogue is stiff and awkward, but does improve over time. Character personalities are also a bit strange and unrealistic... however I don\'t dislike the...characters. The two main characters really grow on you as you watch, and the poor dialogue writing and weird characterization somehow make them even more endearing.The first 4 episodes are probably the most intense, with maybe the strangest story line out of the whole series. The beginning is pretty abrupt, and fast paced. A lot of information is thrown at you within just these first 4 episodes, but even though the pacing is so fast it\'s still a very enjoyable watch.As the anime goes along the pacing does improve (a little), and it becomes more like a detective mystery show with hints of an overarching plot throughout.The last episode wraps up almost everything. It\'s still unclear what a certain character\'s motivations are, and his story line doesn\'t get finished which kind of sucks. Other than that, everything else gets closure. (Albeit, in a very abrupt manner. It felt like I was given a really good summary of events rather than watching the story at times.)Overall, my opinion is that this anime is a solid 7 with the potential to be a 10. If the character dialogue was improved, along with the pacing (and with that, giving more detail and fleshing out the story more) then this series would be improved dramatically.Now, just for some warnings for those who have sensitivities to certain content. This anime has mentions of, or plot involving, a lot of sensitive topics. In fact, there aren\'t many sensitive topics that aren\'t at least mentioned in this anime. Some things include: slight gore (just a good amount of blood), illusion to unsavory things happening between a priest and a young boy, demon worship/summoning, sacrifices, murder, domestic violence, and war atrocities.

Well, sign me up; that was my first thought. Now that I finished it, I wish I just hadn\'t signed up for this at all.The first problem to point out is the opening and ending, I don\'t why someone thought that mixing animation with real footage would be a good ideia because it turned out so bad that I\'m not even sure how to say anything about this, so let\'s move on to another problem: how the miracles are solved. They\'re supposed to use science to solve them and they kinda do...use it but at the same time they don\'t? At least it doesn\'t fell like it because in the end the main reason is always ""evil people are doing it for Satan"" or something along those lines.The characters are really boring and Hiraga is specially annoying and the most dumb of the duo despite being the one who actually uses the science, and yet both of them are smarter than cops and well, almost everyone else. I\'m not really sure of what the antagonist, if it\'s possible to considere him one, was supposed to do.Despite all of that, what really killed the story was the effort to try to create a bigger plot to link all of the elements of the last two arcs because it failed, terribly. Instead of just focusing on the main task that was uncovering those so called miracles, they ended up solving murders and all sort of things that didn\'t have anything to do with their purpose and the worse is that they tried to make it seem like all of the events were connected, and personally I hate when the interests get so dispersed like this and at this point the focus was completely lost.To say this one was a disappointment for me is an understatement, because the first arc is decent but after that everything went downhill and it just got worse and worse. use it but at the same time they don\'t?

Here are my thoughts:This anime is about two religious scholars who travel around investigating the validity of various miracles on behalf of the Vatican. This show has an intense Roman Catholic theme that is quite unique – I really appreciated this aspect of it. However, aside from its strong unwavering commitment to this rich Catholic theme, this show isn't well directed. The actual screenplay and script are kinda dull. Furthermore, as much as I love the premise, the writing is undeniably super amateurish and feels like a novel you'd find in the...bargain bin of somebody's neighbourhood yard sale. The plot is so absurd it feels like a kid wrote it. The explanations used to justify the various mysteries in the story are completely ridiculous. As a whole this show is incredibly campy, but that's what makes it fun to watch.Vatican Kiseki Chousakan is a very unique show. It's so over the top it's comical, yet plays it dead serious at all times. Like, I honestly can't tell whether or not this is all just pokerface satire. This anime has a unique satirical charm that I really enjoyed and think others would as well. On a related note, I definitely got a shounen-ai vibe from the two main characters, which is somewhat ironic to say the least, and also enhanced the parody feeling even more. Plus, they were super cute together.The two MCs are actually great characters: unique, likeable, memorable, and they complement each other well. Additionally, I liked both of their VAs and thought they suited the roles. Another thing that adds to the show's campy charm is how the many English words in the script are mispronounced by the seiyuus (to the point that referring to the subtitles is often still necessary).Visually, the show is adequate at best. Some of the character designs are decent, but other than that it is super basic and feels low budget. I think much of the poor visual budget was compensated for by using poor lighting in many scenes. Thankfully, not much character animation is needed to tell this dialogue-heavy story. I do like the seemingly authentic church-like OST. There is a lot of choral music, organs and that sort of thing, which suits the themes and mood of the anime. I'm glad they committed to the themes in this regard as well, instead of using a more-generic soundtrack.One thing worth mentioning is that the show constantly cycles through supporting characters. The two MCs travel frequently, resulting in the surrounding cast constantly changing (or disappearing because they were killed off). The show is constantly introducing new characters, only for them to disappear within an episode or two. The cost of this constant recurring exposition is significant and is a drain on the show. This is compounded by the fact that some random just-introduced character is usually key to whatever 'miracle' they are investigating at that time, which makes for a sometimes-confusing viewing experience. They randomly throw in characters who are fundamental to the plot and then they vanish and an entirely new supporting cast is introduced – this happens multiple times throughout the show and it is a lot to digest during a 12-episode runtime. I think a fixed set of supporting characters would have been much more suitable for this anime.My overall rating: 6/10As much as I adored the premise of this show and really wanted to see it succeed, I can't ignore its very real flaws. Foremost, the writing is unignorably amateurish. It feels like some hack novel that was just barely publishable, although it does have a lot of satirical charm; similar things could be said about this anime's direction and production quality. Regardless, this is still a very unique show and I'm glad I discovered it. A huge portion of my score here is a result of how unique this anime is, as well as the confidence and conviction with which it is presented. The intense Roman Catholic theme of this show is one of a kind and I valued it tremendously. The shortcomings of this anime are unfortunate – it had enormous potential. This appalling waste of potential is a mortal sin indeed.If Catholicism interests you then you might find this anime enjoyable despite all its flaws.

Characters like Sicaro, Childe, Vidis Emperor to name a few are used simply as a comic device to create small incisions between major scenes to break the tension of the story. The story itself ends on a lacklustre note with a poorly written antagonist who shows up every now and then and an even stronger antagonist who is hinted a few times in the show. Neither had any significant impact on the story until the end but even still felt like a convenient dispensible plot device and less like an actual villain.Art & Sound: 4/10The art in this series is more of the 2.5D style rather than genuine 3D CGI and it's not too bad quality. The fight scenes are obviously also in the 2.5D Cel animation style and carry some interesting visual effects. Beyond that however, there isn't much more appealing features to the art or animation.Sound design is as expected for a modern series. The sound effects and music all work together to enhance the mood; I.E upbeat techno music is played during the fight scenes between Chen Jun's team and other enemies. Voice acting is fairly good quality for many of the characters too.Overall & Enjoyment: 3/10I'm not a personal harem lover myself but if that is your type of thing this series will suit you; Chen Jun takes care of his harem more than himself and becomes entangled with each member with different scenarios. Of course there isn't any actual romance so it's a lot worse in terms of enjoyment for me. I would have enjoyed a better designed villain rather than better designed harem characters like this series has opted for instead.

Bonobono (TV 2016),https://myanimelist.net/anime/32353/Bonobono_TV_2016,"['Ratings:Story: 7Art: 9Sound: 9Characters: 8Bonobono is an anime short that is focused on the lives of a few animals. Each episode is about five and a half minutes long, and the cast of characters is fairly small. Bonobono originally aired in the 90s, and this is the 2016 take on the show. To be clear, I have not seen the original so this review is just based on the 2016 version.While some episodes do continue on into the next one or reference each other, the story is for the most part not exactly fluid. Each episode is extremely mellow, and shows us Bonobono (the blue...sea otter guy in the picture) living a peaceful life with his animal friends and father. There\'s a chipmunk, a racoon, and more. Even though Bonobono\'s life is peaceful, him and his friends seem to wonder about strange things and often find themselves looking for answers to the many questions of life.The sound for this show is something that I imagine is not for everyone. Bonobono\'s voice actor and the rest of the cast fit perfectly in my opinion, but I could see some people being turned off by Bonobono and his father\'s voices in particular. They almost seem kind of... slow... The background music is again, very mellow, but perfectly fitting in my opinion. The ED is great as well, it always gets stuck in my head.Each character in Bonobono is unique and clueless in their own way. They rely on each other to try and answer their many curiosities. The show is comical in this way, as sometimes the ""conclusions"" they come to based off of their friends\' information are quite ridiculous. It is definitely dry humor, and will probably make you shake your head a few times.I like the art for this show because it is simple and represents the show perfectly. Everything about this show is simple, but rightfully so.The episodes are a perfect time length, and I really enjoy this show every week. I don\'t foresee this changing, and if you have seen the show you would know why. You kind of know what to expect each week with this show. Not in terms of story, but what kind of show you are going to get. It has not changed in 22 episodes and is successfully heartwarming each time I watch it. Give this show a shot, as I am not sure why it has such a low rating on here. It\'s only 5.5 minutes and definitely worth it. sea otter guy in the picture) living a peaceful life with his animal friends and father. There\'s a chipmunk, a racoon, and more.

Quietly running throughout 2016 & still ongoing, though, was the return of an even older series, Mikio Igarashi's BonoBono.Consisting of fifty, five minute vignettes, the first season follows the relaxing, amusing & often meandering days of the titular blue otter. Laid back, absent minded & always holding a clamshell, it doesn't take much for Bono to...find pleasures in the simple things or have his mind fired, or distracted by, the most mundane or unusual occurrences. Imagine if Osaka from Azumanga Daioh got lost in the forest.Rarely able to answer his own questions, Bono's woodland wanders are often accompanied by the brash yet earnest Raccoon (not a Tanuki!) & the adorably cynical Chipmunk. Though often of little help, they make for entertaining company, the trio having echoes of Pooh, Piglet & Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. A strong recurring support cast further add to the series – my favourites being Bono's lackadaisical father & Chipmonk's sisters.Accompanying the entertaining characters is a commendable production from director Hidenori Yamaguchi & studio Eiken. The series maintains a consistently mellow pacing, resisting the possible temptation to heighten the emotion of scenes or overindulge in giffable character reactions. The only thing that might seem odd at first is the characters tendency to switch between using conventional mouth flaps & something that looks more like the trumpet mouths in Pingu. A bright yet soft colour palette more akin to children's illustration than typical TV anime further adds to the relaxed mood, as does the music. It's hard to resist the urge to hum or whistle along to Moonbright's theme song.It's not all smooth sailing, though. As fun as the main trio can be, their shtick can get old. Raccoon often fills the role of tsukkomi, which means lots of hitting & shouting at other characters. An otherwise fun character, it's unfortunate that arguably he's at his weakest when purposely trying to be funny. Chipmunk, while their cynicism & occasional sinister turns are adorable, also has “are you going to bully me?” for a catchphrase, repeated ad nauseum in some episodes. There is also a lot of toilet humour, which is fine but there is only so many times you can laugh at poo.Then again, Bono Bono isn't a series that's really meant to be binged, which is when the more repetitive elements of its humour become obvious. While not quite as episodic as it appears, with many vignettes being paired by theme or characters if not direct continuations, none the less it's arguably best enjoyed a few episodes at a time. Its laid back atmosphere & quietly comic musing on the big issues (to a small animal) make for a great visual palette cleanser to relax & clear the mind - or maybe even get you thinking yourself.Made for children but enjoyable by all, Bono Bono is the kind of laid back, family friendly TV that one sometimes wishes there was more of. Pleasantly relaxing & often amusing, if you're looking for an anthropomorphic alternative to the usual anime fare, you'll find it here. find pleasures in the simple things or have his mind fired, or distracted by, the most mundane or unusual occurrences.

A manga for salarymans. For those who don\'t know theses terms, Salarymans in Japan are hard workers who don\'t have a lot of time to spare. Adapted from a 4-Koma series, Bonobono isn\'t a complex thriller or anything that\'ll make you question humanity, but hey, atleast it\'s a relaxing ride.Our main character here is Bonobono, a blue otter who isn\'t a smart guy in any terms. Along with his friends, Araiguma the Raccon, known for being...lazy and a tsukkomi, and Shimarisu the Chipmunk, a chipmunk with an absurd amount of sisters, live their daily lives and the woods. Nothing outta this world.Episodes last for 5 minutes, they\'re mini SOL stories, and most of theses don\'t have a story line, but I think what makes theses worth it is the silly interactions with all the characters. They\'re not complex, but the main trio actually feels like a bunch of children just doing dumb stuff, which on a SOL series is actually a nice breath of fresh air from the usual ""anime girls doing cute stuff"".The series doesn\'t have a complex humor, as I\'m pretty sure the jokes are child-friendly. Talking about child-friendly, there\'s a lot of poop jokes over here, and all of theses fall flat, like a turd in a toilet. Humor provided by Araiguma\'s is either screaming or kicking, Bonobono is a airhead, and Shimarisu just says ""Are you gonna bully me"" a lot. I mean, A LOT. A few jokes are wholesome, others make you smile, and all the poop humor is... poop humor.OST is relaxing, as all of theses soundtracks give serious Math Rock vibes. The series doesn\'t have a OP, ED isn\'t really memorable, and the animation on ED feels like a children\'s story book.There isn\'t much to say about this series. Bonobono is a cult-hit in Japan, but western viewers aren\'t much familiar to this series. The series isn\'t made for average anime-fans, as this is something that Nick Jr. or Discovery Kids could easily air.  I\'d say give it a watch if you\'re stressed, or just want a relaxing SOL series with no anime girls, no ecchi, no romance, just Bonobono.Final rating: 6.5/10 lazy and a tsukkomi, and Shimarisu the Chipmunk, a chipmunk with an absurd amount of sisters, live their daily lives and the woods.

12-sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32601/12-sai__Chicchana_Mune_no_Tokimeki,"['Give me a chance, since this is my first review.When the Spring 2016 season came out, I saw this one and was vaguely interested. I was looking for a romance (that wasn\'t a harem). I watched the first episode, and I thought this show was adorable. Second episode, show\'s adorable. After that? Ih.Story - 6I\'d give this story a 6. I know, it\'s somewhat original since it focuses on what happens after a couple begins dating, and it\'s about sixth graders. I don\'t usually watch anime about little kids, and this proved my point. Although, this series is what got me into Kodocha, which I...recommend checking out. But, it\'s overly cutesy and it\'s typical. It makes me want to pull my brains out how much they\'re embarrassed about every little thing! And I\'ve dropped this show at 5 episodes, because we just reached a conflict with a love triangle. Great. Nothing about it is super original or out there. It\'s just fine. And what bothered me the most was the real turnoff point for me, which was how they focused on one couple more than the other. I liked the second boy and girl that were introduced more, but recently, they\'ve just been side characters.Art - 6Since this show is about sixth graders, it bothers me how their eyes are as big as my dinner plate. But, I don\'t mind it, since it\'s supposed to be like that, because they\'re little kids and all. I liked the design of the characters. They fit their personalities.Sound - 7The music was fine. It fit with the story and the opening isn\'t bad. Nothing special, but not bad.Character - 6This is where I can really rant. There are slight spoilers below. Like I said, I liked the second couple, so we\'ll start with them.Yui was a cute girl who I liked because she was more mature. I liked her design, because it showed her maturity. She\'s more simple, and I think she\'s a little more comfortable when talking to Hiyama, making me happy to see their relationship grow. She isn\'t annoying and there\'s nothing really bad about her (in my opinion).Hiyama is a sweet kid, who was tough at first, but warmed up to Yui. He is a nice boyfriend who does the things that Yui asks and is happy to be dating her. Also, I don\'t think there\'s anything wrong with this kid.Marin is Yui and Hanabi\'s best friend who gives them romantic advice that she learns from her sister. She\'s cute, and in my opinion, a little bit of comic relief with her confidence. But, she\'s also kind, and helps out her friends.Next up is Takao, Boyfriend #1. He stands up for Hanabi for too much and always has to make her feel better, making her frustrating. He gets embarrassed a lot, which annoyed me, and he didn\'t really become ""protective"" until this whole love triangle thing started. He\'s too forgiving, and hasn\'t really toughened up until now.Next up is Tsutsumi. (SPOILER) He\'s the second love interest of Hanabi. Why her? I have no idea. Once he appeared, I had a feeling he\'d make this whole relationship thing complicated. But, I refused to believe it. And I actually really liked him with his cross, bad-boy attitude. For about an episode. And then he fell in love with Hanabi, which made me shake my head. I knew it was going to happen. Hanabi refused to believe he showed any feelings for her, since she\'s in her happy glow of Takao. She innocently wanted to be friends. And he just made this whole mess sloppy. I don\'t mind him as a person, but his love preferences? I\'ll pass.Now we have my least favorite character of the show. Hanabi. This girl makes me want to punch a tree. 90% of the time Takao says something to her, she blushes and kind of internally freaks out. She is too cutesy, and her character design happens to be the one I don\'t really like. I don\'t like cutesy girls in anime a lot anyway, so this isn\'t entirely her fault. She dresses cutesy and acts cutesy. She\'s also embarrassed to ask Takao about a lot of things, and sometimes I think she\'s just an idiot. She relies on Takao a lot, and can\'t really stand up for herself when her classmate says she wants Takao, and that Hanabi isn\'t worthy of him. She isn\'t. Also, in one of the episodes (spoiler) when she goes on her double date with Takao, and Yui and Hiyama, Takao somehow manages to grab her a stuffed animal from those claw machines. Of course, she wanted the one that was only an inch tall. And then she LOST it in the mall. I don\'t know how, but they managed to find it. I was impressed. Her personality is just too happy and cutesy to the point I can\'t STAND her! She confused and oblivious (in an innocent way) that just really bothers me to the point where I was thinking, \'It\'s so obvious! Why are you an IDIOT?!\' multiple times. I\'m sick of these types of characters. They\'re really annoying.Enjoyment - 5I probably would\'ve stuck with this show \'til the end if it wasn\'t for Hanabi. But, it was getting a little annoying with the blushing and cliche, predictable moments. I liked this show at first, but I was getting seriously bored and annoyed with it. The cuteness and the fact that it\'s about little kids was kind of taking my interest out of the show.Overall - 6I personally don\'t like love triangles, especially because I usually end up feeling bad for the person who is ""losing"" to their rival over their love. It\'s pointless for them at that point. I know as a viewer how it\'s going to end up. It\'s also why I don\'t like harems. But, this show was just heading down a road I didn\'t want to go down. If you\'ve read all this and disagree with me and still want to watch the show, by all means, go for it. This anime is cutesy and about actual relationships (with 12-year-olds). That just isn\'t my style. I don\'t like cutesy characters (as main characters) and suck-ups. The story wasn\'t fantastic, nor the art. It wasn\'t a great anime in my opinion, and I don\'t think you\'ll miss out if you pass this one. recommend checking out. But, it\'s overly cutesy and it\'s typical.

She is too cutesy, and her character design happens to be the one I don\'t really like. I don\'t like cutesy girls in anime a lot anyway, so this isn\'t entirely her fault. She dresses cutesy and acts cutesy. She\'s also embarrassed to ask Takao about a lot of things, and sometimes I think she\'s just an idiot. She relies on Takao a lot, and can\'t really stand up for herself when her classmate says she wants Takao, and that Hanabi isn\'t worthy of him. She isn\'t. Also, in one of the episodes (spoiler) when she goes on her double date with Takao, and Yui and Hiyama, Takao somehow manages to grab her a stuffed animal from those claw machines. Of course, she wanted the one that was only an inch tall. And then she LOST it in the mall. I don\'t know how, but they managed to find it. I was impressed. Her personality is just too happy and cutesy to the point I can\'t STAND her! She confused and oblivious (in an innocent way) that just really bothers me to the point where I was thinking, \'It\'s so obvious! Why are you an IDIOT?!\' multiple times. I\'m sick of these types of characters. They\'re really annoying.Enjoyment - 5I probably would\'ve stuck with this show \'til the end if it wasn\'t for Hanabi. But, it was getting a little annoying with the blushing and cliche, predictable moments. I liked this show at first, but I was getting seriously bored and annoyed with it. The cuteness and the fact that it\'s about little kids was kind of taking my interest out of the show.Overall - 6I personally don\'t like love triangles, especially because I usually end up feeling bad for the person who is ""losing"" to their rival over their love. It\'s pointless for them at that point. I know as a viewer how it\'s going to end up. It\'s also why I don\'t like harems. But, this show was just heading down a road I didn\'t want to go down. If you\'ve read all this and disagree with me and still want to watch the show, by all means, go for it. This anime is cutesy and about actual relationships (with 12-year-olds). That just isn\'t my style. I don\'t like cutesy characters (as main characters) and suck-ups. The story wasn\'t fantastic, nor the art. It wasn\'t a great anime in my opinion, and I don\'t think you\'ll miss out if you pass this one.', 'If I had to choose a word to describe this anime, it would be ""cute"". This anime was so adorable and cute that it really touched my heart. I judge anime based on enjoyment and whether or not it executes it\'s stated genres to perfection. For example, This anime was romance and it gave us a lot of romantic scenes. I fell in love with all the romance scene. The characters where also adorable and I imagined myself as the heroine, Ayase.This anime explores topics like first love, growing up and friendships and relationships at a young age. I know a lot of people...are going to pass out on this anime because it is about children but I wouldn\'t recommend you doing that because it is a really good romance anime and focuses a lot on the two relationships in the anime. I can dare say that this ""children"" anime has a lot more romance in it then some of the other romance shoujo anime I\'ve seen. are going to pass out on this anime because it is about children but I wouldn\'t recommend you doing that because it is a really good romance anime and focuses a lot on the two relationships in the anime. I can dare say that this ""children"" anime has a lot more romance in it then some of the other romance shoujo anime I\'ve seen.', '12-sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki follows the life of a few young girls in their last year of elementary school as they explore what happens during and after puberty. This includes an overwhelming number of things such as learning about periods, bras, and more interestingly: romance and boys. If you are somebody who has probably passed the 7th grade, regardless of whether you have experience in the love department or not, you would realize two things while watching this anime:1) 6th graders, regardless of how small, naive, and uneducated they seem, also deal with their own issues, as puberty tends to start around their age....And sometimes, they handle situations better than most teens and adults would, given their straightforward attitude, but they might also handle different situations worse, since they /are/ still only sixth graders who do not understand their real sense in the world.2) 6th graders falling in love probably seems like a very naive thing, and I would applaud any couple who can spend 6-7 years dating during grade school, and dating more afterwards if not getting married, but there\'s something about a sixth grader\'s unique and naive love that absolutely screams ""CUTE!!!"" in our faces.12-sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki is an anime that everybody could enjoy, some more than others, as it\'s relatable in many ways for preteens and teenagers who are still growing and discovering themselves, and it also gives a sense of nostalgia for older people, letting them reminisce about their old 6th grade days when they thought they were the king of the world.The following section will just be me rating the anime. I tried to keep it relatively short since there\'s not much to say.STORY [7]: The story is simple and straightforward. It\'s a story about 6 graders coming of age; as they mature more and spend their last year in elementary, transitioning through puberty. It focuses on such themes that may appeal more to girls than guys, to a younger audience than older, though, the romance aspect of the show is more neutral than naught.The story and plot may be weak, but my favorite part about the show is probably its execution. I\'m not going to lie; 12-sai.: is very cheesy, almost to the point where its cliche. But it\'s with 6th graders, and it\'s cute and fluffy and gives you more than your typical high school romance anime would, so undoubtedly, this anime works in more than one way.ART [7]: The art is fine. It\'s your typical anime art style, except moe\'d down a bit to fit the atmosphere. The 6th graders actually look like they are 12 years old, and the character designs are realistic as they get. The characters can be seen clearly and there are some scenes in where the lighting is absolutely gorgeous. The background effects in this anime are very shoujo-like, as it does cater to young girls.SOUND[8]: The sound is pretty good. The OP and ED are fine, but the OST/BGM is something worth noting. The character\'s voices matches their characters and they do sound like actual preteens. Occasionally, you do hear a character (generally a back ground character)\'s voice cracking as if they were actually going through puberty.CHARACTER[8]: The characters in 12-sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki prove to be an interesting array of people, just like you would have in your normal, typical elementary classroom, ranging from that one really stupid and immature kid who pisses off the teacher, to that smart and mature child who sits quietly in one of the front rows. In my personal opinion, the characters are the best part of the show, and it\'s better to let people watch it themselves and explore the cast rather than sit and explain the characters and their interactions with each other.Though, as an example and for reference, we have our main character, Ayase Hanabi who is your typical, cutesy girl who wears lots of pink, dreams of dating an idol and sticks by her friend. If not clear, she is a very realistic 6th grade girl. Then we have one of the main boys, Hiyama Kazuma, who is a giant tsundere. Typically, in anime, you rarely ever have boy tsunderes, and whenever they do appear, they\'re done wrong. Hiyama Kazuma is one of the rare examples of a boy tsundere who is both interesting and dedicated to his role.ENJOYMENT[8]: The anime only has a few episodes out so far, but I\'ve been thoroughly enjoying it. There\'s really not much that this anime has to offer besides learning more about puberty through realistic situations, and also seeing romance through a 6th grader\'s mind. It\'s cute - it\'s vanilla, it\'s fluffy, it\'s everything you ever wanted in a romance anime (except minus the 6th grader part, probably).OVERALL [8]: 12-sai.:Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki is a story about 6th graders. It\'s cute, it\'s dumb, it\'ll make you jealous, and you wouldn\'t know how sugary sweet it is until you try it out.

I waited for it to be subbed almost a month more than for other anime which finished mostly by the end of June.First episode was basically the same as OVA. If you have watched the OVA before, you won\'t get surprised, only reminded what the plot was about.Let\'s get directly to the good stuff.The boys who are side characters are obnoxious to the point of being unbearable to watch.Hanabi falls on the floor, gets hit by a soft...mop or something, and everyone comes running towards her like she just survived a nuclear apocalypse. Girls are portrayed way too weak. She is also an annoying soccer mom, who has to shove down people\'s throats her ideas of righteousness. In fact, all the main girl characters are like that.Kokoa is incredibly cringey to watch, her actions throughout the anime, are forced, irrational and dumb. Yuuto is hilariously cringey, shown as perfect prince in the eyes of the writer, and comes off heavily forced as well.At last, here comes Ayumu, the only relatable character. He comes to school as a transfer student or whatever, I don\'t remember anymore nor do I care. Anyways, this guy is minding his own business when suddenly, everyone thinks he\'s into Hanabi for some stupid reason, while she keeps hanging around him all the time even though she\'s in a relationship . Soon enough, he magically falls in love with her through the power of forced writing.Nao Maita (the writer) did a terrible job portraying there characters. She has shown she has very little knowledge on human psyche as all of her characters are very one dimensional. Kids are not as dumb as you think, lady.Now, I will mention the important fact that the first three episodes are very good. It\'s always interesting to see how characters will end up together and you can\'t really make a mistake going with that direction. Honestly, the problems I mentioned above were completely irrelevant when the show was enjoyable, it had a good flow. However, once they got together the flow stopped, and the problems lingered.I couldn\'t force myself to finish it and, also, I have a policy I don\'t watch anime once they fall to 4/10, subjectively.I\'m sorry, I really tried to like it, but I couldn\'t. It gives a shoujo a bad name. Honestly, the good thing this show has made me realize is appreciating how good shoujo genre actually is, and this bad apple can\'t ruin the genre for me and makes a show such as Special A, a God send, and don\'t even get me started on Maid sama.Ultimately, I wouldn\'t recommend this show if you usually pay big attention to characters\' interactions and whether they make sense or feel forced, which is how this show feels like.I could only recommend this show to young teenage dreamy girls, warning them prior to watching the show to turn a blind eye on the characters.TL;DRThis anime \'finishes\' its plot way too quickly in the first few episodes, with remaining episodes only serving as melodramatic, generic plot twists, which are impossible to pass through without cringing. The events, as well as characters\' interactions are way too obviously forced, it makes me want to gauge my eyes out. Would only recommend viewing first 3 episodes. mop or something, and everyone comes running towards her like she just survived a nuclear apocalypse. Girls are portrayed way too weak.

Yui and Kazuma\'s relationship however gives us something more than that, that of a twice shy relationship but with a role reversal we usually see in a romantic genre, the role reversal in this relationship is that the male is the tsundere while Yui is the headstrong *ahem* ""give no shit what you think"" character of the relationship and because Yui and Kazuma goes through their own obstacles by tandem from Hanabi and Yuuto\'s but they however not only resolve their obstacle but they give us character development, growth and depth (most noticeably Yui as a character development angle and Kazuma in a relational development angle) and for that, Yui became LA\'s favourite character of this series.Onto the other characters, Coco is your typical ""rival-ojou love interest villain"" girl for Hanabi and she is HIGHLY predictable in failure due to Yuuto resolving everything, Coco...you just can\'t win...just give up and on speaking of giving up, the three idiots are WALKING ANNOYING COMEDIC RELIEF and their running gags of ""wanting to emulate Yuuto\'s manly quotes"" to just plain out causing some of the cliche obstacles thrown at the two core relationships, the three idiots really are double edged swords, they move the plot forward predictably but are also annoying useless comedic trio. Huh...LA didn\'t think that Maid-sama would have more relevance in this anime review but whatever. Marin at the very least have a purpose to be a thoughtful best friend to Aoi and Hanabi and when they are in doubt, they go to her for advice, IRONIC as most of her advice although thoughtful as being the friend of the both of the core female characters, her advice is unneeded for the most part. Finally rounding up the cast, LA will point out the ""other"" love rival to Yuuto and Hanabi\'s relationship by the name of Ayumu Tsutsumi voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara, well the biggest problem with him is that his screentime is soo low he just becomes a one-off ""love rival"" against Yuuto...he\'s by the by for a love rival, very forgettable in the long run.In terms of voice acting, there tends to be LOTS of squeak that can get really annoying (LA is looking at you Ai Kakuma and the three idiots), however once again Yui\'s voice actor Juri Kimura was LA\'s favourite voice actor, she actually tries to sound like a 12 year old and actually ACTS like on to without the squeak aside from Juri Kimura, LA actually liked Sayuri Hara who voices Cocoa as a ""playing against the type"" role for Sayuri as she usually voices genki-type characters...this role as Cocoa for Sayuri is a complete 180.In terms of animation by OLM, Inc who helms this anime from SynergySP from the OVA, they\'re character designs have similarities to the OVA\'s but more ""sparkly"" typical considering this is a typical shoujo anime, however with it\'s comedic moments, the animation goes full chibi with blank circle eyes animation and LA can see that it IS a comedic moment thus can be playful but in animation sense, LA can just see this as being ""kinda lazy"" and not take the comedic moments in a stronger sense. Overall, animation is janky between it\'s shoujo-romance and comedy moments.With all these faults and promising elements to 12-sai has, overall, LA can easily say that IT IS a cliche storm of romance tropes just heavily toned down due to the demographic they are trying to show this anime too and to be completely honest as cliche as it is, it\'s still hits the mark at pleasing it\'s demographic, it\'s cutezy puppy love with no high-tension drama, but still having the typical romance anime tropes we see, it even makes sense from it\'s animation quality standpoint as it\'s chibi and comedic for the most part shows us the tone of the anime throughout.12-sai is getting a 2nd season so if the 2nd season can do something MORE especially with Yuuto and Ayase\'s relationship instead of being the ever-stable relationship that never changes, then LA will honestly say that the 2nd season will be pointless. 2nd season hopes aside, 12-sai\'s first season at best is an ""ok"" romance shoujo anime in the cliched view of a 12 year old and that\'s not such a bad thing. love and follows some typical cliches of the romance genre.If LA could analyze the two relationships, Hanabi and Yuuto\'s one is the more generic one out of the two, with Yuuto pretty much solving EVERYTHING that comes into his and Hanabi\'s relationship with his smooth-talking to coincidental incidents, if anything LA is reminded of Usui from Kaichou Maid-sama as the main character who ""can do no wrong and EASILY fixes any obstacles in his and Hanabi\'s relationship"", Yuuto and Hanabi\'s relationship right from the start is TOO stable and leaves little room for growth as LA\'s biggest annoyance to this relationship is Yuuto solving everything by himself and for a relationship with no flaws and hardly moves up (sure their 12 years old, but still!!, we get invested into a relationship for them to grow, not do the same things over and over and over again), is a hard relationship to get invested in.

Relationships were established pretty early on and the plot was mostly about them, young 12 year olds, learning about it.Art: The art was decent. The only problem is the eyes are large, wide-set, and basic and the eyebrows are just lines so when the animation on the eyes isn't perfect it is very noticeable. But eyes are often wonky...in anime and this anime liked to do a lot of still frame, dramatic shots.Sound: Loved the voice acting. A++.

Aside of the romance it's also has their school life but also I think friendship is also a major part in this series. I would describe this anime as quite cheesy, cliche, cute, charming, immature and silly.As a romance fan, I enjoyed this show. The greatest thing was, although these  characters are much younger then most animes, they had more progress and development with there relationship than current shoujo anime out there. We have the couples get together from the first episodes, it's quite sudden...and spontaneous, but love is like that. It was nice not to have to wait 12-24 episodes for just a confession but just get straight to it. There love is very innocent and shy, and more often than not, they're blushing over everything!! it's adorable but maybe on the excessive side. They're shy to tell how they feel, but slowly start to open up more as it goes on and you'll probably get more openness than most anime.Ohhh so many cheesy lines and sparkly moments, but hey I guess it comes out that way when you say your true feelings. I'm just glad this side was even present in this anime, because usually characters are in denial of their feelings or hide them.So being 12 year olds, other then just romance, the anime also deals with getting there period, buying their first bra, etc.I love the art, it remind me of the old school art style but touched up for this day. It has this realistic look when it comes to the style and overall appearance for example their hairstyles. The main characters, especially Hanabi, wear different outfits each day and some quite cute ones actually. I like how they put detail into changing their clothes everyday, even down to different hair ties.The characters are quite cliche, and the supports are quite annoying. For example Kokoa, a girl interested in Yuuto always gets in the way and stirring trouble. But she reminds me of the team rocket in the sense she always has to turn up in every episode just to be shut down in the end, probably only to bring the couple closer together. Same with the boys in their class, always nosing into the couples business and getting in the way. But they're kids afterall.There;s also the character Marin, best friend of Yui and Hanabi. Although she's left out of the group with no boyfriend she's always playing her part by giving wise love advise and being enthusiastic support to her friends.Also I did like the chemistry between to the two couples, there love is just so charming and innocent.Of course this wouldn't be a romance without a love rival (who isn;t actually much of a rival) but it;s just totally necessary to keep up the cliche story so we have to chuck him in somewhere ;)I love the OP! it fits in the anime so well, it's upbeat and fun with good romance lyrics to fit in the story. The background sound was good, aswell the music, it;s quite happy tune that reminds me of christmas lolOverall, I would recommend this to girls who want their romance dose, specially if you go for the old school style over the romance anime's nowadays! but the older audience may have a hard time watching with it's immaturity of kids and cliche characters $ plot. and spontaneous, but love is like that.

I do find myself relating to the second couple more than the first because they are the shy ones and don't really know what to say to each other. That's how I was when I was with my first boyfriend. This show is super cute, and has some pretty good fluff episodes, as well as humorous ones thrown in the mix. I give this anime an 8/10, here's why.Story: 9/10This story follows two sets...of couples, all the characters being 12 years old, getting into their first relationships.

I'll give it this, the character designs really matched the attitude that they gave off, and I did like that quite a bit.Sound: 6/10The opening to this song was really good. I honestly didn't skip it at all. I typically skip an opening if I don't like to listen to it, so the fact that I didn't skip it is a good sign. The ending is decent, I did skip it for episodes 2-11 though.Character: 9/10The characters were really well portrayed and I loved (Almost) all of them! There were a couple characters that just got annoying, but the rest were awesome. There was one character who has a thing for one of the main character's boyfriends and she was just a big bully. I did not like that character at all, honestly I could say that I hated her. The character development was very small, but it was there. I am rating this so highly because of the way the characters interacted with one another. It was really cute.Enjoyment: 8/10I really did enjoy this anime, even though I'm not in the target audience. It has been a while since I've seen a good romance anime, and this one definitely had it's cute romance scenes. There were times I was watching that I had a big doofy grin on my face because of some of the things that were said, it was just really adorable.Overall: 8/10I really look forward to watching season two, I need to see more of the cutesy romance this anime supplies. of couples, all the characters being 12 years old, getting into their first relationships.

This review covers both seasons of the full length anime, not the original short OVAs.Positives:+ Sweet and innocent. Red flags may go flying up when you hear it\'s an anime about 6th graders in love, but there is zero fanservice or sexualization of the characters here. It feels like it was written for the actual demographic it portrays (middle school-aged girls), rather than for otaku voyeurism. Rest assured, there is nothing in this series that could possibly qualify as objectionable or creepy.+ Convincingly portrays the transition from childhood to...adulthood and all the anxieties and grey areas that come with it. All the blushing and nervousness in the romance comes across as more true to life when it\'s 6th graders doing it rather than high schoolers or even adults, like in most anime romcoms.+ The chibi comedy stuff can be pretty cute. It\'s not like it\'ll have you laughing out loud, but you\'ll probably at least smile at how adorable some of it is, like when Hanabi wags her twintails like a dog when she gets excited.+ The increased roles for Inaba and Tsutsumi significantly improve the 2nd season, and they are arguably more well-developed and interesting than some of the main cast. They both end up being pretty likable despite their initial portrayal as jerks trying to steal away the main girls from their boyfriends.+ Marin as the romance teacher is a fun ongoing bit, though it would have been nice if they had given her more to do than just repeating that one gag.+ Season 1 OP has a bitchin\' guitar riff.Negatives:- This show is a fatal dose of syrupy sweetness. It is so overpoweringly corny that I had a hard time making it through, even with my high tolerance for that kind of thing. Every possible situation is a setup for one of the boys to deliver an embarrassing line laden with shoujo tropes like ""if you ever cry, I\'ll be the first one by your side"". The dialogue is cliché, cringeworthy and doesn\'t feel like the kind of things anyone would ever say in real life.- The male leads lack personality or interior lives. Yuuto in particular has exactly one personality trait (""cool"") and is never developed beyond that. You never even get basic details like what he likes or dislikes, what his family is like, or what his dreams are. He is like a robot that exists solely to deliver embarrassing lines of dialogue.- Lacks balance. The show is primarily structured around its two main relationships, Hanabi and Yuuto, and Yui and Kazuma. Unfortunately, it tends to go into deep focus on one of these relationships for 2-3 episode arcs while totally ignoring the other during that time (Yui and Kazuma get the short end of the stick more often than not). It\'s not quite as bad in the 2nd season, but the relationships are forgettable enough that you will start to actually forget them when they get backburnered for long stretches.- Kazuma is thoroughly unlikable and lame. His immaturity is probably accurate and appropriate for his age, but he\'s such a miserable little shit that it\'s hard to understand why Yui likes him at all or why she\'s so devoted to him when he treats her the way he does. Their romance falls flat largely because it\'s obvious that Yui deserves better and you don\'t really want to see Kazuma win, especially when a better character starts trying to woo her in the 2nd season.- Cocoa\'s presence as a bitchy manipulator is grating and repetitive. Somehow she always manages to manipulate people and convince them that they\'re doing something wrong even though she gets caught lying and loses face in front of the entire class repeatedly. It\'s like everyone exists in a state of perfect naivete where their memory resets at the beginning of each episode and they all forget that she\'s a lying snake that can\'t be trusted about anything.- Basic and cheap animation and questionable character designs, especially when it comes to some of the side characters adulthood and all the anxieties and grey areas that come with it.

Captain Earth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21677/Captain_Earth,"['**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**You can have all the budget and production value that you want, but NOTHING makes up for incoherent and nonsensical story-telling. This well-understood fact has never been more evident in the anime industry then in this season\'s harrowing mecha series known as Captain Earth. Studio Bones sure as hell knows how to animate, but they are developing a reputation for writing convoluted and nonsensical plots that make no sense what so ever, and this anime is no exception. When 90% of your show consists of characters spewing exposition and you still fail to convey what the hell is going on, then your show...is a failure. Period. End of story. Captain Earth completely failed to set up a foundation for its plot, making everything that happened afterwards a lost cause.The show opens with our protagonist, Daichi Manatsu, discovering that he is the only one who can pilot a mecha called ""Earth Engine"". Why is he the only one who can pilot it? Don\'t know. Never explained. Anyway, he then proceeds to instantly hop into the mecha and begin fighting the evil ""Kiltgang"", who are seeking to destroy the Earth. Why do they want to destroy the Earth? Don\'t know. Never explained. How does Daichi instantly know how to pilot Earth Engine? Don\'t know. Never explained. So after ignoring those TOTALLY unimportant details, we see Daichi taken back to the headquarters where he is reunited with our two other major characters: Hana and Teppei. Daichi hasn\'t seen Teppei in a decade and he met Hana literally once, but apparently, they are already close friends! So close, that Daichi magically discovers his ability to summon a gun called the Deus ex Machi-... er, I mean the Livlaster, and proceeds to destroy an entire section of the building in order to bust his two ""friends"" out. Why? So they can throw a boomerang on the beach together and then return to the organization willingly! Because that makes sense! So you may be asking yourself: What is the Livlaster? Well, I don\'t know. Never Explained. Why can Daichi do this but nobody else can? I don\'t know. Never explained.I could go on, but I think you get the point. Captain Earth\'s storyline is all over the place, unfathomably shallow, paced sporadically, and most of all: incompetent. The writers for this show are just completely, 100% incompetent, and that is by far the biggest problem with the show. The fact that they managed to turn such a simple premise into a complete and total MESS laced with plotholes and ambiguity is so laughable that it is almost an accomplishment. You would need more than just your fingers and toes to count how many plot points are introduced that never connect to anything. The characters ramble and ramble on and on about ""Orgone energy"" and ""Libido"" and other such meaningless bullshit, but they tried so hard to give depth to the scientific aspect of the plot that they forgot to make an actual plot in the first place! And, y\'know, that\'s kind of important!The characters, unfortunately, provide no saving grace from the plot\'s onslaught of stupidity. They have nothing that even resembles development and have no depth what so ever. Daichi is an oblivious moron and the other characters either have annoying personalities or none at all. Worst of all, they have no chemistry with each other! We are very clearly supposed to get the impression that the characters are close friends, but NEVER, not even once, do we see them engaging in any form of comradery what so ever. The romance between Daichi and Hana, for example, is one of the worst I\'ve ever seen for a variety of reasons. One: It\'s CREEPY. This is NOT how people in love with each other behave. It\'s literally Twilight levels of bad. Two: Hana has no personality what so ever. The only development she is given is nonsensical, comes completely out of nowhere for no apparent reason, and then fades just as suddenly as it began. Three: Daichi and Hana have no chemistry with each other and there is no gradual build-up. The extent of their meaningful interactions can be summed up with that creepy scene in episode 12, cause, y\'know, that\'s totally normal.Another thing that makes me a lot more angry then it probably should is the downright idiotic slogan that the show flashes in our face whenever it possibly can; I\'m talking during the OP, when it goes to commercial, when it comes back from commercial, and during the ED. They REALLY want you to remember the following slogan for some reason:""When I opened the door called Truth, my childhood ended. It was a summer I could never forget.""Based on this quotation, it is strongly implied that Captain Earth is some sort of coming-of-age parable. That is annoying because this anime is NOTHING of the sort. There is not a single solitary element in any of the episodes that would even slightly suggest that this is a story about becoming an adult. In fact, Daichi is arguably the most kiddish and immature character in the show even in the face of this world-scale threat he is supposed to be facing! I mean my god! Could this show\'s plot get any more stupid?Captain Earth isn\'t totally unredeemable though; the animation, for example is absolutely stellar. The first episode blinded me with stunning, movie-quality art. Unfortunately, even went downhill. The animation seemed to get slightly worse as the show went on, but it was still great. The sound is also well-executed; I love first OP and ED, but the 2nd ones were shockingly bad in comparison. The OST isn\'t half bad though. Despite these things, as I\'ve mentioned earlier, production value does not make up for awful writing and it never will. With that fact in mind, Captain Earth is an undisputed and unbridled disaster that I do not recommend watching at all to anyone. is a failure. Period. End of story. Captain Earth completely failed to set up a foundation for its plot, making everything that happened afterwards a lost cause.The show opens with our protagonist, Daichi Manatsu, discovering that he is the only one who can pilot a mecha called ""Earth Engine"". Why is he the only one who can pilot it? Don\'t know. Never explained. Anyway, he then proceeds to instantly hop into the mecha and begin fighting the evil ""Kiltgang"", who are seeking to destroy the Earth. Why do they want to destroy the Earth? Don\'t know. Never explained. How does Daichi instantly know how to pilot Earth Engine? Don\'t know. Never explained. So after ignoring those TOTALLY unimportant details, we see Daichi taken back to the headquarters where he is reunited with our two other major characters: Hana and Teppei. Daichi hasn\'t seen Teppei in a decade and he met Hana literally once, but apparently, they are already close friends! So close, that Daichi magically discovers his ability to summon a gun called the Deus ex Machi-... er, I mean the Livlaster, and proceeds to destroy an entire section of the building in order to bust his two ""friends"" out. Why? So they can throw a boomerang on the beach together and then return to the organization willingly! Because that makes sense! So you may be asking yourself: What is the Livlaster? Well, I don\'t know. Never Explained. Why can Daichi do this but nobody else can? I don\'t know. Never explained.I could go on, but I think you get the point.

It was an anime I could forget.""From Studio Bones and the same creative team that made Star Driver, comes a mecha anime that promises amazing action backed up by Shakespearean lore but instead, delivers a train wreck that is only worthy for the scrap yard.The story starts off well enough, having a 17 year old high schooler named Daichi, through a set of extraordinary circumstances, coming to be the sole pilot of the Earth Engine, which was built to defend humanity from the invading Planetary Gears. However, it...quickly becomes very apparent that Captain Earth has no intention of delivering a coherent plot and soon meanders off into slice of life territory with visits to the dessert cafe, idol concerts and chilling off by the poolside topped off with copious amounts of fanservice. There is even an episode where an idol gets to be a commander for a day onboard a space station, right before a major military operation is about to go underway. When it does get back to moving the story forward, it does so in the most convoluted manner possible and is nothing short of glacial in terms of progress. Among the worst offenders of this crime is the Planetary Gear\'s recruitment arc in which the bad guys are awakened and gathered for several episodes like some demented version of Pokémon.Events happen or things are done in a certain way that has no bearing to proper protocol in a similar situation in reality. For example, when it comes to identifying and apprehending potential Earth-ending individuals, Captain Earth has teenagers taking the place of what should have been the jurisdiction of entire government agencies or armed special forces. I could understand having a bunch of high schoolers be the pilots of giant robots and saviors of humanity but not when it comes to scouring an entire urban center with only four people that get sidetracked by dessert cafe. Plot points are even worst, often appearing from a random direction and resolved in an equally hazard manner. In one instance, there was a scientist lady who was in charge of observing special children connected to the planetary gears. Said scientist kisses one of them and transfers her desire to obtain immorality using the child which results in a falling out between the two. Very quickly, the assistant to said scientist shoots her in the head with a pistol and the last time we see of her, she is riding in a back of a truck, wrapped up in a body bag. I swear to God, I\'m not making this shit up. Explanations frequently comes down because the writers say so and that is nothing short of an insult to the audience struggle to understand the bigger picture because of inept writing.When it comes to the four main characters of Daichi, Hana, Akari, and Teppei, their attributes make them seem anti-Evangelion to a fault. Daichi Manats is the overly confident and energetic teenage boy to distant Shinji Ikari, who only pilots only for the sake of his father. Hana Mutou is the curious and very voluptuous alien girl to the emotionless doll of Rei Ayanami. Akari Yomatsuri is the hacking/self-proclaimed magical girl to the emotionally broken tsundere of Asuka Langley Soryu. Finally, Teppei Arashi is the uncertain and withdrawn extraterrestrial to the transcendent angelic being of Kaworu Nagisa. The trouble doesn\'t lie in how the characters start off as but it\'s that they remain stagnant for the majority of their development. Yes, they have their own trials and personal issues to overcome but it\'s so ham-fisted and forcefully written that it almost becomes a parody unto itself. The obvious pairings happen but everything about their relationships are so bland and uninspired that it just bored me seeing Captain Earth clumsily go through the motions. There is simply nowhere else to go when all the characters become happy-go-lucky teammates that believe in the power of friendship and love to win the day. Unless Captain Earth had the balls to go a darker route from there, which it doesn\'t, it makes for a boring watch as our young heroes simply brute force their way onto victory, complete with sparkles and rainbows.Outside other main four leads, which get plenty of screen time to dally about, there are just too many characters and factions in Captain Earth. Ranging from those who work at GLOBE, Tenkaido Space Station, Intercept and Ark faction, Salty Dog, Kill-T-Gang, Puck, and the Macbeth Enterprises, none of them are explored in any meaningful depth. Sure, members of the Planetary Gears get their own episode to shine but as quickly as they are introduced, they are soon forgotten in favor of the next shiny plot point.One aspect that initially drew my attention to Captain Earth was the high production values in its animation. Having a wide assortment of bright vivid colors and highly detailed backgrounds, it is clear that a substantial amount of money was invested in the visual department. While other series like Knights of Sidonia and Aldnoah.Zero have embraced CGI robots into their animation, Captain Earth steadfastly sticks to the dying art of drawing 2D mecha. The 3D elements are subtly incorporated into the background of display screens and popup HUDs which demonstrates how CGI should be used to enhance the viewing experience. In particular, the Earth Engine\'s transformation scene was quite a novelty when it was first shown by featuring no less than three space station lined up together while the Daichi\'s machine speeds through the center as it becomes fully formed.Also matching the high standards set by the visual department, is the music composition by Satoru Kosaki. His previous works is nothing to sneeze which include the entire Monogatari franchise, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and OreImo. In Captain Earth\'s case, he choose to go with a more traditional orchestral sound with booming trumpets and soaring string instruments doing much of the heavy lifting. It really is a shame that the stellar soundtrack is just another sad reminder how great this show could have been if it even had a half-competent writing team backing it up.The mechs themselves are quite creative in their design and functionality. Earth\'s own engines look like a updated white version of the Gainax\'s Gunbuster with its massive shoulder pylons and fairly conventional weaponry. On the opposing side, Planetary Gears in their true mecha forms have more of an aesthetic that resembles doll figurines with umbrella dresses for the ladies and tailcoats for the men. As such, their respective fighting styles are more akin to dancing around their opponents before slicing or blasting them to pieces.Being a huge fan of the mecha genre, much of Captain Earth\'s tremendous shortcomings could be forgiven if the giant robots fights were exciting, loud and filled with awesomeness, but sadly, this is not the case. Mech battles in Captain Earth often dissolve in shounon-like brawls that involve little to no tactics and obscene amount of deus ex machina bullshit in favor of the protagonists. The plot armor that every major character, both alien and human, is as thick as the front of a main battle tank and saps much of the tension from said battles. Indeed, the show even incorporates immorality into the invading Planetary Gears with their Ego Blocks, and has them blasting off like Team Rocket every time they get their asses kicked.With names like Midsummer Knights, Puck, and Oberon, I would have expected a mixture of Shakespearean elements from his various plays like humor from A Comedy of Errors with a dash of the tragedy from Macbeth and the mystical atmosphere of The Tempest. Instead, Captain Earth simply reaches for the lowest common denominator of dumping a metric ton of fanservicey ingredients into its concepts and calls it a day. I suppose it could have be related to the sexuality that is prominent in Shakespeare\'s work in some sort twisted way, but I can\'t really be bothered to dig that deep when cleavage takes up half the screen and everyone is trying to kiss each other.The first opening, titled ""Runner\'s High"" by flumpool, is a lot like my anticipation and first impression of Captain Earth. It was epic, energetic and pointed to something far more ambitious than your typical anime show. By the time, the second opening "" TOKYO Dreamer "", by Nico Touches the Walls, rolls around, I had long stop caring about Captain Earth and abandoned any hope of the show redeeming itself. The show had wasted too much time on pointless exposition, fetch quests and scandalous shots of female anatomy. Studio Bones held a promising concept in its hands before weighing down with mediocrity and Otaku philandering that plagues the anime industry today. quickly becomes very apparent that Captain Earth has no intention of delivering a coherent plot and soon meanders off into slice of life territory with visits to the dessert cafe, idol concerts and chilling off by the poolside topped off with copious amounts of fanservice.

Studio Bones held a promising concept in its hands before weighing down with mediocrity and Otaku philandering that plagues the anime industry today.', 'When you have an interesting setting and characters, great designs and good action, the obvious option would be using them to their fullest potential and crafting a great story involving these factors. But you could also do it like Studio Bones did with Captain Earth and do absolutely NOTHING with them. Seriously, I\'ve rarely seen a series devolve from one with lots of potential into something that was a chore to watch episode by episode.The story centers around Daichi Manatsu, a high school student who, through some coincidences and connections, ends up in a secret organization fighting extraterrestrial beings with mecha robots. Now, the whole...""high school student fights unknown creature"" setup might be one of the overused cliches in anime ever, but there are still series that manage to put it off well. That\'s what I also hoped for Captain Earth, but it was all in vain.From the beginning on, the viewer is bombarded with one unknown term after another, expecting us to understand what the hell they are supposed to mean. All this while the plot starts off with a tiring episodic monster-of-the-week scheme. Those types of episodes are not always bad, but it is pointless if the plot still has not made any crucial progress, making it a chore to watch the same thing over and over.About midway through, the series is finally back to the actual plot - not that it got much better though. To sum it up, you could fast-forward to the last few episodes (bar a few selected ones) and you would not have missed out on anything. And instead of good storytelling we get pointless fanservice here and there. And some more unexplained terms, because we obviously have not had enough already! And if plot points are resolved, then it\'s in a cliche and predictable way. Or there is no resolution at all - I mean, what happened to Teppei\'s father? The creators probably forgot about his existence, who knows. What about the little girl who was supposed to be something like a manifestation of Daichi\'s Livlaster? We never found out what was up with her.Well to make it short, while the setup was already lame, what the producers made of it made it even duller. And this also brings down the characterization.This brings me to the characters of Captain Earth. The four main characters are like the only ones who get some character development, so I\'ll just get to them. First we have Daichi, our protagonist - a character I found pretty intriguing in the beginning. With a connection to some other characters related in the battle against the aliens and a somewhat rebellious attitude he could have been a good character. Could have, if the story were any good. Instead, he turns into the stereotypical good guy character who can face any hurdle through the power of friendship.The second male main character Teppei, suffers a similar fate of character change - from a character related to the Kill-T-Gangs his role in the story turns quite irrelevant. He ends up as just another mecha driver without much development.Akari, the self-proclaimed ""mahou shoujo"", is a super-hacker who supports the team in the background by, well, hacking. There isn\'t really much else to her, aside that she is a poor love interest for Teppei. Seriously, would it have been so hard to develop the romance between those two a little?Hana is the last of the main group, and also the love interest of Daichi. Well, their romance was a little more interesting than Teppei and Akari\'s, but Hana as character herself was - nothing special. Just like with Teppei, her supernatural powers are not explored well enough - she is more often used as a fanservice character.Last I want to mention the enemies in this scenario, the Kill-T-Gangs - just as the main heroes, very underexplored. Most of them have a one-episode appeareance and then disappear or are used as more fanservice devices. The main pair - Moco and Amara - only differentiate from the group in that they get more screentime, act more evil and get more fanservice scenes (Moco, at least).One thing that had Captain Earth going for it is the visuals - nothing special, really, but compared to the other aspects of the series a pleasure. The character designs are nice, the mechs look good and the action is on point.The sounds of the series are nothing special, the openings and endings are alright and the soundtrack was alright too. Hana\'s song is probably the most outstanding aspect in the sounds section.Sadly, the strongest points of the series (Art & Sound) do not carry a show alone.Thus, Captain Earth overall does not really convince me and thus I give it a score of 3/10.

First of all, I had just finished Captain Earth a minute ago when I started writing this review. Plus to that, I pulled an all-nighter to finished 25 episodes in one go and I must say, I was about 33/67 satisfied. And well, I am going to give my best in order for this review to be spoiler-free.The feeling of watching Captain Earth is like watching a show that at one scene will make your heart flutter and the next two scenes, will completely crush the enthusiasm.It\'s quite fair to give a 6 for the story. Why? First of all, Captain Earth didn\'t promise...the watchers a plot that will attract the majority. It\'s like BONES tried to please at least 2 people out of a 10.The idea of the story was simple however, the execution was lost after the first 5 episodes. The direction started to get messy and it even felt like the director doesn\'t even want to direct in the first place. In one case, why waste at least 2 minutes on the same docking sequence? I mean, yeah, it\'s cool but should he at least make a good use of that 2 minutes?Art and sound, is feasible. The art was within the 2014 standard. BONES never fail to give a title the appropriate art however, in this case, it\'s obvious that the art was really a minor factor. The sound is nowhere great but at the very least, I like both of the opening themes.If Captain Earth had one point they should rue, it is their characters. For a battle-robot series running at 25 episodes, it is understandable that the scale should be vast. However, Captain Earth limited theirs by focusing on little number of characters and mainly giving the limelight to the main protagonists and antagonists.Their was never a good background involving the characters. It spells like they were never given a chance to appeal or make the audience empathize with them. They were hero just because they were meant to be heroes. They were villains, that\'s because they were meant to be villains. The feeling of this kind of simple character development is something unforgivable given the budget for 25 episodes. Some characters had to the potential to spark a good run though, the expectations or should I say, my expectations were never been granted given a soft and weak building of characters.BONES particularly relied on short flashbacks in order to explain the fundamentals surrounding the characters. While it is never enough, they at least gave out a vague idea to intrigue the watcher to watch the next episode in order to enlighten the piling query. In any case, for the character factor, there was something like a roulette in which BONES struggled to decide who\'s going to be the final boss and when the end was nigh, they just decided, ""Oh, okay. This one will be the final boss..."" and then it\'s all over leaving myself wondering ""That\'s it?"". That is the case for myself and in the end, I am not really happy yet it was understandable and slightly palatable in my opinion.The enjoyment was certainly small. I sure had moments when I felt Captain Earth was good. The romance addition was something not up to my flavor however, it is still something cute at the border of innocently cute.Finalizing, for a normal space-robot genre, Captain Earth magnificently fulfill it\'s position. However, as one of the blandest title. The potential was scrambled and was forever lost due to the fact that Captain Earth never knew the direction it should take. This should explain as to why there\'s never a solid consistency on who\'s really going to be the main adversary. Another unfitting factor was also the addition of supernatural and magical events. It felt too much misplaced for a title such as Captain Earth. The pacing was also horrible however I felt like the story has never been cut at every episode. While the plot-threading seemed terrible, it still ended with a pretty decent closure however, even with the decent tag, Captain Earth left a wholesome of hanging queries unanswered and that what makes it justified mediocre. Should they at least have another episode to explain some questions, I think Captain Earth would\'ve placed itself a meter higher than the bottom they\'re in right now.For my last comment, Captain Earth certainly started like a title capable of reaching a 9/10 grade. But instead, it slipped and never managed to catch up the lost potential. the watchers a plot that will attract the majority. It\'s like BONES tried to please at least 2 people out of a 10.The idea of the story was simple however, the execution was lost after the first 5 episodes. The direction started to get messy and it even felt like the director doesn\'t even want to direct in the first place. In one case, why waste at least 2 minutes on the same docking sequence? I mean, yeah, it\'s cool but should he at least make a good use of that 2 minutes?Art and sound, is feasible. The art was within the 2014 standard. BONES never fail to give a title the appropriate art however, in this case, it\'s obvious that the art was really a minor factor. The sound is nowhere great but at the very least, I like both of the opening themes.If Captain Earth had one point they should rue, it is their characters. For a battle-robot series running at 25 episodes, it is understandable that the scale should be vast. However, Captain Earth limited theirs by focusing on little number of characters and mainly giving the limelight to the main protagonists and antagonists.Their was never a good background involving the characters. It spells like they were never given a chance to appeal or make the audience empathize with them. They were hero just because they were meant to be heroes. They were villains, that\'s because they were meant to be villains. The feeling of this kind of simple character development is something unforgivable given the budget for 25 episodes.

Captain Earth is so boring that not even giant robot battles with aliens who feed on human lust can make it interesting. I last wrote a review when only 22 episodes were out, and I predicted the show would do nothing to change its boring nature. And I was right. In all fairness this is like predicting the sun will rise in the East. You could have done the same if you\'d watched only 5 episodes. And...here\'s why:There is no rising action. The stakes are never upped. Normally to get people excited in a story like this you have to continually raise the stakes, make the conflict bigger, more dramatic, more important, or more personal to the characters. But it never happens. The action is a flat line. The exact same thing over and over again. There are momentary blips where it looks like the stakes are about to be upped, it\'s about to become ~personal~ for Daichi and company. And then it immediately resolves itself and all the tension goes out of the show again. Or sometimes it\'s never even addressed and it\'s like nobody even cares. Like there\'s this big revelation later that should have been a big deal for Daichi and he just kinda shrugs it off like ""whatever."" It\'s like even the characters can\'t be bothered to become emotionally invested in this dreck.Let me give you a concrete example:In episode 1 we get all this exposition dumped on us about how there\'s aliens trying to devour all human libido (just roll with it) and this will destroy humanity for reasons. And right away we\'re treated to this high stakes giant robot battle for human survival as these aliens attack the Earth.Sounds like an exciting first episode, huh? And then they do it again about 10 more times.Nobody dies or is seriously hurt in any of the fights, there\'s no real consequences. Our heroes eventually become so bored by the whole affair that they have to resort to anime teen romance to distract themselves and the audience, complete with beach and hot springs episodes. And remember, there\'s never any real change in the danger from episode 1. The stakes are never raised, but they never go down either. It\'s just that everybody becomes bored because of the monotony of it all, the only sense of danger in the show becomes a state of normalcy, so as a result everything becomes dull. When even the characters fighting for the survival of the human race start complaining about how boring their job is and prefer lounging by the pool, how are we as an audience supposed to feel any tension from the threat of extinction?And the threat of extinction is the only card they have. Every time they bring up new shit it gets immediately discarded. The secret of Daichi\'s father? Pass, apparently not enough to get Daichi emotionally invested. What about all the Planetary Gears and the lives they lived as humans before awakening? They literally stopped caring after they woke up and they are never really visited again, they just become a bad guy of the weak and occasionally have a pointless battle that accomplishes nothing. Hana is about to be kidnapped? Again? Don\'t worry they prevented it. Or the guy just gave her back for no reason. Whatever. I guess it\'s too much to expect an exciting development that might change the dramatic tension. Even at the very end where it finally looked like the stakes had been raised, it all got resolved without issue.And all this stale, flat action gets topped off with a heaping helping of convoluted scheming with some of the most unnecessarily complicated world building I\'ve ever seen. Bones really outdid themselves this time, it makes Eureka 7 look straight forward and reasonable. I\'m not saying it\'s impossible to follow or care about, I\'m just saying if you took the time to work out which factions are allied with who, who works for what organization and what they\'re trying to do, and how any of this shit about livlasters, neoteny, ego blocks and so on works, you need a hobby. It didn\'t help that they crammed it full of nonsensical Shakespeare references. Yeah, I get it, the guy who wrote this shit really liked A Midsummer Night\'s Dream. I guess it\'s a step up from Romeo & Juliet, but why in the wide, wide world of sports would you use a farcical comedy as the literary basis for a science fiction action series? I\'m not saying it can\'t work, but looking at Captain Earth, it clearly didn\'t work here.TL;DR version: it looks pretty, but it\'s really boring and confusing. Waste of effort.

Just like this review.', 'SPOILER FREE REVIEW:Personally I quite enjoyed it, though it was very up and down. Some episodes were completely boring, while others would be spectacular. It threw around far too much technobabble in my opinion, as it had to devote sooo much time to just talking and explaining it multiple times, which took away from the experience. When they let the characters just interact as themselves, it could be quite fun, and some arcs and episodes were really really good. I felt that the show was dropped by a lot of people, because despite having a strong first episode, after that it goes downhill, and I...feel the only good episode that comes after that was episode 9.The Bug Bear arc was spectacular, but kind of wasted. They try to set up this deep background for the villains, and then instantly turn them into copy-paste villain A when they get turned due to lack of focus on them. Particularly during the first maybe 15 episodes this really irked me because I found the villains to be a lot more interesting than the main characters, who really didn\'t get any development until later on.Hana stays the damsel in distress for far too long, Teppei stays the ""oh I\'m so conflicted and I can\'t be happy"" guy for far too long, and Daichi was lacking in much-needed motivation besides ""it\'s the right thing"" for quite a while. Akari, in my opinion, was the one character I enjoyed throughout consistently, though her running gag got a little annoying. That said, these problems were fixed to some extent later on, but by then it was a little to late.On the animation spectrum, it\'s beautiful. One of the best-looking show\'s I\'ve seen in a while. In a area mostly dominated by terrible looking CG mechs, Captain Earth brings these brilliant 2D (or at least 2D-looking) mechs. The animation occasionally suffered from consistency issues, but for the most part was really amazing. I did have a minor complaint with the character designs, and that is that pretty much *every girl but Akari* has breasts the size of a dump truck. It was kind of ridiculous.On the sound spectrum, it\'s okay. The first OP is amazing and one of my favorites, and was incredibly fitting to the tone and mood of the show, but the second OP wasn\'t near as good though it was still nice. Both of the EDs are pleasantly calming as well. The OST is pretty up/down. Sometimes it fits well, but other times it gets far too over-the-top and stands out too much, pulling your attention away from the show (which an OST should NEVER do). Other times it sounds great. Even when it\'s off, the songs themselves generally aren\'t bad, just a little too predominant or unfitting. That said, an OST\'s one job is to simply contribute to the experience, but not to take away from it, which this didn\'t fully succeed in accomplishing.But the number one thing I\'d say I liked the most in this show was the clear-cut romance. I\'ve gotten sick of these ridiculously-sized love triangles and pentagons, the idiotic harems and will-she-will-she-not. This show doesn\'t have any of that stupidity. The characters have good chemistry, and are not afraid to admit they like each other. They get together in a good way (though I feel one pairing was on the late side, and didn\'t get enough time together to properly develop their romance), and it was just satisfying. That\'s what I liked about this show. For all it\'s many errors, it was satisfying. It left a good taste in my mouth, and for all it\'s mediocre moments, those sprinkled moments of brilliance made up for it.While it may not be the show for everyone, the wonderful art let me hold onto it in it\'s duller moments, and those moments of brilliance made it worth it in my opinion.

Well technically, they aren’t kids but rather pilots who are able to operate the Earth Engine Impacter (EEI). And with that weapon, they just might have the chance to stop the alien invaders known as the Kill-T-Gang. But really, with all of these concepts in motion, the show has all the ingredients for a generic mecha show.Produced by studio Bones and created by the same team that worked on Star Drivers, this mecha show seemed like a classic, at least...from the surface anyways. Essentially, the series is like a riddle where there are many questions that fuels the need for answers. Take for example, the main male protagonist Daichi Manatsu. He is not only a 17 year old high school student but also addressed comically and repetitively as ‘Captain’ by his crew, the Midsummer’s Knights. We find out a little more about his past although most of it is still shrouded in mystery. But nonetheless, the show takes the steering wheel with it comes to setup and does it well initially with the premise. There may be a lot of questions but that’s what can hook an audience in finding out more. But unfortunately, Captain Earth isn’t exactly a show that exploits its advantages. Rather, it can be a throwback when it comes to execution.The story itself takes place in a modern setting with sufficient technology. Assumingly to be in Japan, the series fixates on the idea of an alien invasion against Earth. But the interesting part to note that the invaders aren’t Cthulhu-like beings or those tripod fighters you see from movies like War of the Worlds. Rather, the invaders have humanoid features. Yet behind that mask lies a menacing personality and ambition to kill anyone to get in their way of their goal. Taking a step back though, the show is an original work although with possible influences from series such as Eureka Seven. Besides the giant mecha or the Kill-T-Gang, we get a small yet colorful cast of characters.Daichi is the star of the show but his character isn’t exactly someone people may find exciting about. Like father, like son, he takes the responsibility of a captain as the figurehead of the Midsummer’s Knights. But despite his good faith, the kid often shows insecurity with his role. And this shouldn’t be a surprise either considering the burden he must bare to protect his home planet. However, his relationship with the other characters is normal in particular his best friend Teppi Arashi, who also happens to harbor secrets of his own. Taking a further step into mysteries, we get Hana Mutou, a girl with mysterious powers found by Daichi and Teppi in the past. But seriously, with this setup, there’s the oddball trio with nothing in common except for coexisting and hopefully survive against what’s coming. Otherwise, members of the crew operate at a generic level. Perhaps the most noticeable of them would be a skilled hacker named Akari Yomatsuri. She brings the energy to the team with her ebullience and also pretends herself to be a magical girl. Silly as it sounds, she is serious about it at heart.As the story is crafted out of science fiction concepts, expect the show to advance them like building blocks to a product. That product is made of the characters, story, and mechanics. Throughout the series, various mechanics are explained. Terms such as Livlaster, Designer Children, Planteary Gear, and Ego Blocks are just a few used to convey its sci-fi image. To add on top of that, we get the antagonists known as the Kill-T-Gang with their ambition to drain the planet of its resources. Now, that sounds a bit familiar doesn’t it? It’s cliché to the core as the aliens demonstrate their selfish desires by their words and actions. Oh and of course, they have abilities of their own besides their skills to pilot the mysterious “Machine Goodfellows”. Throughout the series, two prominent members known as Amara and Moco begins what can be seen as an odyssey to fulfill their goals. And as a series with a lot of stuff going on, you might least expect kissing to be involved. Only of course, it’s not for developing relationships but rather to invoke memories. It’s easy to realize what the show is doing here when employing generic concepts from the old book. Unfortunately, the series doesn’t really go beyond characterization when it comes to the antagonists. There’s a load of them introduced as the series goes on with diverse personalities. And although flashbacks are occasionally used to give them some feedback, the antagonists doesn’t spawn enough interest. Their actions are straightforward, stereotypical, and lacks precision when it comes to thought. Furthermore, their nature and instincts are hardly relatable at all. In fact, they are more like pieces to the riddle only serving as answers rather than choices. Indeed, the show chooses to neglect development for its antagonists that provides minimal motivation for interest. At one point in the story if I could recall, they even mention their desire to feed on humanity just because it feels good.On the other hand, some main characters get highlight and characterization. Most prominently is Daichi, as we see growth in his character and relationship with others. However, most of this still feels stale with no seemingly strong direction going for any characters. Hana has almost no personality with a lack of common sense, while Teppi has deep inner thoughts with himself. Even Akari, the genius hacker of the team can be repetitive to watch. Furthermore, the series’ romance department doesn’t exactly function right. There are flags raised early and throughout the series but nothing is truly confirmed. What you will get though are teasing like Akari’s gimmick of flashing her belly button or Hana’s common sense that matches the consistency of a 10 year old. It tries to desperately appeal to comedy to distract fans. While it works out sometimes, the ultimate result feels imbecilic and its formulaic moments go down the drain.What the series can occasionally do well is pulling off is mystery. Yet, some of it lacks logic and happens too fast. Other times, it’s absurd and makes you wonder what the show is doing with itself. Besides the origins of the series and the alien invaders, we also see a darkness from humanity’s side. Macbeth Enterprises is a prominent example of this with their CEO whom wants to rule the world with an iron fist. Well, he tries anyways despite being clueless at times about certain events and characters around him. The funny part is that his trustworthiness in certain characters would be his death warrant. It’s uncomical since the show takes itself seriously. Unlike Star Driver, it isn’t fabulous.When examining the animation style of Captain Earth, creativity is the word you might come to mind at first. Characters crafted with a variety of designs ranging from the suits the pilots wear or the members of the Kill-T-Gang. The background are also fluid with style such as the rainbow and tropical like atmosphere. The mecha designs can also be impressive too with their design such as Daichi’s EEI. There’s a variety of them too so expect diversity with superior CG art. Even action is fast and solid that keeps the pace to contain rhythm. Other times, its languid coordination balances out the pacing.  In retrospect, the show pulls off its animation beautifully with studio Bones and its skills to decorate the way it deserves.Soundtrack may seem an oddball at first but does remain a noticeable factor. In particular, the songs used has more meaning than just its attractive tone.  Hana is an epitome of this with her noticeable voice. Akari’s cheerfulness too can be inspirational. On the other hand, most of the male characters lack strength when it comes to voice mannerisms. Only perhaps some of the antagonists can bring out the best from the cast of characters. However, it’s more stereotypical than anything special. The OP & ED songs tell a different story though with its more conventional image of science fiction. Perhaps only the OST is a more noticeable strength as it dissects the memorable scenarios with a tolerable soundtrack.Captain Earth isn’t the next big thing or in fact, anything great. With a load of exposition, the show often demonstrates a lack of characterization.  Daichi himself is uninteresting while the antagonists are stereotypical from many angles. Transition suffers problems with its storytelling as well. But taking a bit closer look, the series can cleverly craft mystery and some of its side characters. Unfortunately, that isn’t enough to save the series. And in the end, Captain Earth is a show that really didn’t show a fruit of its potentials. from the surface anyways. Essentially, the series is like a riddle where there are many questions that fuels the need for answers. Take for example, the main male protagonist Daichi Manatsu.

Well, he tries anyways despite being clueless at times about certain events and characters around him. The funny part is that his trustworthiness in certain characters would be his death warrant. It’s uncomical since the show takes itself seriously. Unlike Star Driver, it isn’t fabulous.When examining the animation style of Captain Earth, creativity is the word you might come to mind at first. Characters crafted with a variety of designs ranging from the suits the pilots wear or the members of the Kill-T-Gang. The background are also fluid with style such as the rainbow and tropical like atmosphere. The mecha designs can also be impressive too with their design such as Daichi’s EEI. There’s a variety of them too so expect diversity with superior CG art. Even action is fast and solid that keeps the pace to contain rhythm. Other times, its languid coordination balances out the pacing.  In retrospect, the show pulls off its animation beautifully with studio Bones and its skills to decorate the way it deserves.Soundtrack may seem an oddball at first but does remain a noticeable factor. In particular, the songs used has more meaning than just its attractive tone.  Hana is an epitome of this with her noticeable voice. Akari’s cheerfulness too can be inspirational. On the other hand, most of the male characters lack strength when it comes to voice mannerisms. Only perhaps some of the antagonists can bring out the best from the cast of characters. However, it’s more stereotypical than anything special. The OP & ED songs tell a different story though with its more conventional image of science fiction. Perhaps only the OST is a more noticeable strength as it dissects the memorable scenarios with a tolerable soundtrack.Captain Earth isn’t the next big thing or in fact, anything great. With a load of exposition, the show often demonstrates a lack of characterization.  Daichi himself is uninteresting while the antagonists are stereotypical from many angles. Transition suffers problems with its storytelling as well. But taking a bit closer look, the series can cleverly craft mystery and some of its side characters. Unfortunately, that isn’t enough to save the series. And in the end, Captain Earth is a show that really didn’t show a fruit of its potentials.', 'Captain Earth, it was a name which I saw and thought was lame and plain on the season chart, but I still decided to check it out simply because it feels familiar to me from other series I have watched, like Eureka or Star Driver. Indeed, it did not fail me from enjoyment. I personally have a preference to romance-type anime and an average preference to mecha stuff, but in the end I still say this anime makes me feel happy and satisfied after watching.Story-I feel the story is strong, because it is pretty much focused on a single theme throughout these episodes; a fight...for living that comes with friendship and through friendship comes a more stronger relationship. I feel this story is solid enough to keep me attracted and exciting enough as well. I rate this story good (solid). It is not very good, because I feel I can get more surprises and more excitement from this anime; that it has more potential than what it looks like.Character-The characters are easy to understand and each maintains the same personality throughout. By that I mean the characters did not confuse me of what is going on in the anime. Each character is interesting in his/her own way and each works with the other to make the anime and its story solid through evolution of personal feelings, just something we usually see in other anime, but expressed in its own way. I like the characters, so I rate it great in general, simply because they really show what kind of anime this show is and the type it should be.Art-I feel the action scenes were very well done to their specific details, plus I feel these scenes are complicated to manipulate, yet the art still supports them pretty well to the extent that I can feel the power of what is happening, so I rate the art very good. Maybe it\'s because I am a boy, I really do enjoy seeing the art for oppai to be done well. That is another reason why I rate the art this way. Because this anime is mecha, the uniqueness of the art is essential and I believe the art has gotten my attention very well.Sound-A solid 8, that means very good, because of its opening song, BGM, and sound of battle scenes. Specifically, I like the first opening and the BGM involved in the anime. The opening itself calms me because watching this action-mecha anime, while the BGM really prepares me for the battle scenes arriving. There is no need to mention about sound of battle scenes, because like I mentioned this anime means POWERFUL to me.Lastly, I really want to say this again that I really did enjoy this anime of mecha, friendship, and especially its just-enough romance elements. It feels powerful to me, indeed, but it also feels calm at lots of times as I watch the whole 25 episodes. It is not just what others would call it ""ups and downs"", but it is definitely something more to slowly enjoy and to feel. The character and the sound portion of this anime makes me want to rewatch this anime again sometime later. I have not seen a good romance-mecha anime for a long time. I really enjoyed it to the very end, I rate this kind of enjoyment a solid 9, a great enjoyment. for living that comes with friendship and through friendship comes a more stronger relationship.

I watched it. The whole lot of 25 episodes of wasted potential.I'll try to make it short  -unlike Bones did with this show- so you don't have to waste more time if you're already interested in watching this.1. Plot: Lousy piece of crap. Was a Clicheton, or a Cliche-fest, in the wrong way, not in the funny way. Every character is poorly developed and wasted on clichés made up to interest some audience. It was like they targeted every demographic and ended captivating none. Because of...this, the plot is all over the place, there's no argument that sticks with the show for the entire season, and the arc are so poorly designed and developed that it can be compared with a more episodic stuff like... you know like what. The first episodes can catch real quick, the rest just hang on to you like leeches, sucking your life bit by bit with its endlees plotwist that can be seen from space. There where a ton, and I really mean a ton of things that got left out of the entire plot, things that common sense dictates that are relevant.2. Animation: Awesome, outstanding, kind of the best out there, somewhat comparable with some Production I.G works. Well, Studio Bones was on par with this show when looking back on his previous works. I mean, the mecha design resembles a tad to Heroman, but yeah, it looked cool. After all, according to the Studio's Director, their animators drew it all by hand, there was practically no CGI, if none. Kudos to them.3. Sound: good music, everything seemed to go with the mood... nothing memorable. At least they didn't screw up this one.4.- Character: yada yada yada, theres no originality in this characters and even the stereotypes are bad done. There's little-to-no development, and their roles where so messed up I couldn't even bother to remember the names past the first two or three episodes, since there's so many and you see little of them. It I could score this segment, I'd give it a -0.01.5. Enjoyment (and overall): a Studio Bones work to forget. They've done some pretty amazing shows in the past, but this isn't something you can call out among the rest of other awesome anime and say: you should be watching this or that, 'cause Studio Bones.I pretty much ended watching this show out of commitment to the animators and the Studio previous work, and because of earning the right to argument my stuff correctly.Seriously, don't watch it, even less marathon it, unless you don't have anything else to watch and you can watch it very episodicaly, like, one episode a month. this, the plot is all over the place, there's no argument that sticks with the show for the entire season, and the arc are so poorly designed and developed that it can be compared with a more episodic stuff like... you know like what.

Like, what if instead of Shinji being a horrible, insufferable misanthropist and his dad being a crazy megalomaniac that really can't get over his dead wife, Shinji was super-hype about saving Earth and his dad just wanted to watch everything burn? That's kind of what Captain Earth is.Basically, everyone in this show is some kind of stereotypical Giant Robot archetype and their role in the story uncannily parallels the roles of Evangelion characters but reverses those characterizations. Don't believe me? Take a look at the main character: Daichi Manatsu. He's a stereotypical Japanese high school...student who just wants to live a normal life but finds out he's genetically pre-destined to pilot a frigging awesome giant robot. He lives with his step-dad who is actually the leader of a secret underground organisation that's constantly plotting NEFARIOUS DEEDS (TM) with a super-secret shadowy cabal like they are the Tribunal from Metalocalypse talking about how to stop Dethklok. Sound familiar? Here's the thing, though: Daichi is SUPER HYPE about wanting to get in the robot. He thinks it's totally radical. Everybody else wants to stop him (well, the unnamed shadowy figures at least). So, it's basically like bizarro-Evangelion. And that's cool, because Evangelion (in all of its incarnations) has always been seriously and irrevocably marred by its thoroughly-unlikable protagonists. Oh and the show's writer is Yoji Enokido who was the screenwriter for...Evangelion.So, having Daichi be a real go-getter is a refreshing change of pace for the genre, which has seen its fair share of teenage protagonists NOT want to get in the robot and/or being unlikable weirdos (I'm looking at YOU, Heero Yuy from Gundam Wing). Granted, Tengen Toppa Guren Lagan saw two protagonists (Simon and Kamina) both generally optimistic about their piloting destiny and arguably that's what gave TTGL such a cultural impact at the time of its release.But wait, you may ask, if Daichi is basically Bizarro-Shinji, are there analogues for Rei, Asuka, Risuko and the rest? Yeah! Yeah, there totally is. So, in the first episode we are introduced to a quiet, almost unearthly boy who befriends Daichi and has supernatural powers and their relationship quickly escalates into ambiguously gay yaoi-bate. Sound familiar? Sound...maybe, I dunno...like Kaworu Nagisa? Yeah, he basically is except his name is Teppei and he has purple hair instead of dirty blonde. And, in keeping with the motif, unlike Kaworu, Teppei is a generally cool guy who (so far) doesn't seem to want to blow up Earth or initiate Third Impact or...whatever Kaworu was supposed to do in Eva. Rei has an analogue too, who, in keeping with the archetype, is tacit and mystifying but, unlike Rei, she's actually pleasant and not socially awkward and has brown hair. Daichi's uncle is basically Fuyutski; Ritsuko has gone from being a super-hot chain-smoking MILF to being a dorky, balding Anglo-Saxon man; Misato is there too and she's basically the same but younger and with short hair (go away Woolie).But, more than just being a refreshing take on giant robot anime, Captain Pla...Earth has a lot going for it visually as well. For one: there are actual animations. I can't count the number of times I've watched anime try to get away with just looping animations and wiggling the cells in the vain hopes of impressing action upon me. Captain Earth's art direction is subtly beautiful. It's not the highly-rendered, meticulously detailed backdrops you would find in big-budget titles but it's also not the flat-colour rubbish you see in stuff like Gantz. It feels good to watch and that's really important when you are making a piece of VISUAL media. The colours have a very natural tone and everything is quite bright and vivid.Being a giant robot anime, there are giant robots and their designs are also of a high calibre. The protagonist's mecha, Earth Engine Impacter [sic], has a broad-shouldered narrow-waisted design that reminds me a lot of Nadesico. In fact, all of the mecha have that Nadesico style to them, with just a hint of modern sensibility. Granted, Earth Engine at first struck me as rather ugly, not quite as garrulous as, say, those old 70's mecha but still rather bulky and cumbersome. But, it quickly grew on me watching it fight, which, by the way, is somewhat well-animated (although brief). All the mecha so far lack feet, giving them a quality reminiscent of Zone of The Enders mecha. Indeed, the dogfights look a lot like Zone of the Enders as well and this really reinforces the feel that the show could serve remarkably well as the precursor to a toy line or video game franchise. It's really video-gamey in fact. Bones, the production studio, didn't do Nadesico but they did do RahXephon and Eureka Seven, both of which visually echo the design choices in Captain Earth.The title and ending themes are your typical crooning J-pop numbers. I don't fancy them but the use of male vocals is a refreshing change and the songs aren't irritating, which is extremely important if you are watching video files without bookmarking. Occasionally a song will play in media res and do an admirable job of setting the mood. Comically, the music that plays in the first episode seems to be a cover of Korsakov's Flight of The Bumblebee. That's neat.In all, I'm thoroughly impressed by what I've watched so far and definitely intend to continue watching. The unique storytelling, compelling visuals, and likable characters make this a must-watch for people who enjoy the concept of giant mecha destroying things. student who just wants to live a normal life but finds out he's genetically pre-destined to pilot a frigging awesome giant robot.

I haven't binge-watched anime so I decided to watch Captain Earth by simple curiosity. It was a Sunday night and I had nothing to do, so Captain Earth seemed like a good way to alleviate my boredom with. To be honest, I started watching it with no expectations at all, but perhaps I should have expected something positive considering the talent involved here. Also, despite the title, this show has nothing to do with Captain Planet. Anyway, let's see what this anime has in store for...us.Story: The series follows a group of teenage friends that defend Earth from a race of aliens called the Planetary Gears. Making things complicated for our heroes is a secret organization that is sabotaging the heroes' efforts to save the world. This basic premise could make for an interesting story; unfortunately, Captain Earth is unable to fulfill its narrative potential and this is because of the multiple plotlines advancing at the same time. Aside from fighting the Planetary Gears, our heroes come into conflict with Salty Dog, an organization that wants to evacuate humanity from Earth because they believe the planet is beyond saving, and Puck, an AI that is manipulating the conflict between humans and aliens for its own benefit. The show even dedicates screen time to the Planetary Gears in order to frame the story from their point of view. With all these factions running around, you'd think the show would be filled to the brim with interesting concepts and storylines that would get proper screen time and development, but you'd be sadly mistaken.First off, the Planetary Gears are incompetent fools that get defeated almost every week. Their plan is to awaken more of their own kind, scattered across Japan and get them into space, where they can use their robots to drain the life force of humanity. While the heroes fail in stopping the villains from replenishing their numbers, they do succeed in beating them in combat and destroying their robots over and over and over again. The only reason the villains live to fight another day is because their minds are stored in special objects that cannot be destroyed by normal weapons. The show tells us that the villains can never be allowed to use their machines on Earth's surface, lest they will absorb the life out of humanity, but instead of giving the show some semblance of urgency or dramatic tension, it just makes the conflict boring because we know the heroes are never allowed to lose. The heroes are left with empty victories that have no meaning because, again, the villains are incompetent fools.Second, the battle with Salty Dog is ridiculous because Salty Dog is governed by lunatics who believe humanity doesn't stand a chance against the Planetary Gears. Apparently, they willingly ignore the reports about the teenagers that save the world on a weekly basis. Salty Dog proceeds to antagonize the heroes in an effort to evacuate mankind to outer space and leave Earth to die at the hands of the Planetary Gears and they are more than willing to help the Planetary Gears turn the Earth into a wasteland. Even Daichi is frustrated by Salty Dog's lack of foresight and desire to be smartest people on the room.Third, the AI Puck is very predictable. From the moment it's introduced, the show raises red flags that Puck will be an antagonist, either by making its behavior creepy and weird or by introducing technology that will help it fight the heroes. By the time Puck finally gets to fight the heroes, it feels weird and forced because the heroes have no idea of who Puck is and they are only fighting him because the show needs a physical antagonist because, again, the Planetary Gears have utterly failed as villains.Another major problem Captain Earth faces it its overuse of exposition. The show throws around concepts and names every episode, like Livlaster, Neoteny, Impacter, Ordinary, etc. It took me about 5 episodes or so to piece the backstory together with the scraps the show left on the floor but it felt very frustrating that the show has no interesting in piecing together its own backstory and just left viewers to do the heavylifting. If the show cannot properly develop its themes and concepts, then people will certainly not care enough to keep watching.Any mecha battle should have dramatic tension and emotional stakes around it, otherwise it is nothing more than robots just throwing punches and shooting lasers for no reason. Like I said before, the heroes always win. There is no real reason to get emotionally invested in these fights. Just when it looks like the heroes are any kind of real danger, the heroes manage to pull off a win thanks to some contrived deus ex machina or the power of friendship and love. The show explains the heroes' power thanks to the Livlasters, extradimensional energy beings that take the form of magic space guns that can only be wielded by those they deem worthy. In other words, the heroes are Green Lanterns, but instead of superadvanced space rings, they have magic space guns. This is plot armor of the highest order. I was kinda hoping one of the heroes would die, if only to throw the heroes out of their comfort zone and give story some semblance of gravitas and nuance, but that never happens and the heroes are never in any real danger. (3/10)Characters: Another major failure on the show's part is the lousy character writing. Despite their objectively interesting backstories, the main characters are boring and lack any sort of emotional nuance. Daichi, our hero and the character we are supposed to relate the most, is a bland and generic goody two-shoes who rarely shows any emotion beyond friendship and eagerness to do the righting. His friends are hardly any better. Akari is a smug hacker with an inflated ego. Teppei is just a shy and awkward guy with issues that just barely qualify as social insecurities. Hana, the pretty girl with the big secret, has no personality beyond the childish and innocent girl who is just getting to know the world. The friendship between the protagonists is bland and lacks any real substance. We are clearly supposed to think these four are close friends, but the show never delivers any semblance of comradeship between them. They simply engage in pretty standard, paint by numbers friendship stuff. The romance between Daichi and Hana is one of the blandest and most ridiculous in TV show history. Her magic kiss lets her see into his thoughts and a few scenes later, they are having a romance for the ages. A romance this badly written hasn't been seen since the likes of Twilight. Daichi and Hana have no chemistry with one another and they are only together because the show simply needs a romantic subplot. (3/10)The secondary characters are left with almost no development whatsoever. The Planetary Gears, other than Amarok and Malkin, do not evolve in any meaningful way. Sure, they get some episodes to shine here and there, but they are soon forgotten in favor of another, newly introduced plotline. The AI Puck follows the all-too predictable pattern of AIs that become evil and attempt to destroy mankind, like Ultron and the Reapers, with no attempt of subversion.(3/10)Art: Captain Earth, maybe unfortunately, is good in a few ways, enough to make it feel like a missed opportunity. The visual effects are amazing, the colors are bright and lively and the background enjoy a high level of detail and nuance. Clearly, a huge amount of the production budget went into the visual department. The mecha battles are nothing short of visual spectacles, but the enjoyment of those battles is ruined by the aforementioned lack of dramatic tension and emotional stakes. Good visual effects should enhance the anime experience, not make it. I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again. We are basically watching robots fight each other for no reason. Captain Earth at least deserves props for sticking to hand-drawn animation for the robots instead of using CGI. (9/10)Sound: Another redeeming aspect of this show is the talent of the voice actors, who do their best to portray their characters as actual human beings instead of the bland caricatures the shows says they are. It's good to know that the talent of these voice actors will never be wasted, no matter the trash they are given to work with. The first OP, Believer's High, is definitely the best thing to come out of this show. I'm always excited to hear it, even if the show attached to it doesn't match its quality. The second OP doesn't come close to match the greatness of the first, and that's another testament to Captain Earth's untapped potential. (8/10)Overall: Somewhere in the multiverse, there is a parallel universe where Captain Earth is a good anime that properly explores its themes and develops its characters in a graceful and nuanced manner. Sadly, we don't live in it. Captain Earth is not a terrible idea, it's just that it wasn't properly executed and it's hard to get fully behind it. This is because of seemingly unintentional narrative choices that detract from what should have been a significantly better experience. I don't need every anime I watch to be a life-changing experience, I just need it to be a good story, and unfortunately, Captain Earth fails to do that. The show's premise and setting are good but unfortunately, the character flaws are just too hard to ignore. Ideas mean nothing if you can't execute them. Just because something sounds like a good idea doesn't mean it is if you can't bring it to life. Captain Earth is a combination of good ideas, but it is nothing more than that. More importantly, this show is a clear case where mediocrity is worse than outright badness. The excellent production values only make Captain Earth's failure even more painful to watch. Hopefully, the people behind Captain Earth will move on from this mediocre misfire and move on to something better.

Even Daichi is frustrated by Salty Dog's lack of foresight and desire to be smartest people on the room.Third, the AI Puck is very predictable. From the moment it's introduced, the show raises red flags that Puck will be an antagonist, either by making its behavior creepy and weird or by introducing technology that will help it fight the heroes. By the time Puck finally gets to fight the heroes, it feels weird and forced because the heroes have no idea of who Puck is and they are only fighting him because the show needs a physical antagonist because, again, the Planetary Gears have utterly failed as villains.Another major problem Captain Earth faces it its overuse of exposition. The show throws around concepts and names every episode, like Livlaster, Neoteny, Impacter, Ordinary, etc. It took me about 5 episodes or so to piece the backstory together with the scraps the show left on the floor but it felt very frustrating that the show has no interesting in piecing together its own backstory and just left viewers to do the heavylifting. If the show cannot properly develop its themes and concepts, then people will certainly not care enough to keep watching.Any mecha battle should have dramatic tension and emotional stakes around it, otherwise it is nothing more than robots just throwing punches and shooting lasers for no reason. Like I said before, the heroes always win. There is no real reason to get emotionally invested in these fights. Just when it looks like the heroes are any kind of real danger, the heroes manage to pull off a win thanks to some contrived deus ex machina or the power of friendship and love. The show explains the heroes' power thanks to the Livlasters, extradimensional energy beings that take the form of magic space guns that can only be wielded by those they deem worthy. In other words, the heroes are Green Lanterns, but instead of superadvanced space rings, they have magic space guns. This is plot armor of the highest order. I was kinda hoping one of the heroes would die, if only to throw the heroes out of their comfort zone and give story some semblance of gravitas and nuance, but that never happens and the heroes are never in any real danger. (3/10)Characters: Another major failure on the show's part is the lousy character writing. Despite their objectively interesting backstories, the main characters are boring and lack any sort of emotional nuance. Daichi, our hero and the character we are supposed to relate the most, is a bland and generic goody two-shoes who rarely shows any emotion beyond friendship and eagerness to do the righting. His friends are hardly any better. Akari is a smug hacker with an inflated ego. Teppei is just a shy and awkward guy with issues that just barely qualify as social insecurities. Hana, the pretty girl with the big secret, has no personality beyond the childish and innocent girl who is just getting to know the world. The friendship between the protagonists is bland and lacks any real substance. We are clearly supposed to think these four are close friends, but the show never delivers any semblance of comradeship between them. They simply engage in pretty standard, paint by numbers friendship stuff. The romance between Daichi and Hana is one of the blandest and most ridiculous in TV show history. Her magic kiss lets her see into his thoughts and a few scenes later, they are having a romance for the ages. A romance this badly written hasn't been seen since the likes of Twilight. Daichi and Hana have no chemistry with one another and they are only together because the show simply needs a romantic subplot. (3/10)The secondary characters are left with almost no development whatsoever. The Planetary Gears, other than Amarok and Malkin, do not evolve in any meaningful way. Sure, they get some episodes to shine here and there, but they are soon forgotten in favor of another, newly introduced plotline. The AI Puck follows the all-too predictable pattern of AIs that become evil and attempt to destroy mankind, like Ultron and the Reapers, with no attempt of subversion.(3/10)Art: Captain Earth, maybe unfortunately, is good in a few ways, enough to make it feel like a missed opportunity. The visual effects are amazing, the colors are bright and lively and the background enjoy a high level of detail and nuance. Clearly, a huge amount of the production budget went into the visual department. The mecha battles are nothing short of visual spectacles, but the enjoyment of those battles is ruined by the aforementioned lack of dramatic tension and emotional stakes. Good visual effects should enhance the anime experience, not make it. I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again. We are basically watching robots fight each other for no reason. Captain Earth at least deserves props for sticking to hand-drawn animation for the robots instead of using CGI. (9/10)Sound: Another redeeming aspect of this show is the talent of the voice actors, who do their best to portray their characters as actual human beings instead of the bland caricatures the shows says they are. It's good to know that the talent of these voice actors will never be wasted, no matter the trash they are given to work with. The first OP, Believer's High, is definitely the best thing to come out of this show. I'm always excited to hear it, even if the show attached to it doesn't match its quality. The second OP doesn't come close to match the greatness of the first, and that's another testament to Captain Earth's untapped potential. (8/10)Overall: Somewhere in the multiverse, there is a parallel universe where Captain Earth is a good anime that properly explores its themes and develops its characters in a graceful and nuanced manner. Sadly, we don't live in it. Captain Earth is not a terrible idea, it's just that it wasn't properly executed and it's hard to get fully behind it. This is because of seemingly unintentional narrative choices that detract from what should have been a significantly better experience. I don't need every anime I watch to be a life-changing experience, I just need it to be a good story, and unfortunately, Captain Earth fails to do that. The show's premise and setting are good but unfortunately, the character flaws are just too hard to ignore. Ideas mean nothing if you can't execute them. Just because something sounds like a good idea doesn't mean it is if you can't bring it to life. Captain Earth is a combination of good ideas, but it is nothing more than that. More importantly, this show is a clear case where mediocrity is worse than outright badness. The excellent production values only make Captain Earth's failure even more painful to watch. Hopefully, the people behind Captain Earth will move on from this mediocre misfire and move on to something better. (3/10)"", ""People attempt to take this show too seriously. It's just another mecha show with some goofy characters mixed in and some twists and turns along the way. I enjoyed the series, the characters were well written, unlike many shows they weren't afraid to throw in a little fan service, and it kept a good pace. A lot of people will be quick to condem it because of the fan service, but I say if you don't like it than there's literally a million similar shows out there you can watch devoid of the ecchiness.

A big, poorly written mess.My main problem with this series isn\'t with its perfectly presentable aesthetics, unoriginal as they are. It looks and sounds like a solid 7/10 show, despite its recycled transformation sequences and unremarkable soundtrack. This show\'s...problem is its meat, the story and the characters.

Captain Earth is just meh.The pacing is screwy. Almost every episode has at least one head-scratcher. There\'s wasted potential all over the place. But instead of using its potential, the show screwed around with teen angst and spent a ton of time showing mechs ""expanding"" in an overly complicated space-based linear assembly line…because what we need in mecha anime is definitely mechs that don\'t make sense.Feels like I can\'t write a review without tripping over plot holes every five words....I said it in a single-episode comment, but I\'ll say it again in general: the environment in this show is far too accommodating to the protagonists. Everything always works out just so and they succeed at fixing whatever the problem of the week is. There\'s always a new prototype Impacter that\'s not done being tested yet but is available for Teppei or whoever to launch at a moment\'s notice and use to save the day. I guess you might like (parts of) this show if you\'re a fan of deus ex machina writing, since there are an awful lot of cases where the perfect gadget (or Akari\'s hacking skills) just so happen to address the problem at hand.And again, pacing… ugh. This show spends so much time on nonsense, slice-of-life filler that barely even advances the plot. There are tons of long, dialogue-heavy expository scenes that, well… if you know about screenwriting, you know about ""show, don\'t tell"". This show tells. A lot.So yeah. Meh.On the plus side, MAL says it took me precisely 1111 days to watch this show, so that\'s cool I guess.

Genji Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3488/Genji_Monogatari,"['Two points of view in one for your entertainment:1- Me, who didn\'t know anything about Genji Monogatari prior to seeing this movie. Conclusion: it\'s boring like hell, slow, the story makes little sense (it does make sense, but is uninteresting), with too many ""artistic"" slooooow parts.2- Japanese girlfriend, who is a big fan of Genji Monogatari. Conclusion: This movie is, I quote, ""an insult to Genji Monogatari"" and the director is ""heta kuso"" (let\'s say it means he\'s shitty weak). Main reason: the story doesn\'t make much sense even if you have read the story several times in the past, lots of parts are missing. ', ""I read 源氏物語 (Genji Monogatari) last semester for school, and absolutely fell in love with Murasaki Shikibu's work. Naturally, when I discovered an anime based off the tale, I had to watch it. (It can be found on YouTube)The anime adds a very unique twist to the tale, focusing most on Lady Rokujo's venegeful spirit. With that slightly horror-esque environment, Genji's liaisons have a whole new element, and Genji himself seems more dimensional than in some translations of the tale. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this anime may not make a whole lot of sense to you. The story is vastly...enriched from allusions to the text, which is why I can give the enjoyment a 9 and the story only an 8. The anime does not go into the arc with Niou and Kaoru.Overall, my recommendation is:If you've read the Tale of Genji and enjoyed it: WATCH!If you haven't read the Tale: Get some background info on his various lovers and then watch. You'll want to focus on Lady of the Evening Faces (Yugao), his wife (Aoi), Lady of the Plum Blossoms (Murasaki), The Empress (Fujitsubo) and Lady Rokujo (subtitled differently in the anime). enriched from allusions to the text, which is why I can give the enjoyment a 9 and the story only an 8.

I'm not really familiar with Heian period, even though I like stories that take place in ancient Japan. The only thing I knew of Genji Monogatari was that it revolved around a man named Genji and his love life.Story: 3I think the story would have been more enjoyable was it not sooooo sloooow. I almost fell asleep at one point, which I rarely do. This anime has not utilized the time they got efficiently enough. It could have either reduced the time for the plot, or made...the plot more complex. Trying to keep up with the plot was difficult, because the characters were too similar with each other (both visually and characteristically). Also I think the focus was too much in Genji, because I couldn't really grasp what the other characters' personalities were.Art: 7The art was refreshing, as if watching woodblock prints. I had to take some time to adjust myself with all the lipstick though. I didn't like it how every woman looked so similar, because it made it difficult to recognize them from one another. Animation pacing was slow, which was sometimes good, and sometimes painful to watch. I wish they had used more angles and movement for the camera, because I think it was too static and straightforward.Sound: 8I actually liked the music that was used. It was a nice blend of old and new, which didn't bother me, and actually fit the atmosphere.Characters: 2As mentioned, the women were difficult to tell apart, and Genji gave me an impression of a boy who didn't know what he wanted, swore his loyalty to his lovers, but ran off to another's arms when things got difficult.Enjoyment: 2For a person who didn't know anything about the story beforehand, this was terrible to watch.

"", 'Genji Monogatari is the type of film that will only be enjoyable to certain types of people. It seems to be the type of film that you either find brilliant or a waste of time, no in between. If you are patient and can enjoy a film for more than just its story, then I think you will find Genji Monogatari to be a valuable cinematic experience.I came across this film randomly one night in my YouTube recommended. I thought the thumbnail picture was interesting, so I clicked it and only planned to watch the first five minutes to see what it was like so...I could decide if I wanted to watch it some other time. (This was at midnight as I was scrolling my phone before bed.) Instead, I ended up watching the entire movie right then, staying up way later than I usually do just because I was too fascinated to pause it til tomorrow.Sound 10/10First and foremost, this movie is defined by its music. I am a huge fan of soundtracks and always take care to pay attention to the sound of a movie, and I promise that this soundtrack by Haruomi Hosono has to be the best film score I\'ve ever heard -- American, Japanese, or otherwise. The mixture of natural ambience, Japanese folk instruments, and melancholy chord progressions manifests a unique vibe that defines the movie. At times the music feels almost vaporwave with its slow, moody \'80s synths (such as the song ""Kechigan""), and at other times it feels ethereal and heavenly beyond human capability (the song ""Wakamurasaki"" is particularly striking). If nothing else, this soundtrack demands admiration.Art 10/10The other major strength of this movie is its lovely art style. Faces, clothing, scenery, etc. are all drawn in such an interesting way. The color choice is also excellent. You can also notice the attention to detail in the artwork. For example, in the Heian Period, it was considered inappropriate for the inside of your mouth to be visible, so people would speak with their lips as closed as possible -- which you can see in how they drew their speaking, the lips barely move. The layers of beautiful clothing -- so much so that they are a burden to walk -- are also historically accurate of Heian aristocracy. There are parts of the film that are experimental, such as the strange opening credits and the ending. The visuals are really such a treat.Story 6/10Truth be told, the story itself is not that thrilling. I had never heard of Genji Monogatari before watching, so I couldn\'t figure out what was happening for a lot of the movie. The plot is best enjoyed if you read what it\'s about beforehand (like I send, I jumped right in without even reading the description) and I know some other reviewers said its not entirely loyal to the ancient classic. On the other hand, I understood what was going on well enough for the ending to have an emotional tug on me, so if you really pay attention you\'ll be fine.Characters 6/10While Genji isn\'t exactly likable, he does perfectly capture the quintessential ""handsome prince"" of the Heian Period -- angsty, reserved, polyamorous, and beautiful. If you ever read up on the Heian Period (or watch the Crash Course on YouTube) the aristocracy really behaved like this. They spoke in poems and slept around and acted sad all the time -- that was the culture. To that effect, the movie captured Heian life well. However, beyond the historical accuracy, most of the characters are pretty flat. I had trouble telling the various women apart because they were drawn very similarly (except their hair, I realized) and all acted basically exactly the same. No one had any flavor to them -- each character was interchangeable with all the others, personality wise.Overall, Genji Monogatari is movie best enjoyed alone, in the dark, with the best speaker system and biggest screen you can access. Resist the urge to check your phone during the slow parts, don\'t pause it to go get food or finish a different time. I highly recommend watching John Green\'s Crash Course on the Heian Period prior to watching the movie so that you can appreciate (and understand) what you\'re seeing.

Wayyy too slow! This is insulting to the original novel ""Genji Monogatari""The art and sound is fine, I don\'t have much complaints about it ^^The story of the original novel is grim, fascinating while the movie just turns it into storyboarding hell!! Walking from one place to another should not take that long!I get scenarios like Evangelion\'s elevator scene but this?? I don\'t see the meaning or purpose behind these dreadfully slow motions and I feel like it\'s just...pretentious.The art itself is quite beautiful, I must admit. and there\'s minimal sound (or when it\'s used it\'s very appropriate)....Just like Ergo Proxy and Evangelion, it doesn\'t really tell you what\'s going on- but with Genji Monogatari\'s case it\'s way too vague...someone who have not read the novel or at least know the contents and plots prior to watching the movie would most likely find a hard time understanding this story and plot.Just go read the novel, don\'t bother yourself

enjoyed it and game it 8/10 (7.5/10, if there was the option), so that lead me to find that there was an older anime film adaptation and it peaked my interest, so I'd watched it and oh I was both impressed and kinda disappointed at the same time.I felt that this film had compressed the original story too much, if I hadn't seen the anime series adaptation and read the wikipedia page of the novel, I wouldn't...actually know what's going on in the film, there were some scenes which were cutted out and there's basically no character introduction which makes the film frankly hard to follow, so that's my main criticism really.Animation wise though, even while watching in VHS tape quality looked amazing, the voice acting was good enough and the music was fitting too.Personally I don't really feel I can judge the story aspects of the film or novel since well I haven't read the novel and the topics of Genji Monogatari is to me mostly a historic artifact, something not really to enjoy in a modern sense but to analyse society of Japan 1000 years ago.So overall, it's a 7/10, if you haven't read the novel or know the story of Genji Monogatari already, I would say read the novel first (or even the 2009 anime series adaptation first), then watch the film, even though I criticized it for compressing the novel too much, the film still makes the cut as a classic anime film imo.

anime series adaptation first), then watch the film, even though I criticized it for compressing the novel too much, the film still makes the cut as a classic anime film imo."", 'this could of been good but its to focus on visuals which are good  but everything else ends up a messstory 3there needed to be more narration. while normally with movies and shows it should try tell things more with

this to help ease the viewer in the setting. the issue is it might be fine with some scenes but the scenes showing the character getting ready for passionate sex. should have a different voice tone

Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2: Shiroki Ryuu no Miko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1904/Harukanaru_Toki_no_Naka_de_2__Shiroki_Ryuu_no_Miko,"[""This is basically the same story as Harukanaru 1: Hachiyou Shou but told differently with some details changed. Akane was brought into the other world by herself, the hachiyou were all originally from the other world. The hachiyou do not just blindly follow her simply because she's the miko, but she has to try to earn their respect in order to get their help. While there isn't a lot of character development (it is only 3 episodes), there was already more character depth than what I got from the enter 26 episodes of hachiyou shou. There is conspiracy, political tension, personal crisis/turmoil for the characters...(eg: fighting between duty and personal choice). I am very sad that there is only 3 episodes with no continuation.In my opinion, this is a better story than Hachiyou Shou, and I would have loved for them to continue this version into a fully fleshed out TV series instead of hachiyou shou. The plot is more believable, the characters are more in depth, and the art is better. (eg: fighting between duty and personal choice).

THIS on the other hand has a lot of potential, it establishes the world and conflict quite well, especially when it comes to the guardians. They have their own lives and their own conflicts outside of the Priestess, which is why initially most of them are reluctant to join Karin, or even downright reject her.From the very...beginning Karin isn\'t babied because she\'s the priestess, she\'s instantly faced with the difficulty and responsibility of being the Priestess of the white dragon, also with all the political and social consequences that entails. The feeling of isolation and loneliness makes Karin very likable as a heroine from the get-go, as well her modern way of being (such as playing ball with the nobles, something unheard of for a lady to do at the time).One thing I don\'t understand though is why the change of character design and names when it\'s obvious who is supposed to be who from the 2004 version.

Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4756/Hello_Harinezumi__Satsui_no_Ryoubun,"['Ah ""Hello Hedgehog: Domain of Murder"", this is an OVA that almost know one knows about, in the U.S. and in Japan. I wouldn\'t even know about it if it weren\'t for ANN\'s recent Buried Treasure article. I read that review of it, and it seemed interesting so I bought the DVD. I am quite happy that I did, because this is quite an undicovered gem. It\'s no masterpeice, but it\'s a very good series.Plot/Story7/10This OVA is based off of the popular seinen manga ""Hello Hedgehog"". Sadly the OVA did not become too popular, but lucky enough for us, Central Park Media licensed it for...some reason, and even gave it a good dub a few years later. Anyway the story is very interesting. It\'s a classic detective tale, but the mystery behind it is very interesting. The story starts out with Detective Goro (nicknamed ""Hedgehog"" due to his hair) being asked to find a lady\'s long lost husband. He ran away from the family years ago, and she beleived him to be dead. But a recent wanted poster she found (how cliche) has a picture of him on it. There\'s a different name on the poster, but it\'s definitely his picture. This lady wants the detective to find her husband, so she can talk to him once more before he goes to jail. It\'s an odd request, but Goro takes the case ( a little  reluctantly at first). The case leads him to the other side of Japan, and while investigating there are many twists and turns. The plot is pretty much a regualr mature detective drama, something we\'d be more used to seeing in an American Live Action  Movie, or TV series then in anime, but the change in medium is well welcomed. The mystery is very good, but not without it\'s faults. I wouldn\'t go as far as calling them plot holes, but there are some real problems with the story. Many things that unfold are very unlikely, which is normally a little forgivable in an anime, but I\'ll hold them to it for this, since they are trying to be very realstic.  For one thing, why does this one man make so much more progress on the case the the entire police force? Another thing, why the HELL didn\'t the police grab this man when he was about to get on the ferris wheel (toward the end of the OVA), or one of the many other times they could have grabbed him at the amusement park!? Look I know they are trying to ""protect"" his son, but they are putting him in (physical) harms way by not taking him away from his father! Trying to protect him from mental scares is not a good enough reason to gamble with hsi life! Real life police don\'t act this way, and least I sure hope they don\'t. If an officer ever made the same choses that the officers make in this anime, I would expect them to be fired! They make some real stupid descisions toward the end...but I digress.  Anyway because they allowed him to get on the ferris wheel, an illogical scene occures, which is a pivotal moment in the anime, and due to this it feels forced and illogical and loses it\'s point. The part with the husband/father in the bar also has some problems to it, and feels a little off. More time should have been speant explaining exactly what went on there. There are also some real leaps of faith needed to believe that the car crash scene would ever happen in real life. It doesn\'t even make sense that the family is magically holding on to a vine, when they were just in their car folloing down a cliff! Of course the father is the only one holding on to the vine and the kids are holding on to him, too! But besides the multiple problems with the plot, it\'s actually pretty good. The ending was decent and it told a good story. If your forgiving, and willing to not question a few major scenes, this is a very good mystery anime. Perhaps I\'m a little to hard on the plot anyway. It\'s not that bad.Art7/10As Justin Sevakis says in his ""Buried Treasure"" review of the OVA, I wouldnt call the animation/artwork ugly and cheap looking, I would call it realistic and detailed. The backgrounds are great looking! Ok so it\'s not Cowboy Bebop, or Paprika, or something, but the backgrounds are very good for 1992.  It didn\'t blow me away, but it\'s above average. As for the character designs, I really enjoyed them. Some would call them ugly, I would call them real looking and seinen inspired. They all have a rustic, personal look to them I\'d say. I wish a few more anime series looked like this. It\'s not top level work, but it\'s not cheap or anything at all.Characters8/10While many of the characters actions (and non-actions) are very illogical (esecially the sons and the police forces actions, but even th e husband/father and wife/mothers toward the end), I still would give this about an 8/10. Many of the characters are realistic and interesting, despite problems with the others. They really show us a little bit of the way they live, and let us into their world a little. We learn a lot about these people in a short amount of time, which I think is a real feat. Although many of the characters feel tacked on and a little useless at the end, there\'s no one I really hated in the story, and I felt sympathetic to all of the. I felt like they were all decent or good characters.Enjoyment9/10I agree with Justin Sevakis on this one. It\'s so rare to see an anime like this make it to the US that the flaws are easily forgivable. It\'s really enjoyable, esecially if you don\'t sweat the small stuff (and think too hard about many of the major scenes). It\'s easy to like this OVA, and I\'m very glad that I did. I think I may have been a little to hard on this OVA, because I really did enjoy it.Final Vertic:Now to sum it up. The story is great, with an interesting mystery, and great characters. There are problems with the plot, and illogical characters do harm the OVA, but it still comes out looking very nice. The music is decent, but forgettable. The artwork is great, and the character desings interesting. It\'s a good detective drama, with an attempt at realism, but does comes off a little forced.  Great suspense story, and a good watch. This is not going to become your next favorite OVA, but you will probally enjoy it.

I know I did!Domain of Murder - Buried Treasure Review: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2009-03-05/domain-of-murder', ""Domain of Murder is a simple old school detective story, and it was pretty fun to watch. Its just a single episode based on a random case from the manga it was adapted from.story: The story is about a private detective working for a firm taking on a case to find a disturbed killer. This story about the killer has a twist I have never seen in an anime before or anything else in matter of fact. It makes you think would we have done the same thing if we were in his shoes or what would we have done different. it might have not...been the right thing to do but was it really wrong?.Is it fair for us to judge him on the decision he made. It will make you question your moral values and makes you think what did the victim feel when the killer had to make the tough decision. I know I am very vague about the twist behind the killer but I cannot ruin the little the story has(for the few that decide to watch it because of this review), since it is only 51 minutes. 8/10Animation: The animation has the old school feel. It kind of feels low budget but the animation is clean. It being low budget does not take away from the anime at all because I believe it goes well with the detective story. None of the characters are pretty or cute which makes ova seem more realistic. It also animated some great scenery from a couple of Japan's cities. 7/10Sound: I can't say I remember much but nothing annoyed me. Sub and dub both are done well. Decent background music. One thing I do remember is that they changed the dialogue and accents from the background characters, when Goru travels from Tokyo to another city. It is easy to recognize in the sub and probably not at all in the dub, but is mentioned in both. 6/10Characters: The main character is Detective Goru he is a private detective and works with other private detectives for a firm. To me it seems the other detectives and the people that run the firm are main characters from the manga but only make a small appearance in this ova and that is probably due to them only showing one case from the manga. The killer and other people involved in the case get well developed for the case so the audience gets a real feel of what these characters are going through. You get to know more and more about Detective Goru's personality as the ova progresses . 7/10I  did enjoy it nothing really bored me when I was watching it. I wish they had done at least a few more ovas and maybe we could have gotten introduced to more of the main characters from manga. Like I said earlier it is really just a random case from the manga adapted into animated form. To me I think it is probably not even the best case or story the manga had to offer. I could just tell by watching this ova that the manga will have more interesting stories and cases to show. I haven't read the manga and don't plan to read it, but that's just because I don't really like to read.I watch a lot of anime and I don't really watch any american TV even though I live in America so I can't say for sure if the twist has not been done before. but I have not seen it before.

The audience is somewhat thrown into the story and are given the same clues to work with as the private investigator which I thought was pretty fair. As a \'psychological\' anime it does fulfill that role and deals with some serious questions about the grey area of morality (specifically analyzing the concept of sacrifice to save another) and by the end you are left with the general message that the decisions we think are easy may end up being ones we regret for the rest of our lives, which is pretty damn psychologically mind...boggling for a half hour movie. However, the movie had its ups and downs from the start.The art style is what you would expect of for an anime of this era so there are no complaints on that front, and the sound is a bit grainy but again, expected. The characters are fairly enjoyable, unique from each other, and have intriguing goals/motives that the audience can tell from the short amount of screen time they had. Now here comes the bad news - they completely blew the arc of the story. Just as things were coming together and the mystery was getting deeper, one character suddenly reveals a VERY important detail that they ""forgot"" to mention earlier, despite how very clearly important it was to the case. Not only this, but that fragment of the case could\'ve been revealed in several different ways, but for the character to brush it off like ""oh right I forgot to tell you that the killer told me who his next target was"" is a *little* frustrating on its own, let alone how nonchalantly the character brings it up. This struck me as a lazy way of keeping the plot going but at the very least the movie didn\'t end on that note.The climax of the anime takes place in a theme park and was genuinely well played out in terms of twisting your mind and sort of making you sick/sad. To be as general as possible, they bring in two snipers who claim they aren\'t capable of taking the shot, the one man who doesn\'t want to take it is the only one who knows he can, and the decision of whether to pull the trigger is left to a character who thought the decision would be much easier said than done.  The wrap up shortly after the climax is a bit too mushy for my taste but I\'m hard to impress when it comes to endings.Overall, I think it was worth the watch! I give it a 6 out of 10 because, though I found it intriguing as a whole, I wouldn\'t place it as one of the best I\'ve ever watched. I\'d definitely recommend it to those who enjoy this style of anime or perhaps a sample of psychological anime for those who are wondering if they might like the genre, but don\'t want to sit through an entire series. boggling for a half hour movie.

It turns out the man is wanted for double homicide, and she wishes to speak with him before he's arrested. What makes this anime so interesting is that this investigator travels across Japan following breadcrumbs he hopes will eventually lead to his target. But, instead, he discovers that these clues slowly unravel a psychological mystery of a man who suffers a mental break after being haunted by an incredibly difficult decision he made in the past.While I won't spoil exactly what this decision was, I will say that his survival once...teetered on a morally grey dilemma where all outcomes are tragic. The PTSD resulting from this choice forever changed him and sent him down this dark path.Despite the anime only being 50 minutes long, they manage to create a good sense of mystery while gradually illustrating what the man's recent history was like while also making you question your own morality. In the beginning, the guy sounds despicable, but the more you watch, the more you realize that anyone could be placed in such a horrendous situation.Although Domain of Murder is a mystery that gets into the psychology of its suspect, I wouldn't describe it as suspenseful, at least until its climax. It feels like you're watching a random episode of a tv crime drama for the most part. You don't care about the protagonist because he's been introduced ages ago in content that wasn't adapted, and he also doesn't face any real danger. If you enjoy episodic tv crime dramas, then you'll enjoy this. However, I think most other people will probably find the OVA interesting but dry. There is an English dub I think is good. However, if you want to get the most out of something like this, I'd recommend the original Japanese audio.I give Domain of Murder a 7.5 out of 10. I recommend checking it out because it creates an engaging mystery in under an hour, plus I think it's produced well in terms of character designs and background art. To me, this anime feels like a missed opportunity to have a nice, short series because I'd love to see more along the same vein. The manga is titled Hello Hedgehog, and Domain of Murder applies to this specific mini-story. The manga series was also adapted into a Japanese live-action TV drama, but I'd personally rather just read the manga...if I could find it. Although Hello Hedgehog isn't all about crime mysteries, if each arc was written as well as this OVA, then I think it would make for a decent read.STORY 7ART 8SOUND 7CHARACTER 7ENJOYMENT 7OVERALL 7.5 teetered on a morally grey dilemma where all outcomes are tragic.

The premise has a woman paying a private investigator to find her criminal husband to see him one last time, it’s sentimental but also kind of cheesy from the get go. At least the pacing is not bad, since even though the protagonist is seemingly fooling around, he is getting close to people related to his target and gathering information about him, that way he also comes to learn stuff about him, and...since every character he encounters is related to the man he is searching, both that guy and everyone else gets fleshed out at the same time by revealing more about their shared backdrops each time. The movie it’s mostly about that, there isn’t much plot in it aside from showing the lives of the criminal and his acquaintances.Visually the anime is good for a single minor production from its time, character designs are simple and generic, the artwork suffer from some quality drops, and motions are simple and not very good. Backgrounds and special effects, however, elevate the overall visuals. The sound is very forgettable and unnoticeable, weak sound effects, weak music, very average voice acting.The main problem of this title is presenting a fake grey morality, it tries to judge the horrible actions of the man everyone is searching from a moral standpoint, and what they do with him at the end feels satisfactory because both his wife and friend take a big part on it, but it also tries its hardest to justify every single thing he does. Exploring a character to understand his motivations is one thing, justifying the horrible things he does is another completely different. Not only that but the conflict could have been resolved much sooner if every single person here didn’t act so stupidly and illogically. Also the anime becomes idiotically melodramatic at the end by attempting to present a situation as complex when it’s not, it’s very simple as the outcome comes to prove. Finally, the closure it tries to give to its story and bad guy was so corny and out of place, the movie tries to say that he found forgiveness, redemption and a sweet, touching and emotional reunion but it fucking isn’t possible to buy it, he was a horrible person through and through and his train of thoughts was completely irrational and only gave an even worse impression of him, he didn’t deserve any happy ending, and certainly not one where he happily reunites with his first victim.This is supposed to be the adaptation of just one case, the 170th, of a long manga, in turn spin-off of an ever going way bigger manga franchise, which is why there is no context given about the protagonist nor any of his coworkers, plus, if this is its level of quality, then there’s no reason to delve into it.

The idea of having snow as a setting illustrates that point further. For you see cases are like the weather. Some times the endings/starts are like sun shine nice and bright. Although, they can always turn into rain/snow, miserable/bleak. A case drifted in a detectives lap and while he had multiple opportunities to brush it off he choose against it. Now, the question remains was that the right call? Simple to answer without the facts but like Aristotle said, ""The more you know,...the more you know you don\'t know.” Which means there is no longer an easy answer for as the facts come in so do different paths and approaches. A simple detective story but come to conclusion be ready to share with all the characters emotions. A great movie at making one see beyond what is in front of the blizzard that surrounds oneself.Some things worth mentioning that i enjoyed-In terms of the introduction i covered how the use of snow was a nice touch. But i only addressed it in a metaphoric stand point. Snow beautifully covered the creative or imaginative form but danced perfectly to the literal beat of the heart of the plot. Yes, characters had a tough time in arriving to any form of conclusion but how the art portrayed this piece really pushed upon the viewer the feeling of uncertainty in something one can see. Something metaphoric lacks is sight. Yes, it can be imagined but having something worth seeing can be worth believing.- As for the ending i was disappointed but at the same time  appreciative. I tend to want happy conclusions for those brighten up my day and don\'t leave me depressed. But the director, bless him wanted to outshine him/herself by doubling back to how this story originated in a somewhat unique form. Which in turn forced the blissfully ignorant side to make the same tough call.If i were to construct one element i wasn\'t pleased with i would say detail in the art. Although, mind you this judgement would be forced but i think that art wise could have been better.

It\'s an older drawing style reminiscent of  Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo and Master Keaton, backed by a kind of ""cocktail hour"" jazz, which sweeps me away to a simpler, more beautiful time in the world, and particularly in Japan.We have seen many of these characters before in melodramatic police shows, but somehow Inspector Yamagishi\'s remarkable seiyuu and character design managed to bring me to the brink of tears more than once, as though meeting his ""type"" for the...first time.If anything, although it\'s in color, Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun ""feels"" more like a black-and-white 1950s Japanese movie than it does an anime.

Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17651/Genei_wo_Kakeru_Taiyou,"['Alright, let\'s face it. After the ever famous and successful ""Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica,"" a want and increase in demand for dark magical girl shows have been prevalent in the anime community. Now, I\'m not going to be comparing this show to Madoka 24/7, because trust me, this show is bad on it\'s own, but I will be using Madoka as a basis for what a dark magical girl show should try to succeed, and what it shouldn\'t.Day Break Illusion is, absolutely, what it shouldn\'t.If the promotional art and the opening wasn\'t a dead giveaway, it should be well-known that this show is going to...be pretty dark. And well, it definitely is. The story pretty much revolves on young tarot card users who fight against ""Daemonia"" - demons created when humans contract with them and eventually succumb into despair after the daemonia pretty much takes over their mind. The Daemonia causes what appears to be natural disasters around it, and its up to the tarot card girls to fight against it.You know, I wouldn\'t mind the story. I wouldn\'t mind it even if it was almost an exact replica of what Madoka did. Here\'s the thing though -- the story is insanely try-hard. By try-hard, I mean it does so, SO much to try to remind you of how dark it is, of how grim and bloody things get. Let\'s take how we\'re flashed back with Akari\'s dead cousins\' bloody corpse at least 5 times throughout the show. Or how when a painter girl becomes jealous that another painter criticized her, she made sure that both her and the boy that the critic liked were KILLED. Or turning the twelve (yes, twelve) year old girl into a wolf demon. Yes, a wolf demon.I wouldn\'t mind these story elements either that much if they were, gee, I dunno, foreshadowed? The sudden and grimdark death of Akari\'s cousin happens within 10 minutes of the first episode. 10 minutes. You hardly know anything about the cousin or why she dies. A revelation that occurs later on that almost guarantees death of major characters just.. happens. Why? To make the plot get gritter and darker. Nothing is ever at least foreshadowed a little bit, not even once. There were no hints whatsoever that a tarot card user could combine with a Daemonia and create some weird demon, nothing.Basically, the show does whatever it can and goes out of its way to remind you of how dark and edgy and grim it is. You know, I have people that complain about Madoka being dark and edgy, but at least Madoka foreshadowed it. Maybe it had issues with shock value, but just so you know, shock value isn\'t just tricking the audience. Shock value can be randomly killing off a character in a gorey way in the first episode. Shock value can be deciding at the end of an episode to change one of the characters into a demon wolf. It doesn\'t matter if the show is already proclaimed as dark, if it happens without foreshadowing, it\'s shock value.Now you\'re probably wondering, well, do the characters at least save the show? Oh, I wish. I really, really wish. Hopeful protagonist, cold girl with dark past, sisterly lesbian, and energetic one. That\'s really what they all are, and honestly.. they\'re not that good. Namely our protagonist, Akari. I get it -- I get that she\'s only twelve years old and couldn\'t kill things that easily. But you know what? When I see another character go up and kill someone she knew personally and loved to free him out of his misery, I\'m going to be annoyed at her actions.The characters range from cliche to boring to downright DISGUSTING. The main villain, who we know almost nothing about, decides late in the series that he wants to mate (he literally says mate) with Akari. Akari is twelve. Twelve years old. He basically does this sick shit in order to completely destroy her mind and heart so she doesnt care about silly things like consent anymore and, I quote, ""becomes a mother.""Playing the rape/sexual card in a story is NEVER a good sign, unless it\'s absolutely relevant to the plot or was foreshadowed/absolutely needed. But you know what? These girls are twelve/thirteen. We have one girl walk around evil and demonic with her tits literally bouncing out of her chest. We have another one being nearly forced to give into consent with pretty much a demon. Do you see the issue here? I hope so, because none of this is mature, or deep, or good. It\'s honestly really sick and unnecessary.In terms of the art.. it\'s... ehh... I mean, the animation honestly is pretty good. The fight scenes, attacks, all of that look pretty nice. But the show is very obviously lolicon-ish. The girl, all of them, look so stick thin and skinny and tiny that when these terrible things happen to them, it feels so out of place and awkward. It feels honestly awkward seeing a scrawny 12 year old girls\' eyes turn into tiny dots and scream at the top of her lungs. It looks awkward, and the artstyle makes it feel awkward too. It really feels like it\'s trying hard to appeal to the lolicons with its artstyle.Not only that, but the artstyle and character designs in general aren\'t all that good. The eyes are all really huge, they\'re usually misplaced too or sliding off the characters face. The bodies in general look really unproportional and just weird, and the hair seems really choppy and cheaply made. Not really an appealing design, at least for me.If one thing can be said good about Day Break Illusion, it\'s the soundtrack. I have to admit, aside from Akari\'s seiyuu, the voices are pretty good and solid. Not to mention the OP and ED themes are pretty great and catchy too. The OST isn\'t honestly all that stand out, but I can definitely say that the sound is a really concrete part about the show.And here\'s where I talk about dark magical girl shows in general. You can skip the next three paragraphs if you don\'t wanna hear it, I just feel it\'s kind of needed.Look, what I believe made Madoka successful in it\'s darkness wasn\'t that a girl got her head chopped off or another had to watch her friends die again and again. That\'s not where I saw success. I saw success in how the show dealt with the psychological breakdown of the things that happened to these characters, and even how their issues could be applied to real life. I feel, personally, that it did an excellent job with showing many different character archetypes in these situations and pretty much breaking them down, showing the affects that it has on them. But that\'s for another day.I feel like studios seem to think that if they just add in some death and gore, that it\'ll be a success. But that\'s not how it works. It really isn\'t. I hate to break it to you, but just showing characters die doesn\'t guarantee success! It really, really doesn\'t. A solid story, solid characters, good foreshadowing and writing, and a good breakdown of these things are what make it so great. I don\'t think the show being open about its dark nature is what makes it unpopular either. There are plenty of shows that were shown to be dark from the very beginning that were successful. (Psycho-Pass, Attack on Titan) I\'m not calling these objectively good, but they were overall well-received. Essentially, the fault for Day Break Illusion of not being a big hit despite having cute girls in grim situations isn\'t really because it was already dark from the beginning, but it just does a very bad job at doing what it tries to do, which is, again, be dark.I guess I enjoy this anime, I mean, it doesn\'t bore me or put me to sleep like other shows, but the enjoyment is really just mediocre for me. It\'s enjoyable to watch weekly I guess, but not something that I can say I actually ""like"" watching, you know? I guess it can be fun for people who like watching anorexic lolis kill things and get killed though.Overall, Day Break Illusion is a prime example, in my opinion, of how people SHOULDN\'T be trying to make dark magical girl shows. Go ahead, make more! It\'s what people want! But making them so grimdark, adding in things like wanting a 12 year old to give birth to pretty much a demon child, killing off side characters like there\'s no tomorrow -- that\'s not what we want. A good story, a solid one with good character that happens to have a darker or more serious twist on the genre, is what would be good, really. But this? Not this, please no this.Magical girls are about cute girls doing cute magical things, not awkward lolis being slaughtered in blood. be pretty dark. And well, it definitely is.

Lapalace and Kyubey seem really similar in that sense.There\'s 4 girls who turn into stronger versions of themselves and fight in an interdimensional space against evil beings, one nice one, one bad ass one, one that\'s more set in their own goals, etc....However a few things set them apart.1: The main character Akari Taiyou willingly accepts her powers, although she seems to be upset by what her actions entail (killing people who\'ve turned into Daemonia - the enemy who takes over people\'s hearts). Madoka was horribly indecisive about becoming a magical girl until the very end. Not saying either route is a bad one, but it\'s a good difference.2: The so far ""end goal"" of Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou is also unique. Instead of saving the entire world and everyone, which is (honestly) played out a bit. Sure, the end goal of Genei/Taiyou is awful, but it\'s unique and the way the artists play out facial features among other emotional cues is incredible and adds depth to it.With that out of the way, I\'ll go on to say why I like this anime.1: The story is neat. Tarot cards being the basis of their powers is a neat new theme i\'ve personally not run into so far. I also like how violent some of the fights are, even though its between monsters and 12 year olds. The only thing I don\'t like too much is simply how easily Akari accepts her new role, which may seem hypocritical after I\'ve stated the similarities between this and Madoka Magica, but nevertheless. This show is -almost- as good of an emotional rollercoaster as MM, but it falls just short of greatness as there\'s no -extremely- sad moments. (yet)2: The art style. I didn\'t care for it at first and lets be honest, Seira looks like she was beaten with the ugly stick by a mean daemonia, but it grew on me. I think Akari is adorable, which adds even more emotion to the current horrible setting. Luna and Ginka are relatively unique, I\'ve never seen a power like Ginka\'s in an anime. And again, the battles are very well animated.3: The characters are a tad basic but they do their job well. There\'s the determined bad ass one who simply wants to exterminate, the caring supporter, the defensive character who\'s always around to help cheer up the group, and the protagonist who seems to be flawless in her love for her friends and family. The enemies/daemonia are very uniquely drawn out, and some of them are the epitome of evil. I\'ve never hated an antagonist as much as Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou\'s.4:  I can\'t say too much about the sound. The background music helps to pump up the action during the fight scenes, the characters voices are done well, I find it funny that some of the voice actors also worked on Kodomo no Jikan together. Overall I feel the characters were voiced perfectly.Overall. I really like this anime and can\'t wait for the next episode. It truly has me on the edge of my seat.I\'d recommend it to anyone who enjoys magical girl genre, action genre, or just looking for a good anime with cute girls fighting evil. However a few things set them apart.1: The main character Akari Taiyou willingly accepts her powers, although she seems to be upset by what her actions entail (killing people who\'ve turned into Daemonia - the enemy who takes over people\'s hearts). Madoka was horribly indecisive about becoming a magical girl until the very end. Not saying either route is a bad one, but it\'s a good difference.2: The so far ""end goal"" of Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou is also unique. Instead of saving the entire world and everyone, which is (honestly) played out a bit. Sure, the end goal of Genei/Taiyou is awful, but it\'s unique and the way the artists play out facial features among other emotional cues is incredible and adds depth to it.With that out of the way, I\'ll go on to say why I like this anime.1: The story is neat. Tarot cards being the basis of their powers is a neat new theme i\'ve personally not run into so far.

It received mixed ratings. Some were 9, while others were 4. The ones who rated this anime to be low were mostly those that kept comparing it to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Critique the show, not compare! It's not a perfect anime, but it doesn't mean it cannot be enjoyable.Story: The first episode took me by surprise,with me thinking that it escalated pretty quickly with very little background to the story. It made me prepare myself for the upcoming episodes, as there were more grim. The tarot cards were a cool component of this anime; I...just wished that they described them in more detail, especially with the cards that the 4 girls have. They don't really explain the organization that they work for either.. The battle scenes were nice, they show struggle through pain and blood. Towards the end, I felt like the story sidetracked from there.Art: The physical appearance of the girls bothered me at first. They're skinny as twigs and some have pretty big breasts for their age. They magically grow long, bushy hair and go from kawaii-eyes to serious, bad-ass eyes. All of the older people look scary to me. The battle scene backgrounds are plain, but at least the battle moves were pretty cool and somewhat unique. The daemonias look creepy and gross, and some of them, I was not sure why they look like that, based on why they suffered.Sound: The opening and ending are nice. You hear a lot of screaming in this anime, mostly screams of fear or battle cries. They set the mood pretty well as a potential daemonia appears with ominous music.Character: I feel the category for this anime was the reason why the viewers rated it low. The fortune tellers that Akari knew seemed somewhat irrelevant; the transvestite and big-breasted lady didn't have to exist. I thought the main antagonist was the sidekick, because he was following orders from someone else. What was the point of this!? When he reveals his intentions at the every end, I thought it was a bit silly. The cat and raven are useless talking messengers. Luna annoyed me the most, being overly attached to Akari. The past between her and her sister was cloudy. Basically, most of the characters had cloudy backgrounds; besides Ginka and Seira. I feel like some didn't fulfill their roles either.Enjoyment: Although it may seem like I'm contradicting myself while negatively criticizing this anime and giving it a high score, I still like it. It could have been something better, but it just lacked things like depth. Despite missing some important components, I still enjoyed it to the point where I wanted to keep watching the next episode. I came to like most characters, enjoyed the battle scenes, and feel for the girls, as they experienced hardships together.Give the first few episodes a try and see what you think. just wished that they described them in more detail, especially with the cards that the 4 girls have.

Madoka Magica was a game changer and achieved acclaim and popularity that has proven persistent. Given all that, it's really no surprise at all that other anime studios would want to try and repeat that success. So it is anime studio AIC has decided to present us with an original dark magical girl series...that copies quite liberally from the Madoka book. However, while the inspiration is quite evident, having followed this anime, Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou, I can safely say that it transcends simple imitation and stands as something good on its own.A huge part of Madoka's strength was in its art and animation. The characters were incredibly well designed and the imagery for their enemies was perhaps even more striking. The animation meanwhile was top rate, with over the top exhilarating action that never failed to satisfy. It would be hard for Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou to reach the bar Madoka did on that end, and yeah, it doesn't quite. The character designs are a little weak; not terrible, mind you. The characters are plenty cute as they should be, but the art style has a somewhat more super deformed look than I personally care for and the characters designs aren't immediately distinctive. The designs for their enemies, the Daemonia, fare better, most of them looking really cool and disturbing; still maybe not as memorable as Madoka's witches, but quite good and effective. The animation is great too; fight scenes are visceral and appealingly flashy. It's all pretty solid.There isn't really as much to say about sound. The voice actors are convincing and do a pretty good job of defining their roles. The music is appropriate and good at setting the tone. Opening and ending themes are fine though nothing overwhelming. Madoka's themes weren't the most memorable part of it either though.The story is the important thing, and Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou does a pretty good job with it. It follows Akari, a girl who is pulled into an enigmatic organization of magical girls fighting against Daemonia terrible monsters born from humans afflicted with negative emotions. She is put on a team with three other girls who she comes to know and bond with as they struggle against the Daemonia and the conflicted emotions that the battle against them provokes. It's a solid setup and I'd wager it still has plenty of twists and turns to lay on us still at this point. The story is delivered well, doing a good job of setting its atmosphere. It really helps highlight why Madoka worked so well. With its cuteness and sincerity, the magical girl genre really does mesh beautifully with dark elements and horror; the contrast just works really well, and Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou does nothing if not capitalize on it just as Madoka did.Characters are key to the formula working though. Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou does pretty good on that front. Again, their not as immediate as Madoka's cast, but the magical girl team here are a likable bunch who are developed quite well. Akari herself is about what you'd expect from a main character in a magical girl anime; she's sweet, friendly, earnest and a little naive, but with a lot of resolve. Nothing too groundbreaking, but she works. Seira is strict, distant one that could maybe be described as the Homura analogue; her and Akari come from very different mindsets when it comes to the Daemonia problem which puts them at odds. Luna is a shy magical girl who is quickest to befriend Akari; she's likable and nice, but seems conflicted and self-conscious. Ginka rounds out the team with a lot of exuberance and is probably my favorite character. She's smartly developed and just a lot of fun. So far each of the main characters had at least one really good character building episode. There are other magical girls too in the organization, some of which get some screen time. Most of these supporting characters have interesting designs and seem fun.All the elements work pretty well here. Nothing is quite as perfect as it was in Madoka Magica, but I'd say the sum is greater than the parts here. I'm sure some might sneer and say it's derivative or Madoka lite, but I don't think that's giving the show quite the credit it deserves. Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou is a smart show that knows what it's doing and has a lot of heart. Definitely recommended.Update: as a short addendum having now completed the anime, ultimately Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou is a somewhat more uneven anime than I would have hoped. There are a lot of very obvious threads left hanging at the close--a number of elements introduced are not fully explored and there are characters who feel kind of extraneous. That said, in its best episodes in the second half (particularly the stuff with Luna), the character development on the core cast becomes incredibly effective and got me pretty invested in all of them. What we end up with is a plot that's more emotionally coherent and compelling than it is actually complete. Also, while I had some hang ups about the art style at the time of my review, it grew on me over the second half and the animation remained slick and impressive throughout. Ultimately it left me kind of scratching my head still wanting it to come together somehow, and I hope there's a second season or something to give the answers, but it also left me smiling and satisfied. I probably just have a weakness for this kind of show; I don't know. Whatever it is, despite the apparent faults, my score stays what it is. that copies quite liberally from the Madoka book.

Whatever it is, despite the apparent faults, my score stays what it is."", 'It’s been a while since I last reviewed something, and that’s mostly because there wasn’t anything I finished that I felt like reviewing.Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou though is one show I wanted to review since episode one.So I sat down, watched the remaining 5 episodes that I haven’t watched yet and marathoned them.And what should I say? Meh.It saddens me that this show clearly had potential but had two main issues that ruined all potential it had.First - The pacing.This show was just waaaaaaaaay too rushed. Sometimes they squeezed in so much stuff into one episode it couldn’t build up any impact for the things...that happened prior than that,Second - The VisualsIf you know a bit about studios, you know that AIC is not the greatest anime studio around, but they usually try different things, and focus more on the content than on the presentation. But Genei could really have needed some better visuals. But more to this in the respective categories.There are actually 2 reviews I want to write for this. One focusing on the show, and the other comparing it to Madoka, because there are a lot of people who think this show mostly exists because of Madoka, and I am one of them.Lets get started shall we? (spoilers ahead!)Story________________________________________Genei is a magical girl anime, so it’s obviously about magical girls fighting evil using their power.In Genei our main characters use the power of tarot to fight evil, and each character resembles a certain tarot card.I am a fan of the tarot system ever since I play Persona 3 so this is a big plus for the show to base its magic system around tarot.What’s not a big plus was how the first episode was handled.We are introduced to our main character Akari the “sun” who apparently lost her mother and lives with her aunt and her niece.While the introduction was done okay, towards the end the pacing problem as described early kicks in. Suddenly she transforms into a magical girl kills a tentacle raping plant and next thing you see; her niece is dead.And not only that but also no one seems to care.It doesn’t stop there, fast forwarding you see her adult tarot-girl friends being attacked by yet another demon and e get introduced to the other 3 magical girls during that fight.All that happened in less than 5 min and left me extremely confused.What did just happen? Why is her niece dead? Why does no one seem to care? How did she get her powers? Why the fuck is it all so rushed?Without going into greater detail about what happens later, this is not the only time when they try to fit in a lot of content into one episode.My conclusion is: This should should have gotten 24+ episodes instead so you can properly build up these things.More episodes would have been also helpful for explaining all the concepts in the show.There seems to be some secret organisation, but we never really find out what it is all about, not even by the end.Also some events that would have made a huge emotional impact on both the characters and the viewers didn’t get enough time, making it sometimes really sketchy or shoehorned in.Good thing though they filled most plotholes so by the end nothing was really like “how could this happen? why didn’t they do that?”.So the overall story didn’t suffer too much.The ending was also pretty solid. No lame cop out but an actual ending with most of what happened being actually important.This is also a good transition to talk about Madoka.So what did Madoka do better/worse/different here?First of all. Both shows were rushed, but in Madoka it didn’t feel as rushed because thanks to Urobuchi we never get details into anything anyways.Not in Genei. the writers tried to explain everything and make solid explanations to both the magic system and the evil that is threatening the world.While some powerlevels seemed to be random in Genei, you at least saw why their abilities are what they are.![spoiler]!Also no important character gets killed too early as in Madoka without enough background to make it important.And of course the ending is no magical reset bullshit.![/spoiler]!I personally think that Genei, even though the presentation of the story was lackluster, had an overall better idea than Madoka.You know, the evil in Genei actually was explained AND HAD A FACE and was not just there so our magical girls can fight something and suffer.Their magic system was based on something understandable and not LOL RANDOM stuff as in Madoka.Characters________________________________________The cast in Genei wasn’t huge but there were quite a lot of characters and all of them seemed somewhat relevant.Of course the most important were the 4 main girls: Akari, Luna, Seira and Ginka.And then some major side characters: Meltina & Priscilla, Ariel Valtiel & Etia and the loli trio.Akari: Is as mentioned our main character and she resembles the sun. She is kind, warm hearted and also tries to do her best to reduce harm.At first she doesn’t want to fight the Demons but later, out of pressure, does so even by herself.She is not the greatest main character of all time, but she had a solid personality which also resembled her tarot very well. I really liked how important that was for their personality and how they later build it in into the story even more, with her personal drama.Luna: Is out shy, calm girl who has a lady-crush on Akari which later turns out to be Yuri. Later on her character gets developed quite a bit and I ended up liking her more than I usually do for those shy, clam girls. While not my favorite character she is definitely up there. Oh yeah she is the Moon, this works well with her relationship to Akari, as she is kinda the opposite to her. Again I really like how they’ve handled the tarot system in this anime.Seira: Is our cold hearted, kuudere character. She is the star and I had the most trouble identifying her with the star tarot. Maybe I don’t know enough about tarot to understand what it means to be the star, but I just couldn’t really pinpoint what her relation was supposed to be.her development was also done well as for all the characters so far, and for everyone who is into kuuderes she is also a good character. I personally couldn’t connect to her that much.Ginka. My personal favorite. She was temperance, being the balanced one. And so was her roll in the show. I think that was the reason I liked her the best, not only did she have the best character design, but also the least polarized personality. She was not super nice all the time, but also not cold or shy. She was, like Akari and Luna - a good representation of her tarot.They did something dumb though towards the end which is a spoiler that I will not include here but I personally thought it was an asspull. If you finished the show you will know what I mean.The rest of the characters all were not super developed but a good addition.And this again leads me to the transition to Madoka.Characters in Madoka were just plain lazy. Most of them got a sloppy background and had almost no development.That’s especially true for Madoka and Homura. And of course Mami…If I would compare the characters I’d say:Madoka = Akari (obviously)Mami = LunaHomura = SeiraKyouko = Ginka (to some extend)Sayaka = No one really, maybe Luna but only to some extendMadoka in Madoka was utterly useless and not much of a protagonist. She rarely solved any problems, and in the end just did the gigantic asspull of an ending.Akari, while also in a same fragile, nice position as Madoka at least developed later and DID THINGS. She actually fought and solved issues without relying on everyone else all the time.Akari > MadokaMami was just cannon fodder had almost no character and overall is my least favorite character (if I can even call her that) in Madoka. Luna on the other hand moved on later, had a development and a background.She supported Akari and had an overall bigger emotional relation to her than Mami had to any of the characters.Luna > MamiHomura was a bit a mix of Luna and Seira if you’d compare them and I think that if you take Luna out of the equation, she was a more interesting character than Seira but had again no development. Her background was also really sloppy.I mean we see why Luna loves Akari, but why is Homura so fucking gay for Madoka? Why would she do all that just for Madoka, their connection was super sloppy and just forced drama.Overall I say Homura > Seirabut Homura < LunaKyouko was a terrible character and her development was rushed and made no sense. Inconsistent character and overall one of the worst in Madoka.Ginka > KyoukoThe only good character in Madoka was Sayaka, because she actually had a personal drama, a development and her ending was tragic because time was invested in her story.The other thing that I thought was way better in Genei was how outside characters were handled.Geneis sidecharacters always did something to progress the plot, to calm the characters down, to help them change. While in Madoka most characters didn’t even have parents. You never say the parents of anyone but Madoka.I mean what was Homura? Was she a hobo orphan? Didn’t she have family? What’s up with that?You saw Sayaka at home but I can’t remember her talking to her family just once.Only Madoka had a mother. And of course the entire world was completely empty in Madoka.There were rarely any side character just that one girl in school who stole Sayakas crush and some nobodies who were possessed by the witches.Lastly is Kyuubey. While I liked Kyuubey, his or her master plan was just fucking retarded. At least the villains in Genei made sense. I mean the evil plan of Cerebrum was not amazing. But it was waaay better than whatever bullshit Urobuchi came up with for Kyuubey.Art and Animation________________________________________Lets face it. Genei looked bad.The overall art wasn’t bad but the animation was sometimes really sloppy. Especially when the animal companions were talking. They just opened their mouth and sound came out. It just looked really awkward.They also used a lot of animation multiple times.And sometimes movements or facial expressions looked awkward.It was only brief moments when the show looked pretty decent, but was overshadowed by a lack of good artistic work.I mean what’s with those character designs? It’s okay to have lolis look like that, but the adults as well? They looked like midgets! Gigantic heads, short bodies and those weird faces with way too big eyes? Holy Moly!Backgrounds sometimes looked not even bad especially in that Parallel Realm thingy, and some demon designs were cool as well. Special effects were not bad either but also not great.I make the comparison to Madoka brief.Akiyuki Shinbo.Akiyuki fucking Shinbo.Without him, Madoka wouldn’t be that popular. Well okay the soundtrack but that later.Madoka had just way better art and animation. While I didn’t like the character designs in Madoka either they were still better. And the backgrounds were really cool as well.But without him I doubt that Madoka would have been that well received.And with him for Genei, the show would have been received much better as well.Sound________________________________________I skip voice acting as it was good as for most shows and go straight to the opening and ending song.Man did I love the opening song. That song is so catchy and my favorite of the Summer season.The ending song was pretty good as well but not so much to my taste.The rest of the soundtrack was pretty good as well. Even if the art and animation wasn’t great the soundtrack was pretty good.But all rather pale compared to Yuki Kajiuras epic soundtrack for Madoka.The other part why Madoka was so popular has to do with how amazing Yuki Kajiura is.But I don’t wanna talk to much about it, because I think the soundtrack for Genei was pretty good as well, and fit the show pretty good.Enjoyment________________________________________Oh well.I was kinda excited for the show to be honest. And I hoped it to be better.Some episodes were pretty lame I think, while others were good or even great.My personal favorite was Lunas story in episode 9. It showed how well the villain can manipulate and had overall good pacing and writing.While I always cringed a bit at the artwork and animation, the soundtrack (especially the opening) kept me well entertained. And by the end I was pretty happy with how the show went.Still sad because I know it could have been better with more time and better art, but still got some enjoyment out of it.That said, I did enjoy Madoka in my first watch more. But the second time I realized some issues, and later I understood the major flaws of it.Scores________________________________________Art and Animation 3/10 (bad)Artstyle +0 (While not everything was bad, it was far from great)Quality -1 (reused animation and awkward faces sometimes)Background +0 (meh backgrounds)Character Designs -1 (just no. Don’t do that)Visual Effects 0 (okay but nothing special.)Sound 7/10Voice Acting +0 (good but not outstanding)Opening and Ending +1 (opening YAY, ending was good as well)Soundtrack +1 (pretty good soundtrack overall)Sound Effects 0 (effective but not outstanding)Story or Content 6/10Premise and Setting +1 (good premise, especially like the tarot card idea)Pacing -1 (downfall of the show, too rushed)Complexity 0 (not everything was explained but I blame the episode count)Plausibility 0 (plotholes were mostly filled)Conclusion +1 (satisfying ending)Characters 6/10Personality +0 (all made sense to their tarot, but still too simple)Behavior and Chemistry +0 (pretty good but not enough for a point)Development and Progression +1 (everyone got developed!)Motivation and Backdrop 0 (while all got a background, the rushed nature didn’t leave enough space for it)Likability 0 (good characters but not very memorable)Enjoyment 5/10Art and Animation -1 (talked about it. Bleh)Sound +1 (likeable)Story and Content 0 (if not rushed it would have been good)Characters 0 (same here)Value +0 (will not remember this too much though)Conclusion________________________________________Genei the “Madoka” clone proved itself to be much more than just a copy. While it has major flaws in both presentation and execution. I think it had much more potential than Madoka.And in the end Madoka is only better in my eyes because of the production value and good execution.5,4 ~5/10 (average) that happened prior than that,Second - The VisualsIf you know a bit about studios, you know that AIC is not the greatest anime studio around, but they usually try different things, and focus more on the content than on the presentation. But Genei could really have needed some better visuals. But more to this in the respective categories.There are actually 2 reviews I want to write for this. One focusing on the show, and the other comparing it to Madoka, because there are a lot of people who think this show mostly exists because of Madoka, and I am one of them.Lets get started shall we? (spoilers ahead!)Story________________________________________Genei is a magical girl anime, so it’s obviously about magical girls fighting evil using their power.In Genei our main characters use the power of tarot to fight evil, and each character resembles a certain tarot card.I am a fan of the tarot system ever since I play Persona 3 so this is a big plus for the show to base its magic system around tarot.What’s not a big plus was how the first episode was handled.We are introduced to our main character Akari the “sun” who apparently lost her mother and lives with her aunt and her niece.While the introduction was done okay, towards the end the pacing problem as described early kicks in. Suddenly she transforms into a magical girl kills a tentacle raping plant and next thing you see; her niece is dead.And not only that but also no one seems to care.It doesn’t stop there, fast forwarding you see her adult tarot-girl friends being attacked by yet another demon and e get introduced to the other 3 magical girls during that fight.All that happened in less than 5 min and left me extremely confused.What did just happen? Why is her niece dead? Why does no one seem to care? How did she get her powers? Why the fuck is it all so rushed?Without going into greater detail about what happens later, this is not the only time when they try to fit in a lot of content into one episode.My conclusion is: This should should have gotten 24+ episodes instead so you can properly build up these things.More episodes would have been also helpful for explaining all the concepts in the show.There seems to be some secret organisation, but we never really find out what it is all about, not even by the end.Also some events that would have made a huge emotional impact on both the characters and the viewers didn’t get enough time, making it sometimes really sketchy or shoehorned in.Good thing though they filled most plotholes so by the end nothing was really like “how could this happen? why didn’t they do that?”.So the overall story didn’t suffer too much.The ending was also pretty solid. No lame cop out but an actual ending with most of what happened being actually important.This is also a good transition to talk about Madoka.So what did Madoka do better/worse/different here?First of all. Both shows were rushed, but in Madoka it didn’t feel as rushed because thanks to Urobuchi we never get details into anything anyways.Not in Genei. the writers tried to explain everything and make solid explanations to both the magic system and the evil that is threatening the world.While some powerlevels seemed to be random in Genei, you at least saw why their abilities are what they are.![spoiler]!Also no important character gets killed too early as in Madoka without enough background to make it important.And of course the ending is no magical reset bullshit.![/spoiler]!I personally think that Genei, even though the presentation of the story was lackluster, had an overall better idea than Madoka.You know, the evil in Genei actually was explained AND HAD A FACE and was not just there so our magical girls can fight something and suffer.Their magic system was based on something understandable and not LOL RANDOM stuff as in Madoka.Characters________________________________________The cast in Genei wasn’t huge but there were quite a lot of characters and all of them seemed somewhat relevant.Of course the most important were the 4 main girls: Akari, Luna, Seira and Ginka.And then some major side characters: Meltina & Priscilla, Ariel Valtiel & Etia and the loli trio.Akari: Is as mentioned our main character and she resembles the sun. She is kind, warm hearted and also tries to do her best to reduce harm.At first she doesn’t want to fight the Demons but later, out of pressure, does so even by herself.She is not the greatest main character of all time, but she had a solid personality which also resembled her tarot very well. I really liked how important that was for their personality and how they later build it in into the story even more, with her personal drama.Luna: Is out shy, calm girl who has a lady-crush on Akari which later turns out to be Yuri. Later on her character gets developed quite a bit and I ended up liking her more than I usually do for those shy, clam girls. While not my favorite character she is definitely up there. Oh yeah she is the Moon, this works well with her relationship to Akari, as she is kinda the opposite to her. Again I really like how they’ve handled the tarot system in this anime.Seira: Is our cold hearted, kuudere character. She is the star and I had the most trouble identifying her with the star tarot. Maybe I don’t know enough about tarot to understand what it means to be the star, but I just couldn’t really pinpoint what her relation was supposed to be.her development was also done well as for all the characters so far, and for everyone who is into kuuderes she is also a good character. I personally couldn’t connect to her that much.Ginka. My personal favorite. She was temperance, being the balanced one. And so was her roll in the show. I think that was the reason I liked her the best, not only did she have the best character design, but also the least polarized personality. She was not super nice all the time, but also not cold or shy. She was, like Akari and Luna - a good representation of her tarot.They did something dumb though towards the end which is a spoiler that I will not include here but I personally thought it was an asspull. If you finished the show you will know what I mean.The rest of the characters all were not super developed but a good addition.And this again leads me to the transition to Madoka.Characters in Madoka were just plain lazy. Most of them got a sloppy background and had almost no development.That’s especially true for Madoka and Homura. And of course Mami…If I would compare the characters I’d say:Madoka = Akari (obviously)Mami = LunaHomura = SeiraKyouko = Ginka (to some extend)Sayaka = No one really, maybe Luna but only to some extendMadoka in Madoka was utterly useless and not much of a protagonist. She rarely solved any problems, and in the end just did the gigantic asspull of an ending.Akari, while also in a same fragile, nice position as Madoka at least developed later and DID THINGS. She actually fought and solved issues without relying on everyone else all the time.Akari > MadokaMami was just cannon fodder had almost no character and overall is my least favorite character (if I can even call her that) in Madoka. Luna on the other hand moved on later, had a development and a background.She supported Akari and had an overall bigger emotional relation to her than Mami had to any of the characters.Luna > MamiHomura was a bit a mix of Luna and Seira if you’d compare them and I think that if you take Luna out of the equation, she was a more interesting character than Seira but had again no development. Her background was also really sloppy.I mean we see why Luna loves Akari, but why is Homura so fucking gay for Madoka? Why would she do all that just for Madoka, their connection was super sloppy and just forced drama.Overall I say Homura > Seirabut Homura < LunaKyouko was a terrible character and her development was rushed and made no sense. Inconsistent character and overall one of the worst in Madoka.Ginka > KyoukoThe only good character in Madoka was Sayaka, because she actually had a personal drama, a development and her ending was tragic because time was invested in her story.The other thing that I thought was way better in Genei was how outside characters were handled.Geneis sidecharacters always did something to progress the plot, to calm the characters down, to help them change. While in Madoka most characters didn’t even have parents. You never say the parents of anyone but Madoka.I mean what was Homura? Was she a hobo orphan? Didn’t she have family? What’s up with that?You saw Sayaka at home but I can’t remember her talking to her family just once.Only Madoka had a mother. And of course the entire world was completely empty in Madoka.There were rarely any side character just that one girl in school who stole Sayakas crush and some nobodies who were possessed by the witches.Lastly is Kyuubey. While I liked Kyuubey, his or her master plan was just fucking retarded. At least the villains in Genei made sense. I mean the evil plan of Cerebrum was not amazing. But it was waaay better than whatever bullshit Urobuchi came up with for Kyuubey.Art and Animation________________________________________Lets face it. Genei looked bad.The overall art wasn’t bad but the animation was sometimes really sloppy. Especially when the animal companions were talking. They just opened their mouth and sound came out. It just looked really awkward.They also used a lot of animation multiple times.And sometimes movements or facial expressions looked awkward.It was only brief moments when the show looked pretty decent, but was overshadowed by a lack of good artistic work.I mean what’s with those character designs? It’s okay to have lolis look like that, but the adults as well? They looked like midgets! Gigantic heads, short bodies and those weird faces with way too big eyes? Holy Moly!Backgrounds sometimes looked not even bad especially in that Parallel Realm thingy, and some demon designs were cool as well. Special effects were not bad either but also not great.I make the comparison to Madoka brief.Akiyuki Shinbo.Akiyuki fucking Shinbo.Without him, Madoka wouldn’t be that popular. Well okay the soundtrack but that later.Madoka had just way better art and animation. While I didn’t like the character designs in Madoka either they were still better. And the backgrounds were really cool as well.But without him I doubt that Madoka would have been that well received.And with him for Genei, the show would have been received much better as well.Sound________________________________________I skip voice acting as it was good as for most shows and go straight to the opening and ending song.Man did I love the opening song. That song is so catchy and my favorite of the Summer season.The ending song was pretty good as well but not so much to my taste.The rest of the soundtrack was pretty good as well. Even if the art and animation wasn’t great the soundtrack was pretty good.But all rather pale compared to Yuki Kajiuras epic soundtrack for Madoka.The other part why Madoka was so popular has to do with how amazing Yuki Kajiura is.But I don’t wanna talk to much about it, because I think the soundtrack for Genei was pretty good as well, and fit the show pretty good.Enjoyment________________________________________Oh well.I was kinda excited for the show to be honest. And I hoped it to be better.Some episodes were pretty lame I think, while others were good or even great.My personal favorite was Lunas story in episode 9. It showed how well the villain can manipulate and had overall good pacing and writing.While I always cringed a bit at the artwork and animation, the soundtrack (especially the opening) kept me well entertained. And by the end I was pretty happy with how the show went.Still sad because I know it could have been better with more time and better art, but still got some enjoyment out of it.That said, I did enjoy Madoka in my first watch more. But the second time I realized some issues, and later I understood the major flaws of it.Scores________________________________________Art and Animation 3/10 (bad)Artstyle +0 (While not everything was bad, it was far from great)Quality -1 (reused animation and awkward faces sometimes)Background +0 (meh backgrounds)Character Designs -1 (just no. Don’t do that)Visual Effects 0 (okay but nothing special.)Sound 7/10Voice Acting +0 (good but not outstanding)Opening and Ending +1 (opening YAY, ending was good as well)Soundtrack +1 (pretty good soundtrack overall)Sound Effects 0 (effective but not outstanding)Story or Content 6/10Premise and Setting +1 (good premise, especially like the tarot card idea)Pacing -1 (downfall of the show, too rushed)Complexity 0 (not everything was explained but I blame the episode count)Plausibility 0 (plotholes were mostly filled)Conclusion +1 (satisfying ending)Characters 6/10Personality +0 (all made sense to their tarot, but still too simple)Behavior and Chemistry +0 (pretty good but not enough for a point)Development and Progression +1 (everyone got developed!)Motivation and Backdrop 0 (while all got a background, the rushed nature didn’t leave enough space for it)Likability 0 (good characters but not very memorable)Enjoyment 5/10Art and Animation -1 (talked about it. Bleh)Sound +1 (likeable)Story and Content 0 (if not rushed it would have been good)Characters 0 (same here)Value +0 (will not remember this too much though)Conclusion________________________________________Genei the “Madoka” clone proved itself to be much more than just a copy. While it has major flaws in both presentation and execution. I think it had much more potential than Madoka.And in the end Madoka is only better in my eyes because of the production value and good execution.5,4 ~5/10 (average)', 'UPDATE: Completed it now. And everything in this review still stands.The review contains some spoilers, past the first two paragraphs.Let me start of by saying that this series is quite bad. Let me explain why.In short, it\'s a series that tries really, really hard to be Madoka, but doesn\'t really understand what made Madoka really good, and thus only imitates it on a surface level - namely, the artstyle and overall dark tone. However, it\'s story and characters are painfully shallow and succumb to all the Mahou Shoujo clichés that Madoka managed to avert.The characters are all Mahou Shoujo stereotypes, through and through. All of...them. Most of all, Seira and Akari - everything about them is predictable and cliché. Luna is also rather cliche, and what happenes to her in episiode 9 was obvious since around episode 6. Ginka is the least cliche of the 4 main characters, but that\'s not saying much - she also gets the least screentime.The villain himself is uninteresting and bland, something we\'ve all seen a hundred times before. By the end, he resorts to basically quoting the Anti-spirals in every second sentence.The story is also really cliche, and essentially a standard Mahou Shoujo story, despite the attempted dark tone. The quasi-lesbian relationships between characters, the slightly-effeminate shape-shifting villain, the Daemonias that feed on people\'s dark emotions, the evil counterparts of the main girls...it\'s all been done before, and done better. Most of it was even done better in older shows like Sailor Moon, which is saying a lot.This anime also has some of the worst pacing and directing I have seen recently.First of all, the cuts between scenes are sometimes incredibly bad. It usually resorts to cutting from a calm, talking scene, straight to an emotionally charged fight scene, with no buildup or interim, and it does so multiple times per episode. That just becomes tiring, and it really shows the lack of direction in the story.Big events and ""twists"" that happen also have no buildup whatsoever, or they just get a tad of obvious foreshadowing. The death of a character in the first episode barely has any buildup, and is not shocking at all, because we barely knew the character, and it was obvious that she was going to get possesed and die. Again, kind of an attempt to ape Madoka - but Madoka had proper buildup to a death that happened in episode 3.Moreover, this anime attempts to fix this in flashbacks that happen later on, and try to give the dead character more depth, but the deed has already been done, and there is no fixing it.The events in later episodes also have little to no buildup. Counterpart Cards just come out of nowhere, as they were not foreshadowed at all, and the events that happen to Ginka seem incredibly rushed.The events of episode 9 also lack any subtlety, because Luna was really underdeveloped as a character. The episode itself tries to cram in as much backstory for her in an attempt to fix that, but fails to do so. All of the twists there were also incredibly obvious, and clichéd - moreover, there was no buildup to them, they just happened. They have the subtlety of, let\'s say, a knife to the stomach.Everything that happenes later is just the same - no buildup, no explanations, no subtlety. Moreover, the anime makes almost everything that happened almost insignificant by the end.All in all...this is just a terrible attempt to copy Madoka, without actually realizing what it was that made Madoka good, past the cutesy-weird artstyle, dark tone, and deaths. Watching this anime almost feels like reading a bad fanfic. Like something an inept child would make after watching Madoka and saying ""I can make a thing like that too!"".The artstyle is nice though, I\'ll give it that. them.

Like something an inept child would make after watching Madoka and saying ""I can make a thing like that too!"".The artstyle is nice though, I\'ll give it that.', 'I\'m going to be sincere, i heard of this anime because everyone on the internet kept saying that it was a ""Madoka Rip-off"". But as i believe you can\'t judge before watching it yourself, i went on and watch it.My conclusion: people really exaggerate, it definitely isn\'t a rip-off. It does have some common grounds, but Genei Wo Kakeru Taiyou has proved to me that it stands as it\'s own series.Genei Wo Kakeru follows the same formula that most Magical Girl shows have, the only difference it\'s that, apart from the grim factor, it handles very mature topics.Each character that is infected by the...villain by accepting a contract with him suffers from a human problem: Jealousy, anger, sadness, isolation... we all have experimented that once, and maybe sometimes, if someone came to us in our darkest moment, and offer as a deal, would we prefer giving up on our humanity in order to punish those who have wronged us? Or maybe give up our souls in order to save the life our best friend?I think we can consider this show to be divided in ""two parts"". The first seven episodes shows us the most exterior part of the conflict, while Akari tries to come into terms with what her job as an Elemental Tarot implies, and she befriends her new teammates.It\'s in episode 8 when we FINALLY get to the real plot and the story takes a very dark (and bloody) twist.I really enjoyed the first 7 episodes, but i believe, as this story is only 14 episodes long, it would have been better if they started introducing the real conflict from the beginning, instead of waiting until half the series and only having a bunch of episodes left to tie everything neatly. They also could have used those first seven episodes more wisely, for example by explaining better more aspects about the Sefiro Fiore, or about the main character themselves. It seemed to me that the only character who had a personal growth through the story was Akari, and only because she was the protagonist. I think there were a lot of missed chances here, but that doesn\'t make this a bad series either.But anyway, i really appreciate the change episode 8 gave to the story, as it made it more interesting to watch... i was enjoying previous episodes but i was starting to get bored.The only thing that bugs me is that there were a lot of things that were left without an explanation. I don\'t know if this means there is going to be a season 2, but i hope they make it, because if not it will always feel that the story is incomplete.In my personal taste, i also didn\'t like the character design... but it wasn\'t bad either, and it\'s only a matter of taste. On the other hand, i really liked the battle scenes and the special effects on the character\'s attacks. Also, Akari\'s hair animation once she transforms is really awesome to watch.But all in all, i found it a really enjoyable series.  I\'m glad this series was able to maintain all the Magical Girl genre\'s essence, but still being able to step a bit more over the line and handle other things that can appeal to older viewers. Don\'t be discourage to watch it by those who criticize it by comparing it to Madoka... i think we should appreciate both series as their own, and be happy that the industry is now opening itself to bring the Magical Girls to a new level, by making content for the older fans. villain by accepting a contract with him suffers from a human problem: Jealousy, anger, sadness, isolation... we all have experimented that once, and maybe sometimes, if someone came to us in our darkest moment, and offer as a deal, would we prefer giving up on our humanity in order to punish those who have wronged us?

Basically, it is unique at first but does not explore its total potential by the end. There are many loose ends not tied up by the end  and many things introduced lack clarification (such as the Daemonia). I found the story to be a bear to watch as it quickly became redundant, focusing on several things only and not answering...many of the viewer\'s questions. I give the story a 4.Art was decent enough, really colorful to suit the magical girl genre but dark when it needed to be. Art doesn\'t normally make a difference to me though unless it\'s horrible. 7 for art.Sound was a bit better than average, it had a good variety of songs, which suited the show\'s ominous tone and cheerful tone accordingly. 6 for sound.Characters were one of the biggest failures for this show. The characters seemed to be very static, and did not develop by the end. Getting over a single traumatic event is not adequate development for 4 characters in 13 episodes, period. For the characters, I cannot avoid writing spoilers, so I will put a mark at the end for all who have not seen the show.*SPOILERS BELOW - SORRY*Akari is a very bland protagonist, timid, not confident, and very concerned about others. As the story progresses, Akari seems to only get over the death of her cousin. Instead of dealing with her hesitation to kill Daemonia, the show glorifies this fault, turning most life-or-death situations into a simple conversation, resulting in the enemy seeming to have a will the sturdiness of paper. She does not gain any mastery over her power, no training is shown, and little is explained about her mother even by the end of the series.Luna is a tsundere friend, which seems to be the only development she gets the whole series. Eventually she gets over her issues, but not really much is explored into her past or circumstances. Not much to say on this character other than mediocre.Seira is the BA cold-hearted character who opens up to the protagonist by the end of the series. She is probably the best developed character in the show, since she gets over her cold-heartedness in multiple ways and seems a much more rounded characters at the end. This mostly occurs during the period in which she loses her powers, where she is forced to face reality and the value of life.Ginka is the ""dumb blonde"" who is fun to be around. She would have been my favorite character, as the development and character interaction leading up to her ""death"" were very well executed, but her return at the end of the show was the biggest BS move I\'ve ever seen. The biggest thing the show had going for it was to show the seriousness of the struggle they were in, and her return was an excuse, not a reason, which resulted in me losing respect for the entire show. Death is a serious matter, and making light of it is an instant failure in my book, no matter the circumstance.Cerebrum is the stereotypical villain: manipulative, secretive, and heartless. Cerebrum was not developed, which loses a huge impact on the viewer for the final confrontation. Whereas a good show makes you invested in all the characters, whether for their defeat or success, Cerebrum is sort of ""just there"" for the majority of the plot, and only serves as a bland ""final boss"" for the girls to face. Once again, the limited and vague descriptions of the dark tarot cards made his actions less meaningful. It\'s like going to a party where everyone has their own lingo and you feel out of place since they don\'t describe it well.*END OF SPOILERS*As for my enjoyment, I found the show to hook me at first, lost me for a couple episodes in the middle, hooked me again near the end, and then smacked me in the face at the end as punishment for watching it through. Needless to say, I did not enjoy the show as much as I\'d hoped. I cannot say I didn\'t enjoy it, but it failed to meet my expectations in many ways. Enjoyment is 3.5 out of 10.Overall, I give the show 4.25, which I\'ve rounded to 4 for the review. The show is just lackluster and mediocre, and fails to live up to the expectations of the viewers. Even without having seen shows like Madoka or Nanoha, the show does not execute its plot well or develop its characters successfully.In conclusion, as I said before, this show is a prime example of not using its full potential. I don\'t give shows scores less than 5 unless I truly do not recommend this anime, so hopefully I dissuade some people from making the decision to sit through the 2 1/2 hours of this. many of the viewer\'s questions.

I don\'t give shows scores less than 5 unless I truly do not recommend this anime, so hopefully I dissuade some people from making the decision to sit through the 2 1/2 hours of this.', ""Daybreak Illusion is a magical girl anime that follows more in the footsteps of the darker “Madoka Magica” than the usual shoujo-oriented ones like “Sailor Moon.” It begins with Taiyou Akari, a young girl with dreams of becoming a fortune teller just like her mother and the other adults around her. She is a bright and cheerful girl with a room full of plants who lives with her cousin Fuyuna’s family since her mother passed away and her father is no longer around either. What she does not realize is that Fuyuna has been building up a burning hatred of Akari and her cheerfulness. One...night, a monster appears and attacks Akari, which turns out to be Fuyuna. Akari hopes it was all just a dream the next day, but soon finds out that no one remembers Fuyuna aside from her, and it now seems as if she never even existed.That’s when Akari is taken and shown her destiny as a magical girl by a teacher at a small fortune telling school (though its real purpose has to do with training magical girls). Akari is thrust rather quickly into the new world in which they harness the power of tarot cards to use magic (her last name [Taiyou] literally means “Sun” so you may be able to guess which card is hers). She meets three other girls named Luna, Seira, and Ginka who are already magical girls who use the power of tarot cards to fight monsters like the one Akari saw before called “Daemonia.” Daemonia take over people who are despairing and, when defeated, erase every trace of that person’s existence from the world (they’re a bit more complicated than that but I’ll avoid spoilers). As the story goes on the girls encounter many different obstacles and personal problems that they have to overcome. There are a few episodes dedicated to the other main characters, but most of the story revolves around Akari and her connection to everything that is going on.The first half of the series is mostly a “slice of life/school/comedy” story with occasional darker borderline-horror moments thrown in mostly during the scenes involving the bizarre looking daemonia. I thought the lighthearted parts early on were extremely boring as they are very simplistic and can be found in many other anime which focus on them much better. But, I really enjoyed some of the darker moments, and I felt these scenes were better executed. They use some surprising tricks to add a little suspense to the darker scenes which is something not a lot of anime have. One of the main problems the story has is that it just never gets around to explaining certain parts of the plot or the characters involved. There is one organization that seems to be overlooking everything that goes on, but the show never gives any explanation for who they, what they are doing, or why there are a cat and crow who are working for this organization but stay at the fortune telling school all the time.While the story has its many ups and downs, the characters are much more consistent……….ly bad. Akari is the least bad of the main characters, but there are several problems that they all suffer from: poor character designs where their fragile-looking bodies (even Seira who works out all the time) are about half the size of their hair, annoyingly high-pitched voices, stereotypical personalities, and hardly any good development over the course of the thirteen episodes. Taiyou Akari is the protagonist and has your typical fire powers. She is usually optimistic but tends to get bogged down at times when thinking about what happened to Fuyuna. Hoshikawa Seira is the “jock” of the group (as I said before, she is as much of a stick figure as everyone else despite working out constantly). She has ice powers, a very reserved personality, and has never been very good at making friends. Shirokane Ginka is a very cheerful girl (more than Akari) who I found to be the most annoying of the group. She also has money powers, and her father is a wealthy businessman. Tsukuyomi Luna is also very reserved but becomes very close to Akari. Her powers (well, really everyone’s) are never really explained much, but it seems like she has some kind of cat powers.The art, like the plot, is filled with ups and downs. The character designs are all  “overly moe” (even the few guys, like Ginka's dad) with large heads, eyes, and hair but very thin bodies. The daemonia get grosser each episode, but the supernatural settings for the fights against them get better (for the most part) each episode. The art of the lighter scenes is boring and mostly moe-ish with the scenery taking place either in their school or in various locations around their town.The soundtrack is the best part of this show. It mostly consists of orchestral themes with a few rock songs like the upbeat OP. During the lighthearted scenes it is mostly unnoticeable, but during the dramatic scenes, the music is often better than the actual events taking place (especially as the plot falls apart later on).Daybreak Illusion is not a very good magical girl show. Many parts of the story are left unexplained, the characters’ designs are unappealing, and the characters’ personalities are bland and unoriginal. The only part that stands out a little is the soundtrack. The show in general is very forgettable and one of the weaker ones I’ve been following this summer season. night, a monster appears and attacks Akari, which turns out to be Fuyuna.

It's only saving graces were, character designs, tarot, ED, and transvestites.The story seems incredibly forced, has pacing issues, unresolved plot points and more.The character designs are extremely tryhard, but it was in a way I quite appreciate.All of the battles were incredibly uninspired, usually revolving around someone getting grabbed suddenlyThe characters had little depth, but they did a half decent job with branching off into some of them...A lot of deus ex machina brought it together as a very uninspired show trying to ride off the coattails of madoka A lot of deus ex machina brought it together as a very uninspired show trying to ride off the coattails of madoka"", 'Okay now, here we have a Persona series clone, merged with some Venus Versus Virus… well, that seemed interesting for me, so I’ve decided to watch this (especially after reading some good reviews, telling me not to think it has connections to Madoka).Story – 5The actual story begins on the eighth episode, and all I can say is it’s pretty twisted and has LOTS of loose ends in it, like the opposite tarot cards having no actual meaning (it it present as something really important and dangerous in the series, but it resulted just in a lost possibility of making cool explanation); I really did...like the first 7 episode, each of them has its own plot and tells us about different people and their feelings… the eighth episode itself is touching and is probably the best in the show, after that all we get is “Humans Versus Shadows”, which is somewhat predictable and… casual.Art – 8Yep, I loved the artwork, the battle scenes were quite something (although they did look like Persona 3’s boss fights mostly…) and the scenery at whole was picturesque and worth seeing. The characters could be drawn better. Much better. All those sample faces again, bad-looking figures… Seira looked pretty, at least, like Konata from Lucky Star. Oh, and the final fight looked insignificant and cheap.Sound – 9If only the story was as good as the sound, I’d have been very happy. OP caused my heart to tremble, the seiyus were doing their best even during the hardest parts… I could understand those people’s feeling very well cause of that fact. I’ve expected more of BGM, and my expectations failed a bit, leaning me disappointed… I gotta listen to the OP song once again.Characters – 3They say there are characters. More than that, they say there are twenty two girls fighting together. As we can see throughout the series, there are actually four, plus two, adding three and two more, making it 9. The characters are cliché, even the main four. Well, I liked Ginka’s style of fighting with money ([C] anime will teach you on that). Akari is a way inconsistent and is yet another a-girl-that-makes-the-world-go-round, but no complaints on this one. The antagonist seemed interesting and having a reasonable goal, but… They also say there are some mysterious beings observing the scene and moving their pawn like in a chess game, but we did not happen to see them. We oughta believe that they exist… what a pain, no more twists please.Enjoyment – 9Regardless of the bad points, this anime got my attention, and it probably will come to liking for you. Why? It’s about cute girls fighting viru… errr, I mean Daemonia, they face RELLY serious obstacles, mostly psychological and emotional, they think on what’s being right or wrong, they hang out and have some spare time… Yet it has blood, minor gore and almost NSFW content… If only the plot was more interesting…Overall – 7It was my fault I didn’t notice this anime while it was still airing… I’ve acquired a bunch of wonderful memories of it upon watching, and I could bear the weaknesses (even have agreed with the ending, whoa); it may not be the best anime ever, but it is not inferior either, my verdict – recommended to watch, especially if you are into magical girls (Madoka ^^),Tarot cards or exploring ones’ hearts. like the first 7 episode, each of them has its own plot and tells us about different people and their feelings… the eighth episode itself is touching and is probably the best in the show, after that all we get is “Humans Versus Shadows”, which is somewhat predictable and… casual.Art – 8Yep, I loved the artwork, the battle scenes were quite something (although they did look like Persona 3’s boss fights mostly…) and the scenery at whole was picturesque and worth seeing.

Why did it have to turn out like this?Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou is the prime example of how not to do a dark magical girl anime- No scratch that. Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou is the prime example of how not to do anime collectively. It's not absolutely dreadful, but it should have never turned out how it is.The anime has a collection of six actually good episodes, where there's emotions and development that seem realistic. And then there's the rest of the anime, which is unable to decide what it wants to do with...itself as it hoplessly meanders through the plot, trying to grab as many plot points and characters as it can but only getting the most minimal grasp. That's not even mentioning all the down to earth, heavy, real-life topics featured here, like pedophilia, rape, possibly off-screen sibling complexes and the idea of sacrificing one for the good of many.Except none of those - sans the last- are done as a problem in the narrative. Instead they're plot points that are addressed as some kind of twisted romance between the characters- Actively sexualizing and objectifying twelve year olds for the sake of what is played as making the antagonist seem disgusting, but is really just gross fanservice.The sound design is okay, but the only things that are really memorable are the OP, Traumerei and the ED, Mirage. The only really memorable voice acting comes from Seira's seiyuu, who seems to have a penchant for blue haired magical girls. The art can be really nice, especially in the Opening, where the animation is truly at it's best, along with Episode 8, which probably does the best job of all the episodes. In a thirteen episode show, mind you. The story started out nicely, and the concept really could have gone somewhere, but then they decided they wanted to be the new Madoka Magica and it all went down hill from there.I personally really enjoyed watching the show, whenever I didn't question anything and pretended there wasn't as much fanservice as there was. All in all, DayBreak Illusion was okay at best and really awful at worst. It's actually worth the watch- if you have absolutely nothing better to spend your time on, and chances are, you probably do. It's not nearly the worst but when it comes to choices, your time is better spent elsewhere. itself as it hoplessly meanders through the plot, trying to grab as many plot points and characters as it can but only getting the most minimal grasp.

All the magical girls who discovered to be a power connected to a card from the Tarot deck are gathered in a fake Divination School, in which they are trained to...fight against this beings, and all of them, apart from the main protagonist, Akari, seem to have  any problem in doing this work mainly because all of them have a purpose in doing it, or at least doesn't care much about it. For Akari is different, for reasons that I can't explain without ruining the pleasure to watch the show. The thing that make this show look like Madoka is the fact that tricks you into thinking that it will go into a certain direction, watching the first half of the series, but then at the end you can say that this show it's quite a different thing, fortunately. (Or unfortunately, it depends on the expectations of the viewer).Art: 7/10The character design might take a little while to be get used to, because of the very sproportioned bodies that only the girls seems to have and their quite funny hairstyles, but I think it suits this kind of show very well. The artwork of landscapes and buildings is very rich, instead.Sound: 8/10OP and ED are really quite something, very very powerful ones, that you cannot absolutely skip. They're worth watching the show, in my opinion. The rest of the OST is very epic in the battle scenes, while in other moments is rather forgettable.Character: 7/10At the beginning of the show, I have to say that I found quite difficult to empatize to the main protagonist, Akari, and the other co-protagonists, Seira, Luna and Ginka, because they look like stereotyped ones. Episode by episode we get to know them better, and while their development remains unfortunately rushed, at least the viewer learns how to like almost all of them, and the relationship between them. Some of the others characters, like Ezia and Ariel, are really left behind, and nothing is really explained about their past. Same thing for the main evil character, Cerebrum.Enjoyment: 7/10Apart from other consideration about the story and how it's been developed, I have to say that I've quite enjoy this show; it will never enter the list of my own personal favourites, but I've liked it, mainly because it wasn't full of fanservice and easy to follow.Overall: 7/10Many things are left unsaid, and that's a bad thing, for the full comprehension of the story. It deserves another season, to at least explain more about what really Daemonia are and where they come from, same thing about the organization who controls the deeds of the magical girls, called Leguzario. fight against this beings, and all of them, apart from the main protagonist, Akari, seem to have  any problem in doing this work mainly because all of them have a purpose in doing it, or at least doesn't care much about it.

My thoughts gravitate toward different ends of the opinion spectrum. Hmm. Well, I’ll begin by saying that I did enjoy this series for what it was: in essence, a magical girl series with dark elements and an interesting take on tarot cards. The characters are colorful (figuratively and literally) and develop in their own ways throughout the span of 13 episodes. The scenery and overall art of the show is colorful and vibrant. The general idea of the story is kind of cool with a few interesting concepts. The show has no problems with setting an atmosphere with an overall serious...tone (with a few comedic elements here and there). And of course, it’s generally entertaining.I do, however, have some problems with the show. I feel like this series had (and maybe still has if we get another season) a lot of potential what with several really interesting story attributes and concepts being introduced, but it falls short of that potential by rushing everything into 13 episodes without properly explaining (or explaining at all) much of anything, leaving many ideas up in the air. You’re kind of just tugged around, expected to accept everything as is without knowing all of what you’re accepting. On top of this, many additional questions aren’t answered, and some things are just left messed up. In summary, one might consider this a case of horrible pacing issues. And that’s really the gist of it. Spread the series out into several more episodes, address everything properly, and and don’t attempt to throw in a bunch of ideas if the only thing that will be done is rushing to show off templates of ideas rather than being concise and coherent (i.e. actually making it a point to tell me and not just tease me), and I think there’d be a solid story with no plot holes to fill. Great ideas, poor execution. Beyond this, the only other things I didn’t like were some of the predictable, conventional plot devices which gave the show a mediocre feel at points. But I think this also ties into pacing since, well, when you’re rushing things, you tend to sweep under the rug rather than actually clean up.Overall, I liked the series. It was a fun watch, and I don’t feel like time was wasted. Another unique series added to my roster of what I’ve seen. If you like magical girl series, I think it’s worth a watch, at least for its entertainment value and intriguing (albeit not fully executed) ideas.P.S. To those familiar with Puella Magi Madoka Magica, this might immediately seem like a “rip off” of the series. In my humble opinion, I will say it’s definitely influenced by Madoka, but is still pretty different. Rather, I think Madoka Magica popularized if not started a certain trend of including dark elements in the magical girl subgenre of anime. Regardless, I think if you like Madoka, you’ll appreciate this. I sure did. tone (with a few comedic elements here and there).

Regardless, I think if you like Madoka, you’ll appreciate this. I sure did.', 'Ah, another one of those dark mahou shoujo that try to cash in from the fad Madoka Magica created with its hype and financial success. Although it does a fine job at having polarized imagery of happy moeblobs on one hand and creepy murderous monsters on the other, it still fails to accomplish the thing that actually made Madoka Magica such a hit. Which one is that you may wonder? Could it be the deep characterization? The elaborate storytelling? The amazing analysis of its various themes? HELL NO, that show sucked in all that.… It was the production values, ok?AIC is no SHAFT. They can’t...throw a mountain of money at it, nor do they have overrated anime creators in their disposal to hype the damn thing six months before it even begins to air. And this is why despite all the good efforts the artwork of Gen’ei doesn’t look very good and the soundtrack is just ok at best. The character designs are practically laughable and the motions during battles are very crude. The action bits that SHOULD feel epic for the build-up they get, end up being nothing but a random line of magic attacks with no real strategy and an excuse for the heroine to use the power of friendship.Anyways, as a stand-alone show it is not bad but sure becomes sort of repetitive in its plot very soon. Some person is lured to the dark side, turns to monster, does bad things, and the girls are sent to kill it. The theme of how you are willing to do murder in order to fulfill your deepest desires can be interesting but not when it is done in an episodic manner. Every episode is essentially 15 minutes of fuzzy slice of life, followed by 5 minutes of photo-epileptic battles full of gore and death around people we will never see again. It is hard to get attached to any of the characters since every conflict is resolved in the very episode it is created. Also, they resort to that stupid amnesia gimmick where the monsters and the victims of the monsters are erased from everybody’s memories. Their deaths are treated as accidents, which is a cheap way to maintain the status quo but also removes the drama from the setting. And sure, the main characters, the mahou shoujo themselves, remember everything but even they seem to get over it by the next episode.Once again the main heroine ends up being the most basic and dull of them all, constantly trying to reason with the monsters and save everybody with the power of love and all that crap. It doesn’t work to the most part (thank God) but it still makes you wonder why they even have her in the demon busting team. She constantly refuses to fight, which results to many lives being endangered, hers included. I mean I would understand if they kept her in the sidelines until she gains experience; but moving her from JUST GOT SUPERPOWERS straight to FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE is overkill and helps nobody in the longrun.I am also not fond of themes that are rubbed in your face, something which all dark mahou shojo do. They end up having depressing stuff along with cute moeblobs in order to manipulate emotions in the most obvious and lazy of methods. In case you have watched Blood C, Black Rock Shooter, or Symphogear, you will recognize that unsettling feeling of the uncanny valley. Now it’s cute. WHAM. Now it’s gory. WHAM. Now it’s loli fan service. And yes, that is too an issue in case you don’t take pleasure in watching naked moeblobs with squirrel voices for a few minutes before blood starts splattering all over the screen.What I do like a lot though is the attention they gave to slowly explain what is going on. The monsters have motivations, and the magic comes from an explained source, something which beats having no real reason than being evil and having magic. It is also not trolling you to think it is a fluffy show for 3 episodes before it throws in someone important dying. In those departments, it blows Madoka Magica out of the water. The problem still remains though; the drama and conflicts are piss poor and rushed, always resolved with brute force and mind control. Nothing matters past the episode it takes place in.The show is not bad in overall but lacks tremendously in tension. Despite being dark and violent, you just can’t get into it when they throw lolicon fan service amongst silly drawn characters and expect you to gasp at the tragedies they face before they forget them in 5 minutes. So in the long run it fails to be something actually memorable and poignant. Hell, I can even throw in the fact that Madoka also worked because most had never seen a deconstruction of the genre before, so they were taken by surprise. The same trick will never work with any show that tries to pull the same rabbit out of the same hat so soon. And boy, does this hat look ugly by now. throw a mountain of money at it, nor do they have overrated anime creators in their disposal to hype the damn thing six months before it even begins to air. And this is why despite all the good efforts the artwork of Gen’ei doesn’t look very good and the soundtrack is just ok at best. The character designs are practically laughable and the motions during battles are very crude. The action bits that SHOULD feel epic for the build-up they get, end up being nothing but a random line of magic attacks with no real strategy and an excuse for the heroine to use the power of friendship.Anyways, as a stand-alone show it is not bad but sure becomes sort of repetitive in its plot very soon. Some person is lured to the dark side, turns to monster, does bad things, and the girls are sent to kill it. The theme of how you are willing to do murder in order to fulfill your deepest desires can be interesting but not when it is done in an episodic manner. Every episode is essentially 15 minutes of fuzzy slice of life, followed by 5 minutes of photo-epileptic battles full of gore and death around people we will never see again. It is hard to get attached to any of the characters since every conflict is resolved in the very episode it is created. Also, they resort to that stupid amnesia gimmick where the monsters and the victims of the monsters are erased from everybody’s memories. Their deaths are treated as accidents, which is a cheap way to maintain the status quo but also removes the drama from the setting. And sure, the main characters, the mahou shoujo themselves, remember everything but even they seem to get over it by the next episode.Once again the main heroine ends up being the most basic and dull of them all, constantly trying to reason with the monsters and save everybody with the power of love and all that crap. It doesn’t work to the most part (thank God) but it still makes you wonder why they even have her in the demon busting team. She constantly refuses to fight, which results to many lives being endangered, hers included. I mean I would understand if they kept her in the sidelines until she gains experience; but moving her from JUST GOT SUPERPOWERS straight to FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE is overkill and helps nobody in the longrun.I am also not fond of themes that are rubbed in your face, something which all dark mahou shojo do. They end up having depressing stuff along with cute moeblobs in order to manipulate emotions in the most obvious and lazy of methods. In case you have watched Blood C, Black Rock Shooter, or Symphogear, you will recognize that unsettling feeling of the uncanny valley. Now it’s cute. WHAM. Now it’s gory. WHAM. Now it’s loli fan service. And yes, that is too an issue in case you don’t take pleasure in watching naked moeblobs with squirrel voices for a few minutes before blood starts splattering all over the screen.What I do like a lot though is the attention they gave to slowly explain what is going on.

I thought the story was slightly interesting, there wasn\'t alot of development except the story being centered around the main character being able to hear the voices of the ""daemonia"" and the girls fighting these daemonia. Although I initially found the story interesting, it turned a little repetitive and...was slow to speak.ART:The art in DBI isn\'t exactly bad, the character designs in general were fairly cute before turning into a more serious style of animation whilst they were fighting which I thought was great. The animation wasn\'t the most memorable but it wasn\'t the worst I\'ve ever seen.SOUND:The sound in the anime wasn\'t too memorable or enjoyable although the opening in my opinion was pretty good. The background music wasn\'t the most fantastic but it suited some of the fight scenes well.CHARACTERS:The characters weren\'t the most interesting although I\'d compliment the producers on balancing the personality types well.

What little originality this series does contain comes from its Tarot Card Reading theme which doesn't effect the progression of the series as much as you might think. Day Break Illusion can be exciting at times and deliver emotional scenes here and there but overall, it's a disappointment. Not a failure but a disappointment. Everything is actually really predictable except for what happens to Luna or the information dump in episode eleven. Day Break Illusion's story is centered...around young girls who are called upon to sacrifice themselves and save the world as magical girls. In the beginning that was actually well performed, with each girl finding their own way to overcome or ignore the fact that they're basically executioners but we needed an antagonist to really get the ball rolling. Too bad that we literally never figure out why the antagonist (Cerebrum) does what he does until the last two episodes. Cerebrum was such a poorly executed villain, I felt that this show might have actually been better if the producer left him out, let the Daemonia appear as the creatures that naturally exist and focus on the girls mental and emotional development during their times as magical girls. This is just one of the reasons why Madoka Magica managed to be such a hit.Day Break Illusion tries way to hard to be Madoka Magica and that becomes incredibly noticeable after the first episode onward. After 12 episodes, you will finally know what Cerebrum is after and you'll most likely bust out laughing or facepalm because it's just plain stupid. This series really seems to give nothing to you but questions and the few answers that are given are either silly or seriously late for you to even care. Despite how disappointing Day Break Illusion it's not all bad I guess. The battle scenes between the magical girls and Daemonia are actually enjoyable but the animation makes some parts of the fight unrecognizable.Day Break Illusion's cast is made up of your average group of magical girls; the optimist, the tomboy, the joker and the weakling. The girl's primarily survive through the power of friendship and it's just so cheesy, I felt like I should of been eating mac and cheese while watching this series. Day Break Illusion gets points for action and disturbing atmosphere but not much else. around young girls who are called upon to sacrifice themselves and save the world as magical girls.

They should be taken on their own merit, and are definitely worth your time.Others, like Day Break Illusion, will suck you into a dark and imaginative world...then hit you over the head with a baseball bat studded with nails.As usual for my reviews, I must include a SPOILER WARNING.  It\'s been 2 years, so if you want...a better and more comprehensive review, check out the others, which were probably written at the time of airing.  I can and will complain about the ending.  You have been WARNED.Still here?  Good.  Let\'s begin.Day Break Illusion takes a lot from PMMM\'s playbook.  It differentiates itself enough by changing the monster specifics and introducing some interesting questions with the origins of its magical system.  You enjoy uncovering the mysteries of this world, the relationships between characters, and the ultimate implications behind both the villain and the evil power they wield.You know what you don\'t enjoy?  SEEING A CHARACTER BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD FOR NO F***ING REASON JUST FOR A HAPPY ENDING!This anime has an identity crisis.  It wants to introduce elements like a mysterious corrupt celestial council, a death penalty mechanic, and social hatred of the heroes, but ultimately is caught between two roads:Does it want to be a ""monster of the week"" anime?Or does it want to tell a cohesive story?Day Break Illusion can\'t choose.  It spends a solid 3 episodes without any plot, and as a result crams the rest into the other 10.  It\'s oddly paced, and has no closure.Why, then, do I want a sequel?I\'m serious, I want a sequel.  Too many questions are left unanswered, too many plot threads go nowhere.  I want, I CRAVE, some kind of closure.  It\'s probably not going to happen, but I want it nonetheless.  This show made me INVESTED, and that\'s an important thing for any anime: that you wish to continue watching.  And boy, do I wish I had more to watch.  I suppose that\'s a point in the show\'s favor.Even if I got my sequel, however, two problems still exist at this show\'s core concepts.Number one is the monster mechanics.  You see, the monsters that our heroes fight are humans possessed by an evil set of tarot cards.  Our heroes wield the light side, and the dark side sends out thousands of copies of themselves to kill and destroy.  There is no known way to cure a possession, so our heroes must kill these innocents in the line of fire.  Pretty harsh, right?  Our heroes are actually executioners.  It makes for some excellent drama, right?Maybe.  Killed humans don\'t die, they\'re ERASED FROM EXISTENCE.  No one remembers them except for the tarot card wielders....No, it\'s NOT horrifying.  It\'s dramatically bankrupt.Sure, our heroes feel bad about making somebody go bye-bye, but since that person no longer exists, we don\'t get to see any effects of their missing presence on other people.  The weight of murder is lessened by the fact that there are no crying loved ones, no consequences to this loss of life.  Killing a monster, and the innocent person trapped inside, brings a feeling of...""Meh, another one bites the dust.""That\'s not okay.You know what\'s also not okay?  Going against the established rules of your universe.There are 14 cards in the standard tarot.  There are 14 heroes who wield the 14 cards.  Every card has a dark counterpart.Day Break Illusion decides to raise the stakes by introducing a ""no light without dark"" mechanic.  If a dark tarot is destroyed, the light tarot is also destroyed, like matter and antimatter.  That\'s cool, right?!  It introduces a death penalty, and a moral dilemma.  If the heroes ever want to save the world, they must also leave it without heroes.  Do they simply treat the symptoms, or cure the disease at the cost of their own lives?According to the last episode, neither!  You can just defeat the dark tarot without dying yourself through the power of FRRRRRRRIEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNDSHIIIIIIIIIIIIP!!!.........GODFREAKINGDAMMIT.Why would you do this, Illusion?!  Why would you OBLITERATE any sense of consistency by removing such an amazing death penalty with no explanation?!I\'m serious!  During the entire fight with one of the dark tarot, the hero in question magically receives the exact same wounds as their counterpart.  They KILL each other, and it\'s an awesome wham moment.Then at the end of the series it\'s just like:""We\'re going to be trapped here in this rift in reality, stabbing each other in the chest, for all eternity.  You can\'t hurt anyone ever again!  I accept my fate-""""I\'m telling you not to give up despite believing that you\'re already deeeead!""""Welp, can\'t stay here, my friends are in trouble.  GOTTA GO \'KAY THANKS BYE!""""Wait, shouldn\'t you killing me also kill you-OH GOD IT BURNS YOU\'RE ALSO DESTROYING THE VIEWER\'S SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEEEEEEEEEEEEEFFF...""What the F***.So, should you watch this show?  Ehhhh...I give it a solid shrug of indifference.  The character style is bright and colorful compared to the monsters, which are strange and cool looking even if it doesn\'t go full artsy collage-style like PMMM.  The opening and ending songs are amazing.  Finally, it tries to humanize and develop its characters, even if it does fall flat.  It has some good ideas, but doesn\'t know how to use them, and is engaging all the way up to the finale.  I genuinely enjoyed it, even if it all got ruined in the end.

You\'ll just have to make your own choice on it.', 'Horror comes from inside and is directed inside. People who want to kill us are quite scary, but they’re a very specific problem. True horror is in realizing that we can be the killers, that we can be what we hate. It throws a big wrench in our grand narrative and shatters it to pieces. That’s why we limit our consciousness, assume the patriarchy or the media or the government is to blame for it all. Negative feelings are bad, but the true problem must be outside us.Obvious comparisons to Madoka spring up, but these are superficial comparisons. The latter is more existential and philosophical,...less concerned with the emotions of its characters and relying more on structure and mechanics to deliver its philosophical idea. Daybreak Illusion is far more emotional, fantastical and wild. Each character has distinct demeanor, it has many arcs which peek into other people’s lives and the main subject matter is emotion, not the grand meaning of life.With that aside, let’s focus on what’s actually going on here, something deeper than how ‘logical’ the story is. Cliched stories that flood your cinema have an external evil. These are comfortable fantasies. The bad is always outside of us. We need to kill it. Some of them improve and we can converse with these evil, but it’s still outside. The third stage is recognizing something inside of us is evil, but an external thing brings it out. The fourth, and most horrifying stage, is realizing that each of us partakes in the conspiracy against the human race.Daybreak Illusion belongs in the third category, which is a weird one. Stories that reach there are aware of theme exploration, that their story shouldn’t just give us a good time with pretty visuals. You can’t reach that stage without trying to be deep. The anime really wants to be more, not just a copy of Madoka but to compete against it and expand on the genre. It does that fine enough, but not good enough.Daemonia are the big evil, but they’re amplifiers of already-present negative emotions. Yet by pushing the source of the bad outside, the series isolates it and doesn’t explore their issues too deeply. Many of the characters become ‘not themselves’ when the Daemonia take over, but that’s just avoiding the horror. The horror is realizing that the bad side is just as a part of ourselves as the good side.The series is always close to truly delving into the depths of emotion, but never getting there. A climatic conflict does it the best, showing how we’re responsible to each other. Main character finds herself needing to actually face another person’s emotions, and digging inside of her to find out what she really feels. It’s an interesting position to put the main character in, but it doesn’t solve the big conflict. All ends with a big Final Boss Fight full of flashing lights and explosions.In the most of the arcs though, the victims are just innocent people who are tempted by the devil. By the time they start their rampage, they’re supposedly ‘not themselves’. The escape from horror isn’t deliberate. Our heroes talk to the Daemonia and are frigthened by the fact that these are people. In a way, by showing us that these distorted monsters are still actually human beings, we’re supposed to be all the more horrified by our negative feelings. Yet this doesn’t work, since these Daemonia too end up too alien from us, their cause being external. People transform into monsters because something infected them, not because they made decisions (or were born in environments) that turned them into monsters.For the characters in the story these people are real enough, even when they come looking like man-eating plants. What it does better than Madoka is showing the journey and emotional development of heroes caught in the midst of a cosmic battle. Characters actually have a will and their reactions to the events. If in the first episodes the anime seems aimless, it’s only because it really tells the story of these girls and nothing else. Any time the story loses its direction is when it sways from it.Although these characters aren’t particularly deep, they’re given distinct views about the battle, the world and what they get from it. In the first few episodes the anime actually threatens to improve on Madoka, since it’s far more in touch with what kind of dilemmas and conflicts would arise in this situation. Of course it uses Monster of the Week format, because anything else is a distraction. At its most exciting, we see them clashing and arguing and talking about what they’re going through. How it feels like to be the hero is where the excitement lies.The drop in quality comes later. Suddenly we get a more rigid structure and a main villain. Already in the beginning we had some meaningless technobabble, but it avoided getting technical. Battle ended when there was no emotions left to explore in that conflict. The final conflict also ends thanks to the heroes reaching a conclusion, deciding to rebel against their own fate. Yet we don’t actually see them reaching this conclusion.A trait of messy anime, especially those with huge epic stories and wacky art styles is that they have a slew of themes and they don’t know which one to focus on, or even which one fit their structure. First the anime start with exploring how negative emotions get the best of us, how the evil is supposed to be inside of us. Then this is thrown away, not completely resolved and instead out of nowhere the girls are fighting against fate.Now, if the series had something to say about emotional determinism it would be fine. Exploring the conflict of will and choice is the next big thing, since so far we all agree we can’t control our emotions. The whole idea of fate comes from the Tarot, though, not because the series wanted to explore it in the first place. Messy structures tend to arise naturally from theme-focused anime, but here it’s because the show couldn’t focus on its ideas.At least on the surface it works well enough. As a simple heroic story, I’d take this over many others. Even if its exploration is shallow, it gains from it enough emotional weight. These battles matter. We see the characters going through something during these moments of violence and how their psyche is affected. It’s not just ‘beat up those deamons and get some shwarma’. It hasn’t reached the heights it’s aiming for, but it’s still an exciting story with great visuals. For some, that’s enough.3 daemonia out of 5 less concerned with the emotions of its characters and relying more on structure and mechanics to deliver its philosophical idea.

The final conflict also ends thanks to the heroes reaching a conclusion, deciding to rebel against their own fate. Yet we don’t actually see them reaching this conclusion.A trait of messy anime, especially those with huge epic stories and wacky art styles is that they have a slew of themes and they don’t know which one to focus on, or even which one fit their structure. First the anime start with exploring how negative emotions get the best of us, how the evil is supposed to be inside of us. Then this is thrown away, not completely resolved and instead out of nowhere the girls are fighting against fate.Now, if the series had something to say about emotional determinism it would be fine. Exploring the conflict of will and choice is the next big thing, since so far we all agree we can’t control our emotions. The whole idea of fate comes from the Tarot, though, not because the series wanted to explore it in the first place. Messy structures tend to arise naturally from theme-focused anime, but here it’s because the show couldn’t focus on its ideas.At least on the surface it works well enough. As a simple heroic story, I’d take this over many others. Even if its exploration is shallow, it gains from it enough emotional weight. These battles matter. We see the characters going through something during these moments of violence and how their psyche is affected. It’s not just ‘beat up those deamons and get some shwarma’. It hasn’t reached the heights it’s aiming for, but it’s still an exciting story with great visuals. For some, that’s enough.3 daemonia out of 5', ""Being a fan of Madoka Magica, I was looking for another dark mahou shoujo anime to get into. When I came across Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou it was described as a very dark mahou shoujo that hit hard and had no reservations. I was a little skeptical that it might just be an attempt to jump on the hype of Madoka Magica but I gave it a try. What I didn't expect was for the first episode to hit me like a semi truck with the grim nature of the magical girls and their fight against the Daemonia. As I watched, I was drawn in...by the unabashed chuun, the unique tarot card based approach to magical girls' abilities, and the unusual characterization of some members of the cast and their families, including the main heroine Akari Taiyou. Some other characters were not as original but were strong enough to support the narrative and undergo interesting character development themselves.I like Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou because it goes all out to create a dark and chuuni mahou shoujo story and I believe it holds up on its own. It pulls no punches in its grim story and bloody battles, and the characters' development is both natural and important to their growth. The end goal is in my opinion the weakest point, being somewhat rushed at the end of the show's running, and is more shallow than most other conflicts throughout. Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou did a good job of making me despise the antagonist, as they acted purely evil for the sake of evil, but gave very little in the way of revealing their humanity or motivation like they did for random Daemonia.Overall I give Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou 8/10 for its unique approach to magical girls, unapologetic chuun, and its very fun dark and brutal battles. by the unabashed chuun, the unique tarot card based approach to magical girls' abilities, and the unusual characterization of some members of the cast and their families, including the main heroine Akari Taiyou.

I will try not to write any spoilers, but they may end up happening without me even realizing it.READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.Story: (8)For a 13 episode, it was a very enjoyable series. It was unique in its own sense; it basically was a happier version of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika. If you haven\'t seen that anime, it\'s basically a darker version of this one. This anime is a bit happier with a happier ending. All the episodes had a flow to them even when they were on an...episode that wasn\'t about the main prodigy. They told each story of the individual stories of Akari, Seria, Luna and Ginka without going all over the place like some anime do. The plot was well placed throughout the whole series, meaning; They didn\'t just put the point of the series in the first two episodes, they kept it flowing and built up to it. I did have mixed feelings on the end; I wanted a bit more information on certain subjects in the series and on certain characters, and it kind of left it hanging a bit on how it ended. Not to the point where you would be upset with the series. It was just left to the point that they could have made another season, but if they decided not too you wouldn\'t be completely devastated.Art: (9)The art was great; I found it unique, funny and inspiring. You had certain characters/scenes that the artist made that were unique, and then others that were more simple and had ""odd"" proportions, but was still enjoyable to watch. The color scheme through the whole series, with each episode was well put together, and blended into each character as ""their"" color.As I said in my ""story"" section in certain scenes it reminds you a lot of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika and also Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. When they go into a fighting scene the art style changes, not a bad change, but it definitely something that reminds me of those two animes. Including since the art style does change for the fighting scenes.Sound: (10)I give sound a 10 because the only knowledge that I would have on this, is if the characters voices matched with how the characters personality is and also the background music. So that said, the actors who voiced the characters were spot on; I hardly have found an anime in Japanese where the characters voice was way off. The background music was done really well; it didn\'t overpower in any of the scenes.Characters: (9)Characters in this series had flaws, had strengths, none were in the whole ""god mode I\'m awesome"" phase. They all had battles with their ""inner-demons"" and I feel they expressed them and overcame them or how they come to terms with it was really well done. The only issues that I had was, they had great character development and stories for the 4 main characters(Akari, Seria, Luna and Ginka), but I wish I could have heard the back story on some of the other characters. Now with that being said, being only a 13 episode series and it having not just 1 or 2 main characters, it would be rather difficult to shove all the characters back stories into 13 episodes. With all the events that happened, it does leave a lot of questions about certain minor characters in the series, and also the people they answer too and what is happening with that. Of course with the manga the answer may have been answered, I never read it so I wouldn\'t be able to comment on that part, but with just watching the series it did leave me with questions.Enjoyment: (9)I enjoyed this anime. I would recommend it, it\'s most definitely an anime that will leave you with questions, but it leaves you also okay with not having them answered. ? If that makes any sense. If you\'ve seen Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika I would suggest watching this anime, it is a happier version of it. It will make you giggle at times, and you catch an understanding and connection with a lot of the characters. All the characters have a sad story and how they got to where they are and it leaves them with many flaws, which the main ""villain"" tries to use against them. Which most people can relate too.Side Note: Sorry for the length, it is my second time writing a review. I\'m practicing at trying to write better reviews.

Even though they're only emulating the more superficial aspects of the acclaimed Madoka Magica and don't often have a superb story to offer, they can still be greatly entertaining. Unfortunately, this was not the case for me with Day Break Illusion.Story: 3/10The story starts off as a semi-interesting Madoka clone but all of the potential for an interesting outcome is wasted and it just devolves into an incredibly generic friendship story that's masked by its attempts at being...dark. And me personally, I'll watch dark, depressing, gory, etc shows even if they lack any real depth to them because it can still be entertaining, but the darkness and drama in this show isn't even that good! The show utterly fails at creating an interesting atmosphere for the dark events to take place in, thus I ended up pretty much feeling nothing most of the time, not even amusement.Art: 5/10Well, I'll give them credit for trying to have unique character designs, but at the end of the day they're nothing special. The art isn't really bad, but it's not that good either. Maybe a few interesting moments here and there.Sound: 6/10The opening theme is rather nice. Other than that, it's a very average soundtrack altogether. Sometimes, the music doesn't convey the emotion of what's happening on screen to the characters though, which goes back to my criticism of the show's lack of atmosphere.Characters: 4/10Very generic group of characters, a small amount of which are borderline unlikable. The story really goes downhill once it starts centering around these generic characters. The show's plot eventually devolves into a generic group of friends trying to rescue their friend from a generic asshole of a villain who serves little other purpose than to be evil and talk about how pathetic and weak humans are.Enjoyment: 4.5/10This show wasn't terrible, but it was a disappointment. It was just barely good and interesting enough for me to finish it. The action scenes are very average, I couldn't become invested in the characters, and a story that was interesting at the start very quickly became something predictable. I didn't go in expecting this to be even close to as good as Madoka Magica, but I was hoping for perhaps another very solid piece of entertainment in the vein of Magical Girl Raising Project. In the end, Day Break Illusion can't even hold a candle to that show though.My overall score will be 4/10. How much can I recommend this show? Well, if you're looking to watch as much magical girl anime as possible and don't mind the dark stuff, this show isn't unwatchable. Even as someone who likes the more generic dark magical girl shows, I found this one kind of underwhelming, but if you're the same way you MIGHT be able to enjoy it more than me.

This series is a guide for not make a dark maho shojo.For those peoples what criticizes Puella Magi Madoka Magica for contain ""lazy characters""... in Daybreak Illusion finds the true definition for lazy characters. That\'s not joke: the name, the design and dressing is a memorandun of the tarot title for each girl. The personalities are boring and lazy. Is hard empathize with several main characters, with exception of Ginka.The villain is a idiot. Why he don\'t know that could corrupt tarot users? Why don\'t idealize a better plan for mate...with Akari having a temible power in your hands? Come on: he could transforms in any male/female character or expect that she have 16 years old for this! The script is very bad.The only good character and thing enjoyable in the series is Ginka\'s father, because he isn\'t a idiot character, he is a good example of father in the anime series...I don\'t recommend Daybreak. Is a bad and unconsistent anime with Deus ex Machinas, unconsistent rhythm and a boring characters. with Akari having a temible power in your hands?

Just confidence boost? Cameo?).We will probably also never know if Sefiro Fiore (the organization\'s name) intentions are truly good or evil, at it seems they are helping humanity for their own amusement...urgh.It feels like the series builds a great, gloomy and steady atmosphere, then suddenly goes insane and throws everything to the window and gives you a happy treatment pill.Overall,the story was passable, but could have been way better. I don\'t dislike happy endings, if they were done on a plausible way.Art:Artwork is good most of the time and tries really hard to keep it consistent that way. Most anime series show an evident drop of quality passing episode 2- and beyond till the final episode, but i never felt this happened here.Just as an observation, the girls height varies in chapters: sometimes you see them looking around the height of a elementary/Junior high girl, and suddenly they look like they are on their late teens. This alternates on the girls transformed forms as well. Oddly, i thought the late teen forms where more suitable for the show plot...Backgrounds are okay, but the alternate dimension backgrounds are kind of dull (Void, stars, barrens giving a sad empty feeling).I really liked the girls transformations artwork, specially Akari and Seira\'s forms (Ginka was meh at best).Most of the abilities and powers are well made (Specially Ginka\'s Armory and the Solar Rapier from Akari). The last boss form is bad at best.Sound:Overall Good. Both the opening and ending theme are really good and the seiyuus match the characters they represent.Extra points to the triplets voice as they were cute.Character:You definitely can\'t blame the girls for being most of the time moody, angry, depressed or scared about what\'s going on with them. They are young girls that they were forc-...convinced to battle monsters rather than going to school and have a happy life overall:Akari rather than being the ""sunny, bright and lovable"" person that many characters suggest, she is most of the time gloomy, worried or anxious during the series.Seira is the cool, calm and collected girl that due her past with the Daemonia, she slays them without concern or fear. Hates the Daemonia with passion and hates the fact that Akari can listen to them as she thinks its a waste of time. The character i liked the most oddly.Ginka is the ""Sunny, bright and lovable"" character that Akari is supposed to be; even in situations that may suck for most people, she\'s always optimistic and tries to keep the team together. The strongest link on the series if not a little annoying.Luna takes the support role, both in battle and as a person, caring for Akari (to an obsessive/romantic point) which causes her to take really dumb decisions later on. Next to Cerebrum, it is a likely candidate for most hated character but gets better near the end. The weakest link of the girls basically.Cerebrum the villain, is the character i hated the most. I would like to have hated him because of being evil or cruel... but the problem with Cerebrum are his actions:Why Cerebrum was luring humans to become Daemonia in the first place (other than hating humans) is a mystery to me and even if it was a valid reason, there are more efficient ways to hunt down humans souls with negative emotions than going one by one waiting to get at the lowest point of their lives... im pretty sure you can make an army of humans with negative emotions being a lot to choose from, then send them to Sefiro Fiore and finish them off...Also, he indirectly helped Akari to overcome her tragedy and effectively become stronger to defeat him. Villain\'s logic.What is not Villain\'s logic, is to shape shift into a young girl and become the night\'s enjoyment of an middle aged man. Yikes.Supporting characters are kind of memorable, but not much:You have the Tendou Triplets, doing the role of scientists, the demons LaPlace and Schrodinger, Etia and Ariel acting as figure heads for the Sefiro Fiore Japan Branch, the older Tarot Girls , Mama, Hanayume and Lymro, etc.Enjoyment:Despite aforementioned flaws, most chapters end with a good cliffhanger enough to wanting you to look forward for the next chapter. One of the most well done chapters was the fight between Ginka and her Diabolos Tarot card (basically her dark clone) with had a good conclusion.Many incidents are very shocking and entertaining but kind of expected (most of the girls end up fighting with her loved ones) however, the last battle was probably the worst one:You first see the girls overpowering the ""last boss form"" (actually, i felt sad he was being so easily defeated!!) and then suddenly they end up being shot over and defeated instantly even when you saw them minutes ago effortlessly evading the boss attacks. Cheat? Hack?And then... terribly cliched : the MC gains Limit Break , opening theme starts (and you can guess the battle will end due this) , uses it on the Last boss, you get a ""Never give up, trust your instincts"" kind of feeling as you see a familiar spirit around the MC (for no reason, really) and you know what happens next.Happy Ending as all characters are alive? Seriously?Next Season teaser? Ehm...naaah, im okay, thanks.Overall:Flawed or not, I recommend the series to people who like Tragedies or simply look for an alternative of ""Super Shiny Sparkly Bubbly"" Magical Girls.Even though there are some comments about the girls age and their ""designs"", there\'s no fanservice to complement such perversions, which i liked as a production value (Finally somebody understands that Onsen chapters and Beach Chapters are not needed!).For those with questions about Akari\'s Mom there is a light novel out there apparently.In conclusion, there are some weak points that the series would definitely could have improved (the Clessida plot-thing was a laughable and the resurrection of a certain character near the end was terrible); however, the well done art for the transformed girls, average art on special attacks, Dark gloomy atmosphere and interesting-yet-cliched story helped me become hooked to keep watching the series until the end.Give it a try. who\'s the series villain during the chapters.However, one of the the main problems with the story is on the second half it begins to be not so good:Luna becomes excessively jealous for very dumb reasons and her ""transformation"" is terrible, the randomness of the villain Cerebrum (supposedly to mentally defeat her, has a character go through a tragedy infinitely...he didn\'t realize that by the time she finds her she already was like that?) and overall the ""resurrection"" of a certain character and WHY it got resurrected.Also, the ""Cameo"" appearance at the end was totally unneeded (Why? did that happened for a reason?

If that's the only reason, go compare it to sailor moon too. Now, the art for this anime is amazing, it has its own new style that no other anime that I've seen has really been anywhere close to. The sound was amazing and linked up with the ever-building story perfectly. All the way down to the opening as well.

Overall this anime was a...pleasure to watch and is one of the few I can keep coming back too again and again. pleasure to watch and is one of the few I can keep coming back too again and again."", 'TL;DR - If you drop this show early you\'ll probably regret it.Note: I will not be comparing this show to Madoka like many others have, because I can not.After watching this show to the very end I\'m left confused with my own feelings for it, probably because this show itself is confused over what it wants to do.It started out fairly dull, there was no real impact, nothing that really made me feel like it was worth watching past the first few episodes.The characters started off rather shallow, none of them got adequate development and were merely there to do their own thing simply because...that\'s how they were instructed to.Design-wise the characters look lazily done, my biggest gripe in this is the fact that they all have the same disproportionate and scrawny build, despite their daily activities there\'s nothing that would tell them apart if it wasn\'t for the fact they are colored differently. Seira is shown to be very athletic and exercises daily on an almost world-champion level, yet she is as scrawny looking as the next girl, apparently being slightly taller than everyone else is enough to show you\'re physically strong.Another lazily done thing is that some characters in this show have such luscious eyebrows/eyelashes that their hair disappears behind it (as if someone messed up on the layering of the facial features).The animations are still pretty solid even if they had their lackluster moments.As for the sound, the OP/ED blends in perfectly with the show, overall sounds and music were fairly okay, however the voice actors didn\'t leave much of an impact, there were several scenes that left no impression because there wasn\'t enough enthusiasm and emotion behind the characters words. This lack of emotion aids in making the characters seem bland, Laplace is clearly meant to be an asshole, but his voice carries no emotion to really nail this fact and instead comes off as a cardboard cutout that someone wrote ""asshole"" on. The same is true for other characters as well. One character in particular felt really cringy to listen to, they definitely didn\'t know how to make a character sound insanely furious.The story at first feels somewhat bland and not very well written, things happen for seemingly no reason, barely leaves any impact with its actions and tries to tell you that this is meant to be a grimdark story, but fails horribly to deliver.Killing off characters without giving them any kind of character development will not spring any emotions from the audience, it just feels out of place and irritating to see the characters\' friends have an emotional breakdown when as a viewer you feel nothing.The author apparently also has some kind of fetish for restraining and strangling little girls given this happens in almost every episode.Now you might be thinking, why am I rating this show so high after listing so many flaws? Because the last few episodes and the ending left me feeling very satisfied.Despite all the bad things I\'ve said about this show, not once did I feel like I wanted to drop it, I wanted to see if the show was gonna get any worse and actually make me feel so disgusted I wanted to drop it, but it never happened, the show instead unlocked all the restraints and went all-out to deliver a great climax as if it was all a big April Fools joke to trick you into thinking this is a bad show.And that\'s the end of my terrible ""review"", I really needed to get my feelings for this show out so I can move on. that\'s how they were instructed to.Design-wise the characters look lazily done, my biggest gripe in this is the fact that they all have the same disproportionate and scrawny build, despite their daily activities there\'s nothing that would tell them apart if it wasn\'t for the fact they are colored differently.

The idea of Tarot cards, Daemonia, and magic in general, has its appeals. What make it even darker are the video effects, eerie soundtracks, and blood. As for the story itself, I think it is executed very well. There is much progress in the overall plot and the development of the main character to keep things interesting. However, this good execution doesn’t last very long. It is consistent only up to episode 3.Episodes 4 to 6 are so character-driven that they almost have zero development in the overall...story. These episodes seem to be episodic, and the only reason why I can’t say that they’re filler is that they have been used to introduce certain plot elements, like Cerebrum, Ginka’s father, and Seira’s past – all of these could have been introduced by interweaving them to the overall story, and not by creating seemingly filler episodes.Episodes 7 onwards, however, resume the development of the overall story. But unlike the first three episodes of the show, they are not executed very well. The ideas presented don’t seem to be well thought-out, and the philosophical insights are a bit forced and cheesy. The dark atmosphere, too, has almost been completely removed. The video effects, eerie soundtracks, and blood, are not as well-executed as the earlier episodes.In the later episodes, there are also hints that everything will turn out worse for the protagonists, but the last episodes just don’t deliver and everything actually turns out to be a happily ever after. The ending would have been fine if it wasn’t suggested in the later episodes that the worst is going down, but I guess that’s the writers’ way of catching the viewers off-guard by giving them the opposite of what they have suggested.As for the characters, they are not that complicated. But each has its own unique characteristics and opinions that, sometimes, these opinions could even make them clash against each other -- which is always interesting. If there is something I don’t like about the characters, that’s their design.The art style, in general, is not of my taste. It is too funky, and it doesn’t suit the story at all. It is obvious that the creators are trying to create a contradiction between the dark story and the cute art style, but I think it’s not done well.Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou, more commonly known as Daybreak Illusion, holds such a promising start. It is just too bad that it hasn’t been able to keep it up until the end. It just went downhill from episode 4. Its attempt on adding a twist in the Mahou Shoujo subgenre is interesting, but I can’t help but think that it’s trying too hard to make it big like Madoka Magica. Overall, I still enjoyed this anime.

I can see why people said it is heavily influenced by Madoka but I also find the two shows being quite different.The plot is fine. It is basically about girls having magical powers and they have to defeat monsters that can take control of people with ""bad"" emotions such as envy, hatred. The fights are pretty repetitive. The main character always tries to chat with the monsters first, then just kill it because the monsters always want to die. The ending is a bit rush IMO.The art style probably will take time to get used to. The characters\'...appearances are more on the cute side and all of them looks very skinny. I don\'t mind it too much after a few eps.I quite like the characters. They are unique and have quite interesting backstories, even the main villain.Overall I found this show enjoyable while not liking the story that much. appearances are more on the cute side and all of them looks very skinny.

The concept of magical girls turned dark is a growing genre and a good one at that. Where Madoka is a phycological fantasy with twist and turns, shock value and amazing story writing, Day Break Illusion is an echo at best. However, it would be completely UNFAIR to judge the show based on the comparison.Looking at Day Break Illusion as a stand-alone anime, it\'s fairly good. The dialogue and pacing are great. It opens slowly than pushes you at breakneck speed giving you a...shocking start. It then keeps a steady and interesting flow for the remainder of the show.The ""horror"", or edge, derives from small moments. If anything, I\'d say it strives to be shocking with uncomfortable imagery shown at random. The monsters themselves aren\'t scary, it\'s what they\'ve become mentally as well as the personal effects that it has on the girls that are meant to be the true ""horror"". The position these girls are forced into and the phycological effects it has on them is a reoccurring theme that\'s also meant to aid in the ""horror"" factor.The Daemonia (monsters the girls face in the anime) is tame, interesting, and unique. The concept and motivations are where it falters a bit. The idea of "" humans have temptations be it good or bad"" is a bit overplayed. The show definitely would\'ve benefitted from flushing them out a bit more, playing into the pain these people felt, and how horrifying it was for the temptation to take over. We get hints of it throughout the show but it never fully explored. It would\'ve been the perfect excuse to push the gore and mental anguish elements that the show is lacking.In regards to the art style, it\'s a very cute anime girl aesthetic. The children have big heads, big eyes, and a twig-like body. For some, it may be off-putting but you get used to it quickly. The designs of the girls, minus Akari, are VERY much in the pokemon aesthetic. Seira, Luna, and Ginka look like straight-up Gym Leaders.All in all, it\'s a decent anime that you will enjoy. If you go into it comparing it to Madoka, of course, you\'re going to dislike it. Madoka is one o the most critically innovative shows to the magical girl genre, and having any preconceived notions and internal biases will ruin the experience when going into Day Break illusion. With only 13 episodes it\'s a quick and enjoyable watch and I\'d recommend it to anyone interested in a dark take on the magical girl genre. shocking start.

The North exists here and there, everywhere but alas, nowhere. It is simply a state of immobility and disorientation experienced by anyone with a dream of something more. Yamamura's otherworldly imagery is dense in detail, while the fractured memories are effectively unmoving in a repeated cycle or headed somewhere, seemingly north. The cardinal direction is of little importance in and of itself, but it refers to the universal knowledge that one should head towards a straight path in times of need. A consensus that without direction in one's aspirations, they're...bound to be stuck in a limbo of nothingness. The film feels like a daydream, not in the sense that it's unmemorable, however, it's always happening as I'm consuming the atmosphere, genuinely alive right in front of my eyes. It encompasses the human condition in all its inglorious despondency, in which we retain sanity by performing menial tasks.The fictional location depicted in Dozens of Norths is nightmarishly dreary yet expansive, where humans and grotesque creatures coexist. Yamamura will often establish an elaborately composed shot similar to pictures in wimmelbooks, although less populated. The camera then focuses on different sections of the frame, allowing a closer look at the subliminal movements of residents who are stationarily drooped as to indicate depressive fatigue, isolation denoted by existence itself. Other times, we're taken on a tour through the stuff of fantasies, like a dream factory, and Yamamura laterally tracks each individual continually occupied in a pattern of meaningless effort. In search of an escape from fear and suffering, only a purpose can keep our resolve intact, a duty that won't abandon us since we've already abandoned ourselves. The invisible lingering anxiety drowns the film in strong nihilism, albeit it never insists that being unable to relax in thought is a futile dilemma.Yamamura opts for a relatively unorthodox style of silent narration, where short lines of text periodically appear on-screen to communicate the abstract intentions of each separate scene, sometimes shot-by-shot. The aphorisms that are used are meant to provoke a more profound perspective on what would otherwise be highly ambiguous animation. In retrospect, the absence of dialogue is a major factor in successfully experimenting with the poetic mix of art and music. Willem Breuke's jazzy touch is accompanied by haunting shrieks following every beat of motion, and when we are immersed in the quietude, Koji Kasamatsu's sound design of winds and waves is cold to the ears. Alongside its thematic force, Dozens of Norths is an audiovisual delight, boasting unusual designs, messy line art, and freefall control over its characters.Alienation persists whether or not we believe we overcame such mental hurdles, as it's a part of comprehensive perception. Occasionally, we see two small men carrying a quill, traversing the landscape at the corners of different frames. The feather is nearly weightless, yet a subconscious burden that they're designated to carry beyond their North. This recurring scene parallels the existential absurdity at play, a ubiquitous and frequently illogical emotional challenge. Even in its darker implications, the worldbuilding is presented with great beauty, a majestic sensation of mystery. Characters are rooted into the ground where junk and rubble protrude, a parable for monotonous work ethic. Yamamura's first feature chooses visual storytelling above concrete narratives, thoroughly avant-garde. He phenomenally arranges a fusion of dystopian fantasy and adventure, transmitting sharply raw symbolism to the viewer. There is safety in solitude, a phantasmagoria. bound to be stuck in a limbo of nothingness.

It's the most introspective and heavy anime I've ever watched, I usually watch it when I'm in a bad state for the immersion and it helps me a lot to calm down. It's a symbolic movie, so if you want to watch it for fun, or any kind of positive emotion, you're gonna be disappointed, because it's not easy to digest and understand this film. I don't wanna be exaggeratedly assertive, so you can interpret it in your own view, but I just can't watch this movie without the point...of view I'm going to share now.The main text is about how life is fucked up, subconscious and conscious, or primitiveness and virtuousity, both exist and they are like two different worlds, and they are always connected, even though they are totally different, sometimes it's hard to distinguish them, you can't change this, it's inevitable.Surrealism, is an artistic movement in which the artist tries to portray his subconscious ideas, breaking the standard conventional logic, then creating a new logic with layers of allegory, so, every visual element shown in this movie is not literal, and they work as entire projections of related information.The first symbols I wanna talk: the ear and the bugle. 2 of the first characters to be shown on screen, and they represent both action and reaction (in general), we are always trying to say everything that's inside our minds as possible, and we're at the same time cursed to hear what people say to us, therefore making it a bond. There are also some moments when eyes are shown, and they basically represent the same thing as the ear.Characters don't have identity, you won't care for their names and their personalities, because they don't have any, they're intentionally made to represent mankind, in the most collective way, so everyone is just the same, it doesn't matter who they are, the protagonists are probably the same person, as a youngster and an elder, giving this idea of lack of identity.There are also a lot of symbols related to conscious and subconscious, the subconscious ones: underside, animals, water, the little man, a building, people inside the building, holes, giant ribs debris;The conscious ones: upside, light disease, lighthouse, the woman at the sky with a button head, the giant feather and the giant story that little man is writing, the birds, and the stairs of the building.There are some elements like the top of the building and the ground, the universe, time, and the music, etc, that I can't distinguish if they are conscious or unconscious, since the movie is nihilist as fuck, it even portrays the ideal side as an insignificant failure, and there is a lot of subtext related to collectivity and connection, how originality and creation are illusions, and everyone is just fake puppets manipulated by fake puppets, in a loop, in which you don't know what the fuck is going on anymore.The screenplay is perfect and subtle, so let's talk about how technical and atmospheric the production and direction are, the art is beautiful, and at the same time the lines are scribbled, it's spot on for the disharmonious essence it portrays. But what surprised me the most about this movie is the music, dude, the music is so perfect, some avant-garde stuff, that sound like modern classical and jazz, the huge variety of instruments is off the charts, exploring each timbre, with perfect arrangements, rhythm, counterpoint, polyphony and polyrhythms, and a lot of dissonance, music is the soul of this film, it's really important for the screenplay, and it makes the movie more enjoyable, since there is no dialogue, if the music sucked, it wouldn't be as good as it is.I discovered this movie and 山村浩二 [Koji Yamamura]'s work recently, and I'm already calling him a genius, 幾多の北 [Dozens of Norths] is by far his best work, and it's one of the best author films I've ever had the opportunity to watch, one of my favorite animes/films ever, and I can't believe how underrated it is in every goddamn rating site. of view I'm going to share now.The main text is about how life is fucked up, subconscious and conscious, or primitiveness and virtuousity, both exist and they are like two different worlds, and they are always connected, even though they are totally different, sometimes it's hard to distinguish them, you can't change this, it's inevitable.Surrealism, is an artistic movement in which the artist tries to portray his subconscious ideas, breaking the standard conventional logic, then creating a new logic with layers of allegory, so, every visual element shown in this movie is not literal, and they work as entire projections of related information.The first symbols I wanna talk: the ear and the bugle. 2 of the first characters to be shown on screen, and they represent both action and reaction (in general), we are always trying to say everything that's inside our minds as possible, and we're at the same time cursed to hear what people say to us, therefore making it a bond.

As surrealism, it's more John Ashbery than Kunihiko Ikuhara: there's no dialogue or narration, instead scenes are punctuated by gnomic intertitles that together have the feeling (to me at least) of an oblique prose poem on the nature of artistic creation. The relationship between the scenes and the intertitles is less than obvious, and some of the interest in the film is probably in the way the two intersect and complement each other.

B-Legend! Battle B-Daman Fire Spirits!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4667/B-Legend_Battle_B-Daman_Fire_Spirits,"[""The exciting and awesome sequel to the first B-daman show!In B-daman Fire Spirits you can expect seeing the same cast of characters from the first showa and have them all put their skills to the test once again!I have to say that I didn't get to see Fire Spirits until much later on after seeing the first show, however when I did I was quite amazed at many aspects of it which I will try my best to explain in this review.Story: 7/10The story follows in the steps of the main protagonist Yamato Delgado just like in the first show, and he hasn't changed a...bit and is still all about battling tough B-daplayers (opponents) in the world.You can imagine Yamato's personality as someone like Goku, always wanting to become better and stronger to fight against stronger characters.As he also is all about the power of friendship and brings such positive vibes to everyone he meets.And just like in the first show, they enter the Winner's Tournament which is where all the best B-daplayers from all around the world come to enter to become the #1 B-daplayer.However Fire Spirits has a very good set of villains and their methods of dealing with Yamato and his friends makes the show's story darker than the first show in my opinion.Art: 8/10In all honesty, I don't think the art is a all that super, but it is not bad either! It still has that in between old school & modern style feeling, however is definiely more improved compared to the first show.Sound: 9/10The sound I feel is a huge step up compared to the first show.In the first show all B-daballs (the shots that B-damans take) have the same sound, however in this show they actually have a nice variation of different sounds.Many share the same sound, however the sound feels much more fitting for the shots and you will clearly notice this when you watch the very first episode.Character: 8/10With many of the original cast returning as well as new characters being introduced, the original cast has gone through a very nice change.Design wise I find their looks more fitting, regardless of whether some have a very small design change (such as Yamato) and some which have a very different and showing difference (such as Enjyu).The newly introduced characters also have a very good design and it all fits their personality perfectly as well.However there are some that could've stayed the same or didn't really need a weird looking design.Enjoyment: 8/10I definitely think that with the different personalities and exciting battles that are being brought into Fire Spirits you can definitely have a good time by sitting down and watching the show.Of course I can see the show appealing more towards kids than adults, but by no means does this mean that adults could not enjoy it.If you like shows such as Yu-Gi-Oh! and Beyblade, then you most likely would enjoy watching B-daman Fire Spirits also!Overall: 8/10I might be biased because B-daman was a big deal and a huge part of my childhood like other shows such as Yu-Gi-Oh!, Beyblade and Pokemon which are definitely comparable to this one.However I think that if you come from watching the first B-daman show, I definitely believe that Fire Spirits is a huge step up and has its memorable moments to remember.Not to mention the interesting concept and addition of Strike Shots make the show much more exciting!However it does often make things quite predictable, you can definitely see what makes it so cool.Overall I give it an 8 as a sum up for all the points I've gone through and I believe it deserves it as a sequel as well as how good the show has been presented in terms of quality, length and enjoyment. bit and is still all about battling tough B-daplayers (opponents) in the world.You can imagine Yamato's personality as someone like Goku, always wanting to become better and stronger to fight against stronger characters.As he also is all about the power of friendship and brings such positive vibes to everyone he meets.And just like in the first show, they enter the Winner's Tournament which is where all the best B-daplayers from all around the world come to enter to become the #1 B-daplayer.However Fire Spirits has a very good set of villains and their methods of dealing with Yamato and his friends makes the show's story darker than the first show in my opinion.Art: 8/10In all honesty, I don't think the art is a all that super, but it is not bad either!

Baby Princess 3D Paradise 0 [Love],https://myanimelist.net/anime/10196/Baby_Princess_3D_Paradise_0_Love,"[""Well it's time for another review related Baby Princess again this time in anime form and in 3D.Here's the rundownStory 9It follows the whole premise completely, a life story revolving around Youtarou and each of his 19 sisters from a newborn to 18 years, the settings and events follow the novel for the most part.  The introduction of each was nice and had their respective numbers shown as well which is good since like when I explained with the novel each sister has a number, higher the number, younger the sister and Mama is number 0.Art 10The art is cute, sexy, clean, and excellent...and there is a good use of the 3D as well to better see a few small things.  Production values were obviously up the scale due to 3D.  The 3D is way better than the Shukufuku no Campanella Specials.  A noticing thing and novel faithful (it occurs in that too in vol 5) is the fact that lolis don't have nipples.  This is best viewed either in full 3D or 1080p for it's 2D version.Sound 10Sound also was excellent, the OP and ED were highly catchy and are very sing-a-long worth especially the ED theme it's awesome, if you like catchy music then you'll love it.  The other music was also good, quite a bit of the erotic music for a work based on a novel by Sakurako Kimino.Character 10They are all lively, flirtatious, and/or playful in their own way and cute and sexy is the name of the game.  You got plenty of the typical archetypes in Baby Princess but they are done quite well.  Do note the younger ones except Asahi the newborn are also after the brother and will attempt to flirt and kiss him even if it's just in a subtle manner, the series is not for folks who don't like loli.  There is a high frequency of fanservice in this although it's all tastefully done, it can get a bit erotic at times so keep that in mind if you aren't accustomed to ecchi.Enjoyment 10I really enjoyed the anime, there's quite a bit of comedic moments especially with the tsunderes, some sexy moments, some romantic moments and many cute moments with Youtarou and his extremely large family, that's out to kiss him and more.Overall 10Extremely enjoyable ecchi/harem/romcom, however there is still more material and thus I want more, give me a 12-26 episode TV series. and there is a good use of the 3D as well to better see a few small things.

Baby princess 3D love is an anime between your typical harem and harem that you wil not find in anywhere. Baby...princess 3D love or we short it to BP3D, is like another harem when the main character is surrounded by many girls. But thats not all, what if that all girls (19 girls) is your siblings? Surprise? me neither.Baby princess 3D love is originally an adaptation from LN, but i donkt know why they just covers it with just one episode, so basically with just 1 episodes, BP3D doesnt have any rooms to focus on particular story or either plot. so i think thats understandable. anyway, BP3D is just about a boy who suddenly discovered that he has 19 daughters. So, whats the fun? Like i said before, BP3D is an anime that brings you an enjoyable. It brings many fanservices, icha - icha (lovey dovey), so its not for you who loves watching some ""deep"" anime or anything like that. In this anime, You just need to sit watch and imagining what will you do if you are the main character in BP3D.Although BP3D weaks in story, but they pays it with such a beautiful art. I must said it, this anime have a top notch quality in art. They have beautiful scenery, bright coloring, and *ehem* the girls is beautifully drawn. and not just that, in BP3d they use 3D backgrounds too. So, prepare to EYEGASM!Not just the art, the sound itself is the greatest aspects in this anime, especially for the voice actor. If you\'re looking into the voice actor in this anime you will find many top seiyuus, such as Hanazawa Kana, Gotou Yuuko, Kanae Itou, Yuki Kaji, and many more. For the OP, its a cute opening music and its really suitable for this anime.Lets moving on to the character section, This is maybe the one that interest me alot. We got a bunch of unique girls in this harem anime. You name it!Tsundere     [√]Dandere      [√]Kuudere      [√]Loli Blonde   [√]Princess like [√]Mature         [√]Flirtatious    [√]Playful         [√].....and Many more!So, Gotta catch em all!Enough with the jokes, Summary this anime is the one that i recommend if you\'re looking something that enjoyable. Lets not talk about the details like story or anything else. This anime is quite good and thats all. We\'re watching because we want to enjoy not to critize. princess 3D love or we short it to BP3D, is like another harem when the main character is surrounded by many girls.

Not surprising since this is more of a harem and ecchi OVA genre with a bit of comedy and romance on the side. But you know, I really find it hard for a mom of 19 adorable girls (plus one boy) was able to provide for all of them, kinda reminds me of Nadya Suleman- you know, better known as...\'Octomom."" As for the art, well, I do see some very familiar faces that I\'ve seen from other animes, for the sound.....not much for me to say anything about it. About the characters.........hummmmm, they all did what the genre calls for in which the muchacho (the lone male lead) plays the reluctant player to a group of 19 chiquitas (the females in the OVA) which there were those who were teasing, there were those who wanted a brother\'s affection, there those who are hostile and there were those who wanted to kiss the mucahcho and there is one who is still a baby to play around with the muchacho but has proven to as mischivous as her sisters. Overall, I think that this 1 off OVA, should have been made in to a 12 episode short novel it does have some potentials to be one, I mean don\'t we wanna know how it started and don\'t we wanna watch how the muchacho get into some awkward situation with his sisters on a episode basis and eventually to know as to whom he\'ll choose in the end to be his favorite, I guess it\'ll be nice if it will be one. \'Octomom.""

Granted, there was nothing inherently bad about it--... Okay, maybe there was-- but there wasn't anything that stood out. Put simply, it's a steaming pile of self-insert mediocrity.This is Baby Princess 3D Paradise 0.--Story (3/10)--The story starts off with a boy named Youtarou who, unsurprisingly, is as plain as you can get from an ecchi anime protagonist. He lives with his 19 (Yes, nineteen) sisters and is the only boy in the family....Yep, every man's dream come true portrayed in an anime. This is self-insert, people. Get used to it.One day, after all the two second introductions are over, their nameless mother, like all harem mothers, comes in and tells everyone they're going on a trip to a, wait for it, HOT SPRINGS RESORT. Oh joy!I'm going to stop here because spoilers but all in all, it's just one perverted mundane situation after another. The cast of females range from either your adult-like onee-chan, monotone faced imouto, gang of tsunderes and army of lolis.All in all, not much to say since nothing of significance happens other than overly dumb situations and the like. Maybe some parts were funny but that's just it. Some funny two seconds with an overly draggy and mundane 30 minutes.--Characters (4/10)--Again, our main character, Youtarou, is excessively plain. No redeeming qualities, no quirks, not even ability. Sure, his swimming technique is off the chart but that was more of a supernatural ability than a talent. (He could try out for a world record if he can withstand the current of a river near a waterfall). As for the girls, they're simply archetypes. Not that there's anything bad about archetypes but when nothing is done about them, nothing happens. Overall, a mediocre female cast. I can't break them down easily since they're simply overly similar to one another and literally have the same goal, that is, getting in onii-chan's pants. They're not even that fun as a whole to be honest. There's no interaction, no charisma and, disappointingly, no sense of individuality. It's as though these girls are hive-minded aliens that answer only to the mothership (Quite literally, too).So, plain protagonist, stereotypical cast, equals... not very good.Okay, fine it's a short. I get it. It's 30 minutes long. But if I can't even sit through just that long of seeing these characters' 'interaction', then Houston, we have a problem.--Art and Sound (4/10)--The art was above average. Granted the female cast was very boring, their design was something to commend. On paper, these characters looked and felt like individual people, like real siblings that had different mindsets. If only it was as I expected but still, these girls were cute so that's a plus on the design.Animation was iffy, since it wonked a few times, the occasional derp was there and the 3D was off-putting. Granted, there were some good movements here and there which was above average.In terms of sound, both the OP and ED sound horrendously generic and there really wasn't a lot of soundtrack to listen to. Voice acting was top notch but lacked a sense of individuality.--Enjoyment (4/10)--A steaming pile of MEH. Nothing caught my attention, nothing left an impression, nothing made me want to see it again. Overall, Baby Princess 3D Paradise 0 is a short OVA that adds more meaning to the word 'MEH'.If you want to watch a neat short story, turn to Saekano Episode 0.If you want a good short story, turn to Garden of Words.If you want a great short story, turn to Kowarekake no Orgel.If you want a masterfully crafted short story, turn to Tsumiki no Ie.If you want a short story that bathes in its shit like the rest of the schlock, this one is for you.--4/10-- Yep, every man's dream come true portrayed in an anime.

These short scenes are impressive and vivid, and the anime itself  would look just as good without them.The voices of the many characters matched them perfectly.Each character is unique in both personality and design.

I'm a big fan of Blue Dragon. Pretended I had a shadow of my own.I mean who wouldn't after wacthing this epic storyline and shit?!For me it was story. Awesome effects. Awesome characterization.but then again it had its faults here and there. Too much fan-service.and then it was a bit too predictable and didn't really have that pinch of suspense.Well i suppose It was quite the entertainment.I was around 12 when I watched this on Cartoon Network and I didn't miss a single episode...of it. To my embarrassment I kind purchased all teh PS2 /PS3 / Nintendo/ and X-box games for Blue Dragon. I don't even own a X-box.lol. of it.

Seemed that the works inspired by dbz and final fantasy influences was not in vain, at least for fans of the genre´s. The ONLY minor thing about it was the fast build-up of the charachters at 1till episode 8 or so, and some behavior the charachters have, but as the serie progresses it leaves it more to the background. I had no idea that a entertaining serie´s...like this ended with such a dark storyline wich came as a pleasant suprise( i mean really...kids were involved man!!!!!)At first come´s the fantasy dialogue of the creation of darkness,light and the creation of men , then the myth of the 7 Knights of magic, and their heroic deeds, that in the blue dragons world is written down in a book called the EXTRA SEVEN.From there on the story starts with our protagonists that under go journey. Artwise its all VERY CLEAR: nuff said. in the middle there is like good comedy moments a la DBZ wich threw me on the floor, i mean the fun was definetly embedded to do its job. For all the charachters there is a story from their side to tell, from the heroes to the villains till the villagers, but not too complicated.Also a very good job done on the cgi tecniques and millitairy shipmodeling.i hope that the sequel keeps the same things up as this one cuz it was worth the watch like this ended with such a dark storyline wich came as a pleasant suprise( i mean really...kids were involved man!!!!!)At first come´s the fantasy dialogue of the creation of darkness,light and the creation of men , then the myth of the 7 Knights of magic, and their heroic deeds, that in the blue dragons world is written down in a book called the EXTRA SEVEN.From there on the story starts with our protagonists that under go journey.

Her only use is in the second season and even then she's still annoying and pretty much useless.I do however absolutely love the plot and the whole shadow concept, words can't describe how...unique and amazing it is. unique and amazing it is."", 'I don\'t usually write reviews, but this anime is somewhat meaningful to me and I have thoughts to share about it. The first time I saw Blue Dragon was when it aired on Cartoon Network in the late 2000s. Being a young kid, it was one of the only anime I had access to at that time, so I always looked forward to it airing and I watched every episode that was available on our limited Comcast streaming service. That is to say, I have a good amount of nostalgia for this show and its characters, so I may not be entirely objective.The majority of...Blue Dragon is an enjoyable and relatively lighthearted if bland shonen. I only ever saw around the first 15 episodes when it first aired, so I was excited to be able to finally get the whole story. Minor parts of the plot didn\'t really make sense, but it didn\'t really bother me because I wasn\'t taking it too seriously; I was just enjoying the nostalgia trip. At its worst, it dragged, and at its best, it made me genuinely feel for the characters and their struggles. But I still wouldn\'t recommend it, and here\'s why (spoilers ahead):If Blue Dragon had ended just one arc earlier, it would\'ve been totally fine. Just a story about some standard kids with super powers who defeat a standard super villain with the power of friendship. But in my opinion, Zola\'s betrayal completely ruined the story. Now, I\'m very biased because she\'d always been by far my favorite and was the first crush I can remember having period, but just because a plot twist was foreshadowed doesn\'t mean it makes any sense. At one point the other characters even ask her ""why are you doing this? Destroying the world will make sadness go away, yeah, but only because everyone will be dead..."" And she just says like a single sentence of nonsense and no one asks her to clarify. It was totally cheap and just meant to make you feel sad about how a character you\'d grown to trust and care about for 50 episodes turned out to have been heartless since the beginning. To its credit, it worked, but that doesn\'t mean it was clever or well written. Her motivation was very vague and her backstory was completely glossed over and difficult to follow. The whole arc was actively contradictory, as previously Zola had gone out of her way to protect and care for the rest of the party.Pros and cons:+ Some pretty good side characters, actually. I liked how the minor antagonists got depth and made you feel for them, and I wish there\'d been more of that earlier in the show since it\'s mostly in the last few arcs. Bonus points for making me genuinely like General Rogi; even though he was an antagonist it was clear he cared about his squadron and that its younger members looked up to him (I am such a sucker for this trope).+ Even though they were introduced not too long before each of their deaths, I ended up really feeling for Homeron and Dragnov, and they didn\'t seem like they were written in just to die.+ The character designs are fun, and I liked seeing all the different cool Shadows and robots, etc :)— The main cast didn\'t get any character development. I was especially disappointed by Bouquet, who seemed like she was going to learn how to be brave and useful, but after she got her new power she never used it again and didn\'t even contribute to the final battle, even though her copy ability could\'ve been incredibly cool and useful. She was just the annoying, uncomfortable fanservice character the whole time.— Sometimes the details of the plot and the reasoning behind things didn\'t make sense or was hard to follow.— I already talked about how dumb Zola\'s plot twist for the sake of plot twist was— Controversial personal opinion, but I just don\'t like Toriyama\'s art style.— MarumaroBecause of the ending, overall I felt like I wasted my time getting invested into this show, especially considering its length. Would not recommend to anyone who wasn\'t already nostalgic for it. Maybe if you\'re like really into shounens you\'d like it.

A series with artwork by the guy who made Dragon Ball. What can go wrong? ... Surprise! Everything did. It got some fame because of the hype behind the illustrator and then lost it all in a few episodes because it’s a show for children. If you thought Dragonball’s plot and characters were simple, they are Shakespear next to this one. The show was obviously a callback to old JRPGs which were by default simple and cheerful, but that is not enough to make an interesting show out of them. Not even the similar in tone Dragon Quest anime adaptation managed to do that,...despite being the most famous title all fantasy and isekai anime were inspired from.Without much of a source material to work with, the result was a dull fantasy adventure any 10 year old can think of. Not that a good source is enough to have an amazing adaptation, since as we all know by now, they suck as a whole. Classics like Final Fantasy, Persona, Shadow Hearts, Xenogears or Chrono Trigger don’t translate to series well. They are meant to be played, not turned into a story you sit back and do nothing. As good as the plot may be, it will feel very weird if you don’t interact with it. So imagine how worse it will feel when it’s just a fairy tale that lasts ten times more than most people would stand.The characters are not even fun to follow. They are the most cliché stereotypes you can imagine. As simple as Mahoujin Guruguru was, it had fun characters. Blue Dragon has white noise. You will struggle to remember their name, much less their personality or looks. And no, simply using the Toriyama artstyle doesn’t make them stand out.Seriously, there are thousands of better series to watch or things to do in general than wasting your time with this thing that is nothing more than a lazy advertisement of a subpar videogame. Blue Dragon only managed to blue ball anyone who expected something more. despite being the most famous title all fantasy and isekai anime were inspired from.Without much of a source material to work with, the result was a dull fantasy adventure any 10 year old can think of.

Baldr Force Exe Resolution,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1682/Baldr_Force_Exe_Resolution,"[""Most of the time when I view an OVA series I often feel the show was too short and could have used more episodes.  In the case of BALDR FORCE EXE, I couldn’t wait for it to be over.Things start out pretty well as we are introduced to a future world where a virtual reality internet is a huge part of society.  This network is called WIRED, and people can do about everything you can think of in this online world.  The world is populated by hackers and network terrorists and the corporations and police forces that try to stop them....The world gives the show a perfect opportunity to have robot battles because anime loves itself some Mecha's.  The hackers, terrorists, and police do battles online in virtual reality mecha suits but the catch is if you are killed in the online world, apparently this causes your brain to explode into a bloody mess in the real world.  Fans of exploding heads are sure to be thrilled!Overall it’s a fairly interesting premise for a plot but the show manages to fall flat on its face pretty early.  It makes the mistakes of other short series by trying to have too much going on.  There are too many subplots involving other secondary characters to be fair with any of them.  While it does a good job with the main story, which is the most important after all, it would have been better to have just stuck with the basics.  The motivation of the main character in the beginning is, to put it bluntly, stupid.  Toru is a hacker who after being arrested by the police is giving the option of jail or joining them.  But apparently he would rather go to prison because his only reason for accepting is to get revenge on the person with the police who killed his friend.  While on the surface this would seem like it’s not such a bad reason, considering they were breaking the law and also trying to kill the police in return, is it really that fair to expect your might get yourself killed?  Considering how many other people Toru kills himself over the course of the series, if those peoples friends took things the same way the world would be filled of nothing but revenge hungry sociopaths.My main source of irritation with this series is the characters.  Toru was an incredibly irritating character and I disliked him a lot.  I found him to be an egotistic nut job that is singularly focused on killing the person responsible for his friend’s death.  Having to suffer him made this anime largely a pain in the ass to watch.  Unfortunately there aren’t any supporting characters to redeem the series either.  They are for the most part two dimensional and boring.  Ayane was the only character I felt any empathy towards and she was the most cruelly treated.The reason for me watching this show in the first place was the music of Kotoko and Mami Kawada.  They both deliver a couple very good songs which make this the one bright spot of the series.  The artwork is really not that good when you consider how recently this was made.  The CG effects are very drab and ordinary looking.  Generally I am not a fan of CG animation and this certainly won’t change my view.  A lot of the backgrounds though are very nicely done, but this really felt like a show much older than it is.I didn’t get much in the way of enjoyment from this anime.  It was a painful 2hrs to finish and thus I find it difficult to recommend to anyone.  I suppose if you really love CG or Mechs and must see every title out there that has those themes you could check this out.  Overall it’s just very mediocre.

It has wonderful art, a decent storyline, and good characters.STORY:The series is about a man, Tooru, who has lost everything (won't spoil ;p) and joins up with a kind of team, or company, called FLAK. The series is set in a would-be Japan, where the &quot;wired world&quot; is part of everyday life. People are able to literally plug themselves into certain computers and spend time in this new cyber world.It is quite a difficult concept for the writers of...this OVA to get across well in such a small amount of time, but they do it brilliantly.ART:Nothing to complain about here: the characters are drawn very well, the backgrounds are fantastic, and the Mecha and Wired World, which are usually done by CG, are fantastic.SOUND:The music was absolutely incredible. KOTOKO sings the opening theme and the lyrics fit so well with the series, and Mami Kawada sings the ending, which is beautiful but sad at the same time. Luckily for me, these two are actually my favourite singers.CHARACTER:The characters in the OVA could have done with a lot more development, excluding Tooru, but since the series was so short character development was kind of out of the question. However, each character is still able to be unique.ENJOYMENT:Except for the events of episode 2, I really enjoyed watching this series, as it was such an experience to watch. For an OVA, it went far deeper than I would have imagined and OVA could.OVERALL:I was so close to giving BALDR FORCE EXE Resolution a 10/10, but episode 2 really put me off - I thought it was unneeded.

With good CG animations and soundtrack to get you into the series, it didn\\'t make it up for the character development and storyline but considering its only a 4 episode series (2 hour movie if you would say), it had to be rushed in order to fit all the events in and in a proper sequence.The beginning starts off with the usual routine of investigating in the cybernetic world. As the FLAK was doing their normal routine, they encounter this special girl and things take a nasty turn for...a couple of FLAK members.

There is network and people can actually get ‘inside’ there networks and interact virtually. The story takes place when a young man is asked to join an organization called FLAK, which job is to dive in the network and attack the hackers who try to hack into FLAKs servers. This is only a portion of the story, the story is a lot more complex than this, there is revenge, friendships, and secrets waiting to be unraveled.The animators did a good job with the character...designs and backgrounds. The buildings were beautifully drawn, the interiors were very detailed and the slums looked real. There is nothing too fancy about the art; in this is what made it beautiful. But that is all; it was beautiful, not extraordinary. The characters, on the other hand, were averagely drawn, there was nothing new in the designs, but they were (well some of them) beautifully drawn. There were some details that were better than other things. The mechs and fighting scenes were done in a very good way, the mechs were designed beautifully and the fights were smooth and tens at the same time.The music was one of the strong points of this OVA, from the quick beat of the fighting scenes, to the quite rhythm  on the hills, to the sad tone of the music box, all of those made a good combination of sounds. The opening theme was actually very good, it fit with the futuristic theme of the OVA. The ending theme was beautiful, it gives a sense of melancholy which also fits with this OVA’s theme.This OVA had various types of characters, we have the good people, the bad people, the victims, the culprits, the friends, the enemies, and so forth. Some characters were quite average, the types you would see in many series; but some were actually quite good, there were hidden pasts, tragedies that engulfed some of the characters. There was also a strong emotion that motivated the characters do some acts. Some were even ready to do some extreme things to reach their goals. The characters in this OVA were pretty good, there was some decent character development and some of them deserved the viewer’s sympathy.This OVA is a good watch, actually, it’s more than a good watch. It might take some time to get used to, but once the viewer gets used to it one can see that this OVA has much more that it offered. One should look beyond what was shown to the viewers, one should try to understand the message the developers were trying to tell to us.

Really though this is a load, a rip, a troll, a blatant theft of both Ghost in the Shell and Serial Experiments Lain and their respected themes. From tachikomas to ghost hacking to ""if you die in the WIRED you die in the real world"". It is a complete ripoff and it gets NO POINTS for stealing.Also weird virtual rape scenes. Which didn\'t make any sense at all as long as it caters to fandom. Pointless fan service FTW!...Story 0/10The art is nothing to talk at home about. Bland designs, sloppy backgrounds and terrible lighting. A bunch of pointless flashy kill scenes for wow factor to hide its terrible plot and theft. Nice try, but I am among the goat not the sheep. Also MORE RIPPING OFF GHOST IN THE SHELL AND LAIN.Art 4/10Here is the sloppiest part of this theft, the characterization. I felt the development was rushed a lot of the times.

One thing\'s for certain, this is not for kids. If the exploding head gore in episode 1 doesn\'t make that clear, the virtual rape in episode 2 should do. It contains various shoutouts to other series, most noticably the matrix and neon-genesis evangelion. And yes it does have a gainax ending. Halfway through episode 4.Story: 7Set a few years into the future, where instead of the internet, people login to a virtual world called the WIRED through plugs on their neck, ala the Matrix....The major difference being that people\'s heads can explode. The premise is a little silly, but it gets a lot more serious. There is also imaginary mecha.Souma Toru accepts a job at FLAK (mecha internet police) in order to find the killer of his friend. Things don\'t go as planned, and a lot of mysteries and associated subplots open up. After an attempted hack results in the loss of a team member, things quickly become a lot darker, as the killer and Souma\'s past are revealed. The genre then shifts to horror after the real life meeting with Ren.Subplots open up left right and centre, and considering how short it is, it ties them up remarkably well. The scenes involving Rivaia are amazing, and border between comedy and horor. However there are a few things that just bug me: the virtual rape scene wasn\'t necissary, and quite a few of things are overdone.Art: 7The art is consitantly good throughout, although the CG is a bit conspicuous. The creepy scenes involving revaia are my favourite.Sound: 8The sound is usually quite subtle, but fits well with the scenes. Opening and ending are great.Character: 5With the exception of his feelings towards Ren, Souma has all the character development of Clippy from MS word. He is totally focused on getting revenge on the killer, which makes him act like a douche and oblivious to circumstances. He actually says the line ""I don\'t care about the real world or the Virtual world""Enjoyment: 8The numerous shout outs and generally all the scenes involving Rivaia make it very entertaining. I\'d imagine it will be more entertaining to those who\'ve seen Evangelion.Overall: 8Worth a watch, although you can skip the rape scene. It adds nothing to the plot.

Still, quite worthwhile, especially since it is only two hours long all in all. Awesome fighting scenes, a pretty deep (but very cliché) story and pretty cool characters. And a severed limb or two.AnimationKind of a mixed bag. The fighting scenes are spectacular for the most part, but the ""real world"" graphics are only average. Some of the digital animations of the mechas even look really cheap and awkward. But for the most part, the graphics stretches from decent to awesome.Quite a lot of blood, mutilation and...other neat stuff.SoundOpening and ending themes are pretty good, but don\'t sell your dog and your house to get the OST. Background music are pretty anonymous for the most part, but from time to time a real synth romp turns up to enhance a scene tenfolds.Voice acting is above average, I guess. Nothing to complain about, at least.StoryThere isn\'t much time to develop the story, and the writers really have ambitious plans. This makes things feel a bit rushed at times, but this is mostly saved by good directing. That said, most of the story is very cliché and over-pompous.CharacterThere are many interesting characters here that get just about the right amount of screen time. There is some depth and development, and a nice wrapping up in the last episode.

Well, Baldr Force perfectly demonstrates why that is the case.Baldr Force is based on the VN by the same name and is part of the larger ""Baldr"" series of games, which have a bit of a reputation for piling on long sections of setup and worldbuilding, two things notably absent from this anime.And therein lies the issue with this series, it tries to compress roughly 30 hours of story content spread across multiple routes into a two hour time span.As a result characters are undeveloped, plotlines come out...of nowhere and if I hadn\'t played Baldr Sky before watching this, basically nothing related to how the Wired works would\'ve made much sense to me.And it\'s a shame that it had to be this way, since the Baldr games tell some of my favourite Cyberpunk stories with some truly interesting ideas for their stories and setting, but that kind of story can\'t be conveyed properly in such a short amount of time and as a result you end up with a fairly generic cyberpunk anime about ugly, but well animated cgi mech fights with multiple sub-plots and plot holes that aren\'t properly resolved or explained due to time restraints, a romantic side story that was cut for the adaptation but is still alluded to for some reason and a final arc that feels like the studio was given a rough summary of the true route that someone had accidentally spilled their coffee all over and then were told to adapt that, resulting in an unsatisfying conclusion that leaves a ton of stuff unexplained and doesn\'t give much closure to anyone besides the MC.The only redeeming quality of this show is the music made by KOTOKO, who made most of the vocal tracks for the Baldr series, and which was simply reused from the VN.I\'ve purposefully avoided spoiling any plot details, so if you\'re still interested in watching this show, please instead go and play the original VN instead.it\'s the only Baldr game besides Baldr Sky you can find in english as far as I know and it tells the same story infinitely better and includes a competent mech-brawler on top. of nowhere and if I hadn\'t played Baldr Sky before watching this, basically nothing related to how the Wired works would\'ve made much sense to me.And it\'s a shame that it had to be this way, since the Baldr games tell some of my favourite Cyberpunk stories with some truly interesting ideas for their stories and setting, but that kind of story can\'t be conveyed properly in such a short amount of time and as a result you end up with a fairly generic cyberpunk anime about ugly, but well animated cgi mech fights with multiple sub-plots and plot holes that aren\'t properly resolved or explained due to time restraints, a romantic side story that was cut for the adaptation but is still alluded to for some reason and a final arc that feels like the studio was given a rough summary of the true route that someone had accidentally spilled their coffee all over and then were told to adapt that, resulting in an unsatisfying conclusion that leaves a ton of stuff unexplained and doesn\'t give much closure to anyone besides the MC.The only redeeming quality of this show is the music made by KOTOKO, who made most of the vocal tracks for the Baldr series, and which was simply reused from the VN.I\'ve purposefully avoided spoiling any plot details, so if you\'re still interested in watching this show, please instead go and play the original VN instead.it\'s the only Baldr game besides Baldr Sky you can find in english as far as I know and it tells the same story infinitely better and includes a competent mech-brawler on top.', ""That said, the OVA follows a young man by the name of Toru.

This story had to be written by a woman or a gay man. In the middle of the story I thought the main character was going to realize he was gay. that would have explained a lot. I usually like the slice of life animes because they are incredibly insightful. This one is an exception. It did not have the truth and warmth that I enjoy so much. ', 'While the story focuses on teenage boys, some light has been shed on Female characters as well. Generally, it&rsquo;s something that both sexes can relate to. For the first two times watched it, I wasn&rsquo;t able to fully grasp its meaning. Now that I&rsquo;m a little older, I understood myself a few years back.For this third time around, I was able to learn new things. That is what makes this series great. It&rsquo;s a slice of life anime that&rsquo;s actually closer to reality than other slice of life series out there.The characters were great too. They all were very different from each other, so I&rsquo;d...say that anyone who watches this can relate to at least one character. What hit me the most is Kyoichi&rsquo;s character. I know he&rsquo;s a guy, but when he talked about how lonely and isolated he felt I actually understood him. I guess loneliness isn&rsquo;t exclusive to any gender.As for the animation, I can safely say I&rsquo;ve seen better. It&rsquo;s not that bad, but I just wish that the character design was in the same level of the background design. Compared to the backgrounds and landscapes, the characters just seemed so bland. There was also the slight use of repetitive scenes that made me feel iffier (if there is such a word) about it.As for the voice acting, I didn&rsquo;t like Kyoichi&rsquo;s voice that much. He (Kenichi Suzumura) sort of sounded like a 30 year old pretending to be a teenager. I know that&rsquo;s a well known practice in anime voice acting, but Kenichi Suzumura definitely had better days. He handled Hikaru Hitachiin&rsquo;s (Ouran High School Host Club) character really well.I liked the music though. Aki Maeda is definitely a talented person. She did a good job singing the opening and ending themes of the series.All of the tracks were very impressive. I like the variety of BGM that held every scene very nicely. My favorite episode was episode 8 because of the catchy pop songs.I guess that the series is worth watching, and re-watching as well &ndash; I did watch the series three times.

Boys Be… only scratches the surface of reality.PlotHere we have a decent story about a group of friends finding their places in life. Some might fall in love with a star crossed partner, while others perish in utter defeat and depression. As in many love animes, most of their characters are portrayed as those who are deeply in love with their lovers and won’t mind spending their lives together for eternity. In Boys Be… hearts are broken, mended,...twisted, doubted and even scared. In essence, this anime does not emphasis on a fairytale, where people marry each other and have many babies. This anime not only emphasizes on the harsh realities of love, but also even on one’s choices.CharacterThough they aren’t the best characters out there, they are surely the ones we will mostly find relevant and comparable. Their actions are heading the right direction of everyday decisions that we make or will make. To be more specific, when we doubt those we love, we tend to medicate ourselves and bend the rules in game of love.

Thanks for nothing, you piece of shit.Whatever the show pretends to have as a plot is no more than done to death hentai premises where a bunch of teenage boys are objectifying women, before conveniently bumping onto said women who immediately get interested in them, and silly adventures begin.And by adventures I mean endless cock teasing where you are constantly...made to wonder do they like each other, will they kiss, will she hit him for being a peeping tom? To its defense, everybody eventually kisses some girl for a couple of times.To its offense, the plot is basically episodic so no matter what progress seems to be achieved in one episode is immediately rendered meaningless by the next one, and the boys keep jumping from one girl to another, essentially sleeping around without ever showing us anything besides kissing. Their love is so meaningful.And I have to question the intelligence of these girls. They seem to be oblivious to everything that is going on around them. Half the time they have derpy faces and they are spacing out as if their brains stop working. No wonder they don’t even see how they are being sexually manipulated.The show as a whole was promoted as a well-made romance when it first came out, which is why it was recommended to me. Which is a lie, since just like any other romance in anime, it’s only about sexual frustration and awkwardness to speak with members of the opposite sex, before ending when an actual relationship is about to begin.In reality, this anime is not about meaningful romance. It’s aimed at virgin teenagers who want to escape reality and be in a simulation where women are stupid and love you for no particular reason. Proof of which is the promotional art, which only shows the girls and never the boys, since you are supposed to self insert instead of considering men as actual characters.The lamest part is that the anime in general is very low budget, so it’s not even doing a good job as escapism fantasy. The characters are often off-model, have derpy faces, and the animators went as far as using live action footage in the opening and during the intermissions, in a cheap attempt to save budget and enhance realism. Yeah man, show an actual half naked woman in suggestive poses; this will totally enhance the illusion of you watching a plausible animated romance.It is far from the first time anime try to save money with live action footage, but this does not excuse the lazy way it is used. Kare Kano used it in a way that was more about artistic expression and psychology. It was enhancing the romance and the characterization, instead of simply covering up animation weaknesses and objectifying the female body.Boys Be is a throwaway show, made for virgin teenagers with very low expectations who have no idea what romance is and who for some reason cannot watch any other harem anime. I do not recommended it, it’s bad. made to wonder do they like each other, will they kiss, will she hit him for being a peeping tom? To its defense, everybody eventually kisses some girl for a couple of times.To its offense, the plot is basically episodic so no matter what progress seems to be achieved in one episode is immediately rendered meaningless by the next one, and the boys keep jumping from one girl to another, essentially sleeping around without ever showing us anything besides kissing. Their love is so meaningful.And I have to question the intelligence of these girls. They seem to be oblivious to everything that is going on around them. Half the time they have derpy faces and they are spacing out as if their brains stop working. No wonder they don’t even see how they are being sexually manipulated.The show as a whole was promoted as a well-made romance when it first came out, which is why it was recommended to me.

At last I managed to make it through the whole thing and it actually wasn\'t as bad as I thought it would be. That\'s not to say it was good. More like a pale, anonymous ""not-a-complete-waste-of-time""...AnimationThe last couple of episodes actually look decent, but for the most part, this anime just looks really bad.

Many character fall in love and out of love, are rejected, and circumstances keep them apart.The problem is that for one or two cases it seems like a romance was just cobbled together, and sometimes the reason for it working/ not working is so ""anime"" it takes away from the realism of the others.

The show picks back up to a point where its art is comparable to become, but by this time the use of stock footage from previous episodes came more into play. happy medium.The characters aren\'t something we haven\'t seen before, but their interactions are feel a bit more natural than most anime.

Card Wang: Mix Master,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7395/Card_Wang__Mix_Master,"['(This is being written from the standpoint of the English Dub)""Destiny is all you need to play."" Probably one of the weirdest phrases I have heard but it will be stuck with you for the entirety of this series. Not much needs to be said about this series besides it is something that honestly never gets talked about or even mentioned. Let us see why that is...Story (6/10): The summary/synopsis to this series pretty much gives you everything you need to know. Not really much else needs to be said. It is your standard child and monster/weird creature anime. Though it focuses more on more...of a fusion mechanic, which is what drew me to it initially. You have the chosen one who must save the world from evil and that is about it. Nothing even remotely groundbreaking or new but the story exists and proceeds how you would expect it to.Art(6/10): I wish I could be a bit harder on this show\'s animation and it definitely has some oddly drawn and animated characters but it can honestly be overlooked. This isn\'t a show where you come for the art and the unique animation but since it is geared towards kids you have to be pretty forgiving for what it is. Nothing egregious but nothing outstanding either.Sound(7/10): The soundtrack is actually quite good, it captures the mood of the various scenes well. The opening is without a doubt one of the most catchiest songs I have ever heard and even after not watching this show for half a decade I still remember it. The voice acting itself is also quite good for a kids show and I think each voice actor performs their roles quite well. I believe there are only a handful of voice actors in the show but their range of voices is quite wide so it never makes you think ""Hey! Isn\'t this the same voice as so and so?"". The opening and ending themes are exactly the same, one is just an instrumental version of the other so not much to talk about there.Character(5/10): Now this is less about character development and more about character design. The character development is typical children show progression and not worth mentioning except for maybe Giara and Prince Brad(who is probably the strongest point of the show). For a show centered around collecting monster and making new monsters, it probably has the worst monster designs I have seen in my life. The special monster friends in this are called ""Hench"", which just hits the ear weird and makes it sound like instead of the creatures being friends to the main characters they are ""henchmen"". It is a minor annoyance of mine but I feel like they could have chosen a better name. A vast majority of them are just so lazy and uninspired, like they put the bare minimum in designing them. You might enjoy maybe one or two by the end but even I doubt that. They aren\'t visually interesting to look at, they have no unique personality quirks, no unique/defining abilities, not even remotely interesting names. Some of their names literally being a description of what they are, ex. Metal Hopper, which is as you would guess a metal grasshopper. However, when it comes to the human, elves and dark elves design the show isn\'t nearly as terribly. They are all easy to identify and that is good. Prince Brad on the other hand is just a really strong antagonist. Not in terms of ""evilness"" or anything like that but his design, his personality, and mannerisms make the show less of a chore to sit through. He feels like the type of character that honestly doesn\'t belong in such a show but thinking of any other show where he would fit in is honestly a bit of a task. He is just plain goofy fun and I love it.Enjoyment(8/10): Despite for being such a bland show, it isn\'t terrible. It never feels too slow nor does it ever feel too fast. Episodes go by quickly and information is given to you in a timely manner. I can\'t really find it in my heart to hate it even if I don\'t have high praise for it. It doesn\'t overstay its welcome and I can appreciate that.Overall(7/10): Is this show worth watching? Eh. If you really need something to watch I guess but you aren\'t missing out on much.

Build Divide: Code Black,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48776/Build_Divide__Code_Black,"[""Fun concept but fails to deliverIt has been ages since I have seen an anime with card games as the main concept. Last was Yu-Gi-Oh which was great. Where this show fails to capture the fun that card games really are. I think it is mainly because the mess this show is.Let's see. When I was watching the first episode it certainly seemed like a fun idea and it was good for the first episode because we got to see how the world works and how the game itself works. It had many unique ideas but the games kinda just over used them. Like with...Shot Triggers and burst triggers which can alter the games quite heavily. But after the first few fights, all the fights were just identical. The same shit happened in every fight which made it boring.Story could be better. We just followed our MC Teruto who was gathering these chips, and when you have enough chips you are allowed to challenge this King who is just the best player or something. Over the journey we see Teruto fight identical fights which made everything just not intenseThe Opening honestly slaps but it is EGOIST so of course it is bound to be goodSo, I wouldn't recommend this show really to anyone. The concept is cool but it is at the end boring Shot Triggers and burst triggers which can alter the games quite heavily. But after the first few fights, all the fights were just identical.

The concept is cool but it is at the end boring"", ""Redemption. Master and teacher. Teacher and student. Finding your path. As banal as that all sounds, Build Divide: Code Black excelled in executing great story telling behind those ideas. Teruto is the loveable and fun main character whom the viewers can't help but constantly laugh at how awkward and funny his mannerisms are. He definitely became my favorite protagonist of the season. Having lost part of his memory and personality, all he can think about is the king and finding his path towards that. As a result, he has lost the ability to function as a normal human, and for whatever reason develops a hilarious...obsession with bread as well. Blasted into a digital city, he wakes up and takes up shelter in a tent by a river, battling his way to the top to earn enough chips to fight the King. That's all he knows and strives for, and he could care less for anything else.(SPOILERS AHEAD) He meets Sakura along the way. A mysterious individual who appears to be partially glitching out of reality at times. She runs into him by fate, and pushes him by guiding the path for him. Though she appears sincere, she has a use for him that he isn't aware about. She is a part of Kikka, Teruto's sister, who, in her desperation to see Teruto, sent her out there to bring him back. The tragedy of Sakura is that she knows she is going to cease to exist and eventually become a part of Kikka again. Realizing this, and being somewhat advised by Ishinome behind the scenes, she ends up realizing to a certain extent what is going to happen. As a result, she stole the chips from Teruto and fought a battle against Kikka she knew she couldn't win I assume because she wanted to fuse back with her before Teruto got to her.Naomitsu is the 8th of several clones who is out to get revenge against Mario who happens to be his father. His father is looking for a powerful Build Divide player for a new body to take over, but it's unclear still what he means by wanting to reach a new dimension. Naomitsu wasn't that prominent in season 1, but I expect him and his father to be around a lot in season 2 since there isn't much known about them at the moment.Hiyori is an energetic, optimistic, kind, and clumsy girl that meets Teruto and convinces him to become her master. As her student, she hilariously doesn't learn anything from him as he can never commit to actually teaching her anything. For the rest of the season she becomes his cheerleader, until Teruto becomes the sacrifice at the end and passes the torch on to her, as she has now become the main character of season 2, at least assuming based on the reveal. Her character has a lot of room for development and I am sure she'll grow a lot.Ishinome is the most interesting character in the series besides Teruto. He wants to achieve his dream, whatever that is, and is often pulling strings behind the scenes. Despite being part of Mario's organization, he has an agenda of his own that Mario doesn't know about. Often, he manipulates the cast and uses his mysterious powers to alter events. As the battles go on, he often reacts to certain things that happen or that people say with either displeasement or amusement. I can't read him at all, and look forward to what he is going to do in the next season.The biggest resolve in the series is the redemption of Teruto. He grew up with Kikka, and taught her about Build Divide until she was able to surpass him. Raged with jealousy, he decided to neglect her, steal her cards, and even bury her deck outside. He didn't want to fight the King just to get to the top; ultimately he wanted to apologize for his actions. Kikka had gone mad after being hooked up to a CPU and losing part of herself after making Sakura, but was able to wake up from this after Teruto apologized. In the final battle, Teruto redeems himself and offers himself to save everyone in the end.The battles in Build Divide were mostly amazing. There is the rushed battle here and there, but ultimately they can be very epic such has the conclusion of the card professor battle. The directing was top shelf as Teruto and Sakura synchronized their lines, the music climaxes, and the professor gets exploded into a giant ball of chaos. I didn't know anything about the card game at all but this was  a decent introduction to the rules and functions that I can somewhat understand as I learn along the episodes. The music is incredible, and does a great job adding mystery or intensity to the battles. The art is great and consistent throughout, and overall I have very little complaints about the series. The staff passionately crafted a beautiful and meaningful story. There is still a huge mystery as the world of Neo Tokyo became corrupted, and I can't wait for the return of this series in the Spring 2022 anime season. obsession with bread as well.

Speaking of that: This is a show about card games! I\'d say ""don\'t dismiss it out of hand"" but whether or not you can suspend your disbelief as to all kinds of fights in the universe being resolved through the power of trading cards is pretty make-or-break for a lot of people. I can say that Build Divide: Code Black at least tries to do a slightly more mellow, less adventurous and overall slightly more serious plot than your average Saturday morning...cartoon, but it\'s still about card games in the end. Consider this your formal warning.You follow the story of one Kurabe Teruto, an amnesiac waking up in the mysterious city of Neo Kyoto. He meets with a girl his age, Banka Sakura, who fills him in on how the world works; there\'s one ""King"" that rules the city, and people who want to have any one their wishes granted participate in what\'s called a ""Rebuild Battle"": A city-wide tournament where only a single person gets to have the right to challenge the king to a match. In this city, being good at Build Divide makes or breaks a person, and via collecting twenty-three casino chips they will earn the key to the king\'s lair. Sakura tests Teruto on whether or not he has the strength to reach this goal and, ultimately, set out together to take the challenge.Depending on who you are and the type of anime you\'ve seen, this might sound like the best plot hook in the universe or cliché beyond belief. As an avid card game enjoyer myself, and someone who barely has exposure to shows with similar setups, it\'s a breath of fresh air to have the story hook essentially being a PG-13 death match. What it definitely is not, is Yu-Gi-Oh, despite comparisons you may or may not have heard. Yu-Gi-Oh, even at its most mature, still falls into that Saturday Morning Cartoon Adventure feeling. Even if they don\'t start out that way, all of them end up feeling it by the end. They\'re overly long plotlines that take 100+ episodes to tell, which Build Divide is most certainly not trying to do. It has a focused plotline which it wastes no time in telling (except for when it does) which could be exactly what you want, or leave you wanting for more. The story also aims at a slightly older audience, which you can see shining through in its less colourful setting and general character writing.On the topic of character writing, to give you the short of it; it\'s a mixed bag. To give you the long of it: While most characters in Build Divide are interesting, have depth to them, are cute or have any combination of those three elements, they\'re woefully underutilized. The story mainly focuses on our protagonist Teruto, who, while not a bad character, does take a while to kick into gear and can come off as very one-note until the final stretch of episodes where his character arc finally comes into play and resolves about as quick as it came. Other characters are left either the same as they start, or show up once to then never come around again. The only exception to this would be the main lead Sakura, who gets a lot of intrigue and depth over the course of the show. You\'d question if she were the main character, but with Teruto getting the vast majority of card battles in the show, there\'s no doubt that it is his show in the end.Another thing worth mentioning is that the card battles themselves are not for the inexperienced. In discussion around the show you\'ll often find people complaining they don\'t understand the rules of the game. While I wouldn\'t call the show unclear by any means, it seems to expect the viewer to have at least a basic knowledge of how a battle-centric card game works. It tries its best to rush through a tutorial on the first episode, and slowly trickles in some concepts as it goes, but it generally goes through its battle extremely quickly and never slows down to re-explain anything. Thus, if you\'re not immediately up to speed with the rules from the first episode, you\'re going to have a hard time following. Therefor, even though it might be counter-intuitive, I recommend either making sure you understood what happens in the first episode or look up a rule video ahead of time so you can follow along with the action. The battles, for what they are, seem very reasonably scripted and are easy enough to follow if you know said rules. They\'re also pretty, which is a not-unimportant aspect to mention. There\'s a good amount of tension in them, though one complaint is that the winner is incredibly obvious each and every single time, leaving them lacking in impact by the end. If you\'re a fan of upsets, this isn\'t going to be the place to look.As for the overall plot of Build Divide, it\'s totally okay. The plot goes in a radically different direction to what I\'d personally expected/wanted, and I wish Teruto had dealt with more obstacles and pushback than what he eventually got, but the story is perfectly serviceable on a surface level. The only issue is that the pacing is incredibly weird around the middle part, having what I can only describe as ""filler episodes"" despite its 12-episode runtime. It almost feels like they wanted to do 8 or 9 episodes, and honestly feels like they wasted a bit of time with pointless diversions. The episodes in question are by no means horrible, they just end up feeling pointless in the grand scheme of things.If you\'re a fan of good music by the way, well, even there, I can only give a resounding ""It\'s okay"". The score they have is utilized well and nothing sounds bad, but there\'s nothing in the track that I\'d consider an ""absolute banger"" as they say. You won\'t walk away hating it, but it does end up being pretty forgettable by the end. Mileage on the opening and ending may vary.Overall I would say I enjoyed my time with Build Divide well enough. It has a very strong opener and I do think it sticks the landing on the ending too, but the entire stretch of episodes 5-8 are mediocre enough to me to where I can\'t honestly recommend this as a must-watch. It\'s a shame, as I had high hopes for this, but ultimately it comes down to a ""worth checking out if you\'re a fan of card game anime"" type of deal and a ""go in with tempered expectations if not a card game fan"" on the other end of it. If you want a more traditional card game anime akin to the ever-popular Yu-Gi-Oh, you\'re in the wrong place. This show is much more akin to Wixoss, though even that is not a full one-to-one comparison. Build Divide is very much its own thing and stands on its own merits in the genre, even though those merits may not always be that impressive. cartoon, but it\'s still about card games in the end.

They\'re overly long plotlines that take 100+ episodes to tell, which Build Divide is most certainly not trying to do. It has a focused plotline which it wastes no time in telling (except for when it does) which could be exactly what you want, or leave you wanting for more. The story also aims at a slightly older audience, which you can see shining through in its less colourful setting and general character writing.On the topic of character writing, to give you the short of it; it\'s a mixed bag. To give you the long of it: While most characters in Build Divide are interesting, have depth to them, are cute or have any combination of those three elements, they\'re woefully underutilized. The story mainly focuses on our protagonist Teruto, who, while not a bad character, does take a while to kick into gear and can come off as very one-note until the final stretch of episodes where his character arc finally comes into play and resolves about as quick as it came. Other characters are left either the same as they start, or show up once to then never come around again. The only exception to this would be the main lead Sakura, who gets a lot of intrigue and depth over the course of the show. You\'d question if she were the main character, but with Teruto getting the vast majority of card battles in the show, there\'s no doubt that it is his show in the end.Another thing worth mentioning is that the card battles themselves are not for the inexperienced. In discussion around the show you\'ll often find people complaining they don\'t understand the rules of the game. While I wouldn\'t call the show unclear by any means, it seems to expect the viewer to have at least a basic knowledge of how a battle-centric card game works. It tries its best to rush through a tutorial on the first episode, and slowly trickles in some concepts as it goes, but it generally goes through its battle extremely quickly and never slows down to re-explain anything. Thus, if you\'re not immediately up to speed with the rules from the first episode, you\'re going to have a hard time following. Therefor, even though it might be counter-intuitive, I recommend either making sure you understood what happens in the first episode or look up a rule video ahead of time so you can follow along with the action. The battles, for what they are, seem very reasonably scripted and are easy enough to follow if you know said rules. They\'re also pretty, which is a not-unimportant aspect to mention. There\'s a good amount of tension in them, though one complaint is that the winner is incredibly obvious each and every single time, leaving them lacking in impact by the end. If you\'re a fan of upsets, this isn\'t going to be the place to look.As for the overall plot of Build Divide, it\'s totally okay. The plot goes in a radically different direction to what I\'d personally expected/wanted, and I wish Teruto had dealt with more obstacles and pushback than what he eventually got, but the story is perfectly serviceable on a surface level. The only issue is that the pacing is incredibly weird around the middle part, having what I can only describe as ""filler episodes"" despite its 12-episode runtime. It almost feels like they wanted to do 8 or 9 episodes, and honestly feels like they wasted a bit of time with pointless diversions. The episodes in question are by no means horrible, they just end up feeling pointless in the grand scheme of things.If you\'re a fan of good music by the way, well, even there, I can only give a resounding ""It\'s okay"". The score they have is utilized well and nothing sounds bad, but there\'s nothing in the track that I\'d consider an ""absolute banger"" as they say. You won\'t walk away hating it, but it does end up being pretty forgettable by the end. Mileage on the opening and ending may vary.Overall I would say I enjoyed my time with Build Divide well enough. It has a very strong opener and I do think it sticks the landing on the ending too, but the entire stretch of episodes 5-8 are mediocre enough to me to where I can\'t honestly recommend this as a must-watch. It\'s a shame, as I had high hopes for this, but ultimately it comes down to a ""worth checking out if you\'re a fan of card game anime"" type of deal and a ""go in with tempered expectations if not a card game fan"" on the other end of it. If you want a more traditional card game anime akin to the ever-popular Yu-Gi-Oh, you\'re in the wrong place. This show is much more akin to Wixoss, though even that is not a full one-to-one comparison. Build Divide is very much its own thing and stands on its own merits in the genre, even though those merits may not always be that impressive.', ""We Live in a Children's Trading Card Game Society.Build Divide Code Black is another Yu-Gi-Oh wannabe, but since Yu-Gi-Oh can’t even Yu-Gi-Oh as it used to there was no way in hell this edgy, children’s trading card game promotional tool stood a chance of being good.Although its art style is very appealing and the animation and presentation are very polished, Build Divide fails to deliver on almost every level. The one major point the show has in its favour is the weird, class structure of the void city's population where citizens need to win duels to buy day-to-day essentials. However, they’re stuck in a...system where they can’t get their hands on stronger or rarer cards to give them an edge because the higher mobs of society are hoarding them all and therefore the citizens are on the brink of social upheaval.That’s pretty metal! Especially for a children's card game show. Unfortunately, all of that doesn’t matter, because when the main protagonist Kurabe’s “Yami Yugi” transforms to increase his ability to play a children's card game puts on his black, gamer, bunny ears hoodie and pops a Joker smile across his mouth then you’ve officially lost me. It is too stupid I legitimately burst out laughing the first time I saw it.That’s not the only thing this show does wrong. Boring, bland characters whose goals are to be king of card games or something and flat antagonists. The show doesn’t explain the rules or how the mechanics of the game work so whenever a duelist(?) makes a seemingly bombastic move it doesn’t mean anything. It would be more effective if the players just chucked their cards at each other to try and give the other paper cuts.Once again, this is another trading card game anime that fundamentally doesn’t understand the appeal of a TCG, the deck building. Buying cards, trading with friends, learning strategies and combos, learning and adapting to your opponent's deck and the metagame. These are the things that make any TCG fun. Granted the story that Code Black is telling doesn’t have room to fit these elements in, but if you’re going to take those things away you’ve got to replace them with something of equal value and Build Divide Code Black doesn’t have that. If you’re really into card game anime you might get a kick out of this.

She's obsessive but they don't go psycho yandere face with it. Its a more subtle take on it that makes the terror seep into your skin. Like all card game shows its a barebones advertisement for structure decks and clans with zero application to reality but part of the fun is trying to figure out the mechanics as they don't really explain them much. Worse they straight up skip whole duels and into new ones with no context. I honestly thought I skipped an episode but whatever....As for a scifi setting its relatively visually distinct but a lot of characters look like traces from someone's deviant art account. You have Abec characters and even Kisuke Urahara and a Dogs: Bullets & Carnage guy. It doesn't necessarily detract from the ironic enjoyment of this show but it does make it tacky.The main character's hilariously stupid strapped hoodie design is bolstered infinitely by the legions of impressionable teens who think its cool and want to copy it. Egoist returns but this time with a Kpop take which I was honestly mildly uncomfortable with. It didn't grow on me but I didn't wind up hating it either.Its kinda just something to watch while you get drunk with friends who play card games.

Special mention to Hiyori's VA for delivering a voice that resonated greatly with her character's look/mannerisms, despite said character being just there for reacts.Overall - Barely 8Applying my discretion here to bump up the score because of the strong feels at certain points.
