GS Mikami: Gokuraku Daisakusen!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3037/GS_Mikami__Gokuraku_Daisakusen,"[""Nothing special. It's like Bastard in the sense that neither take themselves too seriously. Both are over the top (intentionally) and put comedy in places it wouldn't normally be. Bastard is better, but this is worth a watch. Story is incomplete as it's basically taken right from the series at some random point. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. Animation is typical of early 90's anime. Some good action, but pretty tame overall. "", 'Being the only movie for the Ghost Sweeper Mikami series, its\'a good one which serves best as introduction for people to watch the anime.The story for the film focuses on the revival of Nosferatu who has assassinated & acted as Oda Nobunaga. Essentially, the goal of the movie is like any other shonen series being defeat the bad guy & his minions. While this Mikami features offers a bit more action than the anime, it still delivers on its comedy which is a good thing.One of the highlights of the film is the animation increase as it displayed a few good visual pieces during...the zombie infection & Mikami\'s battle against Nosferatu spider minion. It is also a bit more bloody than usual but no to the point where it makes a giant shift in tone like in ""The Slayers"". My only complaint to the movie is that it doesn\'t involve the other characters such as Dr. Chaos, Maria, Emi, etc in a more productive role as their scenes are brief but worth watching.The English dub was performed by Manga Entertainment which comes off as okay (makes me curious how the popularity of this series would be if the whole anime was dubbed). As a another note, the soundtrack for the English version is changed with some tracks resembling covers of the original OST or being more fast beat themes to hype up the action(Similar to Bruce Falconer & Manga\'s release of Fist Of The North Star). The music is good but doesn\'t have that variety that the anime series has. On the subject of music I believe the ending song of the film is called ""My Jolly Days"" by Masami Ouki.Overall, the comedy is perfect & the additional action is a nice treat for the fans but doesn\'t offer too much variety among other anime films, but it\'s definitely good with its unique qualities being the characters & its sense of humor. Hopefully this film can get some more exposure as this feature should get people interested to watching the anime & reading the manga. the zombie infection & Mikami\'s battle against Nosferatu spider minion.

One of those where all the sweepers come together to fight some world renown creature. It's exactly what you'd expect: visuals have been upped a little, plot is a bit tighter and more epic, etc. It still has many of the recurring jokes from the series.The plot is pretty standard: there's an even more eviler vampire lord and Mikami's desire for money results in her fighting it. I would have liked a bit more effectiveness from the other sweepers. They all get about one good move in at some...point and that's it. Heck, in the end we don't even get to see what happened with them really. It does have some pretty funny moments, just don't take it seriously. point and that's it.

Gregory Horror Show,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6069/Gregory_Horror_Show,"['Gregory Horror Show, where to start with this series? I guess I’ll start with how I came acrossed such an obscure series. My friend recently purchase a bundle of anime dvd’s, in said bundle was the ever intriguing Gregory Horror Show. With its awkward 3D CGI animation and title in fonts reminiscent of Microsoft Word 2003’s word art, I had to give it a try!For a show that is supposed to be a horror/comedy (as described by the dvd’s back) I was hoping for a lot more. Each episode starts with our “protagonist” giving a short voice over which sets the tone or “theme”...for the episode. This is actually a detail I quite like, but the rest of the show falls short, nothing is actually scary. Although you can tell that the show is trying, the spooks just fall flat and the humor is badly timed. Over the course of season 1 I don’t recall laughing at all, or getting scared. I do remember cringing at some points but that is do to the fact that the dvd I received only has the English dub which is pretty painful to begin with.There’s not much else to really say about the show. The characters have pretty unique personalities. The animation is lackluster but not particularly bad. The sound design is nothing special. The plot is pretty dull, they even explain things that you could have potentially enjoyed trying to find meaning for on your own. Overall the show is a let down; it’s really short running about 3 minutes per episode, but it’s not really worth your time.(Side note the side story “Gregory Horror Show: The Bloody Karte” is a bit better some of the jokes actually stick and work well with the characters.) for the episode.

Very decision based and the conclusion to reason makes you think. The idea of not knowing who the narator is a wonderful concept. A very good role playing game.ArtI can not think of any way i would change it. All details that would come to mind of what i would expect were there. The art was no question relevant to the plot.SoundVoices as well as sound effects not only matched the mood but were timed perfectly....Character backstoryNormally i would say it was confusing but that was the point here. If it was simple or you could follow through it would ruin the adventure. This story on background i can see to be the type where you pause and have a debate on what has happened and what will happen.PlotPlot is very thick. Unless you are wise i mean extremely open minded you will fall for each of their traps. Some traps are obvious others are not so much. The idea of the obvious traps with trick later down the road.

This special is but a simple plot of trying to find a lost boy during a Halloween festival with a ""Lost Jack"" lurking the the shadows.To be expected of a Halloween special, the main gang of Lyria, Djeeta, Vyrn and new characters Cagliostro and Ferry join them in this Halloween special, Cagliostro being a snarky summoner and Ferry a Ghost Girl, where they get Trick or Treated, eat lots of candy and cookies and find the lost boy and Lost Jack in the process.The animation...once again done by A1-Pictures is done to it\'s great detail from the original series including the newly decked out characters designs (sans Vyrn), with all their Halloween costumes and the atmosphere of being a Halloween festival is prominent in the animation.The voice acting is decent enough, though LA was kinda surprised that Cagliostro was voiced by SAKURA TANGE of all people with what LA could predict that the mother of the lost boy being voiced by Satomi Arai and the lost boy himself sounds like Mariya Ise?. Nonetheless a VERY great cast and happy to hear Nao Touyama as Lyria and Hisako Kanemoto back as Djeeta from the final episode of the original series back.Really if anything this Granblue Fantasy special is an oddly uplifting Halloween episode, with having a rather heartwarming moment of where both the living and the dead get to have fun together (hey it\'s almost like it\'s celebrating Japanese Bon Festival) and it emanates through the rest of this special, yes even the part of Lost Jack of all things being the catalyst to it all. Usually Halloween episodes are meant to scare you or be horror-filled jump scares but Granblue Fantasy\'s is different by having the aesthetics of Halloween right for a fantasy land, but giving off a contrasting atmosphere of heartwarming and heartfelt moments and heck it did it to great effect. once again done by A1-Pictures is done to it\'s great detail from the original series including the newly decked out characters designs (sans Vyrn), with all their Halloween costumes and the atmosphere of being a Halloween festival is prominent in the animation.The voice acting is decent enough, though LA was kinda surprised that Cagliostro was voiced by SAKURA TANGE of all people with what LA could predict that the mother of the lost boy being voiced by Satomi Arai and the lost boy himself sounds like Mariya Ise?.

It\'s just porn with extra steps.There\'s kind of a story here, but it\'s mostly just a loosely connected series of panty shots and as many frames of nipple as they can get away with before it becomes unrated adult material.

So if it wasn\'t clear, I can\'t in good conscious rate this critical anything higher than 6/10, because the name given to a rating of 6 is ""fine.""

The 20 episodes that are there can basically be summarized into the synopsis given with like the added fact that MC is OP and is just getting started on his comeback to power by establishing his dominance in his new family with some weird side romance type of deal going on aside from his wife. It has the feel that its going to be like Wushen Zhuzai (The god of war dominates). However this anime's 20 episodes only shows you like the first 10 episodes worth of story...progression of the 272 in Wushen Zhuzai.

The master reincarnates into Su Yi, the trash fiancé of  Wen Lingzhao of Wen family, the eldest daughter of one of the four major families in their city. Seen as a useless martial artist who lost his cultivation, Su Yi makes use of his previous life experience to revitalise his cultivation base and climb the ladder of power to find clues about the death of his mother and his past life disciples.Story & Characters:...3/10The story starts off very abruptly and skips a lot of plot points so we’re left in the dark from the get go; There are a lot of plot holes throughout the series up until the end that it becomes confusing to discern Su Yi’s objectives as he explores the world around him. The cultivation system isn’t described clear enough which may be due to the translation discrepancies. There isn’t any substance to the concept of cultivation levels when Su Yi can defeat practitioners in higher realms than his own with flashy sword auras. The story’s progression is very slow and it doesn’t help that a lot of the development is paused by side characters intentionally making trouble with Su Yi only to be protected for being a saviour to an important political figure. I did enjoy several moments where Su Yi’s knowledge of the past life aided in his understanding of curing illnesses but they were unrelated to major plot development. The characters are obviously lacklustre and their involvement with Su Yi’s lifestyle feels superficial especially his sister in law who he obviously favours over his fiancé/wife. The characters all bend to Su Yi’s will because of his reputation with important characters, only extras challenge him but only from afar. Overall, the story and characters feel underdeveloped and full of flaws.Art & Sound: 2/10My eyes were blown away by how jarring it was to watch this series. Character movement and flow of the camera were difficult to follow because they felt very unrefined and stiff. It doesn’t help that the texture quality and ambient lighting were nearly non existent making the scenes appear like a unskippable mobile advertisement. The colors of this show are muted, skin tones are pale and look more like clay than skin; This is a common theme for the environment where the backgrounds are starved of detail.Sound was atrocious; Quality and expression of voice actors were poor quality and the action scenes were devoid of proper sound effects and well timed suspenseful music. It fell apart in terms of audio and visuals making the viewing experience worse in conjunction to port story and characters.Overall & Enjoyment: 3/10I’m lucky enough not to have to watch more than 8min per episode let alone more than 20 episodes for the first season because it’s clear the series won’t improve if it had longer or increases episodes. This series failed at broadening the scope because it was stuck trying to introduce all the important characters to the story in a short period which led to obvious story points being rushed.

Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this series. I don\'t care that it\'s repetitive in a sense of same theme different characters, I think it\'s a great series on a whole.

I don’t mind this at all my only problem is that the horror atmosphere was ruined  and turned into and edgy comedy show. I will be honest I had a good laugh at that family arc where everybody hated someone. The characters actions where so damn funny that the emotional atmosphere was ruined and the way they beat up each other and scream was so edgy that made me almost drop this anime.Also the main story is exactly the same thing from season 3 but they changed the character art style and the  story of the girl who will succed as Jigoku Shoujo to make it look original.

After he uses it, he decides he will be a serial killer because he\'s going into hell anyway.  Well, if being a serial killer is so easy, why didn\'t he kill his family?  The third episode is full of idiocies, i can understand a member of the family is a bad person, but why everyone? The cousin comes home and punches his uncle and her aunt in the face, then, why not call the police? I mean, if an uncle came to my house and punched my family i would call the police, i\'m pretty sure you can\'t go in a house, punch the owners and get away with it.  After he punches them, her daughter says ""hey he\'s sensitive you have to understand him"".  I mean, he just punched your parents in the face, you can\'t be an idiot forever.  So in this family, everyone is a bad person; and the protagonist wants to kill everyone because he is a good person, so he becomes a serial killer, why does he need Enma Ai? Because this series tries to make you think ""good"" people are stupid. This show really insults your intelligence.End of spoiler.The characters designs are awful, Deen should just stop animating for once.  All the budget goes to Enma, of course.  We stili get stupid characters like Yamawaro, that loves saying ""princess"" and winding up her car.  Also, why is Kikuri still there? The music is nothing special.  But let\'s talk about the pacing.  Remember when Enma used to be called by her grandma, remember when she traveled on her carriage? Remember when she tortured evil souls and paddled slowly into the gates of hell? Well, almost all of that is gone, the tortures, and the paddling, everything is rushed.  You can even see how they try to end the episode quickly.  This anime used to be slow-paced and nice, not rushed drama.

The cousin comes home and punches his uncle and her aunt in the face, then, why not call the police? I mean, if an uncle came to my house and punched my family i would call the police, i\'m pretty sure you can\'t go in a house, punch the owners and get away with it.  After he punches them, her daughter says ""hey he\'s sensitive you have to understand him"".  I mean, he just punched your parents in the face, you can\'t be an idiot forever.  So in this family, everyone is a bad person; and the protagonist wants to kill everyone because he is a good person, so he becomes a serial killer, why does he need Enma Ai? Because this series tries to make you think ""good"" people are stupid. This show really insults your intelligence.End of spoiler.The characters designs are awful, Deen should just stop animating for once.  All the budget goes to Enma, of course.  We stili get stupid characters like Yamawaro, that loves saying ""princess"" and winding up her car.  Also, why is Kikuri still there? The music is nothing special.  But let\'s talk about the pacing.  Remember when Enma used to be called by her grandma, remember when she traveled on her carriage? Remember when she tortured evil souls and paddled slowly into the gates of hell? Well, almost all of that is gone, the tortures, and the paddling, everything is rushed.  You can even see how they try to end the episode quickly.  This anime used to be slow-paced and nice, not rushed drama.  If you think this is ""dark and twisted"", then, Jigoku Shoujo will mostly become the new Mirai Nikki or Elfen Lied.', ""There is nothing I hate more than an anime failing to accomplish its main goal.In Jigoku shoujo's case, it's showing the dark side of humans, filled with greed, resentment, jealousy,  violence, etc. But it fails Horribly.Let me repeat, HORRIBLY.No single character is realistic. To the average eye, it may look like the characters are dark and filled with personalities to explore. But in reality, the writers are just lazy. They try to make the characters as bad and pathetic as possible, but they completely forget the main thing that makes a character interesting, motivation. The characters in the anime have no motivation for their...action. It's all based on some blatant dull reason. In episode 5, why did the villagers suddenly go against the family who were so nice to them? How could people have a change of heart so fast? Why did the family not move? Why was the rich family so pissed at the family? Why was their KID so pissed off at them? Why were the kids in the car little bitches? Do you seriously think I will buy that the parents did not notice  their child being bullied?

I have watched it for 3 seasons despite others' criticism towards its tendency to repeat its own plot. However, season 4 is a disgrace and has brought shame to this show which has so much potential.SPOILER (but not really since they just copy paste)The season began with the concept which is copy pasted from season 3, where another girl with hatred lost her memory from her previous life and was now forced to be the next Hell Girl to atone for her sin.

(just let that sink in)The Hell Girl (Jigoku Shoujo) series can be considered a...collection of short stories that never span for longer than one episode, with one exception in which it is divided in two parts, where different characters are involved in a number of events linked to the Hell Correspondence (Jigoku Tsuushin) a group of supernatural entities that have been tasked with providing humans with a ""service"" of sorts that allows them to send people to hell, provided that they have accepted the conditions of the contract that is formed between them and Enma Ai, who is a mysterious, emotionless girl playing the role of the protagonist in every season.The premise remains unchanged but there\'s always a deuteragonist, a character whose story takes place in a different context which develops independently or even tangentially from each of the stories, yet they invariably find themselves sharing a unique kind of relationship with Enma Ai.In Yoi no Togi, we are presented with one of those new characters, a nameless girl wearing a green dress, whose existence appears to be similar to that of Enma Ai and as such is infered to be that of a supernatural entity in the human world.In all seasons, the different short stories deal with an assorted variety of dark themes such as dysfunctional families, abusive relationships, physical and psychological torture, deep resentment and sentimental conflicts which cause major distress to those who are subject to them, but always with a focus on the pain that builds up and festers a desperate need for an individual to accept the eradication of another person as the solution to an inescapable conflict even on the face of the prospect of spending an eternity in \'Hell\', which is then accepted as a more desirable fate than enduring the present state of affairs. In that sense, the only common underlying theme to all of the stories appears to be that tragic fate which awaits both the victim and the aggresor and the internalization of the concept of \'Hell\' as a state of endless damnation and suffering of the soul, and with little to no mention of a \'Heaven\' throughout the series it becomes evident that there\'s an interest on the part of the Hell Correspondence (and Ai herself especially) for these people to actively choose hell as the only alternative instead of finding a different (if any) solution to the conflict, as there are only exceptional cases where sending someone to hell was not the ultimate and decisive goal set by either the victim or Enma Ai\'s team even when the option existed for them to solve the conflict without sending anyone to hell.Now if you\'d ask me, I\'d say the stories themselves might be the best part of the entire show, they are like urban legends, things that may or may not have happened, but such as all urban legends, you just know it has that bit of truth somewhere in there, and makes you wonder what would have actually happened without the added supernatural aspect of the Hell Correspondence as the cop-out method to reach that much needed ""closure"" and solve the problems that its clients face, those times you feel the need to take a side, and decide for yourself which one is in the right, it gives you that sense of foreboding that resembles the expectations of a human drama as you follow it closely to the end, and even when you know that the only possible conclusion is the obvious one (i.e someone will go to hell), it\'s often never as simple as agreeing that what the victim did was the right thing, simply for the fact that he/she was being victimized or made to endure a living hell, there\'s the anticipation and realization that the outcome isn\'t going to be exactly what you were expecting, and the theoretical contrast between the concept of hell and whether life can be worse or the same.But at the same time, there are those episodes where stories are just barely realistic, and or, loosely based on existing stories that are commonplace in the horror and mystery lore even when they are not carbon copies, episode 13 and 17 from season one come to mind, and don\'t seem to serve much purpouse other than filling a time slot, this might be a problem for some but as I see it, the only people that would enjoy Hell Girl would be those willing to sit through a slow paced development, the dark themes alone demand of the viewer a certain measure of contemplation and deep thought and there\'s barely any room for entertainment sometimes even when the third season tried to be a bit less serious on the punishment sequences and gave Ai a bit of a (sick) humor sense mixed with some strange ""fanservice"" bits, you can forget about that in Yoi no Togi though, this one went back to the first season in that department.Incidentally, I feel that the themes pertaining the nature of hell itself versus life in the living world once again becomes a central theme in Yoi no Togi, which I believe fell somewhat short on its execution compared to the other seasons, maybe has something to do with the time they actually dedicated to developing the character of Michiru, who went from nameless amnesiac girl, to what she would become in what? 3-4 episodes? now this is probably not a bad thing, but taking half a cour to build up the character and their motives and then following with an abrupt conclusion wasn\'t probably the best way to come back after 3 seasons with almost 25 episodes each, though in all honesty I\'m biased for Hajime\'s story so I could be setting the bar too high here.Animation on the other hand, has never been exceptionally great, but for this type of work the visuals are not the main attraction, so I can forgive that much, even then in Yoi no Togi, there has been a significant improvement from the type of animation we are used to, looking back to the first season, you can see how the animation team in studio Deen has moved up from the early 2000 digital animation techniques to the current animation programs with the typical crisp lineart you see in 2012 and up anime, and yet the character designs remain consistent with the previous seasons which is already a lot considering it\'s been well over 10 years.All things considered, I don\'t feel disappointed revisiting this series in what will probably be the last season, I\'m glad to be met with the same lovely Hell Girl I remember from a while back, but nostalgia aside, I feel this type of work being preserved as it was with little to no changes is probably for the best, a rare hybrid between a slice of life and a horror supernatural drama that never gets old, a timeless anthology of misery and tragedy. collection of short stories that never span for longer than one episode, with one exception in which it is divided in two parts, where different characters are involved in a number of events linked to the Hell Correspondence (Jigoku Tsuushin) a group of supernatural entities that have been tasked with providing humans with a ""service"" of sorts that allows them to send people to hell, provided that they have accepted the conditions of the contract that is formed between them and Enma Ai, who is a mysterious, emotionless girl playing the role of the protagonist in every season.The premise remains unchanged but there\'s always a deuteragonist, a character whose story takes place in a different context which develops independently or even tangentially from each of the stories, yet they invariably find themselves sharing a unique kind of relationship with Enma Ai.In Yoi no Togi, we are presented with one of those new characters, a nameless girl wearing a green dress, whose existence appears to be similar to that of Enma Ai and as such is infered to be that of a supernatural entity in the human world.In all seasons, the different short stories deal with an assorted variety of dark themes such as dysfunctional families, abusive relationships, physical and psychological torture, deep resentment and sentimental conflicts which cause major distress to those who are subject to them, but always with a focus on the pain that builds up and festers a desperate need for an individual to accept the eradication of another person as the solution to an inescapable conflict even on the face of the prospect of spending an eternity in \'Hell\', which is then accepted as a more desirable fate than enduring the present state of affairs.

I am choosing to write this, however, because I want to be honest with people before they waste their time.If you\'ve watched the other 3 seasons you know the formula of this series. It can be tedious and redundant, but it has its charm in the end. I even enjoyed most of mitsuganae (season 3) despite the criticism it received. The final arc of each season was always what made the series worth watching in my opinion.Upon finding out a 4th season was coming out, I was absolutely...ecstatic. I kept an open mind and enjoyed the first few episodes, but here\'s what makes this season horrible:Yoi no Togi gives us the same themes we\'ve all seen before. What makes it frustrating is it takes humanity and makes them the dumbest, most evil creatures to the point where it\'s entirely unrealistic. Apparently things like the police don\'t exist in this world. One character forms a negatively skewed point of view and every one else piggybacks right onto that opinion without a second thought and suddenly everyone hates one innocent person for absolutely no good reason - at least that\'s the story with the new main character they added.Overall it was the same premise of ""here\'s this girl that\'s dead that\'s supposed to become the new Hell Girl for some reason"". (even though she didn\'t do anything wrong, but I guess that\'s up to your interpretations/values since it follows the religions and values of Japan as far as I am aware) However this was only the story for THE FIRST 6 EPISODES.This is a 12 episode season. The ""new""/main story ends halfway through.Not only is this appalling and unacceptable for an anime to do, but those 6 episodes were very poorly fleshed out. I feel if they slowed down the pace, added more development and such to the story, it could have spanned out at least a little longer. The storytelling itself seems rushed and a lot is unexplained. Within the same episode the girl destined to become the next Hell Girl says she\'ll never ever do it, and strongly opposes it, and then a little later suddenly becomes the Hell Girl and is doing her job? What does that leave Ai and her crew with? It\'s unexplained and unsatisfying.So after that story ends, the anime lets you know that the next 6 episodes of the season will be LITERAL RE-RUNS OF SEASON 1. They aren\'t re-animated, they aren\'t re-done in any way-- just a blatant re-run of episodes we\'ve already seen. Why? What is the purpose of this? I waited until the re-run episode came out before I wrote a review because I wanted to give it a chance. Who knows, maybe we would have been pleasantly surprised if they did something new with it? Nope. It feels like they just completely gave up and didn\'t know what to do for the rest of the series.It\'s sad and inexcusable to me to be honest. I value quality over quantity and while I was happy to see more new Hell Girl, I was greatly let down and would have preferred if this season didn\'t exist at all.If you\'re a huge fan like myself, you\'ll likely want to watch at least the first 6 episodes, which is fair. After that though? It\'s almost insulting and you don\'t need to waste your time.

I have always loved the various Hell Girl anime series. They\'re almost all episodic, to the point that you can pick up anywhere. The characters are usually personable, making you want to learn more about what makes them so horrible. The Hell Girl crew is enjoyable to watch as they seem so worn about what they\'ve seen in the world. The animation is usually big eyed creep fest, plus beautiful florals. Add in thematic and atmospheric music. Sounds great, right? Well, throw all that out...the window for this 4th season.

No, not milking. Draining. I have no words to describe my disappointment.The series had a decent first season – the first episode plunges you right in the middle of the story without needless info dumping. In each episode, you are only given the information necessary to understand the current situation, and as time passes new elements of the puzzle are discovered that serve to unravel the mystery surrounding Enma Ai. The story isn’t without its flaws, with repetitiveness and bad pacing being the worst offenders. Many of the cases could have been merged as they were...of similar character, and most of the overarching plot development came in the later part of the series.All in all, the first season was nothing to write home about but it wasn't bad to the point of unwatchable either. It was just decent. Had the story ended with the first season, it still would have been a fitting ending but I wouldn't have cared for any of the characters. I have to admit I'm not into episodic shows, especially ones where the overarching plot takes a long time to develop but I still liked Jigoku Shoujo. I'd say I realized I like it once it was over.Then I watched the second season and I fell in love with the characters. One can say the characters grew on me through repetition. Yes, repetition. I've seen many single cour shows and wondered how the characters would have developed were there more episodes. By the end of S2 Jigoku Shoujo had 52 episodes and that's an awful lot for the small cast of recurring characters. This naturally gave each of these characters enough screen time for development and let me get to know them. The last arc of the season somehow reminded me of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, which happens to be one of my favorite shows and that made me like Jigoku Shoujo even more. The final episode of S2 was in my opinion the best possible conclusion to the series.From there on, everything went downhill. S3 was where the first signs of milking appeared. I went into S3 with no idea what to expect as the end of S2 left nothing more to be solved. Yet the showrunners somehow decided to shrug off the explanation to the one simple question that bothered me throughout the entire S3 - why and how did Ai come back? It appears handwaving that question was how S3 was able to come into fruition, all be it with a large plot hole at its core. Anyway, by the end of S3 the story had acquired some semblance of sense of its own right so as to give it yet another meaningful conclusion. Still not better than S2 but at least it didn't do any major harm to the existing story.And then I saw S4 and that abomination was the reason I wrote this wall of text. The showrunners completely outdid themselves with that one - retconning the events of S3 as if they never happened. I don't want to give away any spoilers but you'll know it when you see it. S4 aired 9 years after S3 and who knows, maybe the showrunners believed fans had already forgotten the events of S3 or that they haven't seen S3 at all. Or maybe the showrunners themselves forgot S3 existed, which would be the worst case scenario. Me? I binged all seasons in a week’s time so everything was pretty fresh in my memory.S4 was full with inconsistencies and plot holes but that wasn't its only downfall. Its greatest transgression were the characters. Not Ai-chan and her comrades - no, they were already well developed in the previous seasons so I bear no grudges against them. My peeve was with the other characters, you know, the ones who appear only in their respective episode. The problem with those characters was that they were profound idiots. Each one of them. Bad guys were bad for the sake of being bad, good guys were framed by bad guys due to miscommunication (ahh, my favorite trope) and lack of proper investigation by authorities, and nothing anyone did made any sense.Episode 1 was about yet another student being bullied at school and that’s about it. I didn't quite get what was going on in episode 2 – it was a mess from beginning to end. And episode 3 felt like a bad joke. Seriously, this was the worst episode of Jigoku Shoujo in the history of the anime. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. I couldn’t help but laugh at the ending – that’s how bad it was. Episode 4 was similar though a bit more subdued. It still didn't make much sense. The last two episodes were about the new recurring character of the show - Michiru. I'm not gonna spoil anything but suffice to say two episodes and a couple of cameos are not enough to develop a new character. Compare Michiru to Yuzuki of S3 and you’ll see what I mean. I didn’t bother watching the recap episodes as I had watched the original episodes some days earlier, so I won’t be commenting about them.As a whole, Jigoku Shoujo S4 was like watching an orgy of everything that had made the previous seasons good but written by someone with no sense of human psychology and taken to the extreme for the sake of… what? Attention? Maybe the writers believed fans would like the show more if there was more gratuitous violence. You know, the hackneyed trope of always making sequels bigger instead of deeper. First season had dragons. Well, let’s add more dragons in S2. Or first season had mechas. Can you guess what’s going to make S2 an even bigger success than S1? But of course - MORE MECHAS!!!!Unfortunately, Jigoku Shoujo S4 suffers from the same “shallow sequel syndrome”. Previous seasons had violence. So let’s add even more violence in S4 even though it’s done in a very poor taste and makes the bad guys look like props used to give the other characters an incentive to summon Ai.

Hell Girl: Fourth Twilight is an absolute disgrace to the series, and while I still strongly believe the series should\'ve ended as a trilogy, this fourth season seriously had potential to be a worthy successor of Three Vessels. It seems that it wasn\'t planned out properly and Studio Deen just made it for the sake of having a fourth season. Look at the time between the ending of Three Vessels and the beginning...of Fourth Twilight, the former finished airing at the end of Spring 2009 and the latter started on Summer 2017. That\'s eight years compared to one season between the first two seasons and one year between the second and third seasons. Plus, the first two seasons ended on cliffhangers telling the audience that the series will continue. Three Vessels had no such indicator of a future continuation, so anybody watching at the time would\'ve assumed that\'s where the Hell Girl timeline ends, and after a strong finale too.Even though I selected the Not Recommended label, let\'s not get all too negative right off the bat. After all, Fourth Twilight does have its redeeming qualities that helps it avoid the lowest score of 1. I will begin by listing all the good parts of this season.First, this season maintains the series staple of having an introduction before the beginning of each episode and then playing the opening. I hardly memorize them even though I never skipped them, but it does present the dark atmosphere Hell Girl is all about. They also kept the staple of the first episode taking place in a school and the first victim character is a victim of bullying.Second, the soundtrack is pretty decent. Although I have to admit, the opening song feels more like it would suit a magical girl anime better. The beginning of the opening sequence solidifies this with having all the butterflies come together around Ai Enma to transform into the uniform she wears. The ending song is a pretty chill tune, and it\'s nice to see that Mamiko Noto, Ai\'s voice actress, still sings the ending song for the series. Speaking of voices...Third, it\'s impressive that eight years later, they kept all the original voice cast for Ai and her followers. They all still capture their characters perfectly just like they did back in the original trilogy.Fourth, the third episode is actually pretty good. Compared to all the other filler episodes, this one is pure insanity at its finest. It is all about a family that is dysfunctional beyoud belief and Wanyudo even says that they are a bigger Hell than Hell itself.Fifth, technology! The original trilogy aired from Fall 2005 to Spring 2009, so things like smartphones and high definition televisions didn\'t exist yet nor were popular when they first came out back then. Since it\'s 2017, of course there will be smartphones and that\'s how people access the Hell Link now. At least the world of Hell Girl is keeping up with real life technology.Sixth... um... the artstyle and animation is mostly faithful to how the original trilogy looked, just in a high definition tone now.Seventh... hmm... ... ...Oh! Near the end of the opening sequence, there are cute little pinwheels, a throwback to the first season\'s opening.Did I just call the pinwheels cute? Oh my GOSH! What is wrong with me?!So now... do you all have the time to listen to me whine about Fourth Twilight? I am so not going to enjoy this.Here\'s a very brief episode by episode analysis of what happens in this season. I did state that it\'s a staple that the first character to access the Hell Link is a victim of bullying. See... the first season\'s first episode was a simple base, the second had a plot twist of the bully being a teacher, and the third had a greater plot twist that the hated teacher wasn\'t so bad after all. Fourth Twilight begins with... social media slander??? I\'m sorry, but that story can easily be done with computers and laptops did exist in 2005-2009. Long story short, it\'s not as impressive as Two Mirrors and Three Vessels\' beginnings.Episode 2 is centered around a comedic duo where at first glance, one is superior over the other, but it\'s actually the opposite, and it seems they both were getting tired of show business and agreed to be together forever in Hell. Honestly, it feels like a weaker version of the Mari and Juri story from Two Mirrors.Like I said, the third episode is good, very good! There is just nothing redeemable for the majority of the family members in that episode. We\'re talking about an episode that is truly worthy to be a Hell Girl episode. As much as I dislike the season, this is the best episode it has delivered thus far.Episode 4 takes place in a Senior Citizen Center, and the person in charge is obviously abusive towards the elderly. I will give praise to the idea to have Wanyudo blend in with the seniors and bond with the one who wants to send the abusive head caretaker to Hell. Oh, and Tsugumi\'s here too... except it seems the writers didn\'t do their homework and fumbled her dialogue. Tsugumi states that working at the Senior Citizen Center is her ""first job,"" but everyone knows she started off as a school nurse at Yuzuki\'s school back in Three Vessels.All throughout, we are greeted with a new character named Michiru, who mysteriously appeared before Ai and believes the Hell Link is wrong. For episodes 5 and 6, we learn who she is and her backstory is a freakish monstrosity that tried to combine Ai and Yuzuki\'s tragic childhoods only to result in giving the worst of both worlds. Michiru hails from a town that didn\'t have electricity of any kind until her father convinced the landlord to permit lightbulbs to be installed all over town. Apparently, the landlord didn\'t want this, and was even peeved that he eventually gave in. The landlord\'s son blindly agrees with his father and he and his cohorts bullied Michiru and eventually attempted to drown her. Let me cuss, please... OVER ELECTRICITY?! ARE YOU SH!TTING ME?!Fortunately, the ground right underneath the kids gave away and they all fell in the water, and Michiru was the only one who knows how to swim. The landlord\'s son and his partners in crime perished, so what do you do when multiple kids experience something so dangerously fatal and only one survives it? Why of course, assume that it means the remaining child murdered the others and then completely ostracize her and her parents! Congratulations, townspeople! You successfully... just copied Yuzuki\'s story, except the innocent little girl herself gets accused instead of her father. The hate got worse over time and one guy kidnaps Michiru and locked her up in an abandoned storage house for ten days... okay, she shouldn\'t have survived since humans can last up to seven days without food or drink. When her parents found her, the townspeople resorted to splitting the father\'s head open with a crowbar and then burning the whole family by setting the storage house on fire. Right before her death, Michiru, who has been very patient and forgiving this whole time, completely snaps and sent the fire to burn her entire village and its people down with her. Gee... where did we hear that before? Why yes! Ai did set her village on fire after she was buried alive and resurrected as an undead in order to take revenge on everyone.Seriously, Michiru\'s origins are completely poorly written and put together. First of all, Hell Girl candidates die first before committing their unforgivable sin as undeads. I just said Ai was buried alive in her time. This is because she was born in a time in the 17th century where the Japanese believe they must sacrifice a seven year old girl every seven years for good harvest. To ensure she wouldn\'t have the strength to dig her way out, the villagers hit Ai in the face with a shovel. Her grudge brought her back from the dead, so she got out anyway. Yuzuki most likely passed away from having nothing for survival. Her desire to live created a false world where she would still be alive. Michiru didn\'t die yet, so the writers have completely contradicted the rules of Hell Girl\'s world. Plus, since the issue was electricity of all things, she would have to be from about 150 years ago. Where has she been all this time? We know Yuzuki is from nine years before the events of Three Vessels since she was in kindergarten when she was ostracized. I know this was never directly said, but she was in the ninth grade during the season, so it just takes simple math to guess what time she\'s from.Michiru at first doesn\'t accept to be the next Hell Girl until she developed interest in a couple\'s case. She successfully becomes Ai\'s successor and unlike Yuzuki, Michiru actually followed the rules of being a Hell Girl. Episode 6 ends showing what has become of Ai and her companions. Yamawaro decided to serve Michiru under Ai\'s consent. Kikuri is depressed about Yamawaro\'s departure. Ai, Wanyudo, Ichimokuren, and Hone Onna are all taking a break from operating the Hell Link. The episode ends showing that even if Ai is no longer the one answering requests, she\'s still allowed to live, so you would think that the next episode will show how they\'re all doing, but then Studio Deen pulled this cr@p: Reminiscence Episodes.What are Reminiscence Episodes, you ask? Well well well... these episodes are... randomly selected episodes from the original trilogy copy-pasted. Okay well, they each show what Ai\'s companions are up to in a little pub, but the characters are now in the form of paper dolls and Ai herself doesn\'t even make an appearance! To top it all off, the choice selection of episodes for reminiscence aren\'t even the best choices. They chose Baseball Boys, Poorly Hidden Adultery, Depressed Texting, House on a Highway, Masochistic Waifu, and for the final episode, they picked...S... S... S... SS... SSS... SSSSSSSSS...STRAY INARI?!Did I mention there may be a stinker episode in Three Vessels? Yeah, I did and that episode is indeed Stray Inari. All I can say is that episode is nonsensical in a very bad way, and I can\'t believe that out of all the Three Vessels episodes they could have picked to end on, they chose this one. This is NOT how I want to remember Hell Girl, and Studio Deen truly ruined their very own creation, but seriously... no other series does Reminiscene Episodes. If I want to relive past episodes, I\'ll just go over to the previous seasons. There was no excuse to go this direction. Since half of Fourth Twilight\'s episodes were sacrificed for this pointless shtick, we did not receive enough episodes to come to like Michiru. She\'s just there to do a better job of being Ai\'s successor than Yuzuki, and that\'s it. We do not see her have character development, and her story should\'ve been saved to be Episodes 11 and 12, or 10 and 11, if they want the 12th and final one to serve as post-story content, like some shows like to do. We should\'ve had more dark and psychological content throughout this season to give Michiru the chance to be a more memorable character and if Studio Deen really cared about the series, they would\'ve definitely made a much better backstory than the one we actually got.Hell Girl: Fourth Twilight had the potential to revive the waves of popularity for the series, but failed miserably. I am giving it 4/10 since it does have its share of things done right, but the main story arc got cut short and no new twist to the formula was brought to the table. If you want to have any Hell Girl discussions with me, keep in mind that I like to neglect Fourth Twilight. The original trilogy will always be a treat to rewatch when I want something dark for the month of October, but this season?There was no craziness, there was no uncertainty, and it definitely did not give me any life! of Fourth Twilight, the former finished airing at the end of Spring 2009 and the latter started on Summer 2017.

They chose Baseball Boys, Poorly Hidden Adultery, Depressed Texting, House on a Highway, Masochistic Waifu, and for the final episode, they picked...S... S... S... SS... SSS... SSSSSSSSS...STRAY INARI?!Did I mention there may be a stinker episode in Three Vessels? Yeah, I did and that episode is indeed Stray Inari. All I can say is that episode is nonsensical in a very bad way, and I can\'t believe that out of all the Three Vessels episodes they could have picked to end on, they chose this one. This is NOT how I want to remember Hell Girl, and Studio Deen truly ruined their very own creation, but seriously... no other series does Reminiscene Episodes. If I want to relive past episodes, I\'ll just go over to the previous seasons. There was no excuse to go this direction. Since half of Fourth Twilight\'s episodes were sacrificed for this pointless shtick, we did not receive enough episodes to come to like Michiru. She\'s just there to do a better job of being Ai\'s successor than Yuzuki, and that\'s it. We do not see her have character development, and her story should\'ve been saved to be Episodes 11 and 12, or 10 and 11, if they want the 12th and final one to serve as post-story content, like some shows like to do. We should\'ve had more dark and psychological content throughout this season to give Michiru the chance to be a more memorable character and if Studio Deen really cared about the series, they would\'ve definitely made a much better backstory than the one we actually got.Hell Girl: Fourth Twilight had the potential to revive the waves of popularity for the series, but failed miserably. I am giving it 4/10 since it does have its share of things done right, but the main story arc got cut short and no new twist to the formula was brought to the table. If you want to have any Hell Girl discussions with me, keep in mind that I like to neglect Fourth Twilight. The original trilogy will always be a treat to rewatch when I want something dark for the month of October, but this season?There was no craziness, there was no uncertainty, and it definitely did not give me any life!']"

If you're like me, you probably just had your Bleach hopes and dreams crushed after finding out. Sadly, this not something new. It's been around since 2008. It's basically just a gag bit about the captains of the soul society thinking up ideas for the Jump Festa.Story: 5/10The bleach characters are basically just thinking up ideas for the Jump Festa. You can see the characters (mainly the captains and vice-captains) and their individual personalities acting all goofy, but it's really not that funny or entertaining in my opinion.Art: 3/10...By today's standards, the art is actually pretty bad. It's basically a crappy version of the show's art from 2008.Sound: 8/10The sound is basically the same catchy bleach music from the series. The character voices are all the same. Still pretty good.Characters: 6/10The same characters from the show, but they're much more goofy because this is a gag bit. You don't really see Ichigo until the end.Enjoyment: 6/10It was alright.

The humor is not bad either.Final Rating: 6-- Art --The art is fairly typical of the ""old style"" of Bleach anime. There isn\'t a lot of animated scenes, probably because it is a low budget short.

Then it will last for eternity, otherwise, it will soon be forgotten and...worth nothing but random stuff from the past.The common issue that still occurs since the beginning of burst season up to GT season is the fact that Beyblade started to become boys-only toys that proved by the fact that you will never found even a single female blader with non-random beyblade, in fact their presence is almost non-existent at all, and never takes major part in storyline whatsoever. Valkyrie, a Beyblade from one of the main character in the series, whether being concious or unconsiously, was made under the design of androgynous avatar, even though it is obvious from mythological perspective that Valkyrie has a female gender to begin with.

I thought it was kinda boring, but pretty.Fumiko no Kokuhaku has no such restrictions. In fact, Fumiko obnoxiously screams for 75% of this short. The art is vibrant, and the animation really pops. There's a ton of variety and showy animation in this one. It's clearly an exhibition of Ishida's animation skills. It also has a surprising amount...of variety and eye candy for a short.The visual storytelling is one of the best aspects in this story. There are only really three lines of dialogue in this short; most of it is carried purely by the highly expressive and lively animation. But instead of completely ditching dialogue, Ishida adds it when he wants to take the viewer's attention away from the animation and get a laugh.The way characters move in Fumiko no Kokuhaku is very unique. It kind of reminds me of the old Looney Tunes cartoons by Chuck Jones with the emphasis on the way characters move, and brevity in dialogue. The pacing works well, too, because something is always happening on-screen, but it isn't visually overwhelming in the way something like Bakemonogatari (which is a much more layered show) is. It's eye-catching, and a type of organic comedy on its own.It's 2 minutes long, it's cute, it's funny, and it's on youtube.

Gundam vs Hello Kitty,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39674/Gundam_vs_Hello_Kitty,"[""Is this one of the most ridiculous ideas in anime history? Of course! And that's why it works. With just about 2 minutes of material per episode, you don't have to invest yourself in anything. Just enjoy the surreal juxtaposition of angsty teen Amuro having a serious mid-battle discussion with Hello Kitty about friendship and nonviolence.I'm not sure that traditional notions of good or bad apply here. This is just a series of shorts celebrating the 45th anniversary of Hello Kitty and the 40th anniversary of Mobile Suit Gundam. The animation is actually much nicer than it ever needed to be, and the production...in general is well done. It's not a pure throwaway; effort was spent in making this something special (if extremely bizarre and disorienting).If you want a few laughs and like the weirdness of the whole notion, give it a look. I like that it's well-executed, has an odd respect for both franchises, and at this point I can't wait to see how things finally end up.The final question: Will this anime be canon for the Gundam universe?!?!?!?! in general is well done.

This is one of those animes who you think you probably wouldn't see done for many reasons but the main is because it makes no sense, well to be fair there a lot of animes around who makes no sense like Pupa for example. Now going to the anime There's nothing much to talk about it, This is a 3-parts OVA that puts together Hello kitty and Ray Amuro, there's no story but somehow it's funny to watch it, and the animation is really good. If you want to feel good and very...confused for six minutes go watch it. confused for six minutes go watch it."", 'For a silly mashup of two disparate properties meant to celebrate anniversaries of Gundam and Hello Kitty, this is actually a pretty good collection of shorts. The animation in the Gundam universe is gorgeous; Hello Kitty translated really well into that art style. There also were some mecha briefly shown in the Hello Kitty art style, which is good because otherwise this would have felt incomplete. The story is pretty deep for a 6-minute collection of shorts, and it has a basic level of character development in Amuro. This is more than can be said for other anime shorts that commemorate special occasions, as they...tend to rely on meta humour and cuteness. tend to rely on meta humour and cuteness.', 'I did enjoy this odd gundam series, this was the shortest series I have ever watched because each episode was no more than over two minutes long, it was actually pretty comical, it made me laugh, especially having the hello kitty within it. I have never seen anything like this before, I am not even joking this had to be a comedy. Because I have not ever experienced anything like this before, I think they should make more of these short little gundam and hello kitty skits, I thought it was actually sort of awesome in a way. I seriously would love to see more...of these. of these.']"
Girls Bravo: Second Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/487/Girls_Bravo__Second_Season,"[""Well after watching the first season, the second season isn't as much different. Kazuhara is still up to his pervy ways, Yukinari still allergic to Women, and Miharu is still acting like the dits she always is. But this time things change a bit. Now Yukinari and Miharu become more indeph with their small relationship, and there are still many people trying to ruin it for poor Yukinari.It seems the Women of Seiren Demensional Security are trying to bring back Miharu because if she stays on Earth for too long strange things may happen. Also a mysterious cloaked person is constantly following Yukinari, watching his...every move. What's all the comotion about? Welll I don't want to spoil it for you.But like I said to begin with, nothing much has changed. The series begins where the other left off. There aren't any new additions to the character line up, unless you think a masked cleaning super hero as one. But if you are a fan of the series and wants to see what happens to our unfortunate Yukinari then please do watch. Don't complain when you start to think it gets too repetative. every move.

Is this what Anime has become? Well, it’s not as bad as Eiken. The artwork is actually mostly tasteful (Ok… it’s not really but at least the girls don’t have breasts the size of body pillows on their chests) and the storyline is actually rather well done. It’s almost like a Romeo and Juliet storyline in parts because the two always seem to be ripped apart by some things.Let’s start with the characters. Miharu is a little cutesy and a sweetie. Sometimes though, a little too much...of the sweet, naive character. She has the traits of an alien character in that she has supernatural powers that sometimes can’t be controlled and the fact that she didn’t know much of Earth. She has a black hole of a stomach since she is always hungry but oddly, some of the things she eats, she does it way to odd. For example, the second episode, she eats a banana rather suggestively. She has no concept of not changing in front of people, mostly in front of Yukinari though.Koyomi is pretty cute as well and again, is way to naïve. Her background story is actually quite sad. She Has a fear of men but not surprisingly actually is alright with Yukinari after quite a while. She works with the space management office on the planet Seiren where the two are from. Her special agent friend, Tomoka, is actually rather childish and way different then the shy Koyomi.Kirie is a rather kick ass sporty type, who has a thing for Yukinari (You can see where this is all going). She is the childhood friend of him and sometimes ends up just walking into his house without a care in the world, many times leaving a rather big misunderstanding that ends up hurting Yukinari. Whenever she fights a ‘pervert’ she screams out something ‘in hell’ as she beats the crap out of them. It was fun for a little while, and then got rather old.Yukinari is… well like every other fucken main character in a Harem! He’s clumsy, small, and not really able to stand out in a crowd. He has an allergy to women though Miharu doesn’t make him brake out at all. Other then that, he is rather sweet and kind, with a wonderful heart.On the other side of the spectrum is Kazuharu who flirts with every girl around him. He is a pervert who always grabs the girls’ breasts and panties. He is allergic to men though, hence the white gloves that he wears. His sister, Risa, is really into black magic and has a crush on Yukinari. She has a really pushy and throws her servants around to get him to come to her. Now for her servants, Kosame is into Kirie actually. This is actually a new concept I never really saw in another show, especially because it’s a Yuri relationship.They crammed so much into this show that it’s really jammed with a lot of stuff into it. We got the enter-dimensional transportation, black magic, love triangles, aliens from another world, magical girls, special ops characters, and perverts. We even have a little cute side kick animal named Ebi. Ebi and Miharu have an interesting little relationship much like Excel and her dog.The artwork is pretty much standard. It’s clean and bright but It just doesn’t stand out much from all the other anime done around this time. It makes it really hard to figure out just what to say every time I review a show that is pretty standard in this area.The English voices are pretty good, though I feel a bit odd about Miharu’s voice. It’s Michelle Ruff who also played the voice of Ai Sakuraba from Ai Yori Aoshi. Kasuharu Fukuyama is actually played perfectly by Liam O’Brien who did Taishi Kuhonbutsu from Comic Party. Yes, the overactive Otaku is playing the overactive pervert. Not a large difference but it works perfectly for this show.Season two comes out pretty much the same as the first, though even more perverted. I did like the episode where Yukinari and Kazuharu changed bodies. I really loved how it suddenly turned into a really messed up way where everyone switched with every other person at the swimming pool. The only thing that bothered me was the tentacle rape part.  It was kind of going overboard.It is here when I figured out why the story plot seemed so disjointed. I found a lot of these episodes were all filler, most of them only going for one episode. It was all made for fan service that sort of gets old at times. That and the stupidity of Miharu seemed to get even more. Still, I couldn’t help but keep watching it, thinking that there may be an underlining storyline for the whole show. There… kind of was but it didn’t show up until episode 17 (6 in the second episode) but there was barely any info about it till Episode 20. Sadly, this only has 24 episodes when adding the two seasons together.I pretty much see the name as ‘Oh! There are girls naked and sexual innuendos with anime fan service! Bravo!’ or at least that’s what I think the guys are thinking. of the sweet, naive character.

Bravo!’ or at least that’s what I think the guys are thinking.', ""I agree with most other reviews the second season is alot like the first but thats what i like about it' fukuyama still makes me laugh my ass off. being a girl i feel the ecchi is a little much but i deal with it cause it has a really nice storyline' but seriously they didnt hold back on the ecchi' on the first ep there was good ol' tenticles but its fan service. "", 'Only reason i watch this is because im a horny pig...  he he. no, really theirs not much to watch.. and i wanted to watch something echi...  its kind of entretaining and has some funny stuff..  but wouldnt ever rewatch..  its way to typical of a story and it has very few originalities to it.    But its always not to bad to watch stuff like these ', ""As i watched the first season i like it the story had a good opening to it but i think haveing the opening to a nacked girl in the a tub was one of the most obvious thing that anime can do for an opening other then that i think the hole (1&2) season was great to watch, the character's ware funny and great see.also the sexual part ware really funny to see mahjong part it was funny see. so all-in-all it was a good show i like it vary much "", ""So after watching the first episode of Girls Bravo, I kind of rolled my eyes preparing for more of the same (re: tentacle rape scene), but as the season progressed I actually started getting mildly interested.Character and plot development actually started poking its proverbial head in and making an appearance, all be it a very small one by the end. Throughout, they really started to try and give Girls Bravo some direction and purpose in story. I really don't mind the excessive ecchi in a series (I'll admit it, I'm a bit of a perv and I find it funny), but when the story rivals...that of a pornographic film it kind of feels as such. And frankly, that's boring.I bumped up my grade for the second season for two reasons:1 - Characters felt like they were growing a little bit. Fukuyama started becoming a guy you could find a spot for in your heart (even if it was a tiny, seldom used spot). Kirie became a significantly less brutal person and started showing her compassion more. Yukinari started getting a backbone (although I still hated his constant whining - he even sounded whiny when he was showing personal strength against adversity!). Koyomi also started gaining some courage and not a sniveling baby all the time. Character growth all around was ACTUALLY starting to show so they get some props for that.2 - Direction. By this I mean the characters actually started to have some purpose or goals. This was helped along by two things: first being the characters becoming more comfortable about confessing their true feelings to one another and second the introduction of genuine villains. Although the villains were far too mysterious (and in some cases strangely shocking) for too much of the season, it was nice to see the protagonists go up against someone or some thing rather than just bumbling along pointlessly for no reason.The penultimate confrontation in season 2 was interesting enough at the end, but it still felt rushed in a lot of ways. Therefore, I was unable to bump up my grade more than a point (which honestly is probably pretty generous). While Girls Bravo started off as an excessive breast-fetish ecchi with some mildly chuckle-worth laughs from time to time (the episode where Yukinari dresses up as a girl at the video game convention to help the girls made me actually laugh out loud), it grew into something that could have been a fairly decent anime but was cut short. The end was reasonably emotional and cute enough, but it probably won't leave a lasting impression on me.If you like breasts, this is the anime for you. If not, then...I dunno, you probably should skip the series unless you're willing to sit down and give it merit based on both seasons. If the latter, then I'd say give it a shot at least and then see what you think before striking it off your lists forever. that of a pornographic film it kind of feels as such.

While there isn't much to talk about in artwork or sound department (nothing incredible, at least).Story (5)-  The story (or what there is of it) is linked together solely by containing the same characters and the same basic problem with Yukinari. Most episodes are completely irrelevant to the plot of the show, and thus lack any sort of powerful punch behind them.Art (6)- The art...of this show is average, not exceedingly well done nor horrible.Sound (6)- The sounds of this show are much like the art (nothing extraordinary, but not bad). That said, I still enjoy listening to the opening theme and singing along while driving.Character (7)- The characters of this show are admittedly flat and slightly repetitive, but nonetheless each seems to have a unique charm. I found myself regretfully liking the wimpy Yukinari, enjoying Miharu's naivety, and becoming ever more annoyed with Tomo. The show actually makes use of the character's flatness, using it to create unrealistic yet adorable individuals to populate its world.Enjoyment (10)- This is the part of the rating that makes no sense in context with the rest. Given the above information, most would assume that this show is simply a mediocre way to pass the time. But somehow this show manages to provide unending fun, and had me falling over laughing at many of its immature, cheesy jokes.Overall, this show, despite its faults, manages to pull together quite an experience. Ignoring its blatant fan service (but seriously, who's going to complain there?) the show provides endless amounts of cheap humor and innuendo in the likeliest of places. Girls Bravo doesn't strive to push the boundaries of storytelling or force the viewers to reassess his/her life. Instead, it offers moronic humor and cheap laughs that will nevertheless provide hours of pure, mindless entertainment. of this show is average, not exceedingly well done nor horrible.Sound (6)- The sounds of this show are much like the art (nothing extraordinary, but not bad).

But all in all apart from the ending...its a pretty good anime its a pretty good anime"", ""Girls Bravo (Seasons 1 and 2)You know how in most harems, the main guy is afraid of women or has no idea how to act around them? They’re so afraid of the boobies and close contact, right; well in Girls Bravo, our MC has a ridiculous reason for being afraid of girls! He’s been bullied by them all his life and develops a rash/hives that permeates throughout his entire body when a girl touches him, sucks, right?Our MC is Yukinari Sasaki, he lives alone in his large home and has a really kind neighbor/childhood friend that takes care of him. The neighbor is...Kojima Kirie, a really pretty girl who’s loud, slightly obnoxious and very strong, you don’t mess with her.The main girl for Girls Bravo is Miharu, she comes from a different planet, a planet that has a population of 90% females who are all looking to get married and messed up (You know.... oh trust me... you know) to any man they can find; though Miharu isn’t like this at all. She’s kind, sweet, extra cute and is the only girl that doesn’t cause Yukinari’s hives to break out; pretty neat!There are a few recurring support characters such as Fukuyama Kazuharu, he’s the super perverted, grope you in the middle of class type of guy. He’s aggressive and loves the girls, he’s not afraid to get a little dirty, but to make things funny, he hates guys; so he gets hives whenever a guy might touch him; really funny stuff. We also have his imouto, Fukuyama Risa (Lisa), she too is in love with Yukinari, she’s also a bad ass witch who deals with black magic and is a super gorgeous blonde girl. There is also Koyomi, Ebi and Tomoka; Ebi is some sort of creature from Seiren (The planet with a ton of horny girls) and Koyomi and Tomoka came from Seiren to help find a groom for Miharu’s sister Maharu. The cast is all really funny and because there are a good handful of characters to look out for, you never get bored or annoyed with any of them, (well maybe Kazuharu and his really perverted ways).The story: Uuuhm, you’re not watching this show for a story, you’re watching it for the boobs, really…. A lot of boobs, I mean, there are a lot. Any story that is shown is self-contained in each episode, because the anime is very slice of life and episodic, but who cares about that, let the oppai consume you, embrace the ecchi and lewd nature that is Girls Bravo, it's for the best, after all =).Sound: Yes, there is music and ambient sound and BGM. It’s good, but not 100% memorable really. The OP and ED for both seasons however are good and very fun for what Girls Bravo is, really enjoyed them for sure.Animation/Art Style: Hehehe, well I liked the art style and animation, the show aired in 04, right before or during the time that anime started to change towards the extra shiny and super cute look. Girls Bravo retains a more hand drawn type of look, (as in, late 90’s type of look). It’s unique and very pretty. All the girls are drawn very well, there are no strange issues that really occur, but there also isn’t much detail in the world either. A lot of the focus is on the faces and cloths of what the characters wear, things like that.I personally enjoyed Girls Bravo. I was feeling a little down and watching this made me quite happy. It’s a series full of laughs and fun, though I suspect the MC and his hives antic will tire people out. If it matters; it’s not until the last 2 episodes of the 2nd season that things actually progress in the story, so most of it is very very slice of life. It’s fun though and I think it looks good too. Boobs Kojima Kirie, a really pretty girl who’s loud, slightly obnoxious and very strong, you don’t mess with her.The main girl for Girls Bravo is Miharu, she comes from a different planet, a planet that has a population of 90% females who are all looking to get married and messed up (You know.... oh trust me... you know) to any man they can find; though Miharu isn’t like this at all.

The OP and ED for both seasons however are good and very fun for what Girls Bravo is, really enjoyed them for sure.Animation/Art Style: Hehehe, well I liked the art style and animation, the show aired in 04, right before or during the time that anime started to change towards the extra shiny and super cute look. Girls Bravo retains a more hand drawn type of look, (as in, late 90’s type of look). It’s unique and very pretty. All the girls are drawn very well, there are no strange issues that really occur, but there also isn’t much detail in the world either. A lot of the focus is on the faces and cloths of what the characters wear, things like that.I personally enjoyed Girls Bravo. I was feeling a little down and watching this made me quite happy. It’s a series full of laughs and fun, though I suspect the MC and his hives antic will tire people out. If it matters; it’s not until the last 2 episodes of the 2nd season that things actually progress in the story, so most of it is very very slice of life. It’s fun though and I think it looks good too.

Although the bond between Yukinari and Miharu gets stronger it doesnt step to the next stage, i would of expected from Kirie that she tells Yukinari her feelings which she DOESN'T, the story gets a little better and even has a cliffhanger (Shocked), again the only reason this is this series is good is because of Miharu, although shes quite innocent shes...quite funny to watch and unlike many characters she AIN'T annoying.The story progreses (a little) and although it got better near the end i felt the ending was quite poor and even though it was a Romantic Comedy there is not much &quot;Romance&quot; as you dont even see Yukinari kiss Miharu.Be warned quite a bit of ecchi especially in the wrestling matches :). quite funny to watch and unlike many characters she AIN'T annoying.The story progreses (a little) and although it got better near the end i felt the ending was quite poor and even though it was a Romantic Comedy there is not much &quot;Romance&quot; as you dont even see Yukinari kiss Miharu.Be warned quite a bit of ecchi especially in the wrestling matches :)."", ""So I can't decide if Tomoka is the best or the worst character in this series. I watched the English dub for some reason, I guess I just can't resist the sultry tones of Liam O'brien. But the trade off was that the English voice for Tomoka was awful. Couldn't stand listening to it. It seems to be a trend with loli characters that in the process of localizing for an American audience they just have no idea how to create the right tone for the character and just end up being loud and annoying.The story delves a little bit more into the world-building and...how exactly the magic portal to the girls only planet works. We spent most of our time the first season just on Earth but we get to actually go back to Seren... Seran?  Oh Seiren. Had to look it up. Anyway they spend a bunch of time back on Seiren toward the end, and we get a few more members added to the harem.I actually really like Fukuyama as a character even though you're supposed to think he's the worst. He basically a huge chad who knows what he wants and doesn't pussyfoot around crying anytime a girl tries to talk to him. I wish more protagonists had his energy, I honestly kind of hated Yukinari. Yuri Lowenthal doing his best to sound young and timid was just weird, and the character trait of being afraid of girls in a harem anime is so played out and annoying.7/10 how exactly the magic portal to the girls only planet works.

This may or may not be true. Perhaps if you are Japanese and had grown up on Dagashi, this series is probably so slice-of-life that it’s boring. As someone genuinely interested in the lifestyles of Japanese citizens beyond anime and pop culture, I found this anime quite educational! Not only had I never heard of Dagashi before watching episode 1, but it also gave me a look into Japanese childhood, and growing up in the Japanese countryside. I also love the silly characters, especially Hotaru. If...you are interested in Japanese culture as a whole, and you enjoy your light-hearted series’, then Dagashi Kashi is for you! It helps that I’m also a bit of a foodie.I was rather confused by the final episode, which almost completely lacked closure. Are they leaving an opening for a second season, or did they really just not know how to wrap up this anime? you are interested in Japanese culture as a whole, and you enjoy your light-hearted series’, then Dagashi Kashi is for you! It helps that I’m also a bit of a foodie.I was rather confused by the final episode, which almost completely lacked closure. Are they leaving an opening for a second season, or did they really just not know how to wrap up this anime?', 'So Kokonotsu... do you wanna try becoming adults?Say yes you beta bastard, say yes!Anyways, Dagashi Kashi! This series was the one I was most interested in before it aired. Why? Because of that busty babe on the picture! And now, after watching it, I can confidently say that Dagashi Kashi was actually the complete opposite of what I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be a story about young Kokonotsu, an aspiring mangaka, and his struggles of dealing with Hotaru, that sweet sexy thang, who wants Kokonotsu to take over his dad\'s candy shop instead! Well, sure... that\'s kind of what...the show is about. But is it really?Nah.........Dagashi Kashi is a textbook example of a ""nothing happens"" show. However, it isn\'t by any means boring! It isn\'t like Glasslip tier of nothing happens, it\'s more of like the things that do happen are borderline irrelevant to any sort of ""plot"" this show tries to tell.Did I mention ""plot?"" Well, I take it back, for there is none. Dagashi Kashi purely consists of skits and character interactions. As entertaining as some of these skits are, they really don\'t add up to become some amazing story. Quite the opposite, actually, for they don\'t add up at all! They are all their own little equations.And now most of you guys reading this review must wonder why I still give it a 6, and that is because Dagashi Kashi is by no means a bad show! In fact, it was one of the more enjoyable ones this season! Sure, since a lot of the jokes are about Japanese candy, and not a lot of you people are Japanese, you might think the jokes are incredibly hit or miss. But the extremely colorful and dynamic characters more than makes up for it! Dagashi Kashi is definitely an enjoyment > quality type of anime.Pros:- Great characters! They are all really characteristic and fun, and none of them are hateable.- Very catchy OP and ED!- I really like the character designs!- Character interactions are very humorous.- Surprisingly good use of flashbacks!- There\'s romantic tension? What....Cons:- Less story than Musaigen.- While the character interactions are spot on, the jokes themselves are very hit or miss. For most caucasians, you won\'t find most, if any of the jokes funny. I\'m Chinese, and Chinese candies are close enough. (Not really.)- No memorable OST.Story: 4But Yuni, there is no story? Why not a 1? Well, that\'s because the events that actually do happen within this ""story"" are actually pretty entertaining! Each skit is usually about a type of candy or some event based around candy. It\'s a story that focuses A LOT on first world problems. And these first world problems are like ridiculous ones. Whatever happens depends on the candy. Sometimes it\'s a history lesson about why that candy exists. Sometimes it\'s some competition that connects to the candy. Sometimes it\'s a flash back of a memory that was triggered by the candy. These events range from boring, to educational, to entertaining. But at the end of the day, the characters are the same, the plot hasn\'t progressed whatsoever, and yeah. NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!Art: 8The art is great, although nothing noteworthy or overly impressive. I do like the character designs though! This show does have a pretty unique and interesting character design, and I think it fits the characters well, especially Hotaru, who\'s character design makes her look both mature (BOOBIES) and childish.Sound: 7OP and ED are incredibly catchy! Other than that, sound is average. OST is there but you won\'t remember it, and the seiyuus do a good job expressing their characters!Character: 9Arguably the best aspect of this series, the characters of Dagashi Kashi are just so enjoyable! Their characteristics aren\'t the most unique, but they are just so colorful and hilarious! Hotaru\'s little antics and habits are really funny and you can just see the innocence just seep out of her. Saya is your typical flat tsundere, but she still has so much character to the point that she became my favorite character of the series. Also, the interactions between kid Saya and kid Kokonotsu during flashbacks were just adorable. Tou also has a lot of personality, and of course, Kokonotsu\'s dad is just hilarious! Kokonotsu himself is pretty generic, but he has his moments as well.Enjoyment: 8Dagashi Kashi was actually really fun to watch for the most part! Whenever it got entertaining, it got REALLY entertaining. However, there were parts where it got pretty boring, but the entertaining parts completely overshadow the boring ones!Overall: 7Dagashi Kashi is actually a pretty good show! It\'s light hearted and has no serious moments in it whatsoever, and is pretty much there just for fun. If you go in, don\'t expect any plot.

Take my money.', ""Tl;dr 4.4 out of 10. no oppai, no plot, lots of talking about snacks.This show starts completely different than it actually is. We start with a young aspiring manga artist who works in his dad's rural snack shop. It's a boring little shop with few customers. One day a pretty girl walks in and announces she's someone important and then goes on to challenge the main character in some snack themed contest and then does it again and again and again and so on.The story pretty much derails after the first two episodes and falls into a formulaic feedback loop:Start of episode: boring snack shop....part 1: introduce some mundane problem that a character acts like it's the end of the world (think first world problems).part 2: somehow this has to do with a snack (no, really it doesn't).part 3: the history and other random useless facts on said treat (boring).part 4: some sort of bet is made (which they never actually do, no matter who wins).part 5: a contest that usually doesn't make sense takes place (only part where something happens).part 6: win or lose or don't complete the contest. nothing ever comes out of this.part 7: the episode ends.That's pretty much it. This is especially odd since the first ep looks like this might have a bit of ecchi theme to it which is followed by some semblance of a plot and a promise of some high jinks, however that is the only episode that offers any of those things.In the background there's an interesting slow developing love triangle with the two female characters and the main character. I really wish the story would have focused on that more as it is kind of interesting. The two pretty girls have good traits and the main character is likable but the show all but abandons them to play out a history lesson on snacks that you never knew existed, assuming you're not from Japan. I'd still wager that even if you are from Japan and/or you do know all of these snacks, you'll care just as little.Story: 2Art: 6Sound: 6Character: 6Enjoyment: 2Overall 4.4/10 part 1: introduce some mundane problem that a character acts like it's the end of the world (think first world problems).part 2: somehow this has to do with a snack (no, really it doesn't).part 3: the history and other random useless facts on said treat (boring).part 4: some sort of bet is made (which they never actually do, no matter who wins).part 5: a contest that usually doesn't make sense takes place (only part where something happens).part 6: win or lose or don't complete the contest. nothing ever comes out of this.part 7: the episode ends.That's pretty much it.

This anime is boring. It is basically a Japanese candy commercial in anime form. Each episode is typically divided into two parts, with each part focusing on a different candy. There is also a weird crazy girl that knows too much about candy, and she is usually the one that introduces the candy of the episode.The plot of this anime is relatively simple: Kokonotsu wants to be a manga artist, but his father wants him to take over the family...business: a candy store. Hotaru wants Kokonotsu's father to work for her family's candy company, and he agrees as long as she is able to convince Kokonotsu to take over the store. This makes Hotaru begin to harass Kokonotsu about candy all the time and allows the anime to become a Japanese candy commercial. Honestly, I had forgotten about the premise of the series because they hardly ever mention it again in favor of talking about candy all the time (can you tell how annoyed I am that I was roped into watching an anime that is literally just about candy?).The one redeeming quality of this anime is Saya. The episodes, or parts of episodes, that focus on her really stand out for me, but sadly weird crazy girl (Hotaru) gets most if the focus of the anime. I suppose if you want to learn more about Japanese candy you might find some enjoyment in this show. Being a foreigner with absolutely no previous knowledge of any of these candies led me to being either confused or bored at most of the content, and I couldn't justify finishing the series if I was just forcing myself to sit through it. 3/10 business: a candy store.

No fanservice or wish fulfilment going on here, just unabashed dagashi nerdiness and fun slice of life.The premise is simple: An energetic girl comes to a town out in the countryside and tries to encourage our protagonist, Coconuts, to take over his father\'s dagashi shop. The story is full of nice people, the characters are pretty much all likeable and behave naturally throughout the show. I find Coconut\'s father, You(his mom\'s name must be ""Me"") to be an especially fun character, he...is really energetic and caring, the kind of father you hardly get in anime these days.You have to be prepared though, the show throws a lot of facts at you which can get repetitive. Each episode is divided into segments that talk about individual snacks, which are chock full of history and small quirks about each specific dagashi. It helps to have a bit of knowledge about the kinds of sweets there are available in Japan, but for me I never felt lost, even when the jokes didn\'t hit there was usually something to learn.The show does however have a bit of a slow start. The character Tou comes off as pretty mean in the first episode but gets a lot more enjoyable through the course of the show. Some of the sound effects are pretty stock, and Studio Feel\'s animation doesn\'t flow very well at points, but these are minor issues in the show. If you\'re a sucker for anything related to history or Japan I\'d say you\'d take to this show very well, there\'s a lot going on in Dagashi Kashi even though it might not be the most complex show out there. Its smart and uplifting, the kind of show that will never fail to brighten up your day. is really energetic and caring, the kind of father you hardly get in anime these days.You have to be prepared though, the show throws a lot of facts at you which can get repetitive.

It’s nostalgic in the sense that makes you feel like a little kid again. Remember the first time you’ve walked into a candy store and picked out your favorite sweets? It’s that type of familiar feeling. Dagashi Kashi evokes a bit of childhood memories when I walked into a candy store for the first time. And believe me, this show likes to do a lot of funny things related to candy.The series follows the episodic adventures of Kokonotsu Shikada. His encounter with Hotaru Shidare lands him in stories that drops him into the world of dagashi. Why? It’s because Hotaru...is part of a famous family owned sweet company. She wants Kokonotsu’s father to join and he only agrees on the condition that Kokonotsu can take over his own shop. Thus, we got Hotaru and her ever daring tactics to get Kokonotsu for taking the shop.First thing to get out of the way: A good portion of the show relies heavily on comedy. It sells comedy through advertising of the dagashi. Hotaru is pretty much the mascot girl as she tries to appeal the wonderfulness of dagashi. From simple explanations, innovative lectures, or expressive dialogues, Hotaru is actually pretty good at convincing. Plus, she has the look (or “it” factor) to sell her product. The way this show is set up is that each episode has Hotaru trying ways to win Kokonotsu or others over with her convincing. Her personality is rather eccentric and overly dramatic whenever it involves candy. A good example is when she gets a mouth ulcer but still desperately wants to taste candy like in a ritualistic manner. Throughout the show, Hotaru also shows a vast knowledge about candy. The way she tries to convince others is rather overdramatic including getting others to play strange games or activities. So in retrospect, this is the type of show with little emphasis on plot but more on selling its premise.With a small character cast, the show gives a decent amount of screen time for almost all of them. Kokonotsu (or as some of his friends call him “Coconuts”), is perhaps the most normal of the main cast. He is friendly, casual, and often tries to help others although remains oblivious to certain characters’ feeling around him. This includes Saya, a girl that has obvious affections for him. Through his interactions with Hotaru, it seems like if he’s developed an affection the titular character. In the meantime, there’s Saya’s brother Tou, who actually knows about his sister’s crush on Kokonotsu. The only person that doesn’t seem to know is Kokonotsu himself. And finally, we got Kokonotsu’s father, You Shikada. Unlike his son, You’s personality seems more similar to Hotaru with his hyperactive energy. The entire show focuses on these characters and the world of candy. When you have a diverse range character cast like this, it makes you wonder how the show can build around itself. The obvious answer is through character chemistry. Every episode may focus on candy but it also puts a bit of emphasis on character connections. Kokonotsu learns a lot from Hotaru, Saya grows closer to Kokonotsu throughout the show, and Hotaru also develops a friendly relationship with Saya. The show presents the character relationships in a comedic style rather than dramatic. In other words, don’t expect actual love angles to develop as this series is about much more than a romance story. The only thing Hotaru has in mind seems to be candy while Kokonotsu remains dense as a neutron star about Saya. The family relationships (Kokonotsu/You and Saya/Tou) seems pretty typical and nothing out of extraordinary; the type you can expect between real life family members. But in essence, the show is down-right more of a comedic story.However, there’s some controversy with the way the series is adapted. For whatever reason, certain content is omitted from the manga about Hotaru and replaced by Saya. The show started with overemphasis on Hotaru’s presence but in later episodes seems to also expose Saya a great amount of screen time. This seems controversial as it derives from the faithfulness of the adaptation and also gives Hotaru less relevance. Because let’s be honest here, who here originally came to the series to watch for Saya? Hotaru is the main poster girl. In the meantime, the comedy of the show can be a mixed bag at times. It never actually changes despite each episode involving different scenarios, games, or whatever tactic Hotaru tries to convince others about candy. This also comes with a negative of characterization as background storytelling (with perhaps the exception of Saya) is largely absent. In essence, the show is really more of just popcorn fun to pass time at times.Studio feel helms the adaptation and thankfully provides good enough quality for the characters, backgrounds, and overall presentation. It has a countryside feel as the entire show never really ventures too far away from the candy store. However, the most noticeable part of the series is character design. Or rather I should say, one name. Hotaru Shidare. She has exotic looking eyes with ripple-pattern like rings in her iris. Combine that with a bit of lilac hair and you got quite a unique looking girl. Saya’s eyes on the other hand looks rather simple and she dresses more casually than Hotaru. Oh and of course the show likes to take advantage of Hotaru’s appearance so expect a bit of fan service; mostly subtle and satire by the comedic parodies.Soundtrack and music goes hand in hand for the show. The OP song evolves throughout the first three episodes until we get a good glimpse of the style. While I can’t say the music is very impressive, it does fit quite well for the show – being lighthearted and dramatic at time when it needs to be. However, the voice mannerism is what really sells the product with Hotaru yet again being the star. Her over-eccentric voice combined with personality is hard to ignore to be quite honest. Similarly, You is also ever energetic enough to be in the spotlight whenever his son seems to be indifferent about his life.By the time this show is over, I feel like eating candy. No, it’s not because Hotaru convinced me but that the show itself just seems to have too much fun to not jump into it. At the same time, the character cast is there to sell its comedy whether it works or not. As with any comedic series, the humor really needs to be exciting and Dagashi Kashi got that right in the palm of its hands. is part of a famous family owned sweet company.

That is pretty much all there is. However, it’s how this is executed that makes it great. Also, fun fact: the dagashi mentioned in the show are the real product, so there is even accuracy to it.The other great aspect about the show is the characters. Ever get tired of shows that have this massive list of characters that it makes it...hard to comprehend? Well, Dagashi Kashi can fix that, because their cast only consists of five characters. Since we follow only these five that we get this strong connection with them; all of them work together perfectly.I like to believe that the animation from Feel helps give a distinguished look. There have been other works from the studio that I particularly didn’t enjoy, but this is an exception. When there are any close ups of the characters, I love how detailed everything is.This series was one I was highly anticipating for the season. Hearing about it, I promptly read the manga, and feel in love in an instant. The one thing that concerned me was how the anime was going to adapt it, considered the format of the manga. However, though there were some liberations, I feel the anime did a pretty good job.I would highly recommend this series if you love comedy and the fun facts about Japanese history (though be it only about candy). hard to comprehend?

Main plot is about Hotaru convincing Kokonotsu to take over the family candy shop. And almost 95% of this plot is about candy. Every episode explains literary everything about one or two particular candies but in a fun way.Other than candy and some really good humor there is also well-placed hinted romance. But it’s more about friendship and young people planning their future. The characters are also well-made, interesting and fun to watch. I’m not a big fan of main female characters because they’re often poorly done but Hotaru is really special. Her...candy obsession never stops to amaze me. Downside is that you’ll probably get bored because every episode is similar so even if you skip a few, it’s no big deal. And it definitely doesn’t look like shounen anime to me.So if you’re interested in japanese candies and you’re looking for some good comedy with no particular storyline this one I for you. candy obsession never stops to amaze me.

Hotaru is quite an interesting ball of energy and weirdness along with Kokonotsu's father and are balanced by the more normal (but not boring) Kokonotsu and Saya. Tou, Kokonotsu's best friend, was the guy...in between, a little weird and a little normal. So all in all, the characters are almost perfectly corresponding to each other and made this show comical and amusing.The art is amazing, but what caught my attention were their eyes, while in numerous anime these days where the eyes are largish, Dagashi Kashi did the opposite, which is what pulled me into watching it in the first place.Overall, I would say this is good, if you are the type who wants a good laugh. Personally, this is my weekly source of entertainment when it was still ongoing and I was always looking forward to it. in between, a little weird and a little normal.

You have a bunch of teens living in the countryside and doing the usual stuff. They sometimes go to the ""dagashi"" shop and talk about the origin of the sweets they eat. There is not much more to it. So, if you like deep anime with a serious plot, this is not it. It\'s more a ""product"" anime that you watch for your own enjoyment or to kill some time.About the art, I\'m sorry, I am no expert and...my opinions on it usually are pretty subjective, so I just gonna say that it looks polished and the animation is pretty nice. I didn\'t notice too much lazy tricks or any awful drawings.The sound doens\'t have a lot of imporance. The opening was nice and the ending was funny. Ambient music was inmersive for me.Regarding the characters, I found them the best part of this anime because they are funny and likeable. You have 2 girls and 2 guys. The girls just hang around talking about love, life and that kind of stuff. The guys look at the girls and want to be popular,which is quite hard in a village like the one they live in. But I really liked their development, because you get to see how are they in their daily lives and what they do. Basically, they are ""real"" people.I rated it 10 in enjoyment because I like this kind of animes and enjoyed the humor and stories about candy origins.Overall, yes, it may be kind of an advertisement for japanese candy but it is worth watching just because it has a peaceful atmosphere and lots of funny jokes.Sorry if this is a bad review or it has lots of mistakes. I just wanted to give my opinion on this anime because I really liked it and thought there were too much reviews that positioned it in a bad place.I really think it deserves a shot if you like relaxed anime about everyday life with no significant plot.I found it similar to Non Non Biyori or Barakamon, so if you liked those, definitely give it a try.Thanks for reading this.

The series centres around a boy known as kokonutsu. His father tells him one day that he has to run a small shop which is his families legacy. Kokonutsu does not really want to run the store and is left to look after it. Suddenly, an insane purple haired girl who was the main reason people watched the series appears. Her name is Hotaru Shidare. She is one of the main characters. Hotaru is the daughter of a business owner for the famous Shidare Dagashi corporation. She had been sent to retrieve Kokonutsus father to get him to join...the Shidare corporation. We find out that Hotaru has a real sweet tooth, knowing pretty much anything needed to know about candy. We get to meet the 2 other main characters after Hotaru gets Kokonutsu to make a delicious new umaibo mixture. These 2 characters are the twins Says and Tou. Says runs a cafe and Tou kind of just sits there but is a likeable character. Saya is a timid, cute girl. She makes people think there\'s going to be a love rivalry between Hotaru and Saya but there isn\'t. The series serves as a way to sell Dagashi (candy). It\'s quite a good way to advertise something because you know a lot of people will watch it.Now going on from all that description, here\'s the actual review.Dagashi Kashi as I said is a sweet series. The characters are enjoyable, the soundtrack is good, the art is good and it\'s quite enjoyable.Despite that there are a few problems with the series.First of all, there is no story to it really making the series a bit repetitive at times. The pacing of the series I didn\'t really like.There just small problems but the one true problem lies in the dub. The sub doesn\'t really have that much problems with the script but the dub has some really cringe worthy moments and I mean really cringe worthy moments.If you can look past them sorts of things you might enjoy this series. Many people seem to have kind of underestimated it, mostly stopping at episode 7. I swear it gets a bit better after that. I recommend it to people who don\'t mind many advertisements and like a sweet, chilled, relaxing series. the Shidare corporation.

The comedy like it\'s ""slice of life"" genre has simple yet some fanservicey punchlines from the minimal cast however even with 5 main cast members, their chemistry together makes the comedy all the more entertaining and relatable.Although the comedy revolves around traditional Japanese candy that may deter or confuse some people, it still has substance in comedy and relatablity. Candy has always been...a kind of food you could actually have fun with, savour the flavour and best of all, nostalgia, thus it ""just being a Japanese candy, I won\'t get it""...isn\'t much of an excuse...we\'ve all had childhood where we had candy and this anime only reinforces that through comedic timing and characters.There are a bit of referential humor from the ""product placement"" mascots of the Japanese candy (where that actually might deter you but considering that this anime gives some history to these candy at the very least they do that so you CAN be in the loop) and really the humor can go either way, either you\'ll see it blatant product placement or if the comedic timing is right, can be a good laugh, really what LA is saying is that the referential humor can be a hit or a miss.Onto the characters, Kokonotsu does have ""dense male protagonist"" syndrome however he does ""know what he likes"" but is too shy about it, that person being Hotaru who invigorates the anime and comedy with her eccentric skits and candy-addiction and she too is rather dense in the romance department only because she\'s just utterly obsessed with candy AND trying to get Kokonotsu to take the mantle for his father\'s shop. Saya Endou voiced by \'\'Manami Numakura\'\' and her brother Tou Endou voiced by \'\'Tatsuhisa Suzuki\'\' are Kokonotsu\'s childhood friends, with Saya having a tsundere crush over Kokonotsu with Tou giving that shipping for those two. Finally You comes in here and there but he\'s usually loafing around or trying to intact a plan along with Hotaru to get Kokonotsu to be the owner of his shop.

The ending is one with no resolution to the major plotlines from the love triangle to Kokonotsu becoming the owner of the candy shop...your gonna be slightly angry by this, but considering this anime adaptation is still from an ongoing manga, LA was kinda expecting this thus the ""slightly angry"" statement.Dagashi Kashi may look like a ""blatant advertisement for traditional Japanese candy"", but it definitely has something more than that, LA is gonna be slightly cheesy here but it does have heart in it\'s characters for their enthusiasm and love of candy, it may not be thee best comedy of Winter 2016 (as that honor goes to \'\'Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!\'\'), but for a slice of life, relaxing comedy with candy and one eccentric girl in it\'s skits, it definitely caters to that. a kind of food you could actually have fun with, savour the flavour and best of all, nostalgia, thus it ""just being a Japanese candy, I won\'t get it""...isn\'t much of an excuse...we\'ve all had childhood where we had candy and this anime only reinforces that through comedic timing and characters.There are a bit of referential humor from the ""product placement"" mascots of the Japanese candy (where that actually might deter you but considering that this anime gives some history to these candy at the very least they do that so you CAN be in the loop) and really the humor can go either way, either you\'ll see it blatant product placement or if the comedic timing is right, can be a good laugh, really what LA is saying is that the referential humor can be a hit or a miss.Onto the characters, Kokonotsu does have ""dense male protagonist"" syndrome however he does ""know what he likes"" but is too shy about it, that person being Hotaru who invigorates the anime and comedy with her eccentric skits and candy-addiction and she too is rather dense in the romance department only because she\'s just utterly obsessed with candy AND trying to get Kokonotsu to take the mantle for his father\'s shop. Saya Endou voiced by \'\'Manami Numakura\'\' and her brother Tou Endou voiced by \'\'Tatsuhisa Suzuki\'\' are Kokonotsu\'s childhood friends, with Saya having a tsundere crush over Kokonotsu with Tou giving that shipping for those two.

A while later he meets a girl who looks exactly like the one from his manga, except this one has a sweet tooth for anything Japanese and edible (or non-edible, for that matter), and an extremely inappropriate sense of humour (which is what we all like) which derives from the fact that she doesn\'t really know where the boundaries stand or the concept of an innuendo. And then shit happens for 12 episodes.[STORY]The whole of the main...story (mostly spoiler-free) is in the first paragraph. Besides that, Dagashi Kashi is more like a 12-episode, 23 minute commercial for various Japanese sweet companies. Each episode is laid in the format that ""Kokonotsu does something related to some random-ass sweet, Hotaru finds out and realises, she spends an eternity lecturing him on the sweet\'s history and intricate details no-one but ""tru dagashi fanatiks"" care about."". Despite this, I found the story interesting as I could learn about various Japanese sweets, and I got to see more of Best Girl Saya and Big Boobs Hotaru.[ART]Everything in the show is actually surprisingly well drawn, although the artist\'s style of drawing eyes is wildly weird for me (weird circles instead of an iris and pupil), although I believe this fits the style of the rest. Dagashi Kashi\'s animation is actually pulled off pretty well, and flawed only by slight marks of dullness and not much variety or showcasing of it\'s limits.[SOUND]The voice acting is well done (even in the dub) and both the OP and ED songs are catchy enough for me to remember them long after DK\'s finished airing.

Unlike many of the other anime which also produce down this like, I'll confidently say that the creativity behind Dagashi Kashi is through the roof.I'll skip the synopsis and whatnot and go straight to explaining.At first, Dagashi Kashi might seem a bit plotless or plain. You're actually correct; there's actually no major plot in this and it is plain. There's little to no romance and just looking at it, all that's left is the humour. But this is not what this anime is aiming for. Dagashi Kashi wants it's...viewers to hit that nostalgia spot and wants you to crawl back into your childhood.Let's stand back a bit and look at anime from a wide perspective. Anime is targeted towards its local audience (Japan) before considering the foreign audience (other countries). Coming from an Asian background, childhood mainly consists of: Playing at the park, doing crazy things with other kids, and of course; visiting a Candy shop (Unfortunately Candy Shop are getting rarer and rarer so finding one is very difficult nowadays.)From the whole 12 episodes of Dagashi Kashi which advertised a new candy on every episode, I've probably tasted around 30-40% of them. I've seen many of them before but never had a chance to taste them. Every time a candy that I've tasted or seen, I just think back of the time when I'd spend the weekly pocket money all on these candy and eat them all with friends. Really hits the spot, dead on.The art was definitely well done; Characters were lacking depth but that shouldn't matter in this case as there is no major plot.Overall, you will definitely enjoy this anime if you had a childhood that can relate to this anime. If you don't, just take this experience to build a list of Dagashi that you want to buy when you visit Japan for a holiday.Adieu! viewers to hit that nostalgia spot and wants you to crawl back into your childhood.Let's stand back a bit and look at anime from a wide perspective.

One day, a girl appeared and she tried to recruit his father to work for her company. He refused and so did Kokonotsu. Hotaru then decides to stay to try and convince Kokonotsu to work for her company.I have no idea why I decided to enter this show with expectations. The first episode was really interesting and I thought it was going to go somewhere. Even if the...plot was going somewhere like a garbage, I\'d rather have that than 12 episodes of pure advertisement for a candy. That\'s literally the whole show. Every single episode, Hotaru brings in a new candy or she randomly picks one of the candies in Kokonotsu\'s Father\'s Dagashi shop and then she explains the whole candy for you. The concept, how it\'s made, where it came from, what it tastes like, how you should eat it and etc. But wait there\'s more, Hotaru is not the only character who talks about candies. Every character in the show talks about candies.I just explained the whole show for you so I have no more idea what to talk about..Oh that\'s right, the comedy and the fan-service. What I\'m going to talk about right now is going to be purely subjective since not everyone found the show to be funny. I actually found this show a bit funny and it made me chuckle through the run. For example, Hotaru\'s crazy-ass personality made me laugh sometimes and Kokonotsu and Endou being desperate at whatever also made me laugh.  I also noticed that some people found this show boring. For me, I only found the show boring at the first half. At the second half, I just, for whatever reason, enjoyed the remaining episodes. Maybe because I watched the show in English Dub or maybe I got used to watching a 24 minute candy commercial every week.Just by looking at the cover, you\'ll know at first\'s glance the character who\'s going to be subjected to fanservice. Yep, that\'s Hotaru. The show is going to be playing with her extremely large breasts in almost every episode so strap on if you want to see candy crumbs falling on her breasts or if you want to see a Slimey/Watery white candy (I forget what it was called) exploding on her face.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)The Art and the Character Design looks pretty average. It\'s what you\'d expect from a Slice of Life show except I won\'t call this a Sol show since it\'s not labeled in the Genre tags. This show is created by Studio feel, the studio behind My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO and I honestly would have preferred if the character designs were almost the same as SNAFU TOO because the art in that show is feel\'s best work and this feels like half-assed. The animation is pretty good, though I wasn\'t expecting much since this show is just about candies.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (7/10)The soundtrack is....forgettable. Nothing really stood out and nothing attracted my attention. It was just a bunch of plain ass boring soundtracks. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""Checkmate?!"" by MICHI and ""Hey! Calorie Queen"" by Ayana Taketatsu. For a show about freaking candies, the Opening Animation didn\'t really make much sense... There was Star Wars-like segments feauturing  Kokonotsu and some random guy that looked like Darth Vader, an Indiana Jones-like segments, characters flying in paper warplanes...you get what I\'m trying to say. The OP theme song on the other hand is pretty average and it\'s somewhat catchy. The ED theme song is also average and the only reason why I would watch it is to watch the post-credit scene. You could say that I could have easily skipped the ED to watch the post-credit scene but.....it is what it is.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (6.5/10)The only highlights of this god-forsaken 24 minutes candy commercial is Hotaru. The rest of the characters are mediocre (Kokonotsu and Tou) to decent (Saya). Now to talk about the characters.Hotaru is an innocent, candy loving girl who knows pretty much about every Dagashi out there in Japan. Like I said above, she\'s the highlights of this show. She\'s like the only interesting character in the show and is the only reason why I came back every week. She\'s also one of the reasons why the show is hilarious. Her personality, her innocent ""act"" that can be easily taken out of context, and the way she eats her candies freaking killed me. For example, there was one scene in the show where she was eating and chocking on a long and large candy. If you take a deeper look at the scene, the show makes it look like she\'s chocking on a large penis but it\'s just a giant and long pink candy.Then there\'s the rest of the characters. Kokonotsu, Tou and Saya. Kokonotsu is a manga artist who lives in a Dagashi shop with his father and has to deal with Hotaru\'s crazy antics ever since she came into her shop. He\'s a mediocre character, that\'s all I gotta say. He\'s a bland and boring main character but the reason why he\'s not a forgettable character is because the show\'s character roster is super small. Then there\'s Tou, he\'s your typical perverted male character who likes to chase girls. I do like the chemistry between Kokonotsu and Tou which makes me like their characters at times. Then finally there\'s Saya, the only decent character in the series, just under Hotaru. What makes her interesting is her personality and she\'s also a ""tsundere"", my number one favourite character archetype.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (7/10)Who said I can\'t enjoy a 24 minutes candy commercial? There are times where I found the show to be quite boring but most of the time, I did enjoy the show and it was a fun ride. Though, I won\'t be missing this show so good riddance.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Despite ""Dagashi Kashi"" having a weak-ass plot, the characters, especially Hotaru, does make the show interesting to watch. I did learn something while watching this show. First is the meaning of ""Dagashi"" and second is the amount and the variety of dagashi out there in Japan which makes me want to try them out. If you love candies sooo much then this is a show for you but if you\'re looking for a regular slice-of-life then I guess this is an ok show but I won\'t be bringing my expectations up if I were you because there are a lot more slice-of-life shows out there that takes place in a rural Japan and is 100 times better than this show.[OVERALL]: (7/10)Pros:+Entertaining show if you don\'t have any expectations+Interesting characters+Great Animation+The show\'s comedy is hilarious at timesCons:-Candies, Candies, and a whole lot more Candies-Forgettable Soundtrack-A very weak slice-of-life when compared to other slice-of-life shows with similar settings but without the candies. plot was going somewhere like a garbage, I\'d rather have that than 12 episodes of pure advertisement for a candy.

Turns out you can make an anime out of almost anything. The story revolves around japanese snacks, also known as ""dagashi."" From the first episode, it had an interesting aura around it, telling you that it wasn\'t gonna be a stereotypical anime. There was virtually no plot for the whole season, just a piece of sort-of-plot thrown in there known as ""I must get Kokonotsu to inheirit the dagashi shop!"" However, the anime itself didn\'t hit on this point for most of the...episodes and it wasn\'t really a big part of the anime, just a lame excuse to put some characters somewhere.Despite all this, I found the anime actually very enjoyable. The silliness of it and the interaction between characters was quite endearing, and it somehow drew me in before I knew it. The whole anime was just eye candy, no plot but still very enjoyable, like Nichijou or Daily Lives of Highschool Boys.Overall, I would have to say this is a mainly comedy anime with many fun points to check out, and it\'s great for people who are looking for something light and quick to watch. episodes and it wasn\'t really a big part of the anime, just a lame excuse to put some characters somewhere.Despite all this, I found the anime actually very enjoyable.

Sure why not, seems harmless enough. And harmless it is: I discovered this via another website that was showing off a cosplayer\'s talents and ended up looking up the anime and eventually watching it (although I won\'t deny that one of the main heroin\'s ""plot"" played a large part in this).The first episode was enough to get me hooked, and my innate curiosity for all forms of weird and wonderful culinary creations helped a lot with that (thank you Roald Dahl), so overall I found the premise and informative tidbits about the sweets...quite enjoyable really (although, that really is the main topic of this anime, maybe a bit too much so in fact).The characters and artwork are all excellent, even though there are only basically four main characters: the aspiring mangaka protagonist who doesn\'t want to take over his dad\'s sweet shop, his flat-chested and somewhat overpowered childhood friend who secretly loves him, her brother the nice, slightly overconfident and perverted ""guide"" (not really sure how to describe him, it\'s always the same kind of guy in these ""romance"" comedies), and the buxom heiress to a sweet company for whom the MC has a (kinda) crush on (or maybe it\'s just straight up lust, it seems a bit more like that frankly).So there\'s humor, the OP childhood friend beats them all at these childhood games, a few flashbacks, a love triangle that doesn\'t really go anywhere and a huuuge amount of anecdotes related to sweets. It\'s all very nice (if not a bit boring from time to time), but the story just kind of gives up and dies at some point in the last few episodes, which seem to build up to (at least) a moderately impressive (if not maybe predictable) firework style ending, and then the last episode just pops, fizzes, smokes a little and splutters not very convincingly like a wet and rather small firecracker.Which is a shame really, because that kind of thing tends to dampen your spirits and leave you thinking: ""right..Well that was a bit of a cock-up wasn\'t it?""Overall, I\'d rate it 6-7: it\'s fun, I personally enjoyed it, but definitely don\'t watch it if you\'re not interested in sweets, want an interesting story or 24 minutes of the buxom heroin\'s chest (because they only focus on it twice and you can hardly see her bra through a transparent-whit T-Shirt).There is oppai ice-cream though, so that\'s something I feel might be lacking in Occidental sweet-shops. quite enjoyable really (although, that really is the main topic of this anime, maybe a bit too much so in fact).The characters and artwork are all excellent, even though there are only basically four main characters: the aspiring mangaka protagonist who doesn\'t want to take over his dad\'s sweet shop, his flat-chested and somewhat overpowered childhood friend who secretly loves him, her brother the nice, slightly overconfident and perverted ""guide"" (not really sure how to describe him, it\'s always the same kind of guy in these ""romance"" comedies), and the buxom heiress to a sweet company for whom the MC has a (kinda) crush on (or maybe it\'s just straight up lust, it seems a bit more like that frankly).So there\'s humor, the OP childhood friend beats them all at these childhood games, a few flashbacks, a love triangle that doesn\'t really go anywhere and a huuuge amount of anecdotes related to sweets.

Instead, it turned out to be a slice of life comedy with a huge focus on sweets particularly Japanese...sweets and their origin. The middle part is the reason for it\'s mediocre rating, it\'s just too difficult for Western audiences to delve into the show and understand each and every reference and it. This anime was one of those cases of an anime ""Made by a Japanese Studio for a Japanese Audience"" and sadly unlike other reference-heavy anime like Gintama this can\'t be maneuvered by a simple Translator\'s Note... That aside, what made up for it is the easy pace and thankfully worthwhile ending. Though the ending is not exactly giving closure a second season is coming up on Jan 12th next year and so this ending makes sense.De!Art: 8/10Made by feel. I was a bit surprised at the attractive artstyle of Dagashi Kashi because their previous works felt kinda average for me. Kiss x Sis, Mayo Chiki, last year\'s Konobi, the ever popular (and imo slightly disappointing) SNAFU Season 2 along with this year\'s Tsukigakirei are all examples of anime that looked very average in their artstyle. But out of all these, Dagashi Kashi felt a tad better. Character designs were more colorful with a lot of focus on the face, backgrounds looked better, and the list went on. These all made me feel as if Dagashi Kashi is one of the best looking anime made by feel. and so even if it doesn\'t have the best of stories by feel. animated anime it certainly looks great.De!Sound: 6/10The OP/ED were really catchy and both perfectly showed the message of the anime clearly. Though yet again I preferred the ED over the OP (this has been going on for the past few reviews I\'ve done, the ED just feels better than the OP). Now obviously one may appeal over the other for you (or none at all) but I can tell you this much that both were fun to watch and were animated nicely as well. The BGM however, even I with a great memory of BGM couldn\'t find it memorable at all. It felt bland and totally forgettable... Otherwise it was great.De!Character: 7/10I marvelled at how they made a female MC so amazing YET she doesn\'t fall in love with the male MC as it happens in most similar anime of its kind (but then there\'s a season 2 so who knows?). Who am I talking about? Hotaru of course! She wasn\'t just your fanservice character, she was unique. No wonder she was the face of the anime. She loved sweets, she loved them so much that I can kind of understand why there\'s no romance yet. Upbeat, cheerful, and outright wierd, Hotaru had it all. Definitely my 2nd favorite Purple-Haired girl. On the other side we have Coconut- I mean Kokonotsu. He as well as Hotaru is a refreshing character in the way that he isn\'t some hopeless creature who doesn\'t have any aim and still gets all the girls. He has his motivations for being a manga-writer, he has his reasons to refuse the post of succeeding his eccentric Ramune-loving Dad at the Sweet Shop. What makes him so much fun as a character is that he\'s quite relatable as a character. For the supporting cast we have Saya and Tou, who do a very good job as support. The former got more screentime and development but the latter had an important part to play as well. I am quite surprised at how such a small cast of around 5-6 characters pulled it off, but well done.De!Enjoyment: 6/10It was a treat (pun intended) watching Dagashi Kashi. Since I\'m on a slice of life binge right now, I came across it when looking for the upcoming Winter 2018 anime where I noticed season 2 listed there and got intrigued (NOT by Hotaru mind you, I-I w-wont get attracted to a show because of that b-baka!) and gave the first season a shot (of non-alcoholic Beer) and enjoyed it. I would have loved if there was a focus on Romance as well but I\'ll look to the positive side and hope that the second season has some much-needed romance and I assure you, if there IS romance it\'s score will be ahead of the first season\'s. The slice of life aspect was nicely done and I liked the characters and their design as well. Overall I\'m hyped for season 2!De!Overall: 6.6 (Averaged)Comedy, sweets, infotainment Dagashi Kashi had it all. It blended all these things perfectly and unlike Hotaru\'s medicine is sure to make you feel better and happy once you finish the series. An underrated gem, Dagashi Kashi is a must-watch for all Slice of Life fan, comedy fans and of course fans of Ramune-loving I mean Japanese sweets! Here\'s to a wonderful series and here\'s to a hopefully better season 2 as well!P.S: Why the ""De!""s?

Even not summer, but my writing about ""How I spend my summer.""For me, it was that type of compositions when you sit at evening and try to find something worthwhile and not too embarrassing. Because nothing worthwhile didn\'t happen. Heroic deals - not for you, supernatural things always happens in other countries, apocalypse was canceled. All what you do: just went outdoor, met your friends, walk nearby with silly thoughts and do dummy things. You can\'t write about it, it was fun for you, not for anybody else.And ""Dagashi Kashi"" is...exactly about this kind of summer. It set of short stories about teenagers (Kokonotsu, Hotaru, Saya and Tou) who doing nothing special. Hotaru with hers perverted on sweets mind, all time finds some game to play. Kokonotsu, because of none more important job to do, join her. Tou is just a dude, who thinking about boobs and how to become popular, and Saya looking at this zoo with curiosity and try to understand, what sense in all of this.But there is no sense, it just fun, good and so nostalgic to do dummy things, without any hint on moral. Eat candies, relax and you will be happy.So, this anime had no plot (but who need plot in sitcom?), jokes were sometimes childish.

(episodic manner, non-plot-heavy, fan-services, mysterious Japanese snacks and commercial-ish) It is not the type of anime that everyone would like, but I am glad that I never trust the score of MAL and believe in my intuition when I picking up anime.For the story, as a Slice of Life anime, it never intends to tell a story. Plot almost doesn't exist to begin with. Therefore it is kind of irrelevant and unfair to judge the value of this anime with its plot.For the...art and sounds, snacks look delicious. Eyes are unique. OP and ED are catchy. The voice acting is great. Hotaru is voiced by Taketatsu Ayana, who is a very polished voice actor. other characters are also voiced by experienced voice actors.Characters: It has a very small cast of only 5 people. All 5 of them are fun to watch. No complains.Enjoyment: The most important aspect of an anime is always the enjoyment. This anime can be thoroughly enjoyable, can be terrible. It really depends on what types of viewer you are.1. Fan-services: This anime has a moderate amount of it which make the it overall more fun to watch, so it's good news for me. What's better is that they didn't overdone it, snacks and talks are still the major appeal of this show.2. Sense of humour: If you like the following things, you will like this anime.-Innuendos: This anime has a lots of Innuendos, they are like the refined form of fan-services, and are even more exciting than flashing boobs.-''Ridiculous humour'': Hotaru is a ridiculous character, it is an enjoyment to watch Hotaru talking and acting over-the-top about snacks.-Parody: The parody are the core of this anime, mostly in two forms:1. characters acting so serious over some silliy competition2. anthropomorphic snacks having some little drama3. NostalgiaIt's really a personal factor. I don't know the situation overseas, but Japanese snacks like Babystar, Umaibou and Morinaga milk candy are very accessible in Hong Kong. Of course not all of them are available in local snacks store, but even when they are not available, we always can have their China counterpart (counterfeit). I don't know how to describe the feeling when they talk about my childhood snacks. Maybe it's like meeting my childhood friends? I really don't know, but I thoroughly enjoy it.So overall it is a 9 out of 10 for me. I am really disappointed to see this anime is not loved here, but I mean different audience have different tastes, it is what it is. Some may call it a snack commercial. I believe it is, I even prepare some Dagashi to eat while watching the last few episodes. Therefore it is a successful commercial anime. Can't wait to watch season 2. art and sounds, snacks look delicious. Eyes are unique. OP and ED are catchy. The voice acting is great.

Can't wait to watch season 2."", 'Dagashi Kashi is quite a unique anime to come out in recent times. You may have seen a lot of monster of the week or villain of the week anime, but how many candy of the week anime have you seen. I sure haven’t seen any! The premise is quite interesting, as it’s fun to learn about candy, or referred to as dagashi in the series. The dagashi talk is fun and all, but the series leaves me wanting more from the series. The characters are interesting and it would have been nice to go in-depth with them. And the fact that the series feels...aimless didn’t help either. Still, Dagashi Kashi gets its job done.~{Story}~The story focuses on Kokonotsu, a wannabe mangaka who works with his dad in maintaining their dagashi shop. One day a girl named Hotaru comes to their shop, wanting Kokonotsu’s to join their dagashi manufacturing company. This can only be possible is Kokonotsu decide to take over the shop after his father leaves. What first started out as a story about a girl trying to force a boy to take care of his shop, turned out to be a competition between the two to find out who’s more knowledgeable in dagashi. Every episodes gives us comedic situations revolving around dagashi and how the characters react and act in these situation. In every episode, we learn more about these dagashi candies and it’s really fun. There’s no real overarching story here. It won’t take long for you to forget about Kokonatsu’s dream to be a mangaka, or why Hotaru’s here in the first place. It would’ve been nice if more focus was given to these plot points. But the episodes revolving around dagashi are pretty entertaining, even if the content is a hit or miss.Story: 5/10~{Presentation}~First of all, as I mentioned before, Dagashi Kashi has an episodic structure. Actually, for most of the times there’s more than one situation in each episode. Many of these stories don’t connect much with one another besides the characters. The overall main plot, which was mentioned fore, is just used as a frame, to hold all these episodes together. Every episode you get to learn more about dagashi and its really fun. The anime does a great job to teach you new stuff in a more interesting way than reading off a textbook. The anime then uses these dagashi to make a comedic moment. This showcases the creativity in the series is great, as it manages to make a moment out of these dagashi. Dagashi heavily relies on its comedy too get you attention and entertain. If a moment lacks comedy, it doesn’t feel very good. And unfortunately the content here is a hit or miss, though it’s mostly a hit. And the content can get a little too repetitive at times. But still, the style it goes for is great, and it does what it wants to achieve.Presentation: 6/10~{Character}~The characters in Dagashi Kashi are quite good. A lot of them are very entertaining. First we have our main protagonist Kokonotsu, and the best this about him is his name. He’s an okay protagonist, nothing too special, but some of his reactions are pretty funny. Then you have Hotaru, a wacky, dim-minded, yet knowledgeable in dagashi girl, who’s conversations can become unintentionally lewd. She’s easily the most entertaining character in the anime and her love for dagashi never fails to impress me. Her being used as fanservice is a little bit annoying at times. Saya’s another entertaining character in this anime. Her tsundere-ish character isn’t actually annoying, but more refreshing. Here reactions to certain situations, and her OP-ness in luck-based games, are always impressive. Tou’s also pretty funny and an underused character. Also Kokonotsu’s just adds to the wackiness! The bunch of characters are really fun and its really entertaining seeing them react to certain situations. Though none of them get any development that adds depth to them, but for a strictly comedy series, its fine if the development is lacking.Character: 7/10~{Art}~,Dagashi Kashi’s art style is a pretty unique one. By looking at the key visuals, it wouldn’t take much to notice that the character designs, particularly the face designs are pretty unique. Now whether these designs are good or bad is subjective, as it depends on one’s taste. Personally, they add a uniqueness and they can add a better comedic effect to some scenes. The eyes on most of the characters are pretty different. Most of the character’s pupils are tiny and it makes them look cross-eyed at times. Somehow, this just makes some of the comedy scenes feel better (and weirder). Hotaru’s ahegao-looking face just adds to the innuendos and the lewdness. And it also makes people misunderstand her words. The backgrounds in the anime are decent, nothing too special. The detaining isn’t much, but it’s the character designs that shine in Dagashi Kashi.Art: 7/10~{Animation}~The animations in Dagashi Kashi are standard. There’s nothing that shows out to be special. At times, character movements lack the smoothness and fluidity I was hoping for. And the backgrounds do feel a bit to static, but it’s not bad. The anime still looks good and the at style does cover up the animation qualities. And for a slice-of-life comedy, there’s no need for the animations to be fantastic (unless you’re Nichijou that is). Still the animations work well, even if it doesn’t stand out. At least it’s consistent, or else inconsistency (even if its high point if phenomenal) doesn’t look good.Animation: 6.5/10~{Voice Acting}~The voice acting is really impressive in Dagashi Kashi, as a lot of them do the comic timing properly. Kokonotsu’s seiyuu, Abe Atsushi, does a standard job. It isn’t anything too special, but it gets the job done. Taketatsu Ayana on the other hand does a fantastic job as Hotaru. She manages to succeed in making Hotaru a zany, weird, and really fun at the same time. She manages to make the character look dumb and smart at the same time. Numakura Manami also does a fairly good job as Saya. It’s not anything too special, but she does justice to the role. Suzuki Tatsuhisa as Tou on the other hand is great! He does a good job making Tou look like a dumb and not too bright guy, while making him likeable. Fujiwara Keiji does Kokonotsu’s dad, You, and he does a fantastic job. Fujiwara is a fantastic seiyuu do it isn’t surprising that he’ll do a great job in this comedic role. Overall, the cast does a great job in voice acting. Some do outshine others though.Voice Acting: 7.5/10~{Music}~The music in Dagashi Kashi is really good too. The OP, “Checkmate!?”, is quite the underrated one this season. Personally, I find it really catchy, upbeat, and it totally matches the mood of the series. The vocals aren’t anything to special, but the music used for the OP splendid. The ED, “Hey! Calorie Queen” is also really good. Just like the OP, it’s fun and upbeat, and it even matches the anime’s content. The vocals are really good in this ED. The background music used in the anime is pretty decent. It works well during the more comedic scenes, but it doesn’t add too much. The background music doesn’t really stand out much, but it’s decent.Music: 6.5/10~{Enjoyment}~A Part of me feels like I enjoyed Dagashi Kashi more than I should have. Its main plot is unfocused, and the content does get repetitive at times. But I couldn’t get enough of those characters and their silliness. I found myself enjoying seeing them interact with one another. And it was really fun learning about dagashi every week, even though I’m not a big candy fan myself. Also the unique art really does make this anime more intriguing. The silliness and over-the-top-ness makes me grin harder than I should. Some comedy is a miss, some of the reason can be because the jokes may not translate properly. Other than that, Dagashi Kashi has been a fun ride.Enjoyment: 6/10In the end, Dagashi Kashi does exactly what it needs to do; it has the characters doing wacky things and us learning about dagashi. It doesn’t try to achieve anything more than that, but it’s fine the way it is. With its loveable characters and some really good voice acting, the anime ended up being enjoyable, even if the content started to get repetitive. Dagashi Kashi is a flawed anime no doubt, but it’s fun because it doesn’t take itself too seriously. The comedy may a hit or miss for some, but for the most time, it doesn’t miss. Dagashi Kashi is a unique and sweet (pun intended) anime from this season, and it’ll be hard to find something else similar to this.+ Very enjoyable characters with wacky traits, supported by very good voice acting+ Unique art and great character/facial designs+ Teaches us about dagashi using its comedic situations in order to entertain while teaching+ The comedy is very creative at times, and is over-the-top without being too nonsensical- Content starts to get repetitive and does feel aimless at times- The comedy, during some moments, is a hit or missOverall: 6.4/10 aimless didn’t help either. Still, Dagashi Kashi gets its job done.~{Story}~The story focuses on Kokonotsu, a wannabe mangaka who works with his dad in maintaining their dagashi shop.

First we have our main protagonist Kokonotsu, and the best this about him is his name. He’s an okay protagonist, nothing too special, but some of his reactions are pretty funny. Then you have Hotaru, a wacky, dim-minded, yet knowledgeable in dagashi girl, who’s conversations can become unintentionally lewd. She’s easily the most entertaining character in the anime and her love for dagashi never fails to impress me. Her being used as fanservice is a little bit annoying at times. Saya’s another entertaining character in this anime. Her tsundere-ish character isn’t actually annoying, but more refreshing. Here reactions to certain situations, and her OP-ness in luck-based games, are always impressive. Tou’s also pretty funny and an underused character. Also Kokonotsu’s just adds to the wackiness! The bunch of characters are really fun and its really entertaining seeing them react to certain situations. Though none of them get any development that adds depth to them, but for a strictly comedy series, its fine if the development is lacking.Character: 7/10~{Art}~,Dagashi Kashi’s art style is a pretty unique one. By looking at the key visuals, it wouldn’t take much to notice that the character designs, particularly the face designs are pretty unique. Now whether these designs are good or bad is subjective, as it depends on one’s taste. Personally, they add a uniqueness and they can add a better comedic effect to some scenes. The eyes on most of the characters are pretty different. Most of the character’s pupils are tiny and it makes them look cross-eyed at times. Somehow, this just makes some of the comedy scenes feel better (and weirder). Hotaru’s ahegao-looking face just adds to the innuendos and the lewdness. And it also makes people misunderstand her words. The backgrounds in the anime are decent, nothing too special. The detaining isn’t much, but it’s the character designs that shine in Dagashi Kashi.Art: 7/10~{Animation}~The animations in Dagashi Kashi are standard. There’s nothing that shows out to be special. At times, character movements lack the smoothness and fluidity I was hoping for. And the backgrounds do feel a bit to static, but it’s not bad. The anime still looks good and the at style does cover up the animation qualities. And for a slice-of-life comedy, there’s no need for the animations to be fantastic (unless you’re Nichijou that is). Still the animations work well, even if it doesn’t stand out. At least it’s consistent, or else inconsistency (even if its high point if phenomenal) doesn’t look good.Animation: 6.5/10~{Voice Acting}~The voice acting is really impressive in Dagashi Kashi, as a lot of them do the comic timing properly. Kokonotsu’s seiyuu, Abe Atsushi, does a standard job. It isn’t anything too special, but it gets the job done. Taketatsu Ayana on the other hand does a fantastic job as Hotaru. She manages to succeed in making Hotaru a zany, weird, and really fun at the same time. She manages to make the character look dumb and smart at the same time. Numakura Manami also does a fairly good job as Saya. It’s not anything too special, but she does justice to the role. Suzuki Tatsuhisa as Tou on the other hand is great! He does a good job making Tou look like a dumb and not too bright guy, while making him likeable. Fujiwara Keiji does Kokonotsu’s dad, You, and he does a fantastic job. Fujiwara is a fantastic seiyuu do it isn’t surprising that he’ll do a great job in this comedic role. Overall, the cast does a great job in voice acting. Some do outshine others though.Voice Acting: 7.5/10~{Music}~The music in Dagashi Kashi is really good too. The OP, “Checkmate!?”, is quite the underrated one this season. Personally, I find it really catchy, upbeat, and it totally matches the mood of the series. The vocals aren’t anything to special, but the music used for the OP splendid. The ED, “Hey! Calorie Queen” is also really good. Just like the OP, it’s fun and upbeat, and it even matches the anime’s content. The vocals are really good in this ED. The background music used in the anime is pretty decent. It works well during the more comedic scenes, but it doesn’t add too much. The background music doesn’t really stand out much, but it’s decent.Music: 6.5/10~{Enjoyment}~A Part of me feels like I enjoyed Dagashi Kashi more than I should have. Its main plot is unfocused, and the content does get repetitive at times. But I couldn’t get enough of those characters and their silliness. I found myself enjoying seeing them interact with one another. And it was really fun learning about dagashi every week, even though I’m not a big candy fan myself. Also the unique art really does make this anime more intriguing. The silliness and over-the-top-ness makes me grin harder than I should. Some comedy is a miss, some of the reason can be because the jokes may not translate properly. Other than that, Dagashi Kashi has been a fun ride.Enjoyment: 6/10In the end, Dagashi Kashi does exactly what it needs to do; it has the characters doing wacky things and us learning about dagashi. It doesn’t try to achieve anything more than that, but it’s fine the way it is. With its loveable characters and some really good voice acting, the anime ended up being enjoyable, even if the content started to get repetitive. Dagashi Kashi is a flawed anime no doubt, but it’s fun because it doesn’t take itself too seriously. The comedy may a hit or miss for some, but for the most time, it doesn’t miss. Dagashi Kashi is a unique and sweet (pun intended) anime from this season, and it’ll be hard to find something else similar to this.+ Very enjoyable characters with wacky traits, supported by very good voice acting+ Unique art and great character/facial designs+ Teaches us about dagashi using its comedic situations in order to entertain while teaching+ The comedy is very creative at times, and is over-the-top without being too nonsensical- Content starts to get repetitive and does feel aimless at times- The comedy, during some moments, is a hit or missOverall: 6.4/10', ""Dagashi Kashi doesn't really feel like an anime per se, more of an advertisement along with a history lesson.So the general story is that Hotaru one day appears at Kokonotsu's candy store to persuade You (his father) to join her company, but You will only agree if Kokonotsu takes over the candy store. And... that's pretty much where the story ends because from thenceforth every episode is exploring a different Japanese candy, how delicious they are, and their history, along with some light fan service. So basically, this is like Shokugeki no Souma lite.In regards to art and sound they're okay. The art is better...than average so it's an 8 while the sound is an average of 7.The characters are pretty stagnant which would've been okay in a slice-of-life but I feel as though there should be a bit more to them. Kokonotsu also has a childhood friend who secretly likes him and for whatever reason she serves, we don't really know.Overall, the anime is okay. It's really something that's acceptable to watch while you eat to pass the time, but it's not something I would recommend you to go out of your way to watch unless you're really interested in learning about Japanese candy that you may want to try. than average so it's an 8 while the sound is an average of 7.The characters are pretty stagnant which would've been okay in a slice-of-life but I feel as though there should be a bit more to them.

Hotaru shows up in the other characters' village and they spend time being happy normal people with one crazy huge-breasted girl who lives, breathes and loves sweets. I just spoiled the whole show's plot for you, deal with it~Art: I think the cover speaks for itself. It looks nice, character designs are simple yet come off as quite memorable and in general the animation is doing its job perfectly fine for a simple slice of life.Sound: Honestly love the opening song and in general all the tunes. The sound design is also nothing to scoff at.Characters: they're all likeable but I...don't think any of them are anywhere near fantastic. Dagashi Kashi works well because it is carried by its characters interactions and Hotaru's insanity, but if you look at the fine print none of the characters are amazing or even great. Kokonotsu, Saya and To each do a better job than your typical harem protagonist(no this isn't a harem anime), typical childhood lover/friend and typical annoying best friend. There is effort in making them stand out, and they do stand out, as in they're not as lame as most of what you can find, and each of them has personality and charm. It doesn't make them great. I liked all of them and would watch the anime again to see them again, but I will not remember any of them.Enjoyment: To be very fair Dagashi Kashi is best enjoyed in small increments. Barfing the 12 episodes in one night would be the worst idea for a simple reason: the whole show relies on its characters and Hotaru's insanity as I said, and there isn't enough material there to fill 12 episodes with interesting content. So instead DK tends to stump around a bit and drag and repeat its architecture again and again. An episode starts, Hotaru will do or say something insane, it'll end up being about a sweet, and we'll have a ton of character interaction and trivia about the sweet. It's a fine system and there's nothing wrong with using it a lot, but DagaKa ONLY uses that, beyond this principle there is no plot and nothing really new ever happens. I think the Festival episode is the only one with something actually different.Overall: I watched Dagashi Kashi in two parts, episode 1 to 7 then episode 8 to 12. I can say for sure that I stopped for a while after 7 simply because I was bored. A boredom which had disappeared by the time I came back to it some weeks later. If I had to state an overall feeling on Dagashi Kashi it would be that among then numerous comedies with commercial goals and plotless slices of life that I've watched, I think it's still on the higher tiers of quality. It's worth watching and it is fun, even if it does get tiring after the jokes have been seen a few too many times. Likeable and interesting characters go a long way, and even if Dagashi Kashi doesn't have much more than that except the obvious erotic undertones constantly thrown around, it's enough to make it enjoyable, if only slightly. don't think any of them are anywhere near fantastic.

So  far, this anime hasn\'t delivery much except show us audience all things that concern about the Japanese snack things. In fact I feel like watching something from TLC, which would be too obnoxious for the likes of Antony Bordain and Andrew Zimmer. I\'d said too obnoxious because it still has that Japanese exaggeration element, where I feel like giving the author a head slap, but then again I\'d appreciate the simplicity of the anime as a whole:On the story side of this anime, I\'d say that there isn\'t any story plot at all, it was just...a guy who is a mangka wannabe, who has to take over the business and the story plot ends there when some odd buxom girl arrives in the scene and that where the food docu starts.......Let\'s face it, man, when the buxom girl starts to yap about Japanese snacks, you\'re no longer watching an entertaining anime but a docu....a very funny docu that is.On the art side, ok so there isn\'t that quintessential knee high sock wearing bimbo, the replacement, some buxom girl in a Gothic lolita outfit, the only consultation about her is her big melons, hate to say it fashion-wise only Saya  nailed it. Kokonutsu\'s fashion looks like something that\'s out of this world, Tou\'s fashion is that of some Hawaiian Haole whom them Hawaiians would like to feed to the Sharks.

Saya, well she the usual childhood friend, but as the anime ends somehow the direction goes more on Kokonutsu heading towards the oddball Hotaru, frankly I can only pity her for being in a usual childhood friend position. Tou and You, they just serves as the comic relief, thought I would have prefer that Tou is cast as a hot cool guy rather than just Saya\'s punching bag.Enjoyment side, it was enjoyable to a certain extent, especially when the focus is on Hotaru, sure there is that comedy element in it, but at time I would feel like skipping some episodes that were just too cheesy.Since all that matters it the ""Overall"" I\'m gonna give this anime a 6 as in ""fair,"" the story lack a certain follow up where it ends when oddball girl comes in the picture.

Before watching it I saw pictures of Hotaru all over the internet and instantly decided to watch it. The story is more or less, just basic slice of life with not much of an ongoing story progression, but that's plenty for me as its really entertaining especially some of the situations Hotaru gets everyone into by insinuating things she doesn't mean without knowing it. Also Snacks, Lots and Lots of Snacks! Episode 1 of this show instantly transported me back to my trip to Japan where I won some...Umai-Bou in an arcade game, so I ordered some.Highly recommended to any fans of comedy or slice of life.

I think a lot of people should give this show a chance and here\'s why.The number one thing that got me hyped for this show was it\'s incredible and unique art style. Just looking at Hotaru (girl with the purple hair) on the cover made me know the aesthetic is going to be amazing, which it was. And the story also sounded very promising too.Story 5: In a nutshell, Hotaru Shidare is here to convince Kokonotsu to take over his fathers candy store which is a family business. She introduces Kokonotsu...to many different wonders of dagashi (candy) and we learn many different things from this. Buuuut, that\'s not a very good storyline and can seem rather bland. However, the show manages to keep this entertaining! It\'s crazy with a story like this kept me waiting each week for the next episode to come out.The main problem I had with the show/storyline is it\'s constant use of promoting. You can now buy candy seen from the show, doesn\'t that seem like their intention all along? just to make these candy companies more profit. It had me wondering why I was watching it in the first place however, I did like their use of candy such as using them for episode titles. Though it still seemed like Hotaru was actually trying to say ""buy this!"" and ""this dagashi is also great!"" whilst constantly throwing dagashi right at the screen.Art 10: The art is beautiful, wacky unique with a wide range of bright colours and darker colours. Each character had memorable designs which I know I\'ll never forget!Character 9: Ah Hotaru and Saya...two lovely female characters. We have crazy candy loving Hotaru whilst we have bitter-sweat coffee shop owner Saya. Kokontsus character was..okay? his personality didn\'t really have anything different too it which isn\'t so bad for this anime since we already have Hotaru. However, I still think he could have been more exited over the fact that he gets to be with stunning Hotaru for most of his free time. There wasn\'t a lot of character development which we missed out on unfortunately.Enjoyment 9: It\'s actually really interesting to learn about different traditional Japanese candy in each episode. Each candy has a different story, told in the most wackiest way possible.

Otherwise, disregard it.', 'Dagashi Kashi blipped onto my radar this past winter after I happened upon a promotional image for the second season. I thought the character designs looked pretty interesting, so I decided to give the series a try. In doing so, I ended up learning more about Japanese snack culture than I ever thought possible.The series offers up your typical assortment of Shounen-style humor through a uniquely informational slice-of-life narrative. Normally unremarkable tasks such as talking, playing cards, and eating candy are intensified through use of visual metaphor and convincing voice acting. What makes Dagashi Kashi different, though, is its episodic template in which the first...half of each episode almost always includes a dramatized lecture about a snack food of some kind, and the second half focuses moreso on our characters’ thoughts and feelings.There’s a line that goes something like “…the significance of a dagashi shop. Not only is it a place for relaxation, but also a place where bonds are created by interacting customers. It’s a place that creates connections among people.”This line represents the very essence of Dagashi Kashi. While the first season moves along at a pretty slow pace, it develops connections¬ between the characters themselves, and also between the characters and the audience. Season two then molds those relationships into something truly entertaining. Together, they combine for a subtly sweet mix of slice-of-life storytelling coated in educational opportunity, then sprinkled with just enough drama to keep it interesting.TL;DR If yr gonna watch, it, watch both seasons. The first makes the second one much more worthwhile. half of each episode almost always includes a dramatized lecture about a snack food of some kind, and the second half focuses moreso on our characters’ thoughts and feelings.There’s a line that goes something like “…the significance of a dagashi shop.

I guess.The art is the best thing I like about this show.Sound is fitting.Characters are limited with few developments.I laughed a bit and it was relaxing as well.Good anime but could have been extremely better. 3- Small/same amount of characters.---The storyline isn't a thing you can look up to, every episode can be watched individually and still make some sense..

I mean Dagashi Kashi? OR is it Dagashikashi? (Heh , they even made a pun abt it at the end of the first episode). Anyways, it turns out it is an anime based on Japanese Sweets called Dagashi .. And  i guess Kashi means SHoP!( So Sweet SHop).Yeah a really japanesey anime. Better watch dub to understand it better(unless ofcourse you are knowledgible on that account.Story ? It doesnt have one .They basically set it up so that they can talk about candy So if you came looking for story ,i suggest you...search other anime.But if you arent a person who knows much about Japan but want to..THEN GO FOR IT!!! Each episode talks about two or more candy (more or less).You'd think that's boring..But no it is HILARIOUS and INFORMATIVE .How ? That  is where we meet the characters .

It is about a young man, Kokonotsu, whose father runs a dagashi shop. Kokonotsu does not want to run the shop, as he has dreams of being a manga artist. However, the daughter of a huge dagashi manufacture, Hotaru, soon shows up, doing her best to try and convince Kokonotsu to take over the shop. This story is nothing special and isn’t something that would normally get anyone too excited. However, there were a few plot points that did make the anime a bit more fun to watch.The most enjoyable part of the...show would be when Hotaru or Kokonotsu are explaining where the different dagashi came from and the differences that are made from various companies producing the same candy. I also found much enjoyment in the small side story of the crush that Saya had on Kokonotsu. It was through this little side story romance that the characters managed to develop the most, which made the plot move forward.Art -7-The art style of Dagashi Kashi was rather enjoyable but nothing too impressive. I was personally turned off by the strange hair color from Hotaru, as the rest of the plot was in a rather normal universe. I also enjoyed the few times where they would take the extremes and just run with it into the art style, making some of the characters have incredible facial features and the such.However, that was the most extreme that the show went, as they put minimal effort into the backgrounds and the world was almost entirely bare of any background characters. I think that if they had put some more effort into making the world a bit more realistic, the art would have been much better to look at rather than just solely the main characters.Sound -6-There wasn’t anything too amazing with the sound design. Personally, I find it rather annoying whenever there is background music while characters are talking, but nothing too extreme is happening. Dagashi Kashi does not do this all that often thankfully, but it does keep things light as it is a slice of life anime. The opening and ending songs were both rather nice, however, they never really did fit the feel of the anime.The voice acting for the anime was also very nice, each character having a voice that seemed to fit each character. Hotaru was always upbeat and passionate. Kokonotsu appeared to be a bit airy or like he wanted to be doing something else. Saya had the right mix of caring and not caring. If the opening and ending fit the feeling of the anime more, however, the sound would have scored a bit higher.Character -8-I fully enjoyed watching these characters. While there isn’t much of a plot in the whole show, the two most important characters, Saya and Kokonotsu, do seemingly develop throughout the 12 episodes. Saya starts off as someone who just can’t tell Kokonotsu how she feels about him and is happy just to be his friend. However, by the end of the series, she is much more comfortable with expressing her romantic interest in him.Kokonotsu also starts off as rather selfish, only wanting to complete his dream even if it means that he will be leaving a lot of important people behind. After talking to Hotaru and spending the summer with her, along with his friends, he is much more open to the idea of staying in the town and taking on the business. Though he has not given up the idea of being an artist, he is just more open to doing both things. It was fulfilling to watch these characters grow and step out of childhood and become young adults who have real reasonability.Enjoyment -7-Most of the enjoyment for me was not in the occasional fan-service. I had a great time learning the history of different Japanese snacks along with seeing Kokonotsu and Saya start to move out of their childhood and into adulthood. When I was learning about the snacks, Hotaru’s passion would catch hold of me, and I would be drawn into the story, and it would make me want to go out and order some of these snacks for myself so I could try them as well.When watching Saya and Kokonotsu start to grow up, it gave me a warm feeling, remembering when I was just starting to step out of my comfort-zone and start to do things that I enjoyed, but was nervous about. They each had a tiny comfort zone and seemed very set in their ways. However, as they came to the realization that they could not stay like that forever, they started to take steps that as an audience, made me happy to see.Overall -6.8-Overall, I truly did enjoy Dagashi Kashi, but not for the reasons one might expect. The art was average, and the sound was not as amazing as it could have been. However, where I was waiting for an anime full of fanservice and flat jokes, I found an anime about coming of age and learning. I do not like slice-of-life animes because I get very bored of them rather quickly. It is more of a chore to watch them. With Dagashi Kashi, I did not get that feeling. It has the power to connect with the audience and make them remember those time when they were kids just starting to come to the grips of the world. While there isn’t a solid plot in the anime, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a rather fulfilled feeling at the end. show would be when Hotaru or Kokonotsu are explaining where the different dagashi came from and the differences that are made from various companies producing the same candy.

Unfortunately, the owner refuses unless his son, our protagonist, agrees to give up his mangaka dreams and inherit the store. At this point, I'm thinking oh wow we have an instant girlfriend series with a candy-based twist. Oh how very wrong I was.In actuality Dagashi is a show about candy, all sorts of various candy including regional specialties- oh, and a bit of Ramune. The characters are there just barely more than a story is present...in a hentai- i.e. literally just enough to get you to the next scene er... candy. If you like learning interesting random facts about candy and can stand a story that basically goes nowhere, then Dagashi Kashi is the show for you. If you're looking for something with a bit of romance, character development, or depth, you're looking in the wrong place.Animation:The animation in Dagashi is definitely unique, you have to look no further than the OP and its rather wild style. The ED's play on Alice in Wonderland is also pretty creative. It isn't a particularly serious show so colors are more vivid than your typical show, and backgrounds aren't particularly important so expect a lot of blurry scenery. That said there is a ton of various candies, which is drawn to a very good level of detail. The character styling is likewise unique in the show. Hotaru has crazy eyes that match her infatuation with candy and for some reason Saya has tiny pupils. Our protagonist Kokonotsu, hereby nicknamed Coconuts, often wears a bored look that, along with his outfit, reminds me of the protagonist from Sankarea.The show doesn't really have any real action but does have imaginary scenes borrowing some ideas from other shows such as Gundam, and occasionally features various candies as talking characters. There is a bit of light ecchi as the show makes use of Hotaru's generous proportions. It's often a result of Hotaru's lack of self awareness, leading to many bloody noses from the male cast.Sound:The music of Dagashi is likewise unique. The show opens with a funky and playful tune; it's fitting though I don't particularly like it. The ED is sung by the VA for Hotaru, it's a likewise playful tune that honestly is a bit more catchy than the OP. The show's uniqueness continues in the BGM, if anything I'd say it has a bit of a Latin flair; some of the songs sound like they'd go well with a tango dance. Though the BGM is more playful than your average show, there are long periods of just conversation, which can still put you to sleep.The VAs do a good job considering the specific nature of this show and the rather long sections of nothing but conversation. Ayana Taketatsu gives Hotaru a fittingly overpowering personality, and is pretty much the selling point of the show. Our protagonist is voiced by Atsushi Abe, whose somewhat soft voice reminds me of Touma from the olden days of Index.Story:Dagashi doesn't really have much of an actual story; it really is just a bunch of episodic content centered on different Japanese snacks. The focus ranges from the well known to the rather obscure regional delicacy. As a person who has spent less than three weeks total in Japan, a lot of the show is rather hard to relate to as I haven't had the pleasure (or horror) of trying some of these snacks. I will happily report, however, that this show doesn't induce hunger attacks like other food-centric shows (such as Gourmet Girl Graffiti).The show's premise of crazy-girl Hotaru convincing Coconuts to take over the family shop isn't done in a convincing manner. Her attempts basically boil down to a bunch of challenges that happen to deal with candy, whether it's eating super-sour candy or a tug of war with gummies. Though the challenges are comedic and often bring up random references to other famous anime, one has to question the importance of Coconuts father, given the amount of time and effort Hotaru is spending in a rather rural town. As the story doesn't have an actual central plot, I wouldn't expect much of a climax or conclusion either. Really if you're looking for anything beyond a candy-centric slice of life, this story isn't going to yield much.Character:There aren't many characters in the show assuming you don't count the candy and occasional mascot. Our protagonist happens to know many random facts about candy and is often found staring at Hotaru's generous bust. He is accompanied by a comedic-relief sidekick named Tou, who is often on the receiving end of violent retribution when he teases his sister Saya, who happens to have a crush on Coconuts. Enter in the well-dressed and energetic Hotaru, who is literally crazy about snacks.The show establishes the relationships between the characters early on but then leaves them set for the duration of the show. Though there are some interesting exchanges between the characters, don't expect any plot depth from the relationships. Sorry to harp on this more but seriously, Hotaru is in love with a snack mascot?As I said in the intro, this show really isn't about the characters, and it shows in their lack of depth.Value:Though this may sate the comedic needs for some viewers, I am not in that category. Furthermore, there is virtually zero romance in this show and zero story depth. Yes, there are a lot of candy references that I'm sure will be completely useless to me lest I make another journey to Japan, but that isn't really what I'm watching shows for. It does score some value for being unique in theme, but I just wish the story actually went somewhere. Overall, Dagashi was a fair watch, but way overrated considering the amount of initial hype surrounding it.

That is what 95% of the show is about, talking about Dagashi.I'll start with the good parts. I found the art to be rather strange at first but it does grow on you and is a nice change from the art most anime's put out and the sound is also rather good as well.Now for the bad parts. There is almost zero plot/story, it starts out with what could be an interesting but nothing never seen before plot point that basically only gets touched upon briefly in the last two episodes, other then that...their is no plot but some side stories do come up....based around the Dagashi that is the main focus for that part of the episodes. Characters, well their aren't too many characters but they hardly get any focus either anyway.Overall, the ED is probably the thing I most enjoyed about this anime and with the interesting art style you will eventual get use to and decent sound their was not much enjoyment for me, if you are into Dagashi then it will probably be more enjoyable to you.So if you're looking for or need a decent story, or any story, in your anime skip this one. their is no plot but some side stories do come up....based around the Dagashi that is the main focus for that part of the episodes.

Its just plain boring, and every episode just feels like some commercial for a specific japanese candy-brand. There ist soooo much product placement, even more that they have put in the story.The characters are just very plain, and you never get deep enough with anyone of them. The only interesting person is Hotaru, just to see what more crazy things that she comes up with. That was the only reason it kept watching.And the jokes are just recycled boring tropes, and seldom really funny. The ""funny"" food stories just feels unrealistic and over-the-top. ', 'Going into the anime season, there was a bit of hype for this particular series, but for what reason. The hype was for the characters and especially how they are designed. (Video review is up on my channel, here is the written)Story - 6/10Dagashi Kashi is set in a quiet rural village, where the occupants spend their time just chilling around, finding some fun things to do. The story is about Hotaru, who works as snacks company recruit, trying to convince the owner of a local dagashi shop to be an employer. However, Yo Shikada, who is the owner of the shop won’t simply agree...to Hotaru’s term, unless she is able to convince his son, Kokonotsu to take up reigns as the head of the shop, but Kokonotsu has no intention of becoming the next head, as he has his own dreams. And so begins the wonderful attempts and stories on how Hotaru tries to convince Kokonotsu to take over the shop, through Dagashi.The way the story is presented is that it’s all sketch based, so even though there is a overarching story, you hardly see it progress. There is not really if any progression at all. It’s all about the characters eating Dagashi in different ways. And if you don’t know what Dagashi is, it’s basically Japanese sweets. And that is there really is talk about the story. What I find annoying about the show is, how at times it does feel like was progressing, especially the few times they showed backstories and having characters ponder about the future, but in the end none of that ever really comes in to play, most of them feel like they don’t mean anything. And from there, the story gets kind of stale.Characters - 7/10The characters are probably the best part of the show, not for their developments but just for the fact they are fun characters to like.Kokonotsu Shikada is the main protagonist, and he is setup to becoming the successor of the Dagashi shop, however he dreams to be a manga artist. Of course his dad and Hotaru want him to be next owner of the store. Even he has no intentions of becoming the next store owner, he is somewhat a control freak. As he will always criticise on how his dad runs the store, add that with the fact he has a really decent dagashi knowledge, so him becoming the next owner is not just for the sake of Hotaru, but he has the ability and potential to become one as well. The only development we really get from him at the very end is when he questions whether he wants to pursue his dreams or accept his fate and take over the dagashi shop. Outside of that I wouldn’t see say he’s greatly interesting.Hotaru Shidare is one of the main girls of the show. She is a very weird character, a very eccentric individual having a completely profound love for dagashi. Literally all she ever eats is dagashi and she lives on dagashi. She is very knowledgeable when it comes to dagashi, and hences uses her knowledge to test Kokonotsu on his knowledge and the two usually end up butting heads with each other on even ground with their knowledge. Throughout the show, she doesn’t really show any sign of change, as if anything involving her, it’s about dagashi. We never really learn much of her backstory or motives.Saya Endo is one of Kokonotsu’s childhood friends bearing crush on him as well. She is kind of the character to have around as the more straight level headed character, basically she a way for the characters who know a lot about dagashi to explain how to eat dagashi. Saya is not really enthusiastic about dagshi, but she does bear a hidden talent for playing different type of games. She probably shows the most character development, actually deciding what she wants, and she likes the fact she gets the hang around everyone, although sort of selfish of her, she wants everyone to stay together.To Endo and Yo Shikada are other supporting characters that are kind of just around to provide more comedy to the table. What I like about the characters is their interactions with each other. The characters have good chemistry with each other and they complement each other’s unique personalities as well.Animation and Sound - 6/10, 6/10What somewhat made this anime pretty hype was the character designs of Hotaru and I think Saya. Hotaru is kind of out there, with her most distinguish feature being her big eyes, which to be honest looks like a Rinnegan. And Saya being sort of the opposite of her in almost every way has the tiniest eyes. The background and scenery is rather basic as there is not really much going on ever in the quiet town. What they do pretty well is get the dagashi designs right, as when they show it at the end of the episode, it looks very accurate. There are some nice subtle animation during the times when they start eating dagashi.I really like that all the characters have unique designs and very noticeable at the same time. For a slice of life show though, not a lot happens, so you wouldn’t get really complex animation.What I can say about the OST, is that it’s really bouncy. Like the music suits the comedy genre and although it doesn’t add to the scenes all that much, it is somewhat enjoyable to listen to. You can some classical fancy triumph music in there as well. The opening is pretty catchy and has a nice rhythm to it, until it gets the chorus, which I don’t like it all that much. The ED, sung by Hotaru’s seiyu, is nice but, I’m not a huge fan of it, it sounds simple and kind of annoying.Enjoyment - 7/10I really appreciated that the anime tried to do something very different, making a show about Japanese sweets. But the way it was executed can get a little boring. For first few times when eat dagashi and all the creative ways of explaining how to eat can be entertaining, but it gets really repetitive and stale. Same with the comedy, the jokes get old over time. But what I do like about the show is character interactions, their conversations with each other, seeing their personalities collide. And to be honest, I liked the parts when they weren’t eating dagashi more than the parts when they were, because it got really repetitive in the way they presented it. But also the fact, I don’t know what dagashi is and if you don’t have any idea what dagashi is you’re probably not going to care as much, because you don’t know what it is, you don’t know if it’s good or not. The majority of the show is product placement.Verdict - 6.5/10As we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story a 6, because it doesn’t really go anywhere when there a times when I thought it will progress, but it doesn’t. And it’s not much of a great story overall. But I do like the different sketches they can come up with, and appreciate the fact they try to do something very unique,For the animation and sound, I give it a 6 and 6. The animation is not bad, it does good things here and there, but doesn’t blow me away. The art style is pretty good a unique, I like how they have very unique designs for the characters and make it very noticeable. The ost fits the comedy genre very well, but the OP and ED is rather skip able.For the characters I give them a 7. Even though there is not really much development by any of the characters, I love the interactions and banter between the characters. Despite the contradicting personalities, they all have really good chemistry with each other.As for my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7. Yes the first few episodes were enjoyable, but the formula got old and boring. And the fact I don’t have a great knowledge and sense of dagashi, I couldn’t really care too much for what they were trying to promote. Basically it was product placement.So for the overall score after rounding it all up, I give Dagashi Kashi a 6.5/10. If you don’t get bored and mind the repetitiveness it is an enjoyable show. I recommend this show to slice of life fans, and those with knowledge of dagashi, as this is mostly likely aimed towards you. to Hotaru’s term, unless she is able to convince his son, Kokonotsu to take up reigns as the head of the shop, but Kokonotsu has no intention of becoming the next head, as he has his own dreams. And so begins the wonderful attempts and stories on how Hotaru tries to convince Kokonotsu to take over the shop, through Dagashi.The way the story is presented is that it’s all sketch based, so even though there is a overarching story, you hardly see it progress. There is not really if any progression at all. It’s all about the characters eating Dagashi in different ways. And if you don’t know what Dagashi is, it’s basically Japanese sweets. And that is there really is talk about the story. What I find annoying about the show is, how at times it does feel like was progressing, especially the few times they showed backstories and having characters ponder about the future, but in the end none of that ever really comes in to play, most of them feel like they don’t mean anything. And from there, the story gets kind of stale.Characters - 7/10The characters are probably the best part of the show, not for their developments but just for the fact they are fun characters to like.Kokonotsu Shikada is the main protagonist, and he is setup to becoming the successor of the Dagashi shop, however he dreams to be a manga artist.

It\'s estimated that on any given day, a person will see around 5,000 adverts a day for various things.  And with the internet installing cookies that design ads around your interests, it\'s no wonder why this is such a competitive industry.  Why am I talking about this?  Well, Dagashi Kashi is basically one big advertisement.  Seriously.Story:  Just because everyone on the show calls him that, we\'re going to refer to our main character as Coconuts.  Now, Coconuts lives in a very small town out in the countryside.  He dreams of becoming a mangaka and...works tirelessly every day to make good manga.  His father, You, on the other hand, has other plans.  He wants his son to take over the family business, a dynasty that has spanned several generations.  Owning...a candy store.  It is here where Coconuts meets someone new to the village who embarks on a journey of candy and other penny food products.Dagashi Kashi is, as I\'ve stated before, one gigantic advertisement for Japanese candy and shop goods.  The basic story line has our 4-5 characters split the screentime of a single episode into two parts.  The A part has them talk about a candy or store good.  The B part also has them talk about a candy or store good.  A different candy or store good.  And that is our whole plot.  No seriously, that is our whole plot.  As such, Dagashi is one of those shows that is more or less a one-trick pony.  They spend each half episode talking about a specific type of candy only to go more in-depth with each origin, gimmick, and the shit you can do with each individual candy, before ending off the episode.The show uses a form of comedy that bounces off of a straight man/funny man setup where we have the characters split off into one role or the other, and create this mix of exaggerated notes and whatnot to keep the show interesting.  The overall atmosphere is rather calm as there really is nothing tension-wise in this series.  Overall, story is basically nonexistent in Dagashi, as there is no real sense of progression or urgency to create something interesting.  The show itself is like candy, where you can just start it, watch an episode, before putting it to the side so you can watch another episode a different day if you want, like a pack of M&Ms.  It\'s very laid-back and can get kind of boring sometimes as a result of that.Overview:+  Educational?  (I mean, if you\'re not from Japan, you\'re being educated on Japanese candy.)-   There\'s...really nothing going on.  It\'s literally just candy.Characters:  Dagashi Kashi has 5 characters.  5.  That\'s it.  All of these characters are one-dimensional characters that really have nothing of real importance to them.  There\'s no development, and you more or less have to go off of their innate traits in order to even relate and/or like any of them.  As mentioned before, the show plays off of a straight man/funny man routine with the characters more or less evenly split amongst the two roles.Coconuts.  Main Protagonist.  Wants to be a Mangaka, doesn\'t want to take over the candy shop business, but ironically knows far too much about candy and or snack foods than he really should.  (More or less designated straight man.)Hotaru.  Main female Protagonist.  Obsessed about candy and snacks.  (That is an understatement might I add.)  Eats Dagashi.  Eats more Dagashi.  Basically doesn\'t do anything else but eat Dagashi this entire runtime.  Also kind of crazy.  (More or less the designated funny woman.)Tou.  Coconuts\'s friend.  The token pervert of the series.  (Really, that\'s all we know about him.  More or less a designated funny man more than anything else.)Saya.  Tou\'s twin sister who also has a crush on Coconuts.  Not really a big fan of candy but deals with it on a constant basis nonetheless.  Secret boss for a lot of things and a generally likable character.  At least to me.  (The designated straight woman in this case.)You.  Coconuts\'s dad.  Doesn\'t act his age and appears the least in the whole series.  Is also quite obsessed with candy himself.As you can see, there really isn\'t much to say about any of these characters.  The fact that there\'s not really much to talk about either of them, nor is there any possible way for me to really analyze them more than I already have really just drives home the fact that you can watch an episode of this stuff like...once a month, and you can go back to it really knowing what happens since there really isn\'t much to remember.Overview:+ Small cast.  (Like...REALLY small cast.)-  Each member is...rather one dimensional.Art:  The art of Dagashi is drawn in a way that really doesn\'t have much in the way of memorabilia.  It\'s drawn with a relatively unique style with the unique eye choice of being tiny dot pupils rather than big moe eyes, but on the flipside, there really isn\'t much to say about the artwork.One thing to note is that they go a Shokugeki route with the art, making some scenes very...risque.  Well, not risque, but the show sometimes insinuates things with its characters during some scenes and that gives off a bit of an ecchi feeling for the show.Overview:+/-  Decent art+/-  Some ecchi/ecchi related momentsSound:  The OP is an energetic song to relate to the overall feel of the show in comparison to the fact that a lot of what the show does involves somewhat energetic sequences in order to keep itself interesting and entertaining.  It\'s a decent OP, but it\'s not the best.The ED on the other hand features an Alice in Wonderland inspired visuals with a sort of generic ED song.  There really isn\'t much to say here.  Point being, the OST isn\'t really all that memorable.Overview+/-  Meh OSTPersonal Enjoyment: Dagashi Kashi is...well it\'s a show.  I don\'t really harbor many ill or positive feelings towards this show simply because of the fact that it stylized itself the way it did.  The original manga for this series more or less is structured the same way, and concerning myself with the fact that they more or less did a faithful adaptation to the more or less one-note comedy gag manga featuring sweets and adverts doesn\'t seem fair.Did I like this anime?Out of everything about this anime, the one thing I liked most was Saya.  Saya is by far my favorite character in this series and I don\'t know why.  Maybe it\'s because she\'s not overly tsun and she\'s a tsundere type character I grew to like, but aside from that, I really have no explanation.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Honestly....really nothing.  As mentioned before, this anime doesn\'t really evoke much hatred for me cause it more or less does its own thing, and there\'s just not much to say.Would I recommend this anime?If you want to learn about Japanese candy or just have some time to kill and you don\'t want to watch a 3 minute short, then here\'s Dagashi Kashi for you.  There really isn\'t much to say about this show.  It\'s a show devoted to telling its viewers what and how Japanese candy works, roughly tackling about 24 or so different snack foods that exist in the Japanese market today.  As such, Dagashi merits more as a time waster than an actual series anime to get into.  Just be mindful to bring a snack when watching, cause this show has been known to evoke in some...hunger, on occasion.Final Note:  Also, since this anime is basically a huge advertisement, I\'mma put my own here because why not.  Ahem.  ""Come down to PyraXadon\'s anime page!  We got reviews, LOTS OF THEM.  And I\'m always active, so if you got any questions, I\'ll always be around!  I also give out advice for reviewing.

What would be your answer for this question? most people would probably says ""Oh, mushishi!"" or ""K-on!"" but chances is, you\'re not gonna hear this anime mentioned a lot. It\'s definitely one of those shows that stands mostly tall within it\'s own fandom. So, how good is it? Well, read on.First of all, let\'s start with the set-up of the show. It\'s a show about this kid who wants to be mangaka but is being forced to inherited the old candy shop of his father, comes with the help of our heroine (Shidare Hotaru), the story itself...is more about dude\'s daily lifestyle. It\'s framed in a skit style that almost resembles a 4-koma anime that comes with a plus of candy trivia on the sides. I like how the story captures the rural lifestyle that gives off a feeling of nostalgia with many episodes starting with just a picture the environment that lets you bask within it\'s atmosphere. Also, have i said something about the candy trivia? Because, boy. I came out with a lot of useless trivia about japanese candy that would be only useful for specific small talks.We then have the characters. There\'s really only 5 of them that you need to knows (Are there any bystander around? I don\'t remember) We got the eazygoing dad, the idiot best friend, the token tsundere, our mc, and lastly ""Hotaru."" the seasonal waifu that gets talked probably more than the anime itself. They never really broke the mold of their tropes but the show managed to surprisingly make their interaction cute with some funny spices being thrown here and there.The art and sounds. The art serves pretty well for the anime though i do crave for a bit more ""dynamic"" to it that could make the talking scenes better. The artsyle is very simple, outside of the eyes which is.....the most memorable part with character like hotaru having ""Rinnegan"" like eyes for example. The ost didn\'t really leave much impression to me, but the op and ed is definitely very catchy. I would definitely reccomend anyone listening to it.OVERALL: It\'s definitely not a show that aims to be a classic. It\'s relaxing, it got some funny moments here and there, it\'s the equivalent of the friend besides your chair in school telling small jokes on a boring class. It might be one of those more ""filler"" seasonal anime, but if you\'re in the mood for something to just plays before chilling on your bed, it\'s definitely not a bad choice at all. is more about dude\'s daily lifestyle.

Now, I gotta be honest with you, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I fired this one up. But let me tell you, it's a real treat.First off, let's talk about the story. It's not gonna blow your mind or anything, but it's definitely entertaining. We follow our main character Hotaru, as she tries to convince a dude named Kokonotsu to take over his family's candy shop. And let me tell you, this girl is passionate about candy. Like, borderline obsessed....But hey, it makes for some good laughs.Now, the art style is pretty dang nice. It's got a real vibrant and colorful look to it, which fits the candy theme perfectly. And let's not forget about the 3 main characters - Hotaru, Kokonotsu, and his best friend Saya. They've all got their quirks and personalities that make them stand out.The voice acting is solid too, with Hotaru's over-the-top enthusiasm for candy being particularly amusing. And the music? Well, it's nothing too special, but it gets the job done.Overall, I had a good time watching Dagashi Kashi. It's not gonna change your life or anything, but it's a fun little anime that'll satisfy your sweet tooth. So, with a score of 7.3/10, I'd say it's definitely worth a watch.--------------------------------------Baiklah teman-teman, berkumpullah dan biarkan saya bercerita tentang anime yang sangat menyenangkan bernama Dagashi Kashi. Sekarang, harus saya akui, saya tidak yakin apa yang harus saya harapkan ketika menontonnya. Tetapi biarkan saya katakan, ini adalah hiburan yang sebenarnya.Pertama-tama, mari kita bicara tentang ceritanya. Ini tidak akan mengubah pandangan hidup Anda atau apa pun, tetapi pasti menghibur.

Dan biarkan saya katakan, gadis ini sangat bersemangat tentang permen. Seperti, hampir terobsesi. Tapi hei, itu menyenangkan untuk ditonton.Sekarang, gaya seninya cukup bagus. Ini memiliki tampilan yang benar-benar cerah dan berwarna-warni, yang cocok dengan tema permen dengan sempurna. Dan jangan lupakan 3 karakter utama - Hotaru, Kokonotsu, dan teman baiknya Saya. Mereka semua memiliki keunikan dan kepribadian mereka yang membuat mereka menonjol.Akting suara juga solid, dengan kegembiraan Hotaru yang berlebihan tentang permen menjadi sangat menghibur.

Jadi, dengan skor 7,3 / 10, saya akan mengatakan bahwa ini pasti layak ditonton. But hey, it makes for some good laughs.Now, the art style is pretty dang nice. It's got a real vibrant and colorful look to it, which fits the candy theme perfectly. And let's not forget about the 3 main characters - Hotaru, Kokonotsu, and his best friend Saya. They've all got their quirks and personalities that make them stand out.The voice acting is solid too, with Hotaru's over-the-top enthusiasm for candy being particularly amusing. And the music?

So read at your own risk -...The show started with a surprised arrival of some random girl and come to make the deal with male MC. However, it is pretty hard for male MC to take the deal since he had a future goal to be acknowledge. The deal become hard and turn out to such a challenge for the female to remain at the side of the male MC, ofc for the sake of herself goals.Pretty interesting story, and this is my first ever anime i watch with...the main story of the idea like this show. Prove me wrong if i dont much effort to watch this until the end.My Review comment :Well, as an overall review, i just wanna parting some choice and explain it as detail as possible. Maybe some of my sentence come to nonsense. But i respect your opinion, as well as you respect my opinion. I just want to give my detail so clear. But i just cant have much writing ability, so sometime ny writing here come to be so sucked. Well, what happen, just what happened, i dont really care much. Wished you all understand what i write here. Okay, time to business.First thing first, the anime imo, was so good. Actually not masterpiece level of the show. But not bad as well. No hate speech here. I just feel, some scene are so boring. Not being so jerk, but seriously. The scene sometime very repetitive. No other way to had a better visualizations to interprete some good scene. Eventhough, i wish the scene make my heart shake. But it never happens, well, its okay afterall, but not best.And the male MC here was just dont had very much talent to lead such a good show, with the good main idea, such as this anime. I am cursed at this rate of weakness, for real! With that problem, i just cant give this show a solid 10. No, i never do that. However, fortunately, the heroine keep my interest to this show always high, so i keep watching till the end of the show. I sometime feel disaggree for the decision to bring romance to every aspect of non romance show. But, for this show, i dont know why, some slightly romance situation just felt better to be in and really match to the story. And when you realised that romance just for joking, it make felt so happy. Thats a good thing about the show.Some comedy, sometimes very cliche, nor to be boring af joke. But, with the taste of roman kind of thing, and the point of dagashi-story-telling, i think its pretty good to be shown up. I may clap my hand for that clever movement there. Plus think for the whole slice of life boring repetitive kind of the show as this anime pointing out.And then, with lack of those power, i guessed i kinda understand it, a bit. No joke. I just wanna respect this kind of show. The story, with slice of life concept, sometime i judge it is so done well matching to the story progress. Unfortunately, there is no good ending at the ended. A cliffhanger one, plotting somehow suck at this point. And i really dissapointed about that. And then, i just realise for how stupid i am when dont really get what the point of the conversation at the end of the show. I somehow disagree, and then i realised, it just a way the studio take that to the point where season 2 will come to fill the blank space at the end of this season 1. Well, i hope good think come at the end season 2 later. I really wished that happen, so i can make my decision toward end, gave my score definitely be so much wise choice later.Well, with all of that i try to explain, i just wanna give 8 score to the story point. And 7 to the plot point. There is no way i czn give more, if i dont really enjoy with all i dont understand. So maybe another will come up to adjust my score later, for sure.And with other point aspect, like character, art, enjoyment, as i pointed out at paragraph 1, i just wanna give 7 point out of 10. And the music point, i just wanna give 6. Not good enough to take that generic music to my brain. So 6 point will be better than the average.Well, with the show still continue at another season, i just wanna give this show more appreciation. Since not much anime like this, i gave more respect to the studio. I will surely recommended it to my relations. And i really happy with that kind choice made!So, the overall point, 7, pretty match for all of this season showed to me. And i just give another plus 1 for the next season for sure. Thank you. the main story of the idea like this show.

Thank you.', 'Okay so this anime is pretty good, but only if you are into the subject matter.For what it is it is pretty entertaining, if you are into japanese culture or overall learning more about weird little trivia, each episode has what\'s basically a little ad for some japanese candy, which might sound like a bore but the whole scenario that\'s played up for the ad is often very amusing, the characters are all pretty funny and vibrant, they all have a very destinct personality and are overall a joy to see them interact.Speaking of characters, Saya and Hotaru (the two female leads) have a very...large wardrobe and they look super cute on every scene, Hotaru especially, her outfits are always amazing, it\'s quite impressive what this anime can achieve with her one note style. The boys on the other hand are not so lucky on this department, we do see them in some different getup here and there but nothing to write home about (shocker that the cute girls get more attention i know)Anyways now onto the bad, the anime is childishly ""lewd"" at times, the same old boob jokes or the misunderstanding of something, Hotaru\'s cluelessness often (actually its more like ALWAYS) leads to her being put on some lewd situation whenever the script allows, it never misses, if its raining you get to see her boobs thru the fabric of her shirt, and i\'d give more examples but oh well, its eye roll after eye roll with her, its old and tired but oh well.As for the cute moments, well, basically every single cute moment between Saya and our protagonist is cute, it has a lot of romantic tension, you can feel how badly she wants him to stay in town, the works!Between Hotaru and our MC tho? Well... boob jokes, jokes about ""sucking it"" having her sprayed with what looks like......... [and so on]Overall the stupid lewd fetishization takes it down, but i still think that it is at least a 6 and at most an 8, no real flaws aside from that one very dumb very eye rolling flaw that makes me give it a 7 large wardrobe and they look super cute on every scene, Hotaru especially, her outfits are always amazing, it\'s quite impressive what this anime can achieve with her one note style.

Before that, I would like to say that I feel this anime is severely underrated on MAL. This anime is one of the best comedies, and one of the most unique anime I have watched. I would highly recommend this anime to you if you enjoy good, light-hearted comedy, as well as if you like being informed about Japanese snack culture.Story: 10/10There is almost no plot in this anime, but we will not take it into consideration in this...review. The main premise of this show is very simple- A girl who tries to convince a boy to take over his family\'s Japanese snack shop. It is from this main point that lots of interesting scenarios are developed. As I have said above, this show is considered by me to be very unique, because it\'s main focus is on the ""dagashi"" (Japanese snacks), and it provides us with information about it. The comedy and occasional fan-service tie in nicely with the main storyline.Art and Sound: 9/10 and 9/10The art style of this anime is quite to my style, and therefore, I reward it with a high score. I don\'t pay too much attention to sound, but it is vital in the creation of mood and atmosphere, which is done very well in this anime, upholding the comedic genre.Character: 9/10This anime might have a small number of characters, but it makes up for it in terms of story and the character\'s personalities, both of which combine to make the show very entertaining.Enjoyment and Overall Impression: 10/10 and 10/10The unique premise of the show, along with the good comedy that it comes with, means that I thoroughly enjoy this anime. I have no complaints to make, and will definitely re-watch it, given the chance.TOTAL SCORE: ~9.50 (Rounded up to 10.0) review.

It's just the daily antics of a groups of high school kids messing around every episode.Two character i think are worth mentioning areHotaru : One of the biggest parts of the show. She is my 2nd favorite character in the show. There are times i wish she wasn't so obsessed with Dagashi and kind of more like a normal girl. But she is pretty fun.Saya: Is my favorite. I really just love her entire character and her character model. I wish we...got and entire series just based on Saya and Hotaru together sense they are really the only part of the show worth too watch. Saya is also really adorable as a child.The art can take a bit to get used too. But it is pretty nice.Not much else to mention with the show. The MC isn't interesting and i find that Saya's brother is a better character.Overall it's just a fun show to watch that doesn't take itself seriously. got and entire series just based on Saya and Hotaru together sense they are really the only part of the show worth too watch.

I actually didn't think this anime was going to be a slice of life candy history show. I thought candy was going to be the backdrop, however it is the only drop and sadly I feel a bit disappointed. That however is my fault, not the fault of the anime. Lets talk  about it a bit more.The story, if you can call it that, begins with the introduction of a candy shop. This candy shop is in a small village in Japan and it is run by a weird father, and his son who...wants to draw manga. The father wants the son to take over this shop, which has been in the family for generations. One day a girl arrives and tries to recruit the father, but he refuses unless this woman could convince his son to take over the family shop. That is the basic framework of the show.From there Dagashi Kashi progresses in a slice of life pace. Each episode has some form of Dagashi which the female lead (Shidare, Hotaru) presents and explains. This at the beginning was generally used as a ploy to somehow convince  (Shikada, Kokonotsu) to run the Dagashi shop. The explanations seem to be a mix of truth and exaggeration, though since I do not know about the candy being talked about I don't know if it is actually true or not. There are clearly some falsehoods however because this is how they try to drive in the comedy. The ending of the show got a bit more better at exploring the characters and other themes however the candy information never stops.The art seemed lame at first, however I came to appreciate it almost immediately. The characters are done really well and it felt rather unique. Music wasn't terrible either.The characters are as mentioned above. A father (Shikada, You), who seems to be incompetent and humorous but seems to be some Dagashi guru. Then his son (Shikada, Kokonotsu), who wants to draw manga. His personality is a bit more mellow, and he plays the role of the questioner, who prompts Hotaru into talking about Dagashi. His best friend (Endou, Tou), who is sort of the idiot character, and is truly the center of some of the best comedy in the show. His sister (Endou, Saya), who runs a cafe in the same town. She secretly likes Kokonotsu. Then finally we have (Shidare, Hotaru), who is this rich, crazy, dagashi loving person. She spends most of the time in the show, imparting knowledge, being unlucky and adding some sexual themes(though she herself is incredibly dense, or rather uninterested in things outside of dagashi).The characters all have charm. I wish the romance elements were more put together, as Saya was cute. I did enjoy the times in between the candy lessons, as they tended to have a simplistic and comedic feel. Hotaru, was  a huge distraction and wasn't really what I had hoped the show was centering around.Overall this show isn't bad. However out of 12 episodes I think I managed to laugh three or four times. I would be willing to watch a season two, especially since nothing comes about by the end of the first. However this seemed like it was trying to hit a funny bone which I simply don't posses. If someone out there likes Hotaru and her antics you may find this a bit more enjoyable to watch. For those of you not interested in semi comedic candy lessons, you will probably be mostly bored and unamused like I was. This season has been a great one for new and unexplored ideas, however each of these seem to be boring and lame for one reason or another.TLDR: Boring and non funny candy lectures. Nothing happens, no part of this anime progresses or comes to a conclusion. Saya was cute, though. Watch if you don't mind the candy bits. wants to draw manga.

Having said that, there's not really much to spoil as there's 0 story progression and character development. You could even go as far as to say there is no story in the first place. What we have here is pretty much an advertisement/ promotional anime for Japanese candy and snacks.Let's start with what little there is to tell - the conflict. Our protagonist wants to be a manga artist, and his dad wants him to inherit his candy shop (and work there). ..... That's it. That's the whole conflict and backstory. Then comes a good looking girl who's obsessed with...candy and claims to be the daughter of a huge candy company owner who wants the shop to join, and the protagonist's father immediately agrees.. Or rather sets a condition that if she gets his son to agree and inherit the shop, they will join. Since he's not eager to do that, she decides to stay in town and visit him every day to try change his mind. And there the story progression stops. Till the very end of it.What's the rest then you ask? Fanservice with sexual suggestive themes and jokes, general comedy and just goofing around while advertising Japanese snacks and candy while going into their history. And as bad as that may sound, the result is actually somewhat enjoyable. How exactly that is is beyond me (and its not the fanservice, but it does help a bit).Having said that, its not an AMAZING anime by any means, just a decent one, but one that is still worth a watch. 6.3/10 candy and claims to be the daughter of a huge candy company owner who wants the shop to join, and the protagonist's father immediately agrees..

However, this is just an excuse to have these characters in this specific setting. This in itself wouldn\'t be much of a problem if they did something with it, but they don\'t. 80% of the time all we get is Hotaru introducing a new piece of candy to us and acting like it\'s the best thing since sliced bread. This shtick gets old very fast, especially if you don\'t really care about...candies or their history.3/10Art:The thing that got most people to watch this anime in the first place was the character design of Hotaru. She and Saya really do look pretty interesting, the boys however not so much. Animated, this effect fades quickly though. It almost looks as if they didn\'t get much of a budget to animate Dagashi Kashi, which also shows heavily in the opening, which is poorly animated. Hotarus candy fantasies look decent and are a nice change in style, but there aren\'t many of them. The ending looks kinda awkward with its realistic style of movement, but that may just be a question of taste. It\'s not a catastrophe, but it could be better.5/10Sound:The voice acting is pretty good, even though the seiyuus don\'t have much to work with. Music in general was barely noticeable, which is still better than being annoying. The opening and ending songs weren\'t my cup of tea, but I gotta admit they were a little catchy.7/10Characters:This show is supposed to be all around Hotaru, so it pretty much stands and falls with her character. It looks like there are only two possibilities, you either hate or love her. I found her to get very annoying very quickly, as there is nothing to her besides her candy addiction. Coconuts is a very boring character as well, having basically no personality. The Endou twins were more interesting and entertaining, so I\'m glad the anime used them a bit more than the manga does (or so I heard). You is also pretty entertaining, but he rarely ever appears on screen, so I can\'t really count him. For such a small cast, it needed to be more dynamic and eccentric.5/10Enjoyment:As I said, the jokes get old fast. People have defended Dagashi Kashi to be ""apparently not your kind of comedy"" but I don\'t think that\'s true. It just ain\'t funny most of the time. It did get me to laugh every now and then, but for a comedy, I expect much, much more. If you groan as much as you laugh when watching a comedy anime, there is something seriously wrong with it.3/10Overall:4.6/10 candies or their history.3/10Art:The thing that got most people to watch this anime in the first place was the character design of Hotaru.

It did get me to laugh every now and then, but for a comedy, I expect much, much more. If you groan as much as you laugh when watching a comedy anime, there is something seriously wrong with it.3/10Overall:4.6/10', 'Dagashi Kashi started out for me as a somewhat odd slice of life comedy about Japanese candy (dagashi).  Now, since I\'m not Japanese, I\'ve never heard of any any of these bizarre but fairly ingenious candies, so at first I was fairly intrigued by the premise.The art is pretty crisp, though this was made by feel. so I guess that\'s to be expected at this point.  The Op/Ed are pretty good, and the art style is pretty different but I found it enjoyable.  Hotaru\'s spirally eyes are a pretty good indication of just how bonkers she is.The basic...rundown of the plot is like so: Kokonotsu (Coconuts) is an aspiring manga artist who runs his father\'s Dagashi shop when his dad (Yo/You)is busy slacking off (which is most of the time).  Apparently his dad is famous somehow though, so Hotaru, the heiress of a large Dagashi manufacturer, visits to convince Kokonotsu to take over his father\'s store so that Yo can work for Hotaru\'s father.  Since Kokonostu is reluctant to give up on his dream of drawing manga, we now have the premise for the show:  Hotaru must convince Kokonotsu that Dagashi are the Best Thing Ever.There are some nice moments in the show, some good comedy, and I enjoyed it while I was watching it.  However, I can\'t help but feel like part of that enjoyment was built on the assumption that the show would have a satisfying conclusion.  In the end, it pretty much goes down like this:Hotaru: ""Make your decision.""Kokonotsu: ""Do I really have to?""Hotaru: ""No, not really LOL""He just sort of walks off with Hotaru, without deciding anything.  I guess Saya is just left hanging, never seeing her beloved Coconuts again.  I don\'t mind a simple and formulaic plot for the sake of advertising candy, but come on, at least finish what you started.  If you\'re gonna have an ultimatum in episode 11, I\'d expect a decision in episode 12.I\'d say that Dagashi Kashi is entertaining if you go in knowing that you\'re not going to get anything all that fulfilling out of this.  This is one of those odd cases where the whole of the show is lesser than its parts individually.  Ultimately, it fails to properly resolve the most basic of plots. rundown of the plot is like so: Kokonotsu (Coconuts) is an aspiring manga artist who runs his father\'s Dagashi shop when his dad (Yo/You)is busy slacking off (which is most of the time).

Ultimately, it fails to properly resolve the most basic of plots.', 'For a show that revolves entirely around candy, Dagashi Kashi is untenably bland.  Heed the warnings of the other reviews: this series is little more than an advertisement for Japanese sweets of various descriptions.  Whether Dagashi Kashi is meant to parade sugary nostalgia in front of Japanese viewers or to serve as a mildly clever marketing ploy for Western audiences remains unclear (likely both are true), but the show clearly has no concerns outside of detailing and extolling the virtues of the exotic sweets you can find at your local specialty sweetshop or on the corner of any Japanese street.  The subject...matter would make for an informative hour-long documentary on a food-centric network of some sort, but attempting to wring a narrative work with characters and plot out of the fact that sweets exist was a mistake.Dagashi Kashi cares only for dagashi and has no time to spend on anything else; all other considerations get shunted aside whenever a new opportunity arises for a sugar-coated or chocolate-covered gimmick to invite itself into the episode.  The show pays only the paltriest lip service to concepts like plot, characters, and setting.  MAL’s two-paragraph summary contains about as much information about the premise as the show itself delivers in its entire run.  Immediately after laying down a barely workable background for the characters to exist in, the show completely abandons all pretext of pursuing any non-explicitly-dagashi-related plot thread any further than absolutely necessary.  If I remember correctly, the first extended scenario not centered entirely around dagashi comes in episode 6 (and even then it’s still tangentially endorsing something).  I could be mistaken, but it doesn’t matter anyway, because it was still terribly boring, if slightly cute.It’s almost rude the way Dagashi Kashi establishes Kokonotsu’s conflicting futures – continuing in his father’s footsteps as the owner of his family’s shop or seeking success elsewhere as a mangaka – and then sweeps away the main character’s hopes and dreams to focus on more important things, like how many meters a person of average build can run on the caloric energy of a single mouthful of caramel.  Saya has a longstanding and unrequited crush on Kokonotsu (for reasons that remain mysterious, given his complete lack of personality), but once her feelings have been established, they never again become relevant, except for maybe two dumb gags.  The same goes for Kokonotsu’s apparent attraction to Hotaru, though the full nature of his feelings never becomes clear, and Hotaru’s worrying lack of concern for anything not candy renders any attempt to develop the show’s romantic side an exercise in futility.The cast ostensibly comprises five characters in total, and not merely five main characters, but five characters who are ever named or have any significance to the series whatsoever.  Kokonotsu’s father can be an amusing presence, undoubtedly made better by Keiji Fujiwara’s delivery.  Most of the time, however, the action involves only Kokonotsu and Hotaru discoursing about this week’s sweets of choice in the charmless interior of the Shikada shop.  The formula of the same two characters jabbering about the same things in the same place every episode gets old within about two minutes.  Dagashi Kashi has so much variety in edible endorsements, and yet so little variety in anything else that the show feels suffocating.  It isn’t until episode 7 that a couple of new one-time characters finally drop in to break up the monotony and something other than dagashi takes the center stage.  The few episodes in the show’s midsection do begin branching out into more creative skits and provide a mildly amusing glimpse into what Dagashi Kashi might have been had the dagashi not levied such brutal demands for screen time, and while the show still isn’t brilliant, it at least feels like a presentable comedy rather than the soulless grind it usually is.Hotaru’s striking design drew me to Dagashi Kashi, as it no doubt did many others, and I wish I could say that the show had enough substance to merit owning such a unique image.  It’s a shame, because Hotaru’s design is about the only aspect of Dagashi Kashi worth remembering, but at this point I can hardly stand to look at her.  Every time I see those distinctive ringed irises I have to brace myself for a ludicrous speech about the profound, sublime joys of eating something I’ve never heard of, and not even the voice of Ayana Taketatsu can make this dialogue sound clever or enticing.  Hotaru actively makes the show unbearable, boring, and shallow to boot.Dagashi Kashi is so dedicated to dagashi that every last piece of the show’s construction feels like it is aimed squarely at selling a product.  Nothing feels like a natural part of a show, especially not a comedy show; every joke, every hint of character development, every moment of fan service, every “plot point,” every single aspect of the characters’ actions and demeanors seems like nothing more than a lengthy commercial.  It’s like any television ad that tries to get your attention with a hyper-compressed storyline, hypothetical characters, and light-hearted ribbing.  It’s not a REAL narrative and you aren’t supposed to enjoy it, because it has no substance and doesn’t go anywhere; all you have to do is think that you identify with somebody long enough to let the salesmen unveil their pitch.  Already so much of Dagashi Kashi is mere descriptions of dagashi and their functions, but because of the show’s attitude toward the dagashi, the few aspects not explicitly dedicated to dagashi still feel like part of the scheme.  This feeling makes Dagashi Kashi almost uncomfortable to watch; I felt like I was constantly being shilled to every second I sat in front of the show.I won’t bother questioning why To wears his sunglasses at night. matter would make for an informative hour-long documentary on a food-centric network of some sort, but attempting to wring a narrative work with characters and plot out of the fact that sweets exist was a mistake.Dagashi Kashi cares only for dagashi and has no time to spend on anything else; all other considerations get shunted aside whenever a new opportunity arises for a sugar-coated or chocolate-covered gimmick to invite itself into the episode.

I’ll start off with the story/plot, well there isn’t really one. I get the shows name is “Dagashi” which is a meaning for inexpensive fun snacks and you can’t expect much from it, but from what I’ve seen from clips on social media I thought I’ll at least enjoy the show but I honestly didn’t. The whole 12 episodes and 20 minutes are almost always talking about different snacks and either how to eat them or their history and it’s fun and interesting in the first two episodes but then it just...gets boring and repetitive. The story was honestly a 4/10 in my opinion and I think I’m being too nice, but the only reason I’ll give it a 4 is because of the 2-3 good episodes that it actually had that made me think this show does have some type of story that’s not about snacks. The biggest disappointment for me was that they have really good characters in my opinion that can make this show great if it just took a different spin or turn to it but it always went back to something tacky or just annoying topic about snacks. Overall if you want something to use for background noise or is just bored and have nothing to do watch this for sure as you might get some enjoyment from it. My overall rating is a 4/10 and that’s because the last episode carries the whole show in my opinion. I have seen Dagashi Kashi 2 and I can tell you that I enjoyed that way more but I won’t say much because of spoilers. gets boring and repetitive.

Dagashi Kashi followed the latter, as a few of my friends (knowing that I often review things) told me to check this anime out, saying that it was pretty good. And the sad part is that, though not bad by all means, because I went into it expecting more, Dagashi Kashi was disappointing.The story is pretty much pointless, it rarely comes into play, and gets dropped after just a few episodes, so it's barely even worth mentioning.The characters for the most part are fine, nothing...really that special, but they're still at least kind of likable. Kokonotsu is a serviceable main character, with ambitions and goals, and enough personality. Saya and Tou have a kind of fun brother and sister dynamic that makes them a bit interesting, but neither of them stand out too much. But, Hotaru is easily my favorite. She is very in your face and loud, but that's honestly what makes her stand out. She is a fun character because of her loudness and crazy personality. Most of the comedy in the show comes from her and her wild antics. Kokonotsu's father, You, is also a very fun character too, providing a good amount of comedy.The animation and music is pretty serviceable too, nothing special but it does the job.The comedy was something I was really looking forward to. There are a lot of anime comedies that do a fantastic job, like Assassination Classroom, D-Frag, Sgt Frog, Space Dandy, and plenty of others. I was hoping I could put this one up there. But, unfortunately, the comedy feels a bit cluttered and unfocused, mainly because there are so many freaking food gags. The novelty of these gags wears off after a bit, and eventually I was just left watching and being mildly entertained, but I wasn't laughing. To be fair, the show can be funny, it isn't completely devoid of humor, but if it had focused more on other types of comedy and less on the food jokes, than it would've been better.As it stands, Dagashi Kashi is.....fine. And for others, that is, well, fine. But for me, I was expecting and hoping for a bit more, for something good. And I was let down.

I'm here to tell you that... I agree as well.Dagashi Kashi can be a bit heartwarming and stress-free due to the environment settings and no climax or cliffhanging plot. The setting of this anime puts the character in a small town out of city, no overly advanced technology, little to no cars on the road, train or bus could cause you to wait for hours if you missed it. The vibe of such peaceful environment paired with slice of life element can be a bit relaxing at times.Let's...talk about the story. Mainly, Dagashi Kashi is talking about Japanese snacks so if you are someone who would love to know them, I would suggest that this anime could be for you. Storywise, the anime is fixated on a boy who dreamed to become a manga artist but is asked to inherit his family business, as dagashi shop owner, which is not what he wants. The story starts off smooth with this introduction with decent potential. However, as the episode goes on, it felt like a random episode introducing different types of dagashi that fits the theme, which don't really contribute to the main story apart from the main character knows a lot about dagashi. Thus, it starts to grow a little bit bland overtime.Onto characters. The characters in Dagashi Kashi is quite limited. This is good in a sense that the anime will focus on these characters. However, paired with the issue with the story, the growth of the characters are very slow (because the anime's main point is the dagashi!). I have to admit that the characters are quite likeable as some of them often gives you a good laugh, IMO none of them feels boring, they each have their own likeable characteristics.In short, Dagashi Kashi is a relaxing, comedy, slice-of-life anime. If you are someone who is after for an interesting plot, this might not be your cup of tea but if you have some spare time, you can give it a shot. If you are someone who loves to learn more about Japanese snacks in form of anime, I recommend you to try and pick this up!TL;DR:Want to know about Japanese snack, pick this up;Want a decent story and plot, drop this;Want to spend some time for a relaxing anime, you can try to see if it suits you. talk about the story.

Spoilers ahead!)One of my favorite candies is the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup.Although not just any Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. I am not a fan of the regular-sized ones let alone the mammoth kind. Also, I don’t much care for the miniscule ones from the orange, portable bag. No, they have to be the bite-sized kind with the golden wrappers. Their peanut-butter-to-chocolate ratio is superb; I could eat them for hours.In other words, Reese’s cups are just not the same without the gold. Similarly, Dagashi Kashi is nothing without its dagashi-driven damsel.STORYCandy, as Dagashi Kashi indirectly explains,...is not the right word for the treats talked about in the anime. No, these delectable offerings are dagashi (hence the title). While they are mass produced in the same way as candy from America, dagashi are more than just taste and branding. They have special designs. They have particular purposes. They have a history worth learning.So the anime takes this mindset to heart (and to mouth). Each episode is dedicated to a variety of dagashi that are more interesting than the next. A bottle filled with a sugar-like substance whose bottle can also be eaten. Heart-shaped chocolates meant to make one run farther. Caramels that were originally designed to deter cigarettes. Numerous dagashi are showcased over the course of the season. Too many to reasonably list.To this end, Dagashi Kashi is extremely educational in its content. It talks about the mascots behind Baby-Star Ramen. It describes how there is no real significance to the eight letters of the Seven Neon dagashi. It tells the tale of how Miyako Kombu derived from the leftover bits of kombu, a local food.Also on the dagashi industry itself. Some have extra winners to get more dagashi. Some can be used for more than just eating, like jumping rope or blowing whistles. Some have particular packaging with cute characters to entice kids to pick them over the many, many others.In other words, like a dagashi store, Dagashi Kashi holds a veritable wealth of (educational) goodies.Now, the anime understands that nothing but education can get stagnate, so it includes comedy and sexual material to alleviate this issue. The comedy is light, confectionary even, using silly reactions, goofy explanations, and personified dagashi to make the learning fun. The sexual material is likewise light, focusing on a flapped skirt or, almost always, Hotaru’s breasts.Granted, because the sex does not deviate from her huge chest, it tends to be repetitive and lacking in creativity. Quite unlike the dagashi the anime so actively supports. Even so, the simplistic, not-over-the top direction it takes with the sex does go along with the dagashi motif. After all, dagashi themselves are simple but hugely popular treats.Beyond the dagashi and the education and the sex, the anime doesn’t have much more. And that’s a problem. The overarching plot of Hotaru trying to convince Coconuts to take over his father’s shop gets addressed only sparingly and does not get resolved come the end of the season. The implied romantic feelings between the semi-love-triangle go nowhere. And the slice-of-life escapades that do not directly deal with dagashi – like going to a cultural festival – are too few and far between to be considered worthwhile.Not that there has to be more. But when the anime regurgitates information about yet another dagashi, it makes the whole experience feel as though it lacks any substance, any purpose.ANIMATIONDagashi Kashi takes place almost entirely within the dagashi shop that Coconuts and his father run. The quaint place has its wooden walls lined with the treats, making it a fun little dive to hang out in.The anime does venture outside of the shop, though. Saya and Endo’s café gets a few visits. A small spot near a river or a local pool are shown. The side of the road, a train station, and Hotaru’s mammoth mansion.These places are not as detailed or prominent as the dagashi shop, but they help to highlight a common thread of the art: seclusion. Besides the cultural-festival episode and the few stragglers that pass by or into the shop, the anime is mostly devoid of other people. This secluded countryside comes off as very niche – just like the dagashi and the history they contain.Actual animation ends up even stronger than the art. The reused setting gives the anime more resources to spend on expressive faces, blinking, and bodily movements. And of course, Hotaru’s breasts receive extra care to make them even more enticing than they already are.Speaking of Hotaru, her character design is extremely strong. Medium-length purple hair with a black-rose hair piece. A black-and-white outfit with buttons, suspenders, frills, a skirt, and heels. Red nails. Blue-spiraled, mesmerizing eyes which reflect her overzealous passion. And a gorgeous figure that defies all of the dagashi she eats.Saya’s design is not as stunning, but it’s still nice. Long, blonde hair that gets different makes. Multiple earring accessories. A tiny fang to make her slightly cuter. Varying outfits, like casual clothes and a yukata. And a slim, pretty figure. Similar to Hotaru, she is attractive. Dissimilar to Hotaru, her attractiveness comes not from eccentricity but rather simplicity.While the rest of the designs are normal, other shout-outs are deserved. The ED’s Alice In Wonderland visuals are quite fun and fitting – Hotaru makes taking part in dagashi feel as though it were an imaginary (and possibly drug-induced) trip. And the “And so…” eye-catches were nice, too.CHARACTERSDagashi Kashi has to rely on its characters to do most of the heavy lifting in the anime because substantive plot does not exist. Another way to look at it is that, because the setting takes place at a deserted countryside candy shop (and café), it puts a lot of emphasis on the characters. Pressure for them to command a presence.Unfortunately, one character alone cannot carry the weight of all this dagashi – try as she may (and she would try).Starting with the lesser characters, Endo is arguably the weakest of the bunch. As though he were around simply to balance out the boy-to-girl ratio, he does not have much in the way of characterization. He wants to be popular (to get with the ladies), and he almost reveals his sister’s feelings for Coconuts on more than one occasion. That’s the extent of his character.Coconuts fails to be much of a character, too. He is painstakingly plain with zero personality and a go-with-the-flow attitude. His main purpose is not to be a main character but rather corroborate or introduce many of the dagashi facts that are brought up. On that front, he does fine, but that does not make him all that fun of a character.Coconuts actually has another trait, but Dagashi Kashi does not seem to care for it. The reason why he does not want to take over his father’s dagashi shop is because he wishes to pursue a career in drawing manga. From what is shown, he has a knack for it. But the anime rarely uses this characteristic in conjunction with the dagashi, existing as little else besides a stepping stone for the premise.You, Coconuts’s father, has a bit more going for him. He owns the dagashi shop the other characters hang out in. He runs an (unsuccessful) video channel. He is generally carefree to the point that Coconuts questions his father’s ability to do anything let alone run a business.His main problem is similar to Endo and his son: You does not have much else. He does not have a close relationship with his son. He does not interact all that much with Saya and Endo. And the moments he does share with Hotaru are dominated by her presence. He does act as a comedic relief character, but, in a comedy anime, that does not mean much.Saya pulls ahead of the men but only barely. She has a knack for coffee brewing, and, more importantly, she loves Coconuts. Of course, she refuses to make her feelings known, creating for many a moment of frustration.Surprisingly, she does not care much for dagashi, yet she is skilled at all of the games and quirks related to them. Card flipping, marble shooting, and prize winning chief among her abilities. Similar to the rest, though, her character does not do much throughout the season. She blushes when Coconuts gets mentioned, and she can play a mean game of kendama (a ball attached with a string to a wooden catcher), but she does not bring much comedy or pizzazz on her own.That’s a common issue with these four: They are inherently not interesting. Their traits, personalities, and actions fail to bring engaging interactions because what they say and what they do lacks style.And then Hotaru shows up.Hotaru more or less makes Dagashi Kashi. Without her, the anime would be nothing more than educational material. From the get-go, she is a titillating character. Yes, her massive breasts attract a lot of attention. But it is her craziness. Her bubbly personality. Her never-ending font of determination that make her a character one cannot help but like.Besides her breasts, her defining trait is her incessant love of dagashi. Every part of her life – from curing a toothache to reading poetry – revolves around dagashi in one form or another. Indeed, the whole reason she showed up at the dagashi shop run by Coconuts and his father in the first place was because of dagashi-related business.Throughout the whole season, Hotaru proves her worth constantly. She, like Coconuts, has a vast wealth of knowledge when it comes to dagashi. In fact, she is the one to usually spur the boy on. She brings about comedy with her fake-but-maybe-not accent as well as her ironically horrible luck when it comes to dagashi games. And her bouncing breasts, purple lingerie, and misunderstood mannerisms provide sexuality without overbearing the audience or taking away from the dagashi she preaches.Compared to Hotaru, the four others are more boring than watching the guy who is watching paint dry. She overshadows Endo, Coconuts, You, and Saya. Twice over.She outshines the rest to such a high degree that it begs the question: Does her complete domination serve a purpose?Arguably, yes. From an outside perspective, dagashi is a tame topic. Sour shells, fortune-telling pieces, and powdered snacks are not the best conversation starters. That is, much like the main cast, dagashi is admittedly dull. But with the addition of extra facts, different outlooks, and better enthusiasm, dagashi quickly becomes interesting.And that is exactly what Hotaru does. She makes dagashi fun, interesting, by bringing with her the traits, the ideas, and the mindset necessary to turn this boring topic into an intriguing one. Not just with dagashi, though. She applies her magic to the other characters, too. She shows that Endo has some smarts to him. She gets Coconuts to think differently about his life and about people. She demonstrates that You is more than just a lazy man. And she gets Saya to understand her own feelings a bit better.Granted, these developments are small, and Hotaru is usually oblivious to these separate instances. But she no doubt makes the cast, like dagashi, more interesting than they were before she arrived. An outcome that even the most intense paint-dry-watching people could appreciate.SOUNDPerhaps expectedly, the original soundtrack of Dagashi Kashi does not usually rely on more tame tracks. Instead, it heightens and lowers the tempo. Two tracks in particular stand out. The first is a slow, methodical tune that sounds as though it originates from the countryside with its languid sounds. The second is reminiscent of a Mexican standoff often played when the dagashi antics started rolling up the fun.It’s an OST with a nice number of tracks (over forty), but, besides the two listed above, the whole package is not impressive in its offerings.Voice acting mirrors the characters. Ayana Taketatsu as Hotaru shines with her energetic and sincere way of speaking whereas the rest of the cast provide acceptable performances for their roles (but nothing worth noting).Moving on (or moving back to the beginning), the opening track is a nice addition to the anime. The vocalist’s leveled way of singing works well with the quickness of the instruments. In fact, comparing their combined effort to Dagashi Kashi itself, the contrast is large. By the halfway point, the piece adopts a more triumphant tone when both the singer and the beat reach loftier heights. While nothing is available to win (save for Coconuts’s willingness to run the dagashi shop), this new tone matches how the anime (i.e., Hotaru) views dagashi: like flying through the sky unimpeded.But the true winner of the music is the ending track. Mixing accordions, castanets, and dainty chimes, the piece remains consistently fast and fun. Alongside the various hollers, the silly lyrics (“Calorie Queen!”), and the happy vibe, the ED comes together as a catchy piece that, like eating dagashi, is a treat to hear again and again.ENJOYMENTAt the beginning of this one’s run, I was concerned that it would not go anywhere. My concerns, unfortunately, were met.No matter the medium, a tale will always have an extremely hard time if it tries to bank on a single aspect. In this case, this aspect is Hotaru. To be fair, the anime does have its dagashi, but, to reiterate the earlier discussion, it is Hotaru’s involvement that makes the dagashi more than just treats to eat.To that end, I myself found her to be quite the fun character. Her respectful nature towards the cast was nice. Her joking around with You was silly. And her general sexiness was hard to look away from. She was easily my most favorite part of the show.As for the other characters, I cannot say I liked them all too much. Saya’s romantic feelings did have me smiling, and You’s “Yo…yo…” chant was goofy. But Coconuts himself and Endo as well rarely made me happy.On the dagashi itself, I was not necessarily engrossed by the topic. But to give credit to the anime, I learned a lot about dagashi. While I had never heard of such specialized snacks before, and I more than likely still have a lot left to learn, it was cool being exposed to a piece of culture halfway across the globe. Even it at times the subject matter was not the most interesting.Dagashi Kashi does what it can. The animation levels are nice and the different musical offerings are fun to listen to. Even so, the story lacks anything else besides information, everyone but Hotaru fails to impress, and the amount of entertainment plummets as a combined result. Reese’s gets gold; this one doesn’t even get bronze.SUMMARYStory: Fine, dagashi and education combine to create a simple tale that lacks substanceAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, meaningful seclusion, above average actual animation, and nice character designs for both Hotaru and SayaCharacters: Fine, Hotaru commands the purposefully boring castSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, Hotaru is fun, lots of learning, but everything else fails to engrossFinal Score: 5/10 is not the right word for the treats talked about in the anime. No, these delectable offerings are dagashi (hence the title). While they are mass produced in the same way as candy from America, dagashi are more than just taste and branding. They have special designs. They have particular purposes. They have a history worth learning.So the anime takes this mindset to heart (and to mouth). Each episode is dedicated to a variety of dagashi that are more interesting than the next. A bottle filled with a sugar-like substance whose bottle can also be eaten. Heart-shaped chocolates meant to make one run farther. Caramels that were originally designed to deter cigarettes. Numerous dagashi are showcased over the course of the season. Too many to reasonably list.To this end, Dagashi Kashi is extremely educational in its content. It talks about the mascots behind Baby-Star Ramen. It describes how there is no real significance to the eight letters of the Seven Neon dagashi. It tells the tale of how Miyako Kombu derived from the leftover bits of kombu, a local food.Also on the dagashi industry itself. Some have extra winners to get more dagashi. Some can be used for more than just eating, like jumping rope or blowing whistles. Some have particular packaging with cute characters to entice kids to pick them over the many, many others.In other words, like a dagashi store, Dagashi Kashi holds a veritable wealth of (educational) goodies.Now, the anime understands that nothing but education can get stagnate, so it includes comedy and sexual material to alleviate this issue. The comedy is light, confectionary even, using silly reactions, goofy explanations, and personified dagashi to make the learning fun. The sexual material is likewise light, focusing on a flapped skirt or, almost always, Hotaru’s breasts.Granted, because the sex does not deviate from her huge chest, it tends to be repetitive and lacking in creativity. Quite unlike the dagashi the anime so actively supports. Even so, the simplistic, not-over-the top direction it takes with the sex does go along with the dagashi motif. After all, dagashi themselves are simple but hugely popular treats.Beyond the dagashi and the education and the sex, the anime doesn’t have much more. And that’s a problem. The overarching plot of Hotaru trying to convince Coconuts to take over his father’s shop gets addressed only sparingly and does not get resolved come the end of the season. The implied romantic feelings between the semi-love-triangle go nowhere. And the slice-of-life escapades that do not directly deal with dagashi – like going to a cultural festival – are too few and far between to be considered worthwhile.Not that there has to be more. But when the anime regurgitates information about yet another dagashi, it makes the whole experience feel as though it lacks any substance, any purpose.ANIMATIONDagashi Kashi takes place almost entirely within the dagashi shop that Coconuts and his father run. The quaint place has its wooden walls lined with the treats, making it a fun little dive to hang out in.The anime does venture outside of the shop, though. Saya and Endo’s café gets a few visits. A small spot near a river or a local pool are shown. The side of the road, a train station, and Hotaru’s mammoth mansion.These places are not as detailed or prominent as the dagashi shop, but they help to highlight a common thread of the art: seclusion. Besides the cultural-festival episode and the few stragglers that pass by or into the shop, the anime is mostly devoid of other people. This secluded countryside comes off as very niche – just like the dagashi and the history they contain.Actual animation ends up even stronger than the art. The reused setting gives the anime more resources to spend on expressive faces, blinking, and bodily movements. And of course, Hotaru’s breasts receive extra care to make them even more enticing than they already are.Speaking of Hotaru, her character design is extremely strong. Medium-length purple hair with a black-rose hair piece. A black-and-white outfit with buttons, suspenders, frills, a skirt, and heels. Red nails. Blue-spiraled, mesmerizing eyes which reflect her overzealous passion. And a gorgeous figure that defies all of the dagashi she eats.Saya’s design is not as stunning, but it’s still nice. Long, blonde hair that gets different makes. Multiple earring accessories. A tiny fang to make her slightly cuter. Varying outfits, like casual clothes and a yukata. And a slim, pretty figure. Similar to Hotaru, she is attractive. Dissimilar to Hotaru, her attractiveness comes not from eccentricity but rather simplicity.While the rest of the designs are normal, other shout-outs are deserved. The ED’s Alice In Wonderland visuals are quite fun and fitting – Hotaru makes taking part in dagashi feel as though it were an imaginary (and possibly drug-induced) trip. And the “And so…” eye-catches were nice, too.CHARACTERSDagashi Kashi has to rely on its characters to do most of the heavy lifting in the anime because substantive plot does not exist. Another way to look at it is that, because the setting takes place at a deserted countryside candy shop (and café), it puts a lot of emphasis on the characters. Pressure for them to command a presence.Unfortunately, one character alone cannot carry the weight of all this dagashi – try as she may (and she would try).Starting with the lesser characters, Endo is arguably the weakest of the bunch. As though he were around simply to balance out the boy-to-girl ratio, he does not have much in the way of characterization. He wants to be popular (to get with the ladies), and he almost reveals his sister’s feelings for Coconuts on more than one occasion. That’s the extent of his character.Coconuts fails to be much of a character, too. He is painstakingly plain with zero personality and a go-with-the-flow attitude. His main purpose is not to be a main character but rather corroborate or introduce many of the dagashi facts that are brought up. On that front, he does fine, but that does not make him all that fun of a character.Coconuts actually has another trait, but Dagashi Kashi does not seem to care for it. The reason why he does not want to take over his father’s dagashi shop is because he wishes to pursue a career in drawing manga. From what is shown, he has a knack for it. But the anime rarely uses this characteristic in conjunction with the dagashi, existing as little else besides a stepping stone for the premise.You, Coconuts’s father, has a bit more going for him. He owns the dagashi shop the other characters hang out in. He runs an (unsuccessful) video channel. He is generally carefree to the point that Coconuts questions his father’s ability to do anything let alone run a business.His main problem is similar to Endo and his son: You does not have much else. He does not have a close relationship with his son. He does not interact all that much with Saya and Endo. And the moments he does share with Hotaru are dominated by her presence. He does act as a comedic relief character, but, in a comedy anime, that does not mean much.Saya pulls ahead of the men but only barely. She has a knack for coffee brewing, and, more importantly, she loves Coconuts. Of course, she refuses to make her feelings known, creating for many a moment of frustration.Surprisingly, she does not care much for dagashi, yet she is skilled at all of the games and quirks related to them. Card flipping, marble shooting, and prize winning chief among her abilities. Similar to the rest, though, her character does not do much throughout the season. She blushes when Coconuts gets mentioned, and she can play a mean game of kendama (a ball attached with a string to a wooden catcher), but she does not bring much comedy or pizzazz on her own.That’s a common issue with these four: They are inherently not interesting. Their traits, personalities, and actions fail to bring engaging interactions because what they say and what they do lacks style.And then Hotaru shows up.Hotaru more or less makes Dagashi Kashi. Without her, the anime would be nothing more than educational material. From the get-go, she is a titillating character. Yes, her massive breasts attract a lot of attention. But it is her craziness. Her bubbly personality. Her never-ending font of determination that make her a character one cannot help but like.Besides her breasts, her defining trait is her incessant love of dagashi. Every part of her life – from curing a toothache to reading poetry – revolves around dagashi in one form or another. Indeed, the whole reason she showed up at the dagashi shop run by Coconuts and his father in the first place was because of dagashi-related business.Throughout the whole season, Hotaru proves her worth constantly. She, like Coconuts, has a vast wealth of knowledge when it comes to dagashi. In fact, she is the one to usually spur the boy on. She brings about comedy with her fake-but-maybe-not accent as well as her ironically horrible luck when it comes to dagashi games. And her bouncing breasts, purple lingerie, and misunderstood mannerisms provide sexuality without overbearing the audience or taking away from the dagashi she preaches.Compared to Hotaru, the four others are more boring than watching the guy who is watching paint dry. She overshadows Endo, Coconuts, You, and Saya. Twice over.She outshines the rest to such a high degree that it begs the question: Does her complete domination serve a purpose?Arguably, yes.

Yeah. Do I enjoy it? Yeah. Here\'s why:-This show in reality has a pretty repetitive plot, however it\'s only 12 episodes long, so in that aspect it\'s not as bad as some viewers make it out to be, since lots of other anime have gotten away with it for hundreds of episodes. Every new episode usually would introduce a couple of snacks/candy, and doing stuff with them. The good part is, although the core...of nearly every episode is the same, it\'s so short that every new installment has a new creative way to use the candies and tell it\'s story. In the long term such an anime can\'t last, but remember, it\'s so short that it doesn\'t matter.-This anime lives up to it\'s ""romantic subtext"" theme by not having full-on romance moments, but definitely not missing out on making romance-based, or sexual jokes. At first you might think that this is ecchi, however make no mistake dear reader, it isn\'t. If you\'re looking for something 100% pure, this won\'t work for you, as there are some pervy moments in here, like any good old anime would.-For Japanese people this isn\'t anything of significance, in fact they\'d most likely write off this show as boring and unwanted. However, we\'re foreigners. We, humans, usually love and find new things exciting. That\'s why this series is mostly entertaining throughout the whole season. It does a good job at keeping you watching.This anime is how to execute a repetitive plot in a good way.

It just goes to show what putting anime girls next to your product can do.There is nothing particularly outstanding about this anime, if you are interested in learning a bit about dagashi through another means besides Wikipedia, I\'m sure you could find this interesting enough to check out.There are also jokes, which are sometimes funny I guess. If you don\'t enjoy the art style or the characters, you probably won\'t enjoy watching this.Let\'s break it down then, since MAL wants me to write an unnecessarily long review. For the record, you don\'t need to read...any of this, I\'ve already said all that needs to be said.STORY: 4The story is simple. A boy wants to become a mangaka, but his dad owns a candy shop and wants him to inherit it. One day, a girl shows up and wants to take his father away to work at their company. Unfortunately, doing this will force the boy to inherit the shop, so the father refuses to leave unless he does so.So there is the premise, but the story mostly unfolds through the explaining of dagashi, and not derivative ""WacDonalds"" level parody stuff, but actual dagashi that exist in real life, where the previously mentioned girl, Hotaru, will usually explain the history of it with her usual hijinks that become a staple of the series.There is another girl by the name of Saya, who is the main character, Kokonotsu\'s (Whom is often referred to as ""Coconuts"" as a pun throughout the series.) childhood friend. She likes coffee, but dislikes sweet things, so there is kind of that clash between her and Hotaru, as the three of them get to know each other as the advertising- I mean story unfolds.ART: 6Dagashi Kashi\'s art direction is different, but it\'s also one of its main appeals. (So much so, that the season 2 art style has been seen with disappointment.) The character designs are simple, but have a charm to them. One of my favorite design choices are how the eyes are done.Sound: 4Barring aside the OPs and EDs, which have nothing to do with the series itself (Hence my reason for skipping them after a single viewing.), there is nothing noteworthy to say about the sound here. It\'s not bad, but it\'s not good either. As background music, it does its purpose and nothing more. The voice acting is good, but not enough for me to warrant raising the score of the entire series\' sound direction.Character: 5There\'s not really a lot to say about the characters, they\'re simple, but fun. I\'ve described them and their premise earlier, but a lot of what makes them charming is the art design and voice acting. They\'re essentially what sells you on them, but if you\'re not a fan of their design or voices, I\'m not too sure there is really any in depth ""character"" or ""personality"" if you will, that is going to attract you if the other two options failed.Tsundere Coffee GirlHyper Candy ManiacShy Manga  BoiThe Side Character (Haha didn\'t even mention him.)Enjoyment: 7Not going to waste anymore time repeating myself, the characters and art style of the show are what sold me.Overall: 4If it wasn\'t for the fact I found the characters appealing and the main topic of the show interesting, I probably would have never finished this show. Actually, finding enjoyment in that alone is probably not enough for most people to finish it, but what can I say? I wanted to see more every time the end of an episode came.If I were a more cynical person incapable of finding enjoyment in simple things, I would have torn this series apart, but I like fun things.

Both criticisms are valid - the series is neither character- driven nor really is it plot-driven.  The characters are just a means to an end - that end being to educate viewers about the wide range of traditional dagashi that are out there.  If your goal is to learn more about dagashi, the characters serve as a painless means of doing so.  If you're looking for a romcom with a satisfying ending, or even a more traditional slice of life series, this is...probably not the one for you.Aside from the plentiful information about dagashi the series features decent, if a bit cliche, character design and catchy opening and ending themes which you might not mind sitting through a few times.

The plot of this anime is really interesting. It talks about Dagashi culture in Japan which revolves around cheap snacks often sold to children and usually for the price of a single 10 yen coin. You might have heard of some of these snacks such as Umaibo or Ramune Soda. Its both educational and fun learning the history behind different snack brands. The character designs are great, with the unique art style giving each character a unique look. Especially Hotaru Shidare has an amazing design and the voice, the...dub by Ray Tabitha gave her such a unique voice that I've never heard before or since.

One day an eccentric (borderline obsessive and crazy if You ask me) girl shows up in town to recruit his father to work for her family company. By the power of anime logic the father and...the girls conceive a pact. If the girl manages to convince the boy to take over the shop, the father will work for her.

The boy whose future is the subject of the deal between his father and Hotaru. He’s a standard anime protagonist. No charisma and no personality but… he has a goal. He wan’t to become a mangaka and actually practises his craft. Apart from that he really isn’t anything interesting.Hotaru Shidare - Basically a whack job obsessed with sweets to the point she traits them as medicine. She has a habit of going into a teacher mode and gives history and trivia about many kinds of sweets. Despite her being an eccentric she’s not a bad person and doesn’t want to force Kokonotsu to take over the shop and even states she wants to see what dream he will pursue. She’s probably the most unlucky person in the world when it comes to chance games.Saya - A good old childhood friend. After all, what is an anime without one? She runs a cafe and has a crush on Kokonotsu. She quickly befriends Hotaru as their goal aligns - to make Kokonatsu stay in town. She’s a natural at games. She wins all the games she takes part in.Tou - Sayas brother and friend of Kokonotsu.

It starts off with some semblance of a plot with there being some conflict about the protagonist wanting to follow his own dream of being a manga artist instead of inheriting the family snack shop, but that pretty much never comes up after the first episode. I think his manga is mentioned twice after that and only in passing, and no one really tries all that hard to persuade him to...take on the snack shop either. In terms of character development there is literally nothing. There are only really five characters and they stay exactly the same for the whole season. In terms of relationships, there’s a bit fleshed out, but just enough for it to be kind of annoying there isn’t more. There’s somewhat of a love triangle where the side heroine Saya likes the protagonist Kokonotsu, but Kokonotsu is too dense to notice at all, and Kokonotsu shows signs that he may like heroine Hotaru, though these signs are pretty minimal and furthermore she’s so obsessed with snacks that I can’t even begin to image what romantic development with her would look like.Though that last part is pretty much what carries the show, Hotaru and her overtly energetic obsession with snacks combined with her naive oujo-sama like personality. She’s pretty much the snack princess and she’s awesome. The show is pretty much entirely dedicated to Hotaru discussing what makes snacks awesome with each episode focusing on a few specific ones. These snacks are Japanese and thus as someone who is not Japanese they are completely unfamiliar to me, but the general principles behind them are still relatable. And while the trivia relating to the snacks isn’t something that’ll ever come up in real life, trivia in general is pretty useless so the trivia being interesting is enough to make it feel worthwhile. But even more than that, once again going back to Hotaru, the show manages to capture how passionate she is about them very well which is adorable and the rest of the cast act as good straight men for her craziness so it’s also hilarious. I also felt that the pacing was pretty good, in that each episode is composed of two distinct halves that are essentially mini-episodes, which allowed the pacing to be fast enough that it felt like it was always showing something new and amusing. The ending seems to try to be one that dives a bit more into the plot that was originally setup at the beginning of the show and then pretty much ignored, but it’s largely too little too late and not really enough to make the plot worth getting invested in.The art and animation are pretty solid. Both Hotaru and Saya look pretty weird by heroine standards, mostly due to their eyes, but their respective looks fit them very well and Hotaru manages to stand out despite her design actually being mostly pretty normal. I also thought it was interesting that characters were shown wearing different clothes each episode as I think that’s actually pretty rare in anime. Beyond that in terms of design it’s an anime taking place in the modern country side so it’s pretty normal to the point of not being particularly memorable. They did make the snacks look appealing though, enough so that I ended up eating a bunch of random snacks while watching. Also, there are lots of eye-catches that generally look pretty good I’d say, but they move way too fast. The OP and ED are decent enough and fit pretty well.

Besides them there are just other two characters, Saya and Tou, siblings, that are Coconuts\' friends, Saya has a crush on Coconuts since they were kids, but Coconuts is oblivious to that and his eyes are focused on Hotaru, which coincidentally...looks like a character he created for his actual dream, being a mangaka.The first episodes rely a lot on the candy ""lore"" and really seem like advertisements and they are quite boring to watch, however as episodes progress they become a bit more subtle and the Slice of Life genre shines more making the series a bit more enjoyable.

Things get more bizarre when the eccentric Hotaru Shidare attempts to recruit Kokonotsu’s father to work for her family’s dagashi company and he won’t accept work from her unless Kokonotsu chooses to pursue the family business. This leads Hotaru to attempt persuading Kokonotsu to inherit his family’s business through use of tactics like games, stories, and riddles using dagashi to convince him to pursue it.For anyone not aware, dagashi...is cheap candy and snacks that are typically sold to children in Japan. Dagashi Kashi appears to be aimed at those who dabble heavily into the snacks considering Hotaru’s obsessive love for them and the large amount of information she has on various forms of snacks she consumes. Doing some research, it does appear that the series does dabble into actual brand name dagashi, which may offer some educational value to anyone interested in learning more about the types of snacks. But whether or not this grabs viewer interest may depend on familiarity with dagashi or being a snack aficionado.Episodes of the series are structured into two to three segments where Kokonotsu and his friends, the two Endo siblings, interact with Hotaru and get involved in some sort of conversation or activity involving the use of dagashi. The major characters have their typical character types they follow throughout the series and they largely stick with them, as Dagashi Kashi is more focused on its comedy and dabbling into dagashi. For the most part with me, the comedy mostly fell flat as it relies rather heavily on sexual humor and Hotaru’s eccentricity to attempt carrying things, making it feel rather one-note and repetitive with the types of gags it attempts.In short, I’m rather indifferent on Dagashi Kashi as an anime comedy. Its humor didn’t do much to amuse me and its focus on dagashi gives me the impression this show may have a niche appeal to anyone outside Japan, being no different to other anime titles made more in mind for fans of particular hobbies and popular cultural trends within Japan.

For the most part with me, the comedy mostly fell flat as it relies rather heavily on sexual humor and Hotaru’s eccentricity to attempt carrying things, making it feel rather one-note and repetitive with the types of gags it attempts.In short, I’m rather indifferent on Dagashi Kashi as an anime comedy. Its humor didn’t do much to amuse me and its focus on dagashi gives me the impression this show may have a niche appeal to anyone outside Japan, being no different to other anime titles made more in mind for fans of particular hobbies and popular cultural trends within Japan. Definitely a series where you mileage may vary with it.', ""So it's been a while since I wrote a review, obviously, but then again it had been a while since I'd watched much anime.I moved out of my parent's home and into my own place since then and I decided I was in the mood for some Slice of Life anime.And that anime was...Azumanga Diaoh. And it was damn great.But AD got my appetite wet for more Slice of Life anime and by sheer happenstance I happened upon this Dagashi Kashi, an anime about working in a small Dagashiya, a sort of small corner shop that sells cheap sweets similar to Penny sweets in...the UK.Having worked in a newsagents myself for 3 years, I thought this would be so relatable, and I was right. The very feeling of the show brought memories back of working in a similar establishment, to the sheer mundane discussions with co-workers and customers to the various background items on sale, I felt right at home watching this anime series.But that's my personal experience with it, how does it fair as an anime?Well, very well it turns out. The banter-based feel of the comedy reminds me a little of Kevin Smith's Clerks mixed with the over the top visuals of Family Guy and the two actually blend surprisingly well.A Slice of Life comedy is only as good as it's characters and thankfully they're all really great, with the stand out obviously being Haruto Shidare, the eccentric sweet obsessive trying to sway Kokonutso to take over his father's Dagashi store so she can hire his dad for her Dagashi company.But the other characters are great as well, Kokonutso sort of being the only apparent sane person who reacts to all the mad crap going on around him much like any shop worker would.The Endo twins, To and Saya, being great support characters that have a funny Brother-Sister dynamic and Yo, Kokonutso's father and owner of the Dagashi store, who you'd think initially is the archetypal patriarchal figure who thinks his son should focus more on taking over the business than wasting his time drawing Manga. But surprisingly, that's only the half truth. Yo, while wanting Kokonutso to follow his legacy, is actually very encouraging of his son's talents and it's actually Kokonutso who takes on a more mature role between the two.I mean, this show is overall an animated sitcom first and foremost so nothing about it is deep or tries to get a message across. It's just a short, sweet and fun little series that wants to make sure you just enjoy yourself.Much like the Dagashi the show is based around actually, thinking about it.After finishing the first season, I immediately followed on to the 2nd which is treat like a separate series despite being a direct follow on.And boy do I have a few things to say about this one... the UK.Having worked in a newsagents myself for 3 years, I thought this would be so relatable, and I was right.

We get this anime that once gave something to talk about, but today is as forgotten as Erased at the end of its broadcast.We better go quick with this fucking anime shit which I watched in its broadcast last year. Why ?, because I read a post where a moderator of AeE told some member of the Chinese dead that the show of this series would be his Waifu of the season, and surprisingly the design was fucking beautiful...so I ran quickly to see the first episode, only to find me in the end ...An anime, which starts in a meh way. We start with a dream that our protagonist has, which is a kind of future aspiring manga cartoonist, but who works in his father\'s snack shop. A day like any other one comes in a pretty-looking asshole who tells our beta that she is someone ""very important"", so that later she challenges him to a kind of sweets and sandwiches contest. Then the father appears and the pretty girl named Hotaru decides to stay in those places to fuck because he can, because he wants and because he has nothing else to do or anywhere else to go. The story is on the way to repeating the same puta formula of duels and contests with this little girl throughout the 12 episodes that constitute this work, falling into a vicious circle that could hardly leave.As a point in favor I can say that the first chapters were harmless, they were not remarkable but they were not disastrous either, they were just there, they had harmless humor and you could even learn the odd thing about Japanese sweets and sandwiches. What happened next? The series opted to go degrading itself, going from being a Slice of Life with comedy and situations of daily life in a candy store, to be practically Pandering Otaku for pubertos, one of the stupidest I\'ve seen in a series of that year. The series is downgraded to use its theme for a sexual nature and disgusting fetish that I would be embarrassed to teach my colleagues who only see comedies to pass the time and have some laughs. From winks and sexual messages with candy, to a construction of a disc Yuri bait between the two girls in the series. Not to mention that the series is super boring to have situations that are very fast, characters who do not care about a peanut and who spend talking about candy all the time, and in a way that you get tired. When I say that the only reason why someone would see this thing is by the Waifu of turn, Hotaru, being the biggest attraction of the whole series, for its energetic personality and its attractive design.I have no desire to say much more, is another anime that starts as something harmless and ends up pathetically lowering all its theme and its character, to be able to create Fanservice situations that please even the last of the possible fetishes for disgusting Otakus, so that buy the DvDs and sleeves of these products.And if you ask, will I see the second season that will come in January? Well ... I saw that he changed the studio (to a better one), and there was a design change (it\'s slightly different), however the trailer seems more of the same only with new characters, so I do not guarantee that to follow, and if so, I will only see the first episode to make some impressions, and if it is still in the same shit, I will give it its due Drop (unless of course I am wrong and there is an improvement). so I ran quickly to see the first episode, only to find me in the end ...An anime, which starts in a meh way.

Hikari no Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2224/Hikari_no_Densetsu,"[""I've found Hikari to be quite lovely, both the character and the series. It's incredibly simple and straightforward, yet it's one of those uniquely lifelike series that just warm your heart. Most of the time you'll be staring at cheerful Hikari and her big blue eyes.The story does not solely focus on Hikari's rise in the world of rhythmic gymnastics or sports. It also touches the thematics of growing up, overcoming the many obstacles on the path to the final goal, of love, rivalry and many other themes that pest any young individual.The production is sweet, which is typical of many 80's anime of shojo...genre, when the latter was most popular. The music stands out in particular, with piano inserts which range from very lively, positive themes, to starkingly touching melodies. The range of songs in OST is quite narrow, but compositions like Maihime and Yume Miru Koroni are simply beautiful.There aren't many series out there quite so sweet and charming as Hikari no Densetsu. Therefore it is sad it's been cut from initially planned 26 episodes to just 19, since, despite high general popularity in Japan, the TV ratings were poor. It never reached US markets, because there wasn't any interest in the thematics the series portrays.I'm very glad that atleast people here in Europe took a high liking to Hikari - especially in France and Italy, where the manga was also translated. The French have released it at least 3 times - the last time in a dual audio DVD release. But their dub can't compare to the Italian one which is really heart felt and on par with original Japanese voice acting.Even though the anime was cut abruptly , the original manga continues well beyond and has a slightly different development in the love and coupling department. Hikari continues to Seoul 1988 Olympic games. Actually, if it wasn't for the latter, Hikari may have never reached the foreign markets. Tatsunoko Productions have decided to release it outside Japan, since there was great interest in rhytmic gymnastics at the time. genre, when the latter was most popular.

The characters are super compelling and it's easy to fall in love with each and every one, so you want to know where all of their adventures are taking them.Can we also just acknowledge the fact that this show portrays a HEALTHY competitive relationship between two women? We need more of this in storytelling.The animation is also much better than one would expect from an 80's show, with super...fluid motions during Hikari and Hazuki's routines. I felt like it had a sudden production jump towards then end, though. The sound is decent too, since music is a big subplot it has to be.Overall, I loved every minute of it. fluid motions during Hikari and Hazuki's routines. I felt like it had a sudden production jump towards then end, though. The sound is decent too, since music is a big subplot it has to be.Overall, I loved every minute of it."", ""What I liked about Ajimu: Beach Story back when I watched it is how, despite being a romcom, it doesn’t feel like a typical entry in its genre, no overreactions, no too much melodrama, no fanservice despite taking place on a beach, no cast made up of teenagers with moe designs but rather ones that look like actual teenagers, and they were also far more sensible and mature than what I’m used to see in romance stories within this medium.Hikari no Densetsu has pretty much the same positives, plus far better animation, a slightly more sophisticated soundtrack, and a far more original premise, as it...mixes slice of life moments, with drama about a love polygon and a sport which isn’t portrayed much in anime, or entertainment in general honestly.But maybe that has to do with how boring it becomes to watch it. Don’t get me wrong, the gymnastic performances in Hikari no Densetsu is one of its best aspects, as they are well animated, are accompanied by sweet piano pieces, which they dance to, thus making them part of the plot and not just background melodies, and the girls can mess everything up from one moment to another and even hurt their bodies, while there’s also some emphasis on how their emotional state can affect their results.It also does the unthinkable of not having a protagonist who is either op or a complete underdog, while at the same time does not let her win all the time, quite the contrary in fact. But the problems lies in how repetitive it is, during most of the series you see the same performances and listen to the same music again and again and it gets tiresome after a while. Thankfully, they begin with balls and ribbons and add a little more stuff later on but still, the performances don’t change much, if at all. This becomes an issue when, after all the training, there's seemingly no change in them, for better or worse, and since the sport is never discussed on a technical level, I don't think many people watching it will realize how better the characters have become or how the scoring system works, outside of the very obvious mistakes everyone can notice.But ultimately the best thing in the show are its characters and their interactions, they are not that memorable nor have the most unique personalities, but as I said they are pretty sensible and mature by anime standards. Despite the main two girls being rivals in both gymnastics and love, they support and admire each other as they have positive influences on one another, encouraging each other to make advances on the guy both of them love and making each other notice the best and weakest points in their performances on the carpet, thus serving as the inspiration for the other to try new figures and improve ther performances and scores.And all of that is done without melodrama, no crying, no screaming, no fighting, no insulting each other, no keeping distances without talking for days or weeks. Just two girls who have a friendly competition on seeing who gets to the be on top of the tournaments they take part of and who gets to be with the guy at the end.Also, whenever they lose or do poorly, they do not treat that as the end of the world, they see each instance as a new one with newer possibilities and chances to improve, get to know better competitors around the world and they are happy for the one who wins at the end, even if it’s not themselves.This is a truly inspirational sport series, not one of those manipulative ones that feature people yelling and crying and being depressed for weeks over losing where the main characters always win at the end. But I also how to point that, towards the end, several performances are skipped almost completely.The quality in visuals is not amazing but still pretty good for 1986 standards. There are definitely quaility drops in general shots, there are still images and there aren’t many impresive effects, but up close the characters look great despite Hikari having a generic 80s design while Hazuki looks like a generic bishoujo from the 70s, and the backgrounds are really well drawn. The motions are ok to the most part and well done during performances. As for the boys, Oishi also has a generic bishounen design for its time while Mao looks like a generic punk from that time, he almost looks like he belongs in Aishite Knight instead of here.Speaking of Mao, he is the hardest character to like because, although his relationship with Oishi is similar to the one shared by the girls (although not as influential), he always seem to be pissed and angry and getting in random fights all the time. It gets particularly hard to root for him at all when he gets agressive with Hikari towards the final episodes. Well, at least he accepts things as they are without much bitching either.He also brings the so much needed variety to the soundtrack, as he and his rock band have their own side story of becoming a little more famous, while the series also show how shady music records can be, but it’s all shown in a very shallow way, there’s just no way to believe someone would go that far to take a starting minor band out of the picture like this, especially when their songs are so mediocre. Seriously, I don’t know who Mao’s voice actor is but he is not very good at singing and is even worse an acting, not convincing at all, well atleast every song of them is somewhat part of the plot.The rest of the cast do their job just fine, but the sound effects are definitely weak, aside from the bouncing ball, everything else just doesn’t sound right.The sport part has a proper closure without the typical ending by episode 17 but this is when you notice the issues regarding the other genres, as Hazuki seemed to have a very serious ilness which is otherwise forgotten, every character has their own conflicts within their families but that is hardly shown, or explore, and is usually resolved in easy ways, even partially out of screen, several performances gets skipped almost completely and Oishi’s own side story is entirely disregarded.And finally, when it comes to romance, there’s just not much in here, is the typical thing of the characters not confessing their love for a big amount of episodes, right before the series ends and leaves this aspect without a satisfactory closure. This partially has to do with the series not doing well and probably catching up with the manga before the it got finished several episodes earlier than the initial plan, but still, the last two episodes were by far the weakest, the romance had a very disappointing resolution and the series made a big time skip and had the characters saying how every one of them did afterwards by themselves, with still images.Thus the series looks fine, sounds…alright, does a good job with its sport even when its presentation gets boring, and has lovable characters, but the slice of life bit is frankly uninteresting and the romance does not get much attention before being rushed and skipped completely towards the end, making it hard to openly recommend to anyone outside of people looking for something different, as it leaves the audience completely dissatisfied with its finale. mixes slice of life moments, with drama about a love polygon and a sport which isn’t portrayed much in anime, or entertainment in general honestly.But maybe that has to do with how boring it becomes to watch it.

Kidou Senshi Gundam F91,https://myanimelist.net/anime/88/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_F91,"[""Nobody does an attack on a civilian population better than the Gundam franchise.The opening to this movie blew me away.  When a gigantic bullet casing, falling from a mecha's weapon, bounced off a lady's head on a street far below, causing her to fall over and die, I instantly gave this a 10.This is the kind of movie I was hoping Char's Counterattack would be.  A coherent and compelling movie charting everything we love about the Gundam franchise.  The horror and tragedy of war, the visceral action and drama, the complexity and ambiguities of ideologies, mecha blowing shit up.Char’s Counterattack had all...that, but to me felt like you were tuning into a movie midway through; you were thrown into a situation that you weren't introduced to properly.  It had too much plot machinations and not enough breathing space for characters, too many ideas and not enough execution.  F91 however does it all correctly.Yes, F91 is the outcome of a full TV series being cancelled midway through pre-production, and turned into a movie instead, but the movie does not reflect that at all.  It does not feel incomplete or flawed beyond redemption, it actually feels like a prologue to an epic 50 episode saga, one that we won't mind missing out on because there’s too many ways they can end up generic and tiresome, much like the Gundam show F91 is the continuation of: Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ.The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that some of the scenes with the Crossbone Vanguard aristocracy are a bit too long and feel obligatory, but they're still essential to understanding their motives, so they're not a complete waste of time.  Obviously there's no villain on par with Char Aznable, but it would be too much to expect one.Where this movie shines, and what we should focus on, is the attention to detail, like the aforementioned woman-killing gigantic bullet, the reimagining of the tropes of the genre that Mobile Suit Gundam introduced back in 1979, such as survivors of an attack forced to become soldiers, and the ambiguous motivations that spur men to want to kill millions of human beings for a greater good.Another negative thing about F91 is the total rip-off of the Empire Strikes Back bad guys theme.  I'm not a SW geek so I don't know the actual title, but it's probably 'Imperial March' or something.But other than these small nitpicks (and the fact that the MSG Random Slap ratio is pretty damn low) it's an awesome movie with brilliant animation that puts A LOT of today's anime to shame.  And it hilariously keeps up another MSG tradition: stupid names for characters:  Seabook.It's not the name of a prize-winning race horse.  It's our main hero.Seabook.Remember it.  Remember F91, don't let it get overshadowed by other Gundam shows, this one is an accomplishment. that, but to me felt like you were tuning into a movie midway through; you were thrown into a situation that you weren't introduced to properly.

Remember F91, don't let it get overshadowed by other Gundam shows, this one is an accomplishment."", ""Ever wonder what happens when a fifty-episode series gets condensed to under two hours? The answer to that lies within Mobile Suit Gundam F91 -- a textbook example of wasted potential. Though F91's core story is a solid idea that draws plenty of inspiration from its predecessors, without any flesh on its narrative bones, F91 is reduced to an inconsistent and and very much rushed tale. However, boasting its nostalgic story along with great animation, F91 is still worth a look by fans of the gundam franchise.Due to disputes amongst the original production staff, this ill-fated chapter of the universal century gundam saga was cut...down in size in a rather extreme extent. F91 tells the tale of Seabook Arno and the crew of the Space Arc, a spaceship of civilians trying to escape the conflict between the Earth Federation and the Crossbone Vanguard, a faction led by the Ronah aristocratic family.

If nothing went wrong in terms of production and the product simply wastes its potential thanks to bad writing, it can be rather irritating. For better or for worse, Gundam F91, Yoshiyuki Tomino’s attempt at creating a new UC Gundam saga, is certainly the latter. It\'s like a rising college football player dying of CTE, with the victim being unable to tap into its potential for reasons far beyond its control. What was planned as a full 52 episode series reduced to a mere 13,...and those 13 being gutted to create a film that was clearly not meant to be one. It\'s ultimately not the movie\'s fault that it\'s bad, it was never meant to be one in the first place until executive meddling damned this project.Installments like this are a testament to the importance of pacing. Since the events of this movie were originally meant to be 13 episodes, it only makes sense that a lot of information and character/world-building would be taken out. Unfortunately, this is of huge detriment to the movie. I mean, starting your saga almost verbatim like the original and having other important similarities is already not much of a good thing, but when character progressions/decisions and deaths are unexplained or not explained well at all, that\'s when we have a problem. There are multiple emotional scenes in this movie such as the initial attack on the main cast’s homeland, the death of Seabook’s dad, and the reunion of Seabook and his mom, all of which don\'t leave nearly as much of an impact because the bad pacing didn\'t allow us to establish anything properly, giving us little time or reason to care before tragedy or even tear-inducing happiness strikes.There are other problems, some of which also involve cutting. The subplot about Cecily’s earrings goes absolutely nowhere since I think it probably would\'ve become more important later on if this were to have been the 4-cour series this was meant to be, at one point, they cut from the middle of a major battle to a scene way later where Seabook snuck out on his own (how and when did he do that, and where is the city he want back to in relation to the base he and his friends are at?) which raises a ton of problems, even aside from the ones above, since it\'s probably the worst and most unnecessary cut yet. There is no reason we couldn\'t have seen Seabook’s first major battle in full since it probably would\'ve only lasted a few more minutes. Did they really need this movie to not go past the two hour mark? If so, there were probably other ways to trim the movie down a bit more. The finale is ok and probably the most interesting part of this movie, but the ride to get there got gutted badly. Regardless, we’re not getting a more fleshed out retelling of this (or the rest of what Tomino wanted this to originally be), and that saddens me because this movie really needed to be the way it was intended for it to actually be good.As mentioned previously, part of the reason the characters aren\'t very good is that the pacing doesn\'t allow us to really get invested in them whatsoever, sullying a lot of the emotional impact behind the drama they face. When the introduction is a bunch of our protagonists bickering at each other, it\'s hard to really feel a sting when their homeland gets attacked, and when some of them die, not only is it not that impactful since we hardly get to establish a connection with these people before the attack that happens 5 minutes into the movie, but some of these guys we don\'t see until sometime into the attack, mere minutes before their death. The main villain is a typical royal imperial who doesn\'t remove his mask or have much of a personality, and the grandfather is only there for a few brief moments and is just a father who has to put on the royal guise of the Rohan family, but there’s hardly much to them. Like with the protagonists I’ll be mentioning, if they allowed this to be as it was intended, we probably could\'ve fleshed them out a bit more to make them more interesting.Seabook is basically another Amuro Ray in practically every sense of the word, including the fact that a parent of his left to work on the Gundam he would end up piloting by chance. Hell, his mom just appears in the movie with no introduction and then they bond but thanks to the aforementioned issues, it doesn\'t sell as well as it should. His sister is initially very perceptive of her mom’s true feelings and self for her age but then when she actually meets her she acts like her mom is not a good person, which is rather inconsistent. It\'s not like the former is realistic for a child but then to switch to the latter for no apparent reason other than their dad dying while escorting Seabook, is really jarring. Cecily is a princess character who hangs out with and sympathizes with the common people, enough so that she initially forsook the throne like her mother did and then did so again just to be with her friends after realizing that the Rohans are just as bad as ever. At least it\'s a fresh spin on a trope that would be as tired as a sloth. No other character is with really bringing up however, like the typical arrogant prince character, a girl who only switches to the good guy side because her master took interest in Cecily (why she has disdain for her, we\'ll never know), and her master who has a grudge against the Rohans and let\'s the good guys go in the end. I don\'t need to reiterate the potential lost for character building, do I? No? Ok, moving on.Much like Char\'s Counterattack, while the writing is lackluster at best, the visuals are some of the best not only in the franchise, but in its respective decade. The character designs look pretty appealing, the mech shading is great, and the action and animation is all very fluid and simply a wonder to look at. The sheer detail and fluidity is something to grasp at and all of this simply executed the best of what 90’s animation had to offer, even though it came out very early into that decade, and it looks even better than Char’s Counterattack, which already had some of the best-looking and most fluidly animated visuals of the 80’s. The mech designs look great as well, especially the F91 and the Vigna Gina (what a laughable name by the way). Even with everything bad I\'ve said about this film, at least it was able to look so gorgeous that to this day, it is still a top contender for the title of most well-animated Gundam anime.Another similarity between the two films is that the OST isn\'t that memorable. The OST for F91 is at least better than CCA\'s due to it sounding more cinematic. I also prefer this film\'s ED titled ""Eternal Wind"" to CCA\'s ED. It\'s a peaceful yet somewhat emotional track, though I do find it a bit odd that it sounds like it was recorded live instead of how songs usually sound in all non-live venues. Regardless, this is a decent OST for the movie.Bad pacing and cutting aside, this film feels rather milquetoast, minus the emotional scenes that invariably fail to strike a chord with me. The action was somewhat entertaining and well animated, and it was pretty cool to see all of the new developments in technology since the events of CCA (I especially love the laser flag) but overall, my experience felt rather meh, not even in a borderline zen way but like when you watch a show with your kids and feel nothing other than just “well this is a thing I\'m watching”. The fact that I have no real emotion at all during the film barring certain minor points really sells how ineffectual this film really is. It\'s basically a throwaway movie.This movie feels like the first special edition recap to a mediocre series we were robbed of. It\'s a real shame since this was supposed to be a grand and involved jumpstart of a new saga in the Universal Century timeline. We all know the story now, and I think it\'s really sad what happened here. Now, all we\'re left with is this unfortunately mediocre movie, regardless of how visually stunning it is. At the same time, what was presented here might not even be compelling if it went as planned. I\'m not sure if that hurts more or less than the idea that the material was at all promising. Well, with all that said, I think it\'s time to bury this one and hope for a revival. Either we hope for that or hope for an adaptation of the Crossbone manga. and those 13 being gutted to create a film that was clearly not meant to be one.

He then finds out that his mother is alive and has been working on a new mobile suit codenamed &quot;Gundam Formula-91&quot;. Seabook reluctantly pilots the Gundam at first, but slowly discovers the Newtype abilities within him and uses them and the Gundam to...turn the tide of the war.To be fair this was a lot of character development to try to squeeze into a movie and it isn't very well executed.

Just watch the first 15-20 minutes.Ok, I\'m gonna skip the obvious parts that you\'ve probably already read in other reviews. This was meant to be a longer TV Show, we know.Actually, considering the facts this could\'ve turned out way worse. That doesn\'t mean is that good.I\'ll start with the negatives, and then I\'ll try to end on a more positive note.The story is very messy. Motivations are not clear and the villains are very cliché. Just your average ""hurr durr imma baddie i\'ll kill everyone"". Pacing is also an issue. This suffers the...same problem as CCA, where Tomino probably thought we would get bored if we didn\'t get a mech battle every 20 minutes or so. This obviously doesn\'t help in the structure. Instead of scalling up things to a climax, the final showdown just comes and plays out like every other fight in the movie. -pew pew, things blow up, mechs blow up, someone irrelevant dies.-The characters are also wildly underdeveloped. Instead of presenting a couple of secondary characters we\'ll get to know a little bit, Tomino loves throwing out 6+ characters that will barely get any line at all. There\'s a plus if there are very young children just because. I think this movie confirms my beliefs that Tomino isn\'t really a good writer/director.Now to the good parts.Even though they are underveloped, the characters are likeable. There was a point when I was wary of a character doing a stupid 180 like Quess Paraya in CCA, where a neutral character becomes friendos with the murderous genocidal baddies just \'cause. However that did not happen here. I was very happy about that. Maybe not having horrendous hateable characters that aren\'t meant to be that way is not much of a positive. But with Tomino, *ZZ and CCA flashbacks* you can\'t take that for granted.Now for the real compliments. I have two. This has one of the best animation cuts in all of the Gundam series. There were moments where i could swear they were rotoscoping everything, but then you notice some details and you know everything was done traditionally. The attention to detail is amazing. Something as simple as showing the hand of a Mobile Suit malfunctioning and spinning around like crazy just adds so much and grounds the film in reality so good in many moments.And my biggest compliment:Damn.What a great opening sequence. Even if you don\'t want to see the movie after reading this review, do a favor to yourself and watch the first 15-20 minutes. I think this is the most horrendous and gut-wrenching depiction of war that doesn\'t resort to very graphic and explicit imagery. I felt genuinely disgusted at myself for watching these scenes as part of ""entertainment"".A plus: Apparently the story and the characters get really fleshed out in the manga Crossbone Gundam.

Which is a shame, because it\'s a good movie and would have made a good series.Because of these cuts, the movie is somewhat disjointed and incoherent, and certainly shouldn\'t be watched for an awesome plot. What it does do, however, is show off some nice mech designs, have a cool villain with a silly plan, and have awesome animation and art.The plot is fairly standard Gundam, with people from space, people from Earth and some other people from another patch of space fighting. Also Newtypes, who as fans...of the franchise know are sort of halfway between Bene Gesserit, Jedi and idiot-savants. The main antagonist is Iron Mask, who is unsurprisingly a man in a mask and whose plan doesn\'t make a lot of sense. It is nice, though, to have the Char analogue actually be a threatening and powerful villain.The soundtrack is interesting, with some nice background music and an iffy ending song full of unneeded and badly pronounced English.However, it is the detail in the animation and the quality of the art which makes F91 really worth watching. The fights are excitingly choreographed, and the characters have the sort of attention to detail that reminds you of Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Macross: Do You Remember Love.To conclude, it\'s best to think of F91 as a ""tech demo.""

Mobile Suit Gundam F91\'s production background is probably more well-known than the actual contents of the movie. Originally planned for a full-length series, vague reasons that were never really elaborated on halted Gundam F91\'s production after screenplays were written for a mere 13 episodes. Probably wanting to keep the Gundam brand strong, the decision was ultimately made to make what existed of the planned series into a single theatrical film. What resulted was the most universal reception of a Gundam series ever: that the movie was a very apparent hackjob of a story and ultimately not very satisfying. It\'s universal...to the point I have to agree on both of those accounts. But before that conclusion, let\'s take a more detailed than usual look of this nearly ""lost"" Gundam entry.In keeping with the mecha tradition of terrible names, a young man named Seabook Arno and his friends end up on a war ship after their space colony comes under attack by forces calling themselves the Crossbone Vanguard. It’s a mostly typical Gundam set-up and story. Seabook reluctantly fights but still finds the time to complain about adults, and the “brat pack” here is reminiscent of ZZ Gundam’s except they are thankfully far more resourceful and mature. In the movie’s beginning as the group attempts to escape from the colony war zone, it’s actually rather refreshing to see such a reasonable bunch of teenagers interacting with each other without going into fits over nothing or trying to sell each other out to the enemy, but I digress. It turns out Seabook’s childhood friend, Cecily Fairchild, is actually part of the Crossbone Vanguard’s royal family and through the typical cheap plot device of Newtype mind tricks ends up going along with them despite having no reason to do so (she’s practically a stranger to her real family). I also don’t see why the Vanguard put so much effort into retrieving her in the first place, as they reveal they don’t actually care much about the possibility of her dying despite their original plans to use her as a spokesperson for the commoners.And already I can’t ignore Gundam F91’s hackjob story construction. If you thought Tomino Gundam series were hard to follow before with the thinnest excuses possible for major character motivations, then F91 is just bewildering as a result of its editing. The script feels no better than if full episodes existed before the movie’s production were simply cut into snippets like one of the Gundam franchise’s many compilation movies. Scene transitions are extremely improper, with abrupt cuts and any establishing detail skipped over to save time. A sense of movement is often removed, which means you get scenes like characters flying around at the end of battles and suddenly they’re instantly back on the mothership without smoothly aiming the direction there first. There’s pretty much no character development because there’s no time, and the supporting cast from the beginning never gets to rise above background noise. Without scenes spent on characters deliberating or giving introspection to their choices, you end up with those same thin motivations as mentioned before to the depth of being transparent. In Gundam F91 a minor enemy character who is important to nothing in the larger plot makes the huge decision to defect after a five second scene that just barely implies she’s jealous of another pilot’s special treatment by her captain, and then five minutes after this she’s dead forever. In a movie struggling to save time, they give scenes to someone that doesn’t matter that amounts to no emotional payoff.Gundam F91 jumps all over the place like that which makes it a frustrating watch, because there’s enough here to make someone think it could’ve made a solid series. The writing (or at least what we get to see) comes across as more tolerable than some Tomino works. It’s relatively rare to see our characters make completely nonsensical choices and the whining about adults and “needing to understand each other” while blowing other people up is kept to a minimum this time around, although all of the usual Universal Century Gundam tropes do still exist. It’s one of the easier Gundam settings and casts to buy into, and what inhibits further investment isn’t immersion-breaking inane plot details like some series, but rather the lack of plot details entirely to greater establish that setting and its characters. The movie is still attempting to be a character drama, but there’s no breathing room for them to grow on you because the movie keeps shoving details about the actual war down your throat with little else. There’s still some top dollar Tomino dialogue (“When you had to stop breast feeding, your mother was hysterical”) but again, relatively speaking, the core of Gundam F91 is fairly solid and usually keeps its head out of the clouds.Speaking of the Crossbone Vanguard, I have no idea where they got their huge forces since they were apparently secretive rogues and it seems no one in the movie cares. They have a Zabi family-esque monarchy rulership and clearly want control over space, but any attempts to make them a little more interesting fail because of how unclear they are. They want to unify the colonies and stop Earth’s pollution and blah blah blah, but in one scene they’re ordering their troops not to harm colony civilians and in another they’re killing them indiscriminately with automatons. If there were reasons given for this and I missed them, it’s probably because they were established in one five second scene.The real head of the antagonist side is Cecily’s father, a man known primarily as “Iron Mask” due to the metal helmet he wears over his entire head (because his wife left him? What). Let’s cut to the chase: Iron Mask is Darth Vader. He is literally Darth Vader. The dub track makes him sound exactly like Darth Vader because they knew it too. Iron Mask also has a long black cape, and there’s literally a scene where he’s implied to have killed someone with Newtype mind tricks. And you know what? I don’t even care. This guy still has some of the most charisma out of any Gundam villain, because if you’re going to rip a villain off then Darth Vader is an extremely worthy candidate. Iron Mask may not amount to much by the end, but in a movie where no one does he’s at the very least [i]cool[/i], which works.The hilarious Star Wars knockoffs don’t even end there. The royal family structure and culture bears resemblance to that of Star Wars as well, even down to Cecily being Darth Vader’s daughter. And before you ask, no, Seabook is not related. One of the first songs played in Gundam F91 opens very similarly to the main Star Wars theme, and a later one is even more unmistakably a copy of the Imperial March theme. It’s downright uncanny. Return of the Jedi came out nearly 10 years before this movie, so why Gundam is copying it now and why they feel the need to when the original series debuted alongside Star Wars is as much of a mystery as anything concerning this movie’s production. On the subject of audio, the English dub is also a fairly high quality and practically a who’s-who of big 90s anime voice dubbers.Being a movie, the animation is extremely nice and the art looks like it came from a classic 70s Gundam series due to the return of franchise original, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko. The fight choreography is tight, almost always large-scaled battles full of movement without frames getting too chaotic, and those just looking for quality Mobile Suit animation from this movie won’t be disappointed. Gundam F91 also possesses some of my favorite Mobile Suit designs of the franchise, courtesy of Kunio Ookawara. Gundam F91 takes place very late in the Universal Century timeline, and this distance is accentuated by the complete lack of Zakus (finally) and their replacement with Crossbone Vanguard’s grunt suits that have an unusual “gas mask” face and wield lances instead of sabers. There’s a subtle mystique to many of the Mobile Suit designs that make them look like a part of a distant culture, such as the F91’s shoulder “feathers” and the Vigna-Ghina’s back fins. It’s a change of pace from standard Gundam designs without what makes them unique being too over-the-top and ridiculous.Though it has more to offer than its reputation implies, Mobile Suit Gundam F91 is still ultimately just a well-produced, somewhat fun adventure that never has what it takes to be emotionally rewarding. For a two hour romp it’s worth the time to UC fans as it possesses enough of the attitude that made those longer series endearing. It’s a shame that the reunion of the original Gundam series’s team was prevented from creating a more fruitful experience, because Gundam F91 seems to show there was enough of that skill still left in them. In the end, this movie that doesn’t even have a real conclusion might be all we have for a long time, and it’s still somehow more enjoyable than some 50 episode Gundam series. to the point I have to agree on both of those accounts. But before that conclusion, let\'s take a more detailed than usual look of this nearly ""lost"" Gundam entry.In keeping with the mecha tradition of terrible names, a young man named Seabook Arno and his friends end up on a war ship after their space colony comes under attack by forces calling themselves the Crossbone Vanguard. It’s a mostly typical Gundam set-up and story. Seabook reluctantly fights but still finds the time to complain about adults, and the “brat pack” here is reminiscent of ZZ Gundam’s except they are thankfully far more resourceful and mature. In the movie’s beginning as the group attempts to escape from the colony war zone, it’s actually rather refreshing to see such a reasonable bunch of teenagers interacting with each other without going into fits over nothing or trying to sell each other out to the enemy, but I digress. It turns out Seabook’s childhood friend, Cecily Fairchild, is actually part of the Crossbone Vanguard’s royal family and through the typical cheap plot device of Newtype mind tricks ends up going along with them despite having no reason to do so (she’s practically a stranger to her real family). I also don’t see why the Vanguard put so much effort into retrieving her in the first place, as they reveal they don’t actually care much about the possibility of her dying despite their original plans to use her as a spokesperson for the commoners.And already I can’t ignore Gundam F91’s hackjob story construction. If you thought Tomino Gundam series were hard to follow before with the thinnest excuses possible for major character motivations, then F91 is just bewildering as a result of its editing. The script feels no better than if full episodes existed before the movie’s production were simply cut into snippets like one of the Gundam franchise’s many compilation movies.

A sense of movement is often removed, which means you get scenes like characters flying around at the end of battles and suddenly they’re instantly back on the mothership without smoothly aiming the direction there first.

So what did they do to turn it into a film? Cut the unimportant storylines and leave only the essentials? Reduce the character count and leave the focus on the dual protagonists Seabook and Cecily?...Or (the option they chose) just compress everything into such a rapid, non-stop pace that never stops for a breather just so it can fit everything into two hours?I had my complaints with Char's Counterattack feeling too fast-paced for me to keep up, but that was also a sequel playing off of long-established characters and a plot that felt like one constant final battle. F91 works, somehow, because it introduces an entirely new cast far-removed from any previous Gundam series or movie and goes through that entire story with rapid-fire intensity. It's somewhat grounded, the entire story taking place in just a couple space colonies, though of course the main villains plan to wipe out all life on Earth and the Moon because they're Space Nazis, so the stakes are high.Gundam Universal Century is very good about not going into power fantasy mode and keeping you stuck with the grim realities of war, and F91 may be one of the most brutal entries in the saga behind Thunderbolt and War in the Pocket. The opening battle shows the deaths of civilians, including children, and the main cast's home is essentially wiped out in the conflict as they try to escape. The pace is so fast you don't keep attention on the horrors unfolding, but just get thrown into the next one. With both the Earth Federation forces and the Crossbone Vanguard pirates morally gray, it's hard to root for any side and you mostly just hope the characters come out OK.With a story this fast, the characters are obviously underwritten, which is unfortunate. But the action and animation more than make up for it; Gundam has never looked better, and may never look better again because the series isn't popular enough to justify the budget anymore. Watching Char's Counterattack and F91 back-to-back, seeing the difference in animation quality between them is astounding, especially when you consider they were released only three years apart.If you're looking for high-octane sci-fi action, F91 has you covered. As long as you've watched some of the previous UC Gundam series and are up to speed on some of its worldbuilding concepts (because this series has zero time to explain Newtypes or Minovsky particles to us), you'll probably be alright. Just make sure you're prepared for the ride.I may bump up the score for this one after a rewatch, because I feel that the letterboxed low-quality DVD I watched this on probably was not the optimal format to see it in; I'll try and scrounge for a blu-ray copy when I can.

Overall though this was an enjoyable experience I can recall later on the journey to completion-ism. "", ""This is a weird movie - because it was originally designed and partially produced as a 50 episode series. For what it is, I do think the movie stands fine, because it has problems while still being exceptional about certain things.For me, an important aspect for the mecha genre are the action sequences, and F91 has gorgeous animation with very unique and interesting mech designs. The fighting is fun to watch and doesn't clash with the non-action scenes visually. There aren't many, if any, scenes I recall looking off or grotesque due to little time spent on it.It stands pretty alone in the Universal...Century, the most expansive era in Gundam, so you can watch it without needing to know much of anything about the franchise. That said, it follows the most generic outline for a Gundam story it could have, but the differences are rather interesting for fans of the franchise, and knowing what follows in manga format and was meant to be fleshed out actually makes the movie more entertaining.This applies to the characters as well - they are fairly generic and knowing about them through close attention to the movie and the rest of the universe fleshes them out more than the movie will.Being a 50-episode anime turned singular movie (Gundam series tend to be condensed into 3 movies), it obviously has major pacing issues. Little is explained straightforwardly, which while not bad, is very difficult to catch onto when casually watching and is fairly critical since scenes of character development can near instantly turn to the start of action when they felt like they should have been naturally longer. I'd judge this less if it weren't a politically driven movie in-universe, and the politics of the world and reasonings of major characters are very difficult to understand.The audio effects aren't bad, but for some reason I feel like some of them aren't entirely fitting. The soundtrack, save for a few select songs, is forgettable and generic.It has some wonderful parts in the animation and a few songs, horrible pacing and development of the characters and the situation in the movie, and is decent in all other regards. It is a movie that is prettier to look at and imagine what it could've been than it is to listen to and understand fully.

Chronologically, it is far into the future of MS Gundam, of the UC lore. I think its a mature addition to the series, and fairly enjoyable in terms of mecha action. More bellow.Story: the best part of the story is that it is set in the future, where all we know (MS Gunda, Zeta Gundam, etc) is old history, even the Newtypes are sort of a legend sometimes. This gets your attention right away. Another important aspect of the story is how mature it is. It is extremely centered on family struggles, relationships, and some war tragedy, it even...has some strong scenes. The political aspects, however, are overall lame. They are another ""we defeated the empire, but someone is trying to do the same"". Star Wars send its regards. Thus, you will be more rooked about the characters than the political aspects. Nevertheless, it is an entertaining story, where you want to understand what is going on. Imagine that you are seeing a mix of Zeta Gundam, with Gundam Wing.Art & Sound: The art is absurdly awesome for 1991. The artwork is so damn good that the shows appear to be made in 2007 and transported to the past. I can`t say much about the soundtrack, because, in terms of music, nothing stands out.Characters: They are well made. They don`t act dumb or irrational, they are not overflown by lame romantical plots. All feels more natural and organic, like something that could have happened in real life, if all of these things were possible. The protagonists have particular stories and their own reasons to fight, which adds to their decisions and the overall lore of the anime. There is no annoying character, which is always a win, and the main villain is kind of cliche but works well.Mechas: Gundam F91 is a cool mecha. Some of its mechanics were the inspiration for Freedom`s arsenal (Gundam Seed), and clearly for Unicorn`s NTES (Gundam Unicorn). The NPC mechas, for me, are the most awesome NPC mechas of the franchise, surpassing even the Grazes (From Iron Blood Orphans), which were my favorites so far. They are like futuristic versions of the Zakus, but without the lame look they had.Overall, this is a great movie.

The fingerprints of that origin are all over it, from the overwhelming number of characters thrown on screen with nary an introduction, to the somewhat choppy structure that struggles to gel as it trims the connective tissue between scenes to an absolute minimum. Those problems have been known to plague 50-episode Tomino shows though, so it's something any veteran UC Gundam viewer should be used to. Despite that, I enjoyed F91 a lot more than Tomino's other Gundam feature,...Char's Counterattack, mainly thanks to the absence of any distractingly awful characters like Quess. While its ending leaves some major conflicts unresolved, it's more cathartic and comprehensible than the messy ending of Char's Counterattack.The other thing F91 has going for it is its stellar mech animation. The various battle scenes are jaw-dropping, with those happening inside colonies being particularly visceral. You don't want to be a civilian in this movie; it was clearly made while Tomino was still in a dark place emotionally.Overall, while you can see the duct tape holding the editing of this movie together, it brute forces its way to being an entertaining two-hour feature with solid execution of the classic Gundam formula and a host of memorable action scenes.

In some moments it feels very forced but knowing how gundam is, you realize that they always do the same. But that's not why it becomes a bad movie, it is good entertaining and tries to summarize a story in 2 hours so I recommend it.En español:Muy...buena película, lamentablemente no se pudo hacer la serie o el resto de películas, pero la historia tenia mucho potencial, y los diseños eran muy únicos y buenos, la trama y los personajes tenían muy buena pinta, pero como esta tan cortada la película hay momentos en los que no se sienten muy humanos por personajes.

I had few problems following the plot in spite of everything moving super fast, but one character's change just hit me out of nowhere and made no sense to me. This problem might be due to...one of the 2 skips I had on my DVD copy, making me miss two short segments. I liked the characters that got some development, but I really wish there was some more development for the cast, some characters just exist and feel like their arcs are unfinished when the film ends.

It establishes early on that we are in for different kind of Isekai with Genzo basically going “You want me to kill animals? F**k that.” And then goes off to do his own thing. In terms of setting the scene, this show does it very well and we see how the pet shop unfolds over time with the animals Genzo captures and how to get the funding. But throughout the show, we never get to see payoff to all of the tasks Genzo, Shigure as well as two other characters that join him later on, Carmilla and Hanako. It’s all building up to it yet there no ounce of payoff to convince the people that these beasts that threaten the kingdom could be adopted as pets. It’s kind of disappointing.Of course, being a pet shop Isekai isn’t the only thing that makes this show unique, as it also part wrestling and this is where most of the comedy is with all of the German suplexes you desire.  The show is definitely more physical humour than witty humour with Genzo and other characters laying the smack down on anyone that provokes them, friend or foe, male or female (yes, we have another true advocate of gender equality here). So it’s definitely got a certain taste but what makes it work is the timing of it considering that the characters were asking for it. It has plenty of running gags in this show as well that, even though you can see them coming, are well executed every time. It’s well done and definitely is humorous. That’s not to say that the dialogue doesn’t have some funny moments because it truly does so it isn’t all physical humour as the writing does add to the humour.Characters: 8/10As a protagonist,  Genzo isn’t exactly relatable. He’s loud, brash, doesn’t think outside the box and his only interests are for himself with no consideration for other people. As a wrestling protagonist though, he fits that mould well.  Now, I have watched wrestling for several years before finally getting bored with it earlier this year (Thank you Vince McMahon), so I have a good idea of how a good wrestler should act and he definitely does that. He exaggerates everything in every situation for the sake of entertaining the viewer even though he doesn’t realise it. For example, when someone calls him the Daemon Beast Killer, he doesn’t try to reiterate that he doesn’t want to be called that. Instead, he either makes the person go through a table or chucks that person into the ceiling. He dramatise more than he should and makes it work. This makes him a funny protagonist because again, these characters are asking for it and he is just replying how he sees fit, even if it is a bit ridiculous.Now the characters that join Genzo in his quest to open a pet shop are rather basic in terms of how unique these characters are. Shigure is obviously the level headed one in order to see what genzo does is quite ridiculous. While she is a “good” person, she sees this pet shop as way to get rich fast. Hanako, who is a young dragon-girl, is just obsessed with food and that’s pretty much it (although she is smarter than she comes across). Carmilla is a vampire who is obsessed with serving Hanako. The all have simple desires and character depth but they all share a similar mindset which is there obsession over something. Genzo being animals, Shigure being money, Hanako being food and Carmilla being Hanako herself. They aren’t complex because they don’t need to be. They all fill their roles well and their single obsessions is all you need to for them to stick together and to have chemistry with one another. As well as Carmilla getting her ass kicked by Genzo for being a sarcastic b**ch is always funny. There is even a dog that accompanies Genzo by the name of Hiroyuki and he is just adorable.The supporting cast as well has its niches that they definitely fulfil.  They all add something to either the plot, to the comedy, or both. Where it can be simply be Celes wanting to be Genzo’s apprentice, a group of thieves where the wolf-man gets traumatised because Genzo loves animals a bit too much. Even a simple anthropomorphic ant that is somehow part of the pet shop idea and we have no reason why. It’s something stupid like that makes the cast as a whole, enjoyable and there isn’t a character I hate in bad way. It’s rare that I find a cast of characters where I don’t like at least one character but I don’t,  they all fulfil there role well and I can’t complain too much besides a couple of gripes.Animation: 6/10The animation for Hataage isn’t exactly impressive but it is also not bad either. But it is weird saying that because at one point, it can look uninspired. But other times, like when Genzo fights an Orc Chieftain, it looks really good. It lead me to the assumption that it was used for more comedic effect that when it gets down to it, it is impressive; something I think this show has an edge over the manga. That being said, art style isn’t exactly impressive and leans to the more generic side with no signature features to make it stand out. The character designs though is good because they each stand out in there own way can be easily identifiable from one another. So it has that going for it.Sound: 5.5/10The soundtrack is a mixed bag. Half of the soundtrack is more or less generic fantasy music like flute instrumentals or a more light hearted ost for the show’s comedic moments. It sounds like a standard ost that you would hear in other shows. It doesn’t sound bad but it doesn’t stand out. Then there is the other half, where it sounds energetic, intense and adds to the atmosphere. This is normally played during the wrestling scenes or when Genzo is laying the smackdown on people. It definitely is more noticeable than the other half of the ost and adds to the scene of this fight that you would be watching. I also like in significant moments when Genzo german suplexes someone, you can hear someone counting “One...Two...Threeee!” It’s a nice touch for a show that is part wrestling.The opening is alright in my opinion. ""Fight! Kemoner Mask"" by NoB is definitely energetic, paced well and matches the tone of the show pretty well. It’s one of openings that can get you hyped for the show but didn’t exactly wow me and I wanted to go back and listen to it again. Good openings do that. But this opening lacks that itch that makes you want to do that. It is most likely down tot the visuals being okay. But the opening is solid overall. The ending sequence is very meh. ""Anegdot"" by Momosu Momosu is one I skipped through about 3 episodes in. I saw Hiroyuki, I saw his dance, it was adorable and I moved on. It’s pretty much the same animation on a loop so it got boring fast.Conclusion:Hataage is definitely one of those that is there for the sake of being entertaining for the viewer. It’s a rather simple minded show because really, it doesn’t need to be anything else. It just needs to find a way to entertain the viewer and it does that in my opinion. Now sure, it ain’t the best thing in the world since it never does anything amazing but it does do things right to make one of the more entertaining Isekais out there. I will commend it for doing something different instead of just doing, “Transported to another fantasy world but this time have the protagonist be a wrestler to save the world.” Despite having a lack of payoff for all of this, it is one of those shows that you can sit down, turn your brain off after a long day and watch a wrestler german suplex a princess.My personal enjoyment: 7.5/10Overall score: 6.7/10 Recommendation: Watch it I was intrigued.

However, Genzo is a lover of all animals, he could never harm them. So what does he do? He decides to go Brock Lesnar on her ass and takes her to suplex city...b**ch.

Anime fans in 2019 should just accept that we’re going to get even more of these in the future from now on. And joining the expansive lineup, Kemono Michi marks its terrority with an animal lover and professional wrestler named Genzo Shibata.Before actually watching this show, one should take notice the author of the series. Natsume Akatsuki, known for their work with the Konosuba franchise, created this anime and to no one’s surprise, his stylish humor also gets a similar treatment. Does that mean the anime...itself is entirely made of parody? The answer is yes and no. Kemono Michi plays on its isekai tropes by introducing some of its standard running gags but also leans more into selling its humor with everything else when it has the chance to.Taking place in a fantasy world, Genzo enters the anime as a professional wrestler. As a fan of professional wrestling myself, I was rather ecstatic to see some classic wrestling moves being used such as the German Suplex and Sharpshooter. While the anime itself doesn’t sell itself as a WWE drama story, it does put Genzo into a peculiar position. After he gets transported into this fantasy world, he gets tasked with defeating demonic beasts by a princess named Altena Elgard Ratis. The catch is that Genzo loves animals. In fact, the first few episodes easily gives away his love for animals that some may even describe him of having an animal fetish. Furthermore, Genzo has an ambition to open his own pet shop one day and being in a fantasy world opens up such a possibility. Looking at the show this way, the audience should probably not expect a serious tone of storytelling.Watching Kemono Michi does feel like a parody at times. Genzo’s role as after meeting the wolf-girl Shigure transforms him into a dedicated beastmaster. The anime makes it clear that he wants to make friends with the monsters rather than killing them, no matter how difficult the challenge may be. His determined attitude and chivalrous personality earns him many friends throughout the story including the dragon girl Hanako, vampire maid Carmilla Vanstein, and among others. But sometimes, he has to resort to force in order to make his point. When fighting, Genzo uses a mix of his wrestling skills and brawler tactics while taking aggressive risks. The anime often oversell his fights by making them as over exaggerated as possible. The early episodes makes some evident examples such as when he puts down Altena with a German suplex.However, the audience may wonder if there’s any sort of character development for Genzo at all. The truth is, the show doesn’t dedicate on developing him as a person but rather how he builds relationships with others. The most prominent example is with Shigure. In the early parts of the show, she mostly helps him in his goal to further her own ambitions; that is trying to become wealthy. She handles his finance problems while Genzo does the dirty work. Later on in the show, she seems to genuinely care about his well-being. Other characters he meets also begins to understand him more such as Hanako and Carmilla. The one character that seems to despise Genzo is Altena, especially after being embarrassed and not helping with her goals. However, this becomes more of a running gag than a moody revenge sub-plot. She even becomes a source of butt monkey jokes. In fact, several characters in the show carries a degree of comedy gags thanks to the brainchild of Konosuba, Natsume Akatsuki. If you’re familiar with the Konosuba franchise, you may be able to draw similarities with Genzo to Kazuma, Hanako to Megumi, Carmilla to Darkness, and in some ways, Shigure to Aqua. Someday, it would be entertaining to see the two anime get a crossover.Combined with the sarcastic humor and running gags, it’s easy to label Kemono Michi at times as an isekai parody. Some characters such as Genzo are portrayed as powerful humans while ironically, supernatural beings such as Carmilla becomes a jobber in hilarious ways. Character personalities is amplified with some of their habits such as Hanako’s big appetite. And of course, some fans will call this an “isekai furry” anime. After all, some of the more prominent characters display animalistic instincts such as Shigure. And while not being an actual animal, Hanako’s dragon transformation shows her true instincts when she’s angered in one particular episode. In many ways, the anime loves to play itself and that can either be something fans will enjoy or mock for it absurd humor.With such a peculiar premise, Kemono Michi’s artwork isn’t actually strange and actually less visually noticeable compared to Konosuba. Studio ENGi was established in 2018 and this is their first take on an anime project. However, the anime itself delivers an adequate portrayal of the manga. The character designs are also made with fantasy elements and in some cases, animalistic traits. Being a professional wrestler, Genzo is portrayed as a muscular man with masculine features. Even his voice delivers a commanding tone at times when dealing with monsters he encounters. The show itself contains fan service although most of it is portrayed as cheeky humor similar to the Konosuba series. And while I can’t say the battles may suit everyone’s tastes, it definitely look catchy to the eye.You’re probably going to look back and remember some of the hilarious moments in Kemono Michi. With the author of Konosuba helming the show, it won’t be hard to notice the similar style of its humor. I can watch Kemono Michi and say the anime is an enjoyable at best when you embrace its humor. If you looking deeper into the show, there’s not much more you’ll find within. itself is entirely made of parody? The answer is yes and no.

If you looking deeper into the show, there’s not much more you’ll find within.', ""A very funny isekai. It's one to watch for comedy, not plot progression or long shonen fights. The action is fun to watch though since the main character uses pro-wrestling style moves. The action mainly used for comedy. I thought the show would get repetitive but it has kept me engaged so far. It's certainly not generic. The other cast members besides the protagonist are all female but it's not a harem. He isn't interested in them in that way. I also enjoy how the protagonist clashes with most people he meets for outrageous reasons. It reminds me a bit of Konosuba. "", 'I\'m going to be upfront and mention I don\'t like writing previews. That\'s why I typically avoid doing them. This is one of those anime that\'s so weird it demands I make an exception.Kemono Michi or ""Animal Mask"" is a show with an admittedly brilliant concept. The world\'s greatest pro wrestler gets isekai summoned by a bitchy princess, who demands that he slays all the monsters and solves all the problems. The issue is that the pro wrestler Genzo is a vegan/furry and he absolutely refuses to harm an animal! If you watched Shield Hero last season, you would think this is the start of...a long grudge in which Genzo must slowly calculate his revenge. Nope! Genzo just walks up to the princess, does a German suplex on her, and that\'s the end of that entire sub-plot! Seriously, that\'s the hardest I laughed in an anime this entire season.The show then moves on to Genzo gathering a furry harem and teaching the people of the isekai world to love monsters and co-exist with them instead of trying to slay them all. That\'s the entire plot.For the first 3-4 episodes, Kemono Michi is genuinely hilarious. This is a low budget anime that doesn\'t look pretty and doesn\'t have the best character art. However, the comedic timing was such an improvement from the author\'s previous work Konosuba, that I was ready to crown this the king of all isekai!Then they stopped writing new jokes. They just made all the gags from episodes 1-3 into running jokes that quickly wear out. By episode 8, the entire show is just little running jokes that are pasted together to somehow fill out a 20 minute run time. It\'s like watching an old Nostalgia Critic review...before he discovered sketch comedy and became even worse! I don\'t even need to watch the show anymore. I already know every single thing that\'s going to happen!I\'m going to be VERY generous and give this a 6 for the funny concept and those first few episodes. After episode 4 just stop watching. I was willing to go to bat for this anime and it completely let me down. Sometimes less is more. Golden Boy is still beloved after 25 years because it knew when to quit and not overstay its welcome. The manga just continued on with the same gags and eventually became a full blown porn. We don\'t talk about the manga. We love that short little 6 episode OVA. If you only have the material to write 4 episodes, then just write 4 episodes and release it as an OVA or ONA. Don\'t try stretch 4 episodes of material into 13-26 episodes! a long grudge in which Genzo must slowly calculate his revenge. Nope!

If you’ve had the misfortune of watching Hellsing TV, Rosario + Vampire or FMA 2003 I can just go ahead and say this show is one of those. If not - well, this is a manga “adaptation” that starts by following the manga plot, switches to the completely original material halfway, and the twist is that the anime-original parts are garbage. Here’s a bunch of ways in which...this anime fails:1) Trying to fit square pegs in round holes.So, the manga is written by Akatsuki Natsume of Konosuba fame, and it basically is a Konosuba re-skin. Meaning, a gut-busting situational comedy in an isekai setting about a bunch of dysfunctional losers who somehow found a family in each other and are now busy grinding through monsters-of-the-week of their particular isekai (Demon King’s generals in case of Konosuba, demonic beasts in case of Kemono Michi). Seriously, go read it, it’s 10/10. And what do you think the anime does with these building blocks? First, it tries to do a plot-focused “serious” arc, which of course fails because the very premise of the world absolutely excludes any possibility of having serious stakes or grand narratives. And second, it does entire episodes without a single joke, supposedly dedicated to developing the characters - except “the characters” were envisioned as the plot-devices for sitcom humor and there is nothing to develop. It’s like the production team completely failed to understand the whole appeal of the source material and had no clue what they were doing. Which brings me to the next point.2) The production team completely failed to understand the whole appeal of the source material and had no clue what they were doing.Couple of times they run into a situation where they have square pegs and square holes. Do you think they manage to fit them in? Nope. Here’s an example:The beginning of both the manga and the anime has the MC deciding to run a pet shop. In the source he actually runs a pet shop. In the anime this premise is abandoned, which is bad, but not terrible. But then they make an anime original episode where literally the best solution for the conflict would by selling a pet to a person - and that still doesn’t happen. Despite the very same episode confirming that yes, they have the actual pets to sell.Another baffling example: A manga chapter dedicated to a single gag. 17 pages of the setup, 3 pages of the punchline - the most basic structure of a joke. The anime adapts the 17 pages of the setup… and stops. The scene ends without a punchline and the character literally turns to the camera and says “well, what I just did turned out to be a waste of time.” What. The. Fuck.3) The devil is in the details.One of the strongest points of the manga is its amazing attention to detail. The female deuteragonist wears what is essentially a pair of assless chaps - because she’s a kemonomimi girl with a huge tail - it’s an article of clothing that makes sense for her. The chairs in the main cast’s home are also designed in a way that accommodates having a tail. Mind, those things are never highlighted, it just something you notice accidentally, have a lightbulb moment, and then feel good that the artist actually put some thought into his work. Which is why it’s such an eyesore when the anime-original scenes have the tails just phase through clothing or straight-up disappear.A different detail: one of the characters is a vampire, meaning the sunlight harms her. In the manga every time she goes outside during the daytime she carries a parasol (it’s a farcical sitcom, after all). Apparently, not a single person on the anime production team had a clue about what they were doing because in the original scenes the parasol is missing. I mean, it would’ve been perfectly fine to just retcon the thing away if it was too inconvenient, but that would require having a single clue about what they were doing. So the parasol is present in the scenes copypasted from the manga and absent in the original ones, because what is consistency.4) The humor.The jokes from the source material are funny. The anime original jokes are not. All of them. No exceptions. Without ever reading the manga, you can tell which scenes come from where by whether you laughed or not.They also manage to ruin some of the manga jokes by either repeating them ad nauseum or by pushing things way past their limit. Akatsuki Natsume’s trademark humor involves a lot of comedic bullying, and the screenwriters try to imitate it - but somehow come up with the scenes of the actual abuse that can make you feel either uncomfortable or sad, but definitely not entertained. I’m baffled how anyone, never mind the professional writers, could fail at humor so hard. It’s on the level of not understanding the line between cats being scared by a cucumber and cats getting physically hurt.5) It. Just. Sucks.Forget the source material. You can look at this anime completely on its own merits, and it’s just objectively bad on the artistic level.Garbage dialogues: “Hey, ojousan. Your servant is shit, let’s make her duel my, apriori stronger servant, and if she loses, then I, random nobody with no relation to you, will appoint you a different servant (secretly my spy, *Dr. Evil’s laugh*), and also this whole sentence isn’t retarded on five different levels.”Garbage writing: A wrestling tournament is under way, there is an ominous hooded figure watching it from the shadows, he steps into the ring a second before the hero is pronounced the champion. Is it the main antagonist (also a wrestler) who was teased for the last 4 episodes? No, it’s a local Team Rocket guy who has no reason to be there (actually has a reason to avoid the place at any cost) and just gets pointlessly humiliated in ten seconds (see the abuse point above), because that’s how you do a culmination of a tournament.Garbage directing: An episode-long flashback that ends on a cliff-hanger, the antagonist plans to go for the main hero. Guess what the next episode is about? Another episode-long flashback, completely unrelated to anything.Comparing this shitty fanfiction to the manga (which I only ever picked up after liking the first and only two good episodes of the adaptation) reminded me of another thing I’d rather forget - Psycho Pass Season 2 - in a “so that’s how talent versus no talent looks like” way.2/10 for “that’s not how ‘go read the manga’ works, you incompetent hacks.” this anime fails:1) Trying to fit square pegs in round holes.So, the manga is written by Akatsuki Natsume of Konosuba fame, and it basically is a Konosuba re-skin. Meaning, a gut-busting situational comedy in an isekai setting about a bunch of dysfunctional losers who somehow found a family in each other and are now busy grinding through monsters-of-the-week of their particular isekai (Demon King’s generals in case of Konosuba, demonic beasts in case of Kemono Michi). Seriously, go read it, it’s 10/10. And what do you think the anime does with these building blocks? First, it tries to do a plot-focused “serious” arc, which of course fails because the very premise of the world absolutely excludes any possibility of having serious stakes or grand narratives. And second, it does entire episodes without a single joke, supposedly dedicated to developing the characters - except “the characters” were envisioned as the plot-devices for sitcom humor and there is nothing to develop. It’s like the production team completely failed to understand the whole appeal of the source material and had no clue what they were doing. Which brings me to the next point.2) The production team completely failed to understand the whole appeal of the source material and had no clue what they were doing.Couple of times they run into a situation where they have square pegs and square holes. Do you think they manage to fit them in? Nope. Here’s an example:The beginning of both the manga and the anime has the MC deciding to run a pet shop. In the source he actually runs a pet shop. In the anime this premise is abandoned, which is bad, but not terrible. But then they make an anime original episode where literally the best solution for the conflict would by selling a pet to a person - and that still doesn’t happen.

You need MORE Isekai shows? Here you go..."" *pulls another one*Everyone: OH LOOK! Another Isekai! By the author of one of the best Isekai comedies of recent years (KonoSuba)? Oh boy, this sure looks interesting!Me after 12 episodes: OK...meh it\'s fine....Honestly, the wraith of Isekai shows is becoming even a cliche at this point, just look at this season\'s offerings as a whole and tell me if the ever popular Isekai trope is gonna be away at any point in time.For this show, while the concept was somewhat...unique with forging pretty much a ""WWE Wrestlemania"" environment, hammering such mindset is the world\'s greatest pro wrestler by the name of Genzo Shibata, it sure looks like a recipe for success. Alas, while in a modern world match, the ""another world\'s"" summoners\' requiem for a hero (being Genzo) was done as means to justify that both axes of the world can be covered a.k.a Demon Lord vs. Hero stance. Just imagine that once he is summoned, instead of being that conventional hero, he just walks right to the princess which summoned him, and delivers a German Suplex onto her for giving him THAT much trouble, hence, the nickname Princess Buttocks (if you\'ve watched the show).And of course, seemingly rightfully so that being the furry lover that he is, he begins to instil his presence onto the Isekai world with his furry prized possession of a dog Hiroyuki, by fledgling his ""Demon Beast Killer"" status along with pettying the usual neighbours that he runs into, and building his very own pet shop in another world for both humans and demihumans to co-exist together, but not without his supporters on the side: the seemingly sweet but cunning money-loving wolf-girl Shigure and master-servant ""sidekicks"" Hanako and Carmilla. Oh, and not to forget, that while the Hero side is assembled, it\'s nothing until the Demon Lord\'s side is fulfilled in the same fashion with Genzo\'s opponent MAO taking him on just to see the postponed ""World Champion"" wrestling match plot being fulfilled to its potential to close with a bang.Quite honestly, while the hints of KonoSuba stray within this show, I do admit that it has its moments of being funny (for the 1st quarter alone). However, it quickly becomes apparent that like said show, Kemono Michi a.k.a Animal Mask relies heavily on the comedy to compensate for any lack of depth on all fronts, and yes, I do mean in terms of the lesser story and bigger character development, of which I wouldn\'t say there were none, but it just barely stands out literally like its predecessor by a wide margin. While Genzo\'s humour relies on him being both the target and the targeted for other people, there is a heck lot of banter within the wide cast of characters that are being encountered to do their bidding. Pretty much everything is a copy-paste action that once done, is repeated endlessly towards the same old jokes and all, making it predictable and less enjoyable. Boring...Art and animation wise, it\'s Kadokawa taking the reins for this show, the surprise being that I did not expect that they\'d have their own in-house outsourced studio to handle this project. A subsidary of the Kadokawa Coporation, ENGI (not that DAL Engi) was tasked from this joint venture as the studio\'s very first project, and I\'d have to say that it stands out in quite a fair bit. Other than the unique character designs which all have quite the look, the art itself isn\'t too drab, but it supposedly has that ""shining"" effect placed all around, as if there were torchlights to make the overall aesthetics look brighter to hide the low budget effects of the show. The same is applied to the animation aspects, while it certainly looks fine to the average watcher, the incorporation of the comedy scenes were mundane to say the least, and while there\'s a decent amount of action for the most part, it overall still feels like nothing.If the art and animation itself were a bogey, the music itself was on par, not great, but not bad either. Most particularly, the sound designs were mostly and clearly inspired from KonoSuba, and while we got that here, it wasn\'t as appealing the way that it was supposed to be. Same goes to the OST for both the OP and ED, it was also fine. At first, I\'d thought the OP was very appealing from the get-go signifying the countdowns of wrestling matches with its full-on rockability, and it still is acceptable (don\'t get me wrong, it\'s a good song), but that is where the only good parts lie at.All in all, if you were expecting another outing from KonoSuba author Natsume Akatsuki, this show just isn\'t as glamourous and being all that stupid for the predecessor that made us be that ""laughter is the best medicine"" and ""comedy is subjective"" anthropologies. As if the overall score isn\'t very generous enough, the manga itself is paced differently, and even a bore to read after just a few chapters.

Why? Well, like Konasuba, Kemono Michi is a series that prides itself on humour, it's not a plot heavy manga or story and is mainly comedy. The thing about comedy is that it is quite subjective, what you find funny, someone else may not. That's unfortunately the case here. I...don't find any of the jokes, actions or scenes to be funny. For a while, I thought maybe I was just missing something, but nope, just not funny to me.When the humour doesn't connect, the next thing goes to the plot. As I said before, Michi lacks any real plot and trust me when I say the story stays the same throughout the manga. As a result, I had to give this series a 7/10. Reasoning for that score despite it having poor plot and not being funny? 1, the concept of a wrestler being isekai'd is absolutely hilarious, 2  the girl with the grey hair is adorable and 3, I really do appreciate the fact that the same author who wrote Konasuba tried to do something unique here in terms of story, it just did not connect with me personally.Overall, I think it's a series you should give a watch, it's just something that if you don't connect with, you may struggle to enjoy. I will continue watching as I have never dropped an anime in my life. don't find any of the jokes, actions or scenes to be funny.

Was this really done by the same author? Because it doesn't, seem like it, the jokes here can be lazy and often predictable, and the show insists on repeating the same shit every episode. Konosuba was fun to watch precisely for the crazy expressions and see 4 idiots in a dungeon, he got it right,...but here no effort from the author.This show does not innovate at all, it is the same cast that you have probably seen in some bad season fantasy, with the difference that everyone here barely has a personality of their own.

While it seemed like it had little going for it due to its use of a tiresome isekai gimmick, sub-par production value, and barely anything plot and characters. What it did have however is a great use of comedy that made the show an enjoyable ride due to how easily funny it was.The comedy that Kemono Michi uses isn’t really anything exceptional, in fact I would consider it downright predictable. A sort of predictable-ness where you sort of already know what’s going to be the...punchline halfway through the set-up. Nevertheless the pay-off for the punchline are handled really well by going full throttle with the delivery and timing.After a while however the jokes begin to run a bit dry due to how repetitive they become. The show is aware of this, and does try to make fun of how they do the same jokes and bits over and over. An example would be the wolf girl, Shigure, “finding” special expensive weapons that an adventurer dropped due to being knocked out by the main protagonist. As the show continues on with each episode, Shigure ends up getting tired of the bit as well. It gets to a point where they just end up cutting it out with only a few signifiers implying that she’s still stealing the weapons.

But what did I get? An anime that just seems to repeat the same exact joke over and over and over again. And I am being very literal about that.And let me just make this clear, the main character is horrible and incredibly unlikable. The jokes with him that are meant to be...funny just come off as incredibly frustrating and annoying.The only good thing about this anime is some of the other characters. Shigure for example is probably the most interesting of them all. But this sadly doesn't save it for me because they even use the same exact joke over and over with her.

Kemono Michi.  Fortunately for this anime, being half as funny as Konosuba means you\'re still pretty funny.  And that\'s what saved this from being a total waste of time.Outside of the funny moments, which were plentiful, literally everything about this anime is the definition of mediocre.  The plot is mediocre. The characters are mediocre. (Although I did like Shigure), The animation style is mediocre and looks low budget....The ending is mediocre. Just everything about the anime screams mediocrity.  But, it keeps you laughing, so you keep going.Hataage Kemono Michi is as thin of a story as it gets.  A princess summons a hero from another world to battle monsters attacking her people.  The hero, Genzou, turns out to be a pro-wrestler who loves animals and gets violently angry whenever anyone even talks about threatening them.  Instead of killing the beasts, he decides to pursue his dream of opening a pet shop where he can teach people to love the monsters that attack them.  Through this, he meets Shigure, who is clearly a riff on Aqua.  She hates being poor, loves chasing money, and has questionable morals. (She was also my favorite character.), Carmilla (Who is the Dustiness of the group, but instead of her gag being a masochist, she\'s an alcoholic. She even has the same habit of being beaten up and nearly eaten by monsters just like Dustiness) and Hanako (Who I guess would be the Megumin of the group in that she\'s a royal loli who is actually the most powerful of the quartet but can\'t show it.  Megumin can\'t because she can\'t control her power, and Hanako can\'t because she\'s trying to hide her identity.).  The only one that isn\'t the same as a Konosuba character is Genzou himself, because he\'s nothing like Kazuma. (And seeing how awesome Kazuma is, that\'s a loss for this anime. If you were going to rip off the cast of Konosuba, you should\'ve just gone all the way.)  But, even though the majority of these characters are similar to Konosuba, they are far less intelligent and far more one-dimensional than the cast of Konosuba.The Konosuba ripoff doesn\'t stop there, however.  Of course they join a guild, and just like in Konosuba, they cause more trouble for the members of it than they help.  They spend their time doing quests and chasing money to get out of debt, but end up broke, anyway, just like Konosuba. There\'s also a lot of ecchi-based jokes and humor, just like Konosuba. It\'s kind of shameless really, that they just so blatantly lifted so much from Konosuba and then tried to smother it in a bunch of furry jokes and pro-wrestling, so you think that its different.The two things that they use to try and differentiate themselves from Konosuba and Isekai in general were both a blessing and curse for the anime.  The Furry angle produced a lot of funny moments.  But, the gag of Genzou\'s overabundant love for animals ran thin towards the end of the anime.  The Pro-Wrestling angle was never funny. I don\'t even know why they made this guy a pro-wrestler, but it hurt the anime more than helped it. Outside of a few funny suplexes, it was just kind of silly and really limited the combat of the anime to just pro-wrestling style fights for the most part.  And what was bizarre, is that they decided to go the route of pro-wrestling style fighting, but the animation was too mediocre to make it exciting.  And it\'s like they knew they weren\'t good at it, because almost all the fights were like 20 seconds long.I\'m savaging this anime, but truth be told, I was entertained by it.  But, I was entertained in the way you\'re entertained by any gag anime; you\'re just waiting for the next joke.  You\'re not waiting to see some mystery solved, or any kind of credible plot development, or what ultimately happens between characters, because you can figure that all out before it even happens.  You\'re just waiting for the next time someone punches Dustine--I mean Carmilla in the gut, or waiting for Genzou to do something weird like sniff a dog\'s butt.  It\'s the most basic and simple of entertainment, but it\'s entertaining, nonetheless.And that\'s what Hataage! Kemono Michi is. Just a basic isekai anime.  If you didn\'t watch this and you watched something else, you wouldn\'t miss out on anything special. If you did watch this, you wouldn\'t feel like you were completely cheated.

The thought of how Japanese wrestling being represented in an anime, like Tiger Mask W, but written as an isekai comedy by the author of Konosuba was almost too good to be true. And after watching all of the series, I went from being invested in a world with a funny wrestler that fights all the monsters in an entertaining, abstract way to being just fed up with the series as it comes to an end. Basically, I came into this thinking, ""Oh, a wrestling anime, oh boi"" and came out being reminded...that the ""golden age of isekai"" is more dominant and some people might actually enjoy parts I just couldn\'t.

While I haven\'t watched all isekai out there, I have watched a fair amount and I often times even like the ones that get hated on for being unoriginal trash. When I heard this show was done by the same author of Konosuba, I couldn\'t wait to jump in to this show.The art in this show is not bad at all, I actually...thought it was really well done. The sound is good, but nothing that made me stop and appreciate it while wearing my headphones. I think the opening song is kind of cool too. The characters don\'t really stand out to me, many/if not all are one-dimensional, never seem to learn from their actions and if they have a trait you find annoying, be prepared to get reminded every episode. I do enjoy the fighting sequences against foes, more on this in the spoilers. The story may seem odd for a man that just got teleported to another world, nothing too spectacular in my opinion, but early on it was a little amusing to me.I may finish this one at a later date, but I just need a break from this show, because I am just annoyed with it for now. Read below for my reasoning.**May Contain Possible Spoilers**Much of this contains my own personal opinions of the show which may not be how others feel, but these are the reasons I stepped away from this show for the time being.Ever had a friend that constantly does some action or repeats some joke because they think it\'s absolutely hilarious, but it really isn\'t and it just become increasingly more annoying each time they do it? That\'s this show. I fault no man for having a love of animals, but taking his animal love to the point of it being a weird fetish has just killed this show for me. ""Hey Mr. please help me do X."" ""Absolutely not, I don\'t have time for your problems."" *Notices some animalistic trait or feature of that person* ""Oh! Excuse me, right away, I\'d do anything for you, to the point that even you think its overbearing and unnecessary.""As stated above, the fighting sequences can be rather impressive, and when the MC does his first couple of suplexes, it seems kind of cool. But after the MC has suplexed a couple of the frequent characters every episode you start to get the point that even you\'re saying ""really dude?"". And the dragon people, how is there still life on (whatever their planet is called) if one little girl can\'t stop eating or thinking of eating for 2 seconds. The MC and dragon girl are the two most annoying characters to me.I don\'t think I have super high standards for anime, but overly pushy themes ruin shows for me. It\'s like hanging out with the super religious kid on the weekend, sure it would be fun to go to the mall and hang out, but they are going to ask you to go to church with them like a million times when you either don\'t want to or believe in different things.

Its just a comedy and to be honest thats my favorite genre. I say this in most of my reviews but people are too pretentious, like the show is meant to be a gag. For example family guy had no real plot, it was just a comedy but if anime does that same concept we rate it a 6.6?????????? I mean I thoroughly enjoyed the show and had good laughs at a wrestler animal lovin dude who walked around in a speedo...and introduced the whole new world to wrestling lol. It was written by the same guy who wrote konosuba, I think, and it showed many similarities in that type of humor, raunchy dummy shenaniganiry :DPlot obviously not super great but thats not the pointCharacters for the purpose of humor theyre greatAnimation okayHumor good!Overall its better than your everyday run of the mill isekai spam that we usually see. If youre inbetween shows why not give this a chance! and introduced the whole new world to wrestling lol.

If youre inbetween shows why not give this a chance!', ""Hataage! Kemono Michi is at its core, an isekai with wrestling-themes. I usually like isekai, but I cannot express enough how much of a disappointment this show was for me. It started out pretty nice, with the MC's absolutely lunatic reactions and antics. However, as I went on, it slowly got stale. Side characters exist for the purpose of being the MC's punching bag whenever they insult any animal, intentional or not. The MC has anger management issues, lashing out at anyone and everyone, regardless of age, and being ridiculously hard to appease.The MC's personality is absolutely horrendous. He flips his personality on a...switch when it comes to animals, making you feel like you'll catch bipolar disease from him. His personality traits feel as though they're added in just so that he has a personality; it doesn't feel at all thorough or real enough though. Also, side characters have zero personality, zero dynamics with each other, most often interacting with the MC, much to their suffering. It's like they're made of cardboard or something.The story is...non-existent. For the most part, the MC just continues with his pet shop antics and the dog or rabbit-eared girl continues with her money antics. We don't really feel the sense of plot progression, neither do we see any character development whatsoever, save for the lizard lady.Also doesn't help that for the majority of the anime, the story takes place within the only the city, but more often, their house. It's a fucking isekai, shouldn't you be exploring the world? Showing what this parallel world has to offer? And yet every scene is cooped up either at the MC's house or the city central. Fucking unimaginative.All in all, a very disappointing anime with very little to offer. Promising start, but terrible execution. switch when it comes to animals, making you feel like you'll catch bipolar disease from him.

These type of isekai shows don\'t have really heavy plot and it doesn\'t really offer much on the story side of things. Though this may seem bad at first, these types are more associated with non-isekai shows that also doesn\'t really on heavy plot but instead on comedic values (e.g Azumanga Daioh, Nichijou).This is one example of a light isekai, it isn\'t reliant on it\'s plot progression but instead offers its comedic values. Though it does...have plot progression, it\'s better to say that it\'s only part of the package.Now let\'s talk about what it\'s got. The comedy of the show is superb early on enhancing each and every episode though later on it falls off and just becomes repetitive, And that\'s where its plot progression clutches. It does this by rushing through the story steadily then plan its conclusion and this includes thing like build-up, anticipation, and a resolution arc. Though I don\'t think it\'s something amazing, I can say it\'s fairly decent though.So one thing I actually noticed on the show is that fight scenes have better animation than other scenes. The other scenes looks really sloppy and stiff tho going through thw fight scenes it\'s flow is really good.Actually not much to talk about this show so lets proceed to the conclusion.Do I recommend this show?Not really. This show offers a lot less than other shows of its genre. Though this one in particular is fairly decent, I still don\'t see myself thinking about this show whenever someone asks ""hey recommend me some isekai"".7/10 have plot progression, it\'s better to say that it\'s only part of the package.Now let\'s talk about what it\'s got.

It\'s really a story that could only be told within the sub-gender. Different from each other who are much more of a perfumery, the concept is based on the cultural difference between someone from our world and a bunch of medievers.Obviously it\'s not a serious story, not even close to it, but still it\'s interesting to see that there was a reasoning behind the choice of scenario. Still talking about scenery, because it\'s a comedy story without...four hundred bows per season, strangely Hataage allows himself to breathe, to acclimatize.The viewer has time to get to know the city. The improvised little house they live in. The guild of hunters. The village of the orcs. And by having that time, we end up connecting to what\'s happening by extension. Even if the plot is (intentionally) weird.As a parody, Hataage also allows himself not to spend an infinity of time with a mythology. She is there, don\'t get me wrong, but she gives way to what really matters to shine: the characters and their interactions.Traditional Brazilian familyGenzo\'s party is strangely similar to a standard little family. A father who doesn\'t want to work, a daughter, a worried mother and an alcoholic aunt. Oh, he also has a dog, and a janitor who\'s a giant ant. Each family has its own peculiarities, no judgments.But seriously, Hataage\'s main cast is wonderful, maybe not isolated, but when they interact with each other. And the script is clever enough to vary the jokes so that none of them wear out.Besides variation, the script uses them to develop the characters, with their respective jokes escalating to almost questionable levels. The princess with a fetish for being humiliated in public to say so. Not that Hataage crosses the line of common sense, but tests the limits of what is acceptable and leaves the viewer with the doubt if they should be laughing at that situation.Especially wonderful moments are both the training montages and every time Genzo enters the guild for calling him a monster killer. Even Shigure\'s follow-ups always picked up a legendary weapon ""that fell to the ground"" kept being hilarious until the end of the anime.And in the midst of so many jokes the anime even has room to deliver a beautiful moment between the alcoholic vampire Carmilla and her master, the gluttonous dragon Hanako. One complaint, however, is that Shigure is being played a bit of a corner during the entire series.Signs of an unknown studioThe technical part of Hataage is operative in the best moments, sad in the worst. It doesn\'t get you out of the experience, but it doesn\'t help to elevate it.The trail is absolutely forgettable, with a mediocre opening and a passable closure. The work of voices at least is well done.Even though it\'s a series of comedy, it still has countless action scenes. These scenes have their moments, but most of the time they are composed of static images and locked movements.As for the composition of scenes, there is not much to be commented on. With the exception of a Hanako shot against the moon, otherwise, the expected and nothing more. The direction really seems to operate on automatic and rely on the strong text of the manga, a feather.All of this in the end shows the signs of what a new studio Engi is like, and the director, Kazuya Miura, is still on his second work. At least the script holds itself together, and closes very well basically all the ends raised throughout the season.A wonderful grade 7Hataage will not be memorable, a milestone of his genre, or change his life. But it\'s a solid and fun job to take advantage of on a Sunday afternoon at the end of the year. Open your cheap beer, sit comfortably, and watch the power of Wrestling save a generic medieval world.And remember, love the animals if you don\'t want to take a Kemono Mask suplex.---------------------------------------Isekai conscienteAcho que o primeiro destaque relevante para se ter com Hataage é o quanto ele sabe jogar com o conceito de isekai. É realmente uma história que só poderia ser contada dentro do subgênero. Diferente de uns e outros que são muito mais uma perfumaria, o conceito se sustenta na diferença cultural entre alguém do nosso mundo e um bando de medievos.Obviamente não é uma história séria, nem perto disso, mas ainda assim é interessante ver que houve um raciocínio por trás da escolha do cenário. Ainda falando de cenário, por ser uma história de comédia sem quatrocentos arcos por temporada, estranhamente Hataage se permite respirar, aclimatar.O espectador tem tempo de conhecer a cidade. A casinha improvisada que eles moram. A guilda de caçadores. A vila dos orcs. E ao termos esse tempo, acabamos nos conectando ao que está acontecendo por extensão. Mesmo que o plot seja (intencionalmente) esdrúxulo.Como paródia, Hataage também se permite não gastar uma infinidade de tempo com uma mitologia. Ela está lá, não me entenda mal, mas cede espaço para o que realmente importa brilhar: os personagens e suas interações.Família tradicional brasileiraA party do Genzo é estranhamente similar a uma família padrãozinho. O pai que não quer trabalhar, uma filha, uma mãe preocupada com as contas e uma tia alcoólatra. Ah, também tem um cachorro, e uma faxineira que é uma formiga gigante. Cada família tem suas particularidades, sem julgamentos.Mas agora falando sério, o elenco principal de Hataage é maravilhoso, talvez não isolados, mas quando interagem entre si. E o roteiro é inteligente no ponto de variar bastante as piadas para que nenhuma delas se desgastasse.Além da variação, o roteiro se utiliza das mesmas para desenvolver os personagens, com suas respectivas piadas escalando a níveis quase questionáveis. A princesa com fetiche por ser humilhada em público que o diga. Não que Hataage chegue a cruzar a linha do bom senso, mas testa os limites do aceitável e deixa o espectador com a dúvida se deveria estar rindo daquela situação.Momentos especialmente maravilhosos são tanto as montagens de treinamento quanto toda vez que o Genzo entra puto na guilda por chamarem ele de assassino de monstros. Inclusive os follow-ups da Shigure sempre pegando uma arma lendária “que caiu no chão” seguiram sendo hilários até o final do anime.E no meio de tantas piadas o anime tem até espaço para entregar um momento bonito entre a vampira alcoólatra Carmilla e sua mestra, a dragão glutona Hanako. Uma reclamação no entanto é a Shigure ser jogada um tanto de escanteio durante toda a série.Sinais de um estúdio desconhecidoA parte técnica de Hataage é operante nos melhores momentos, triste nos piores. Não chega a te tirar da experiência, mas não ajuda a elevá-la.A trilha é absolutamente esquecível, com uma abertura medíocre e um encerramento passável. O trabalho de vozes ao menos é bem realizado.Mesmo sendo uma série de comédia, ainda possui inúmeras cenas de ação. Essas cenas tem seus momentos, mas na maior parte do tempo são compostas de imagens estáticas e movimentações travadas.Quanto a composição de cenas não existe muito a ser comentado. Com exceção de uma tomada da Hanako contra a lua, de resto, o esperado e nada mais. A direção realmente parece operar no automático e se apoiar no texto forte do mangá, uma pena.Tudo isso no final demonstra os sinais de como o Engi é um estúdio novato, e o diretor, Kazuya Miura, ainda está em seu segundo trabalho. Ao menos o roteiro se segura por si só, e fecha muito bem basicamente todas as pontas levantadas ao longo da temporada.Um maravilhoso nota 7Hataage não vai ser memorável, um marco de seu gênero nem mudar sua vida. Mas é um trabalho sólido e divertido para se aproveitar num domingo à tarde nesse fim de ano.

And since it's an assumed spirit, there's not so much to complain about Hataage! but maybe not so much to enjoy either.The story doesn't seem to go anywhere : after 12 episodes, you're pretty much on the same expectations that you were on episode 2. It's not exactly an issue, considering the amount of jokes and playful situations in-between, but still I would have love to see this anime raise up the stakes and reach another level, something Gintama for example is very good for.But anyway, if you're not expecting too much of it but...wish to laugh from time to time, this anime is a good pick.Nothing too serious, with a good pace and with some quite original buttocks viewing angles. wish to laugh from time to time, this anime is a good pick.Nothing too serious, with a good pace and with some quite original buttocks viewing angles."", ""Hataage!

To me, this show has a very ""medium budget"" 2006-2010 sort of vibe due to its art style with black lines, duller colors and shading, and its music as well. It feels like it has the same sort of style as the early 2000\'s but also has the polish and clean-ness of modern techniques. It also could have been animated better at certain points, as a few scenes are just still frames being shifted around. As for the characters, Shigure=Kazuma, Carmilla=Aqua. Genzo and Hanako have...various traits of Darkness and Megumin. It\'s okay so far. Not the funniest, but I do chuckle a little every now and then. various traits of Darkness and Megumin.

I really am not, I tend to avoid animes which make dumb jokes about women (this might have to do with the fact that I am a woman and it irritates me). BUT this anime has captured my humour and interest very well. It was short, snappy and amusing to watch. It didn't...take itself too seriously and aimed to make fun of itself and it's characters. I will admit that although the premise is unique, the jokes are not entirely that, YET the writing entertained me to no end.It felt fresh to me, especially as the main character wasn't a teenage boy for once.[Conclusion]I think this anime is misunderstood. take itself too seriously and aimed to make fun of itself and it's characters.

Kemono Michi, is a novice Tim Burton of the anime medium in that the shows following his Konosuba hit series make more sense when you understand who wrote them. Much like how Mars Attacks! Seemed like a random kookie movie until i realised it was a Tim Burton number and it seemed to subsequently just click; as intending to be the unique and stylish aesthetic that it was.H!KM is not just a mere isekai, it\'s a parody of isekai and i think this meta seems to have been lost on a lot of people who have...gone into the show without this contextual awareness, taking the show far too seriously than it was intended to be. H!KM is not anything innovative, it is a continuation of Konosuba\'s innovation in isekai parody. Though it\'s main fault lies, unfortunately, in that it winds up being very much just more of the same; a group of inept, hopeless misfits somehow scraping by by what little fortune that can rub together to survive. Except this time with a bizarre 180 on the animation style being almost over produced.Konosuba, the spiritual father to this series is raw with wacky child like animation that is both appreciable in its expressive rendition and simultaneously unworthy of note. On the other hand H!KM is over illustrated to the point where the characters are often stiff as a board, almost as if unwanting to crease their own perfect image. With intermittent ""set"" animation segments that juxtapose almost unnaturally to the point of breaking immersion. Part of me wonders if this was intentional, as an extreme form of balance, though for some reason some of this seemed like a meta joke to me in its own way.

The gags and weirdness are all there, but are so consistent it becomes common place and stale. How often does Genzou really need to repeat the opening gag of performing a suplex on Princess Altena and seeing her pants? The character development is basically nonexistent and whilst the idea of the show is ultimately as a foundation for slap stick humour, but in a weird scenario, Konosuba at least had some manner of story progression that made the show feel like less of a game show and more of a story. In Konosuba each character slowly develops by learning new skills and sharing experiences that connect them going forwards. By the end of H!KM\'s 12 episodes the characters remain almost exactly the same as they did when they were first introduced with the exception of perhaps princess Altena who becomes a masochist from all the humiliating suplexes.

An archetypal MC trope that allows for very little variation in comedy at his [Genzou\'s] expense.At the end of the day, especially considering the fact that the pet shop aspect that ties the whole isekai plot together at the seams gets forgotten about in anything but off hand remarks/references by the MC\'s (now unrelatable) motivation to get out of bed, the show dissolves into a running gag on the MC\'s various unique perversions which actually aren\'t that funny; after Hanako dribbles at the thought of eating food for the fourth time in an episode, 12 episodes in.

The hero's calling to the alternate world was almost standard, as was the case with most Isekai, which...is not encouraging.  It is also sad that the plot does not develop but stands still. The main characters roam in one place, and that's it.There are tons of soundtracks. In battle - dynamic music, in conversation - calm music, and in moments when funny moments should happen, it is accompanied by a soundtrack.There is practically no character disclosure.

If you think it's pro wrestling, pet shops and butts, Kemono Michi has you covered.Isekai has been pretty stale for years, and it usually comes down to a few reasons: lazy worldbuilding, cliched RPG plots, and boring protagonists. This show doesn't do much with its worldbuilding, and the basic throughline of the plot could have ended up as a typical defeat-the-demon-lord quest, but that gets derailed thanks to the protagonist. Rather than the usual otaku or salaryman, Genzo is a pro wrestler/animal fetishist whose plans to retire from wrestling and open a pet shop are scuppered when a princess...teleports him to another world. When she commands him to rid the world of demon beasts (ie. animals), he responds by suplexing her into the ground and walking out. So begins his plan to tame/befriend/sexually harass demon beasts and open that world's first pet shop.Genzo is this show's saving grace. He's presented with a cast of stock action-comedy characters (the hungry one, the money-obsessed one, the trashy vampire, etc) and stock fantasy quest setups, but his approach to problem-solving usually involves a clothesline and a submission hold. Repetition sets in at times, but its generally pretty funny, and gets all the more entertaining when Genzo starts setting up isekai wrestling tournaments. Cap it off with a plot arc that reaches a satisfying (if not entirely conclusive) conclusion within 12 episodes and you have an isekai comedy that manages to outshine the typical tired power fantasies. teleports him to another world.

I feel like they had some solid comedy in the first episode and while it's still enjoyable and comedic for the rest, it doesn't seem to make me laugh as much as the first episode, particularly suplexing the princess. It seems like the plot is kinda slow compared to other shows but it feels more natural. The MC seems to have a goal in mind but not really any plans on how to get there. He is just somewhat winging it and things...happen that sometimes get him closer to his goal of opening a pet shop, even if it's not the way he imagined he would've done it if he had a plan to begin with. Its almost a slice of life that does have a track to follow.There is a good amount of fighting in this show, albeit pretty short since it's mostly the MC catching people off guard and knocking them out for calling him Beast Killer. Its also mostly wrestling as you could guess which is somewhat unique in anime and fun to watch.Most of the characters, even the MC, seem a little shallow. Every character seems to fit some particular role and thats pretty much their whole personality. The MC loves animals and fights to protect them, there is a food glutton, there is a rather stupid and useless bitchy maid, there is the one sensible person in the group that gets mad at everyone about blowing all their money, there is the rival to the MC who comes in later, and even a werewolf that is psychologically damaged by the MC.

Like Kazuma Sato from Konosuba, he is an advocate of true gender equality and doesn't hesitate to beat some of them up using his wrestling techniques. He is pretty OP since he trained his entire life and brings a style of fighting that doesn't exist in that world which often made him look like a pervert. My favorite character is definetly Shigure who became a meme...template because of her greedy smile before she stole something. Good humor during the entire show so don't expect anything serious. template because of her greedy smile before she stole something.

The story centers around the characters actions and relationships more than their attack power or legendary weapons. If you are interested in something that pokes fun at the Isekai genre tropes, but also is grounded a tells a heartwarming story of finding the good in everyone, no matter how big or small, then ""Kemono Michi"" is the right show for you!With a diverse cast including, but not limited to: a dragon loli, a horny vampire lady, a cute puppy, and a full bestiary of fantasy...monsters who\'ve never done anything wrong in their life ever (we know this, and we love them), this anime is a great watch that introduces new characters in every episode that you are guaranteed to remember and enjoy. monsters who\'ve never done anything wrong in their life ever (we know this, and we love them), this anime is a great watch that introduces new characters in every episode that you are guaranteed to remember and enjoy.', 'It\'s kinda of interesting that the amount of enjoyment decrees through the show, although very little things changes to the start until the end. And, to be honest, this may be the great problem on this show.The first three episodes was hilarious (in a good way) and I just wanted to continue watching. Thankfully, when I discovered this anime, it was already all released, so I could watch in one shot. And this was probably the reason that I could see the decline so drasticly. As I said, the first 3 episodes was funny, interesting and full of characters with potential to grow up. The...problem is, when I was on the episode 9, I felt like nothing had change one bit. And it didn\'t.The same jokes. The same characters. The same worldbuilding. Everything was the f*cking same, to the point the became really unrealistic. For the first seven or eight episodes, someone ALWAYS said that Genzo was a ""slayer"" and everytime, he punch this people for saying this. It was funny the first three times, a little boring the next two time and, after that, I just assumed that everybody had Alzheimer. They never realised that calling him ""slayer"" pissed him off, even though he always put things very straight and clear. The same goes to the princess. Everytime Genzou took her body it was for smash her face into the ground with the butt exposed, and still she always think that he wanted to get laid or romantic with her. This was literally the first thing that happpend when they met each other and it repeats forever. His technique to put people with the ass on the top it\'s also a repetitive joke wich became old pretty fast. It was funny the first three times, but was repeated without mercy, and that is the destiny of every single joke in this anime. Everytime a new joke is make, the show keeps using again and again and again and again. The loli rival who pretends to know what Mao is talking about, the generic shounen adverture protagonist being defeat by one punch and had his sword stolen, the affair-like relationship with the Kobold wife, the PTSD werewolf, the list never end.Another thing that was ruined by the repetitiveness of the plot: The protagonist. How can I say this?... This may be one of the worst anime protagonists ever made since Philip The Kid from Cannon Busters (NETFLIX). He is pretty much moved only by his own selfishness. If he is good for another person, it\'s because the person is a furry or someone who Genzo had fought in his style. Everything else, he doesn\'t give a sh*t about. And okay, sure, this was funny on the first episodes when he doesn\'t care about the dangerous of the kingdom or when he said to abandon the vampire with the griffons, but you know why it was funny? Because we didn\'t actually thought that he was really serious about all of this! Like, it was a joke, right? If came the time to sacrifices himself for the others, even someone who he didn\'t really like, he would do it, right? He wouldn\'t be this peace of trash of a scumbag who abandon one of his ""friend"", right? Well... I don\'t really know, \'cause the more we watch, more we get the confirmation that HE REALLY DOESN\'T GIVE A D*MN F*CK FOR ANYTHING BESIDES FURRYS/PETS OR WRESTLING. Genzo doesn\'t care about the struggles of Shigure in keep the financias, doesn\'t care about the non-furry characters, almost don\'t interact friendly with the members of the guild, doesn\'t care about the possibility of the destruction of the city as well of the lives of the citizens (neither to think in a plan to stop de king of darkness without killing). It suprised me when, in the beginning, Genzo\'s agent couldn\'t care less with the disappearance of his star but, now, I\'m on his side. Screw that guy, he really isn\'t a good person.Still talking about Genzo: He doesn\'t know how to resolves ANYTHING without violence. I would like to compare him to Baki, the protagonist from the anime ""Baki"" (NETFLIX), wich it\'s a anime that I have my critics, but I legitimately like the protagonist (at least from what I could see from the five episodes that I watched). Baki is a big dude who knows how to fight as hell and is, basically, a muscle bomb. BUT... when he has a conflict that can be surpass without violence, he choose the non-violence way. Genzo is the exact opposite! Conflicts that can be resolve with a simple conversation are ended with wrestling moviment with put someone\'s head in the ground. Again, it was funny the first time but when your protagonist just knows how to resolve the problems with punchs, it become really unfunny and annoying. He, also, had one of the most fragile moral standarts I\'ve ever saw. Every little thing the people says that annoys him, Genzo DESTROYS this person without mercy. It came to the point in the episode 7 that he became so annoying and unlikeable that even the anime seems to be tired of his bullshit. He was making a problem that had already been resolved going on and on for absolute no f*cking reason besides Genzo being a annoying spoiled brat in the body of a wrestling fighter (this was how I saw him at that time).The rest of the characters is... well, whatever. Now, to be honest, it has three characters that I unironicly like. The first is Shigure, who is one of the few people who I could sympathized, that looked to me as a real person with good and bad sides but who try her best. Besides that, she is the one who puts reason on this circus and put Genzo to sit down and listen. Second is Klaus, the bank guy. I like that he doesn\'t give a f*ck about the nonsenses of Genzo, he just want to make most money as possible. Also, his smooth mood it\'s pretty nice. And the third is Mao. I honestly like his character, his suffer and frustration after Genzo disappers on his last battle and, well, his character overall. He has some nuances wich make him well more interesting then almost everybody. As a bonus, the Ant guy is the best person... being... on this show, without a doubt. He never did anything wrong. His only sin was been to perfect.The thing the most shocked me was notice that this thing was made by the same person that make ""Konosuba"". Like, WHAT?! I mean, yes, I saw the similarities right to the beginning, with the time of four people, one guy and three girls with all of them been people with very questionable morality, but the similarities stop right there. ""Konosuba"" has a huge arsenal of jokes, great interacts with the main and the non-main characters and even Kazuma being the way he is, he wasn\'t full selfish. He has some morals (not much, but still something besides himself) and you can see that, althouth he fight with his friends, Kazuma would abandon them if he knew that their life would be and real dangerous. Besides, remember the thing about Genzo doesn\'t care about his mission of save de kingdom? Kazuma didn\'t have this expectation. He is not a chosen one, he\'s a guy who had a death so mess up that the universe decides that he should have some compensation. Nobody demands his unique and precious help for the sake of the kingdom. When he saves the city, it was because he and everybody who he likes was and dangerous and even there, he wasn\'t the key piece.So, yeah, f*ck Genzo, anime moreless and repetitive. Not the worst thing that I\'ve ever watch, but I don\'t want to come back to a second season. problem is, when I was on the episode 9, I felt like nothing had change one bit. And it didn\'t.The same jokes. The same characters. The same worldbuilding. Everything was the f*cking same, to the point the became really unrealistic.

I mean, yes, I saw the similarities right to the beginning, with the time of four people, one guy and three girls with all of them been people with very questionable morality, but the similarities stop right there. ""Konosuba"" has a huge arsenal of jokes, great interacts with the main and the non-main characters and even Kazuma being the way he is, he wasn\'t full selfish. He has some morals (not much, but still something besides himself) and you can see that, althouth he fight with his friends, Kazuma would abandon them if he knew that their life would be and real dangerous. Besides, remember the thing about Genzo doesn\'t care about his mission of save de kingdom? Kazuma didn\'t have this expectation. He is not a chosen one, he\'s a guy who had a death so mess up that the universe decides that he should have some compensation. Nobody demands his unique and precious help for the sake of the kingdom. When he saves the city, it was because he and everybody who he likes was and dangerous and even there, he wasn\'t the key piece.So, yeah, f*ck Genzo, anime moreless and repetitive. Not the worst thing that I\'ve ever watch, but I don\'t want to come back to a second season.', 'Was waiting for this kind of comedy anime for looooong time.awesome for the beginning till end.It is natural comedy. you can see a lot of new things and a lot of work done on it and it is something different than other anime and different ideathe only thing is that it is only 12 episodes. i wish if it was longer.story, characters, costumes, everything is amazing.it is difficult in recent times to come up with natural comedy with different new story that is why this anime is so great.can not wait till second season. hope it comes out soon.Thank you for the great work. ', ""I'm gonna get straight to the point, the story isn't good by any stretch of the imagination (if you could even call it a story) but it has fantastic animation and fast paced engaging fight scenes with levels of intensity I've only seen in Shonen style shows whilst still injecting stupid jokes into it - regardless of the quality of the jokes the way they were slid into the most intense scenes gave them impact (they author clearly knew what they were doing), it also has cuteness and cringe in equal proportions to sooth your soul but not let you grow numb to the cuteness...as a result of whiplash of being subjected to cringy scenarios at a drop of a dime. All in all it's a show geared towards fun rather than seriousness so it is perfect for blowing of steam and relaxing - it sounds obvious to say but it's feels like it is designed specifically to captivate your attention in its entirety rather than be something you have on in the background which is exactly what a stupid and simple show is meant for! as a result of whiplash of being subjected to cringy scenarios at a drop of a dime.

The cute animals and take on how the MC focuses on them is comical but at times it was just a bit much. In all honesty I feel like I could finish this anime but at the time I did not find it interesting enough to finish. The action scenes where very animated and those were very nice, the rest was normal animation. If they were to put some more of that detail in other scenes I thing it would bring this anime...up a bit.The dog being brought was a very nice and adorable touch i must add.In all it is not a bad anime, just not one that was interesting. Maybe someday I'll pick it back up or watch with a friend. up a bit.The dog being brought was a very nice and adorable touch i must add.In all it is not a bad anime, just not one that was interesting. Maybe someday I'll pick it back up or watch with a friend."", ""In case you ask, I watched this series only because of that particular scene of the princess getting applied a german suplex getting shown in memes here and there.Story, had some potential, if this was a multiple season series, I could understand the 12 episode storyline. They had to setup the world building first and then settle down for a showdown between the main protagonist and sort of main antagonist to give a conclusion to the initial plot-drive.While there were some plot that were not explored at all, I hope it gets explored further if a new season gets green-lit.Art was great. Character drawings were...very good through the entire season. Animation wise, while there were plenty of static shots at some point, something I truly hate in anime, the fight scenes had some smooth animation. One scene in particular got me surprised for the good animation and it wasn't technically a fight scene. Genzo picked up a happy walking Carmilla and applied a hold and it looked smooth af. When you see it, you will appreciate the animation.Females in this series were quite beautiful and lovely too. You might appreciate how good the characters look.I would say, this series served as a good showdown of what the studio is capable regarding character animation.Sound wise, nothing outstanding. Just good. The OP is quite energetic a good match to the series.Characters... well, at some point a felt the characters were quite repetitive but that's part of the series. The only true development I saw in the series was in Carmilla and it was just for a short period of time. The rest stayed the same pretty much. Nothing outstanding but it was fun. I enjoyed the show pretty much because of the females, they were cute and beautiful.Enjoyment... did I enjoy it? Yes! But I consider this series just a good way to kill time. Not necessarily a show to invest yourself in, to savoir the plot, think about it or get your own conclusions. It was fine I guess... It is simply not meant to be taken seriously.So, overall? Was quite good. Did I say already that the females were cute and beautiful? Most of the fan service is delivered in a weird way, but you don't watch this show for the fan service. You watch it just to kill some time and have a chuckle here and there while enjoying one or two good fight scenes. The rest is pretty much repetitive. Is it a bad thing? Well, only if you were expecting something serious.

I know this isn’t a hot take considering the genre is oversaturated as hell these days, but I thought Kemono Michi could be different. A pro-wrestler being isekai’d into a fantasy world? That’s a gimmick I never would’ve expected. Think of all the possibilities this could have been original. Maybe even good.Although it’d be unfair to say this is just another isekai, I wouldn’t say it succeeds at what it tried to do. I expected it to at least be weird, and it certainly is ridiculous. Other than weirdness, there’s not much else. It was...funny at times, but mostly I was just bored. Between the motionless animation, repetitive comedy, and an average cast of characters, there’s not a whole lot left to enjoy.The main problem with the cast is their lack of purpose. There’s no reason for them to be together. They have no chemistry. The show begins with Genzo, the titular wrestler known as 'Animal Mask' getting summoned to fight monsters in a fantasy world. Soon after he meets Shigure, a mischievous wolf girl. She hangs around him for no reason other than her personal gain. She steals swords and armor from people Genzo beats up, then sells them at a pawn shop. As for her relationship with Genzo? She couldn’t care less about him. If he tries to start a conversation with her, she’ll say something like “not interested,” as if she read my mind. It’s funny how blunt she is, especially because she’s so relatable. She’s practically uninvolved with the action, she just does her own thing. It’s a shame the show does absolutely nothing with her (or any of the cast for that matter) because she was my favorite of the bunch. I wish she had been the protagonist, unfortunately, the one we got… kinda sucks.I couldn’t care less about Genzo. The guy is a box of rocks. He has one good personality trait, a nice animal lover. His dream is to open a pet shop, aww that’s cute—until you realize he likes animals a little too much. Recruited to slay monsters, he chooses to make friends with them instead. Rather than killing, he wrestles monsters, then forcibly pets them in a borderline fetishistic way. There’s even a side plot of wolfman who basically has PTSD from being molested by Genzo. He spends most of the show misunderstanding what people say, assaulting animals, missing social cues, and hitting people (usually his friends) rather than resolving things with words.Genzo's stupidity is played for humor, but it makes him look more like an asshole. We never hear what he’s thinking. Sometimes I wondered if Carmilla’s insult was true, that he “has a muscle where his brain should be.” Speaking of which, Carmilla has no connection to Genzo either. She sticks around for the little red-haired demon girl. I struggle to find much to say about this one. She hates demon food, so she runs away from home to eat human food. That’s about it. I don’t know why she chose to stay with Genzo.There’s not much else to add for the characters, which sucks considering they’re what the show’s about. Genzo is conceptually the glue that binds the group together. However, all he does is say/do stupid shit and the others call him an idiot. Without him, there’s nothing. They’re an awkward group of people who don’t give two shits about each other. In the first couple of episodes, the jokes are decent. Every character consistently has great overexaggerated voice acting. You can tell the actors are having fun with the script, even if the directing doesn't do them justice. Genzo’s a weird pervert, but because everyone else called him out, it was funny. This one prominent joke—and variations of it—make up the entire show. Rinse, repeat. Over time you start to wonder if there are more jokes in this show… Rinse repeat. Is there anything else? Rinse repeat. God, I’m bored.It’s hard to not compare Kemono Michi to Kononsuba. Written by the same author, there are many similarities. The cast is comprised of one dude and three girls, slapstick humor, subversion of standard isekai plots. There’s even a token ‘masochistic girl’ character, and strangely she’s blonde too. After the main characters got tiring, there wasn’t much else I cared about, aside from a few minor reoccurring characters. One of my favorites was the bear woman that crushes on Genzo because whenever he comes by he pats her fur and flatters her. She’s married too which makes it kinda scandalous in a goofy way. Eventually, it becomes a love triangle between the bear woman, her husband, and Genzo. Yes. That is the kind of show this is. Of course, it’s only a very minor long-running-joke in the show. Nothing becomes of it, but I always was happy when the show gave bear woman some screentime.Where the comedy fails the most isn’t the milquetoast, repetitive jokes. The comedic timing is almost non-existent. Most of the show is the main characters chatting it up, with jokes thrown in here or there. The mold for an average ‘joke’ in Kemono Michi goes as follows:Step 1: Girl calls Genzo an animal-loving-pervert.Step 2: Cue the default image of them arguing with some speed lines.Step 3: Cut back to whatever was happening.Step 4: (Repeat steps 1-3)If a joke fails to surprise and seemingly has no reason to be there, it’s not funny. Sad to say, the person in charge of Kemono Michi’s adaptation hasn’t heard of this basic rule of comedy. Whenever a joke is cued or a character reaction pops up, you get a lame sound effect, or sometimes nothing at all. The boring elevator background music sometimes plays straight through the jokes, nothing works right. I never expected a director to completely miss what’s supposed to make a joke funny in an anime. Even the most forgettable comedies these days don’t mess up this shit, it’s just the basics. I expected a mediocre production from this studio’s first show, and that’s what I got. Rewatching a few of the episodes dubbed (which is surprisingly pretty decent) I noticed how much art gets recycled.Watching Kemono Michi as a whole series rather than weekly is an absolute chore. They must have used the shot of the princess getting German Suplexed ten times throughout the show. If you're patient, Every two episodes there’s some nice looking sakuga. Other than that, there’s not much worth looking at. The character designs are good, but they’re simplified, and there’s not much animation at all. Even when there’s motion, it’s rarely animated with more than a series of still frames. It’s a shame because the characters would look pretty cool if they tried. They’re what you’d expect from a furry manga; the male characters are fully anthropomorphized animals, whereas the girls will just have cat ears and a tail.At best Kemono Michi is a decent time-waster. At worst it’s a tedious chore to watch. The art is average, the characters are average, the story is average, the music is average. There were a few jokes I enjoyed, until they were repeated a dozen times.

Koukaku Kidoutai: SAC_2045,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38799/Koukaku_Kidoutai__SAC_2045,"['Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2045 is not Ghost in the Shell, neither standalone, and nor is it complex. This new “installment” mirrors more the drama level of their recent ULTRAMAN anime than it does the cyberpunk classic that established itself in the past. All that is left of the original series is diluted concepts and themes to placate the infamous “Netflix audience.” Such concepts as new beings literally called “post-humans” (real creative), blatant taking of Orwell in it’s backstory of a “sustainable war” along with pertaining to modern sensibilities in referencing “one-percenters.” Everything here is a silly recreation of what the average...Netflix user would think Ghost in the Shell was about.It is unfortunate that it seems Shinji Aramaki\'s vision takes precedence over Kenji Kamiyama on this one, corrupting part of their legacy with this series. I was generally apprehensive about their previous forays in to 3DCG things of the like, and although with this the 3DCG doesn’t look that bad on the Netflix budget and can actually look quite impressive, the show still becomes lifeless both writing-wise and in action. The fight with a naked Patrick Huge, the self-insert of the character designer Ilya Kushinov along with his anime girl maid harem that look like every image he has ever drawn, is laughable on many levels. I had already guessed the whole twist that unravels in that episode in the second episode anyway, since the writing in this is action Sci-Fi and not heady cyberpunk. Ilya Kushinov the known plagiarizer, and even without that bit, is a generally average artist that attracted too much praise given his worth and  simply does not have an art style that reliably translates into GitS, especially seen in Motoko among other female characters.Getting in to the new attachments to this show, we have the introduction of a new character, Stan, nicknamed Clown. His design looks like a Fortnite character and perfectly exemplifies what it seems the creators expect from the exposure to a Netflix audience. He is brash, says the most obvious statements, and serves absolutely no purpose. Pazu and Borma are gone for the first half, the Netflix audience wouldn’t remember them anyway, and instead we have Stan. Most of the first half of the show coincidentally also takes place in America, which has apparently been united under the Empire instead of balkanized with the previous Russo-American Alliance.This whole sustainable war point simply isn’t interesting and feels like it came out of How to Design a Futuristic World 101, first take some 1984 and then make the concepts more ""modern"" hmm yes perfect. We already got a close-to-cyberpunk media that did the whole war industry thing better it\'s called Metal Gear Solid, and the person who did the soundtrack for some of the games on that is the composer for this show as well. A war industry has never been a new concept, and here it is surface level as hell. It even makes itself really obvious what the whole political implications are in the first scene of the show. You’ve got the new GHOST merc group under Motoko and Batou getting chased by “sustainable war victims” in dingy trucks and it just serves as a mindless car chase action scene that gives the little info dump about how The World Be. Then, across the next 3 episodes you will be treated to more car chase scenes which take up the main attraction of the episodes. They really cash in on this mainstream audience they’ll be getting by abandoning what made SAC actually interesting and turning it into stupid action backed up by a hackneyed mystery about “post-humans” (doesn’t even make that much sense given the existence of cyberbrains already inhabiting that concept and all that but who cares amirite) who are just cyborgs that downloaded aimbot and they decide to center the whole show around investigating these people.There’s this part in one of the episodes where we get the whole virtual chatroom bit, Togusa is watching four disguised guys talk about GHOST so he can get info on them and one of the guys leaves the chatroom, Togusa intercepts him and FLYING PUNCHES him in the VIRTUAL WORLD to STEAL HIS DISGUISE. You cannot make this stupid shit up, none of this shit feels like the Cyberpunk world of the original series despite this supposed to be taking place EVEN MORE into the future. In the end one can’t help but wonder, what is there for anyone to get out of this except for those who have never seen Ghost in the Shell, that being the Netflix Audience? There is nothing, and even if you have not seen Ghost in the Shell, just watch the movies (not Arise not Arise not Arise not Arise), and the SAC show.And I swear to Allah If I have to see that stupid ass pink haired woman and her moe anime girl idiotic mannerisms one more time alongside her generic dime a dozen kushinov face fuck you ilya kushinov you absolute hack draw a new face for once(end rant) Netflix user would think Ghost in the Shell was about.It is unfortunate that it seems Shinji Aramaki\'s vision takes precedence over Kenji Kamiyama on this one, corrupting part of their legacy with this series.

In fact, the characters design and animation in my opinion are on a level which could be accepted decades ago. It seemed to me a lot like ""Appleseed"", for example, just way too late.If you ARE a GITS enthusiast, please consider it a super-cheap (was it really inexpensive to make?) spin-off show. Watch it only if, like me, you want to fathom the...abyss of poor quality where a franchise can fall, even after masterpieces that defined its genre.I regret some of the original creators accepted to get involved with such a low quality show; I hope they got a good lot of cash from a certain company which has a lot of money and very few ideas (often bad), because I\'m sure they lost the respect of many enthusiasts including myself.As an anime fan in general, I felt offended by the extremely poor quality of this show, and I only stood the pain of watching it in order to update my definition of ""poor"".Enjoy (perhaps some other show) abyss of poor quality where a franchise can fall, even after masterpieces that defined its genre.I regret some of the original creators accepted to get involved with such a low quality show; I hope they got a good lot of cash from a certain company which has a lot of money and very few ideas (often bad), because I\'m sure they lost the respect of many enthusiasts including myself.As an anime fan in general, I felt offended by the extremely poor quality of this show, and I only stood the pain of watching it in order to update my definition of ""poor"".Enjoy (perhaps some other show)', ""Can CGI ruin a show? Yes. Does it here? Thank goodness no, at least not for me.Ghost in the Shell is a lengthy franchise spanning over decades with at least four different art styles. However, while all of the previous art styles until now were in 2D animation, they decided that they should try a CGI approach. Many will skip over this season because of it, but if that is the only reason, then it is a huge mistake. Despite the animation, all of the characters remain the same and the story feels very similar to SAC previous seasons. So how does it match...up?SAC (stand alone complex) is what these seasons do: There are stand alone episodes and there are complex (like an arc) episodes. The complex episodes progress the story while the stand alone episodes progress the characters development. This season starts with a complex arc of six episodes about the emergence of post-humans (super smart and strong humans) and the majors (Mokoto Kusanagi) team being forced to take him down by the American government. Then, there are a couple of stand alone episodes when they return to Japan that showcase the characters of Batou, Togusa, and the new character Purin Ezaki individually. Then there is another complex three episode arc involving another post-human case in Japan but slightly different. Then it stops at a massive cliffhanger which will be resolved in the next season.While the episodes were all great, I am not a fan of the seasons being split up like this, but I take what I can get.To talk about the elephant in the room: the art. This will severely prevent a multitude of people of enjoying this season, but that is only because they won't give it a chance. The CGI is very well done for Japan TV standards. It isn't as good as something like Frozen but it is still decent enough to not be too distracting. The character models are great and very closely resemble the original models. The fight choreography is outstanding and the backgrounds, while not the best, are still serviceable. My main problem with the art was the faces of characters. A lot of times that there should have been emotion on faces, there just wasn't. It is hard to accomplish it in CGI but nevertheless they didn't accomplish it. But the art for the OP was phenomenal.The music was okay...or at least when there was music. While the OP was decent and the ED slightly better, there was rarely any music in the actual show. In the first episode there was a great jazzy instrumentally track which got my hopes up, but after that there was barely any BGM at all. It is sad especially considering that Yoko Kanno did the original SAC OST and it is still known to be one of the best soundtracks of all time. The voice acting was all good. I would have preferred the English dub, especially since the original dub cast returned to reprise thir roles, but unfortunately the dub release was delayed due to Covid19.The characters are all the same as previous seasons with the addition of Kenjiro Tsuda, an American agent in the first arc but who then leaves (he might be relevant in the second season) and Purin Ezaki in the second arc who was the comic relief and an enjoyably cute and silly character. Togusa goes through some development as well. The Tachikomas are amazing as usual but they have slightly less screen time than they did in the previous seasons. There isn't yet a main villain that we have met yet, but the puzzle pieces are building up and hopefully can actually pull off a great reveal in the next season. The major is a boss, like usual.I enjoyed this season a lot, and I would recommend it even to people who haven't seen previous seasons or movies. The pacing is fantastic and thrilling while the story keeps building mystery and great development.My main issue with the season, not including art or sound, is that this season plays it safe. Ghost in the Shell is known for utilizing thought provoking themes which helped it stand out throughout the decades, but this season hasn't really done that yet. The last arc was close, but didn't fully succeed to hit the usual franchise marks.It went for a more Hollywood style, lots of fights, but very rarely any serious internal conflicts or thought provoking ideas.Overall, this season was great. Better than what I expected. Hopefully the second season is as good or better and can properly tie up all of the loose threads that were leftover after this season.Score: 9 (Very good and rewatchable, but not good enough to do so very often). up?SAC (stand alone complex) is what these seasons do: There are stand alone episodes and there are complex (like an arc) episodes. The complex episodes progress the story while the stand alone episodes progress the characters development. This season starts with a complex arc of six episodes about the emergence of post-humans (super smart and strong humans) and the majors (Mokoto Kusanagi) team being forced to take him down by the American government. Then, there are a couple of stand alone episodes when they return to Japan that showcase the characters of Batou, Togusa, and the new character Purin Ezaki individually. Then there is another complex three episode arc involving another post-human case in Japan but slightly different.

Arise was a massive misstep though but it's in a different timeline from the other ones so I can avoid talking much about this though.So whilst I saw a lot of negative reception towards the trailers for this new edition of Stand Alone Complex or SAC_2045, it didn't really hinder my excitement too much. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but still...excited just to get more solid quality Ghost in the Shell content.Now that I've officially finished the first season of SAC_2045, I can say that this show truly was a mediocre and forgettable showing overall and was clearly designed for mainly the newer Western audiences in terms of the direction of the storyline and even the visuals themselves as a sort of a cash grab from the looks of things. It somehow fell below my low expectations for it.The story for the most part without spoiling anything was pretty underwhelming for Ghost in the Shell standards, but okay for the most part. It's not really thematically fascinating but at least has enough action and twists to make some of the portions seem exciting for me. The narrative wasn't too interesting but it was paced fairly well and had solid buildup progressively, with a big cliffhanger by the end that left enough meat on the bone for me to have some intrigue left for its next season.Regarding the characters, I felt this was the aspect that disappointed me the most from what I expected.Motoko Kusanagi is one of my favorite characters of all time so seeing her be treated like more of a side character for the most part in this season was pretty disheartening. Her inner thoughts and narratives always fascinated me when seeing the previous shows so the lack of that definitely was a turn off for me. Besides, whenever she was on-screen, she was underwhelming to watch here and never really was compelling or interesting to watch unlike other editions of her (besides Arise since she was annoying there). The other main characters though in the show were solid, especially Togusa in this show. And the tachikomas were fun as usual.However, the other characters weren't too compelling at all, and haven't really added anything to the show so far at least for this season.Now, the visuals. I've seen a LOT of people discredit the visuals for being fully CG, and looking like an old video game from the PS2/PSP days; and to be honest, I'm not particularly against that for a franchise like GitS on paper.The visuals for the action is a bit awkward with its CG nature but it easily could have been much worse than it turned out to be. Battles while PS2 game-like, were smooth enough while not being too janky and rough to watch. The characters looked pretty rough though (Motoko looks way too young, and some others look like wax figures). Some of the animation even outside action sequences were pretty bad to look at and inconsistent/awkward too (like when characters are walking or drinking).I will say Kushivnov has good art in general, but it's hard to translate his art amazingly into CG. And whilst its not bad overall, you can notice some of the obvious consequences for the awkward transition for the most part.For people that were turned off by the visuals in the trailers, this full show won't change their minds. Especially considering how phenomenal the original edition looked from character designs, to action and everything else about it,The sound was probably the worst part of the show for me. The opening and ending songs just don't fit Ghost in the Shell whatsoever (especially the opening for being way too jazzy and upbeat in an environment that's supposed to be more intense and subtle). We went from having some of the best opening songs of all time in Inner Universe from season 1 and Rise from season 2 (rest in peace Origa), to this really annoying song by millenium parade that should be absolutely nowhere near a franchise like this. Disappointing as hell.This also correlates to some of the soundtracks as they just feel out of place in this environment. At least the voice acting was still okay but far from the top-tier standards that the original GitS set for sure.This definitely isn't a great showing from Production IG and Sola Digital Arts as the show came off more as a cash grab like I mentioned than a proper sequel to one of the best anime of all time. Some aspects felt incredibly phoned in, and the visuals are a turn off for many, many people that it ruins the opportunities for this show to succeed with a majority of the audience, including other big Ghost in the Shell fans. This could have been great, but it'll remain a show that just looks massively inferior to the original rather than stand out on its own.At least it's still better than Arise. excited just to get more solid quality Ghost in the Shell content.Now that I've officially finished the first season of SAC_2045, I can say that this show truly was a mediocre and forgettable showing overall and was clearly designed for mainly the newer Western audiences in terms of the direction of the storyline and even the visuals themselves as a sort of a cash grab from the looks of things.

(Ilya I\'m sorry to say this but if this was one of your ideas it was not the brightest...) I defenitely would love to see it in 2D or even 2.5D even with some of the details that bother me (especially Batou/Borma eyes), and you managed to do something this bad? I mean, for real? You had for sure a fucking big budget to make a huge series and you prefered to use it in motion capture and fucking 3D? No i don\'t accept that, just no. This could have been a good saver for the Stand Alone Complex Run that I didn\'t like from the begining with the ""sub-episodic"" episodes they had with the over exagerated ammount of fillers, but this can be even worst than that in my opinion!If you ask me the best scene is the fucking ending and it\'s still was able to be not so good!

I don\'t know about all of you but I like to have some backstory about what happend before the events that are taking place here (Even though I know that the premises of Ghost In The Shell is to be a little unkown, it really made me enjoy the Arise run of the franchise even more than the original movie!):It was suprising to see fucking Togusa out of fucking nowhere divorcing, getting a new haircut, not to mention that we know that in Solid State Society he got prostethics that we don\'t know what they are and the fucking kung lee karate moves at the almost fucking end of the series?! Where did he learn them, WHY did he learn them, WHY THE FUCK DID HE DIVORCED AND WHAT JOB DID HE TAKE FOR 2 FUCKING YEARS? He is one of THE essential characters to move the plot of the Stand Alone Complex series and you weren\'t able to give us some information about what happend about him? I can\'t allow that!Furthermore, why the other fucking gang going out of japan and going to work for a private security company in the US from all places alongside some newcomer that you\'re gonna ditch after 4 eps, NOT TO MENTION THE EVENTS OF SOLID STATE SOCIETY? WHAT HAPPEND AFTER IT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IT LET US ON A CLIFFHANGER! It\'s just not deep enough for me to give a shit!Also, what the fuck happend to borma and Paz? Hello? Don\'t they exist here? At least in Arise they gave em a little of a spotlight, they almost didn\'t get the change to talk in the whole series here (I\'m pretty sure Paz didn\'t talk and Borma talked like 2 lines of dialogue max)! What did they do in these two years? What\'s with the new eyes of borma? Why paz changed haircut?

With that said, I’m not the kind of delicate elitist who holds great reverence for their favorites and their position as such. The idea of a new installment coming along over a decade since its last and suddenly outclassing all which came before it is not something I particularly begrudge or fear. Projects the likes\xa0of FLCL Alternative where the original creators are publicly decrying the grossly corporatist nature of the production are one thing, but in the case of SAC_2045, the original staff...is still thoroughly involved with the creative process and still very passionate about the work they’re doing, even if said work is wildly different than the original content in both style and substance. I would never dream of taking a cynical eye to something just to eliminate it as a competitor and preserve my favorites, nor, however, would I let these particular geniuses’ old masterpieces cloud my critical judgement and forget the fact those works were good because they were good, not because I wanted them to be good.If there’s one thing this review needs to make crystal clear, it’s the stark reality Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 is not in any noticeable way directed by Kenji Kamiyama, and is instead directed by Shinji Aramaki. Shinji Aramaki, CCO and Director of Operations at Sola Digital Arts, the Production IG subsidiary studio which handled the animation production of SAC_2045, is a legendary mecha designer who’s reputation needs no introduction and who’s been at the forefront of CG animation direction since before the turn of the century. While this all may sound like the beginnings of high praise, I personally think Aramaki is better suited a visual artist than a director. The action direction of SAC_2045 is almost exactly that of Aramaki’s Starship Troopers films, which are little more than shoot’em-up Hollywood action flicks, and while this may seem like a nitpick of relative unimportance given the fact Stand Alone Complex was never really about the action itself—despite housing the most technically proficient police procedural and military action animation you can find in TV anime—this iteration of the story very much is, and this stands regardless of the fact Kamiyama reprised his role as writer. In an interview with Newtype USA in 2007, Kamiyama had said he believes himself to work best in the art of filling out the details of a work structured by someone else as opposed to creating a work from scratch and having to write the rules himself. If we’re to ignore the masterful work he was to do in the future with Eden of the East and take this cute little piece of self-deprecation at face value, we can really appreciate why a world and setting as deeply profound with ideas yet so utterly under-explored by its original creator as Ghost in the Shell would end up being a perfect fit for his craft, because he can take this tiny eleven chapter manga rife with conceptual gold it didn’t give itself the time to fully unpack and unpack it as beautifully and brilliantly as he possibly could, seeing as the groundwork was already in place to support his visionary expansion. And it's this perfect balance which he himself seems to recognize which leaves me so baffled by the direction he took SAC_2045. Artificial Intelligence, or “Post-Humans” as they are called, are the focus of SAC_2045, because even though Stand Alone Complex and 2nd GIG seemed to suggest the original idea of the cyberbrain itself to yield infinite facets of thematic and conceptual exploration, apparently this was not the case after all, and a new central concept was necessary to continue the story. Assuming I think the story even needed to be continued at all—which I do not—why he would choose something so cliche and overused to science fiction as rampant AI, I have no living idea. The Post Human plot line and its borderline post-apocalyptic setting can be more cheesy than a series this adult-oriented ever had any business getting and ultimately serves as little more than a stage for increasingly tensionless action sequences of Section 9 squaring off against largely uncharismatic villains.While Aramaki is credited on both SAC_2045 and Ultraman (2019) with ample episode direction and storyboarding credits, Kamiyama isn’t on either, on either. The writing, on the other hand, actually does feel like his old handiwork, and keeping in mind this man wrote three of the greatest anime ever made, this is actually something of a problem. Everyone who’s ever worked with Kamiyama in the past has corroborated the fact he has always has been the man with the plan, literally, and Stand Alone Complex is the height of the Ghost in the Shell franchise thanks to his brilliant writing. Mamoru Oshii’s 1995 adaptation of Ghost in the Shell is the only iteration of the anime based on a hard source material, since Innocence was entirely written and conceptualized by Oshii, Arise was pitched by Kazuchika Kise and scripted by Tow Ubukata, and Stand Alone Complex was completely conceptualized by Kamiyama and written in cooperation with Shōtarō Suga. These renditions of the story reflecting the sensibilities of their authors so directly makes perfect sense too, seeing as Innocence is a sophisticated study in abstruse philosophy and Arise is an internally flawed mess which puts style over substance with every idea it has, but what doesn’t make so much sense is while Stand Alone Complex is most certainly an exploration of technology befitting the brain which birthed it, it’s also a consistently mature and unflinchingly realistic character drama which takes an originally goofy cast and molds them not into Oshii’s cold realists or Ubukata’s undefined enigmas, but into complex and resonant human beings. Therefore, it’s not unreasonable to think this nuanced yet intensely necessary facet of the series may or may not’ve been the work of Kamiyama himself, because among the many names I just unapologetically tossed your way is Shōtarō Suga. Shōtarō Suga was the co-writer for all three masterpieces the now-legendary Kamiyama Team made back in their glory days with the fullcore Production IG animation staff, and the more Kamiyama makes nowadays, the more I feel Suga to’ve been way more necessary to the beating heart behind his works than anyone could’ve ever imagined. After Kamiyama more or less disbanded the team, they actually reconvened at PA Works in 2013. Written by Suga and directed by co-director of all three of the Kamiyama classics, Masayuki Yoshihara, The Eccentric Family was masterpiece as clever as it was touching, and it was backed by the gorgeous backgrounds of Takeda Yūsuke, the team’s IG art director who followed them over. What I’m getting at here is Stand Alone Complex, Guardian of the Sacred Spirit, and Eden of the East were very clearly a team effort. Yoshihara brought the iconic cinema, Suga brought the deep human element, and Kamiyama brought the mountains of themes and concepts to make them all worthwhile, and now that he’s the only one on staff, it feels like the human pyramid of geniuses fell apart, and the potential masterpiece status of the show crumbled along with it.Since there’s no getting around it, I guess it’s time to address the elephant in the room. Now, whether I take care of this elephant with a painless tranquilizer dart or as many shells from a sawed-off shotgun as it takes is simply a matter of bias, and seeing as I aim to generally adopt the neutral opinion, “good CG is good, and bad CG is bad,” I’ll try my hand at playing the Devil’s advocate. While SAC_2045 very much outclasses its team’s prior work with Ultraman (2019), it is by no means of a quality worthy of the Ghost in the Shell franchise which has set every bar of animation as high as it still is decades later. Ultimately, SAC_2045 is crafted with all the love, care, and attention to detail in the world, it’s just not done with the prettiest of visuals or the most faithful of art design. The set design is passable, but the foreground and background sometimes mesh together awkwardly because everything is 3D, and outside the realm of digital grunge effects, little texture is added to anything which makes this all the more noticeable. Such a drab overtone to the series in darker scenes does it little favors in the visual flair department since the cinematography left much to be desired, even with Aramaki’s endless frenetic action which itself is completely divorced from the realistic and highly researched action direction of SAC and 2nd GIG. The visual direction is just semi-random camera rotations and swivels with little to no dramatic timing to speak of, so if you’re looking for cyberpunk action, this show will deliver, but if you’re looking for the thematically laced, contemplatively formulated shots of brilliance you’d come to expect from the original series with only rare and down-to-earth action, you will find yourself disappointed. Physically speaking, the CG animation looks legitimately incredible, with precise shadow placement, anatomically weighty physics, and the most intricately shaded body definition in any CG TV anime I’ve ever seen, but graphically speaking the show is, at best, distractingly untextured with great depth of color only wherever you can find said color, and at worst, utterly outdated and with coloration as a mere afterthought to the director if not the colorists. And speaking of unevenly poppy coloration, the character designs are just about as hectic as you can get. The male designs are loosely okay, with only a few characters like poor old Togusa receiving unflattering transitions into the world of 3DCG, but the female designs are downright insulting. To be frank, they just look like anime sex dolls. As thoroughly sexualized as Motoko is in all but Oshii’s iterations, though, no anime adaptation of Ghost in the Shell has yet to reach even a fraction of the sex appeal and exploitation found in the original manga, so when all is said and done, you can only really complain about this point so much before sounding like an ignorant hypocrite. Still, one could only hope an icon of feminine badassery and empowerment would not’ve looked like she belonged on a dirty dakimakura.Despite the fact I’ve done little but act like the obtusely picky bitch I am, I did, believe it or not, seriously enjoy SAC_2045, if not as deeply as I dreamed I would’ve. It’s so hard being as rotten as I am, because you’re always left with so much more criticism than praise no matter what you’re consuming, even if whatever it is gives you more than enough delight to gush over. I mean, I simply cannot put into words how happy it made me feel to see Kamiyama so perfectly recapture Batou’s dynamic with the Major; how proud I was to verify he still has a complete and total mastery of his intelligent dialogue which is incessantly relevant to his clever theming; how timely and smart of an idea the Sustainable War setup is, even if I dislike the over-the-top setting which it fostered; how the choppy direction is only really prevalent in martial combat sequences, and dialogue scenes are as engaging as they’ve ever been; how Shinji Aramaki—if nothing else—knows exactly how to use 3D animation to its fullest extent in every way; how gratifying it was to hear all the original voice actors and actresses reprise their roles as if not a day had passed since they’re last recording; how crisply produced and just downright cool the music is despite being no Yoko Kanno score and absolutely failing to recapture her atmosphere; or how much I absolutely die over every word out of Sakiko Tamagawa’s mouth. But ultimately, I’ll always distract myself with the gripes, be they utterly retarded quibbles or legitimate pieces of valuable criticism. I can complain about an anime I’ve given a nine point nine as much as I can complain about an anime I’ve given a one, and while this can be chalked up to frustration over the fact X would be perfect if not for Y aspect of it, the fact remains my potential for whining stands just as tall in either case. Sure, “high hopes, low expectations,” right? But there’s still no saving me from comparison. No matter how detached I force myself to be, the original series will always be there, and when that original series is my favorite anime of all time, that comparison will never find satisfaction. So ultimately, this review is going to conclude itself advising you not to take it to heart. What I’ve compiled in the previous paragraphs is a list of complaints found only on the barest surface levels and the most fastidiously deep levels, and nowhere in between. It’s a list which explains not why a show is bad, but why a show isn’t literally better than or as good as the best anime ever made. Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 is undeniably an unnecessary sequel at its core, its questionable appearance will offend and enrage fans more radical than I, and its position at the end of a franchise newcomers perceive to be impenetrably large will leave it likely unattractive to them as well, but it is—and this is true—good, and I recommend it to anyone able to stomach their preconceived notions of beautiful animation and biased comparisons to the godly work which came before.Thank you for reading. is still thoroughly involved with the creative process and still very passionate about the work they’re doing, even if said work is wildly different than the original content in both style and substance. I would never dream of taking a cynical eye to something just to eliminate it as a competitor and preserve my favorites, nor, however, would I let these particular geniuses’ old masterpieces cloud my critical judgement and forget the fact those works were good because they were good, not because I wanted them to be good.If there’s one thing this review needs to make crystal clear, it’s the stark reality Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 is not in any noticeable way directed by Kenji Kamiyama, and is instead directed by Shinji Aramaki. Shinji Aramaki, CCO and Director of Operations at Sola Digital Arts, the Production IG subsidiary studio which handled the animation production of SAC_2045, is a legendary mecha designer who’s reputation needs no introduction and who’s been at the forefront of CG animation direction since before the turn of the century. While this all may sound like the beginnings of high praise, I personally think Aramaki is better suited a visual artist than a director. The action direction of SAC_2045 is almost exactly that of Aramaki’s Starship Troopers films, which are little more than shoot’em-up Hollywood action flicks, and while this may seem like a nitpick of relative unimportance given the fact Stand Alone Complex was never really about the action itself—despite housing the most technically proficient police procedural and military action animation you can find in TV anime—this iteration of the story very much is, and this stands regardless of the fact Kamiyama reprised his role as writer. In an interview with Newtype USA in 2007, Kamiyama had said he believes himself to work best in the art of filling out the details of a work structured by someone else as opposed to creating a work from scratch and having to write the rules himself. If we’re to ignore the masterful work he was to do in the future with Eden of the East and take this cute little piece of self-deprecation at face value, we can really appreciate why a world and setting as deeply profound with ideas yet so utterly under-explored by its original creator as Ghost in the Shell would end up being a perfect fit for his craft, because he can take this tiny eleven chapter manga rife with conceptual gold it didn’t give itself the time to fully unpack and unpack it as beautifully and brilliantly as he possibly could, seeing as the groundwork was already in place to support his visionary expansion. And it's this perfect balance which he himself seems to recognize which leaves me so baffled by the direction he took SAC_2045. Artificial Intelligence, or “Post-Humans” as they are called, are the focus of SAC_2045, because even though Stand Alone Complex and 2nd GIG seemed to suggest the original idea of the cyberbrain itself to yield infinite facets of thematic and conceptual exploration, apparently this was not the case after all, and a new central concept was necessary to continue the story. Assuming I think the story even needed to be continued at all—which I do not—why he would choose something so cliche and overused to science fiction as rampant AI, I have no living idea. The Post Human plot line and its borderline post-apocalyptic setting can be more cheesy than a series this adult-oriented ever had any business getting and ultimately serves as little more than a stage for increasingly tensionless action sequences of Section 9 squaring off against largely uncharismatic villains.While Aramaki is credited on both SAC_2045 and Ultraman (2019) with ample episode direction and storyboarding credits, Kamiyama isn’t on either, on either. The writing, on the other hand, actually does feel like his old handiwork, and keeping in mind this man wrote three of the greatest anime ever made, this is actually something of a problem. Everyone who’s ever worked with Kamiyama in the past has corroborated the fact he has always has been the man with the plan, literally, and Stand Alone Complex is the height of the Ghost in the Shell franchise thanks to his brilliant writing. Mamoru Oshii’s 1995 adaptation of Ghost in the Shell is the only iteration of the anime based on a hard source material, since Innocence was entirely written and conceptualized by Oshii, Arise was pitched by Kazuchika Kise and scripted by Tow Ubukata, and Stand Alone Complex was completely conceptualized by Kamiyama and written in cooperation with Shōtarō Suga. These renditions of the story reflecting the sensibilities of their authors so directly makes perfect sense too, seeing as Innocence is a sophisticated study in abstruse philosophy and Arise is an internally flawed mess which puts style over substance with every idea it has, but what doesn’t make so much sense is while Stand Alone Complex is most certainly an exploration of technology befitting the brain which birthed it, it’s also a consistently mature and unflinchingly realistic character drama which takes an originally goofy cast and molds them not into Oshii’s cold realists or Ubukata’s undefined enigmas, but into complex and resonant human beings. Therefore, it’s not unreasonable to think this nuanced yet intensely necessary facet of the series may or may not’ve been the work of Kamiyama himself, because among the many names I just unapologetically tossed your way is Shōtarō Suga. Shōtarō Suga was the co-writer for all three masterpieces the now-legendary Kamiyama Team made back in their glory days with the fullcore Production IG animation staff, and the more Kamiyama makes nowadays, the more I feel Suga to’ve been way more necessary to the beating heart behind his works than anyone could’ve ever imagined. After Kamiyama more or less disbanded the team, they actually reconvened at PA Works in 2013. Written by Suga and directed by co-director of all three of the Kamiyama classics, Masayuki Yoshihara, The Eccentric Family was masterpiece as clever as it was touching, and it was backed by the gorgeous backgrounds of Takeda Yūsuke, the team’s IG art director who followed them over. What I’m getting at here is Stand Alone Complex, Guardian of the Sacred Spirit, and Eden of the East were very clearly a team effort.

This.Ghost in the Shell SAC_2045 is yet another attempt to cash in on the ever so popular Ghost in the Shell franchise. Based on the 2002 Stand Alone Complex series, this installment is meant to be a continuation to 2nd gig, once again following the hardened, no-nonsense folks over at Section 9 as they attempt to uncover and resolve yet another crime. This time concerning the rise of posthumans, cybernetically engineered humans that are capable of possessing super strength and limbs that can explode heads with one single swing. When it was announced, the fanfare was tremendous....It would be produced by the same studio, Production IG, with CGI provided by Sola DigitalArts, the same guys behind the Ultraman anime. Kenji Kamiyama, the director for all the Stand Alone Complex installments, was also announced to return to the director’s chair, albeit being paired up with Ultraman director, Shinji Aramaki. It also brought back the original voice cast for the dub and was advertised as a true sequel to the SAC universe rather than just a reimagining. Needless to say, it had a lot to live up to as a sequel.Now, let’s get down to the elephant in the room: the CGI. Holey Moley, it’s really subpar. Not Berserk 2016 levels of horrible, but it’s done poorly enough that you sort of feel your eyes starting to bleed, but not to the point where they’re constantly shedding that scarlet liquid of yours. Every single character looks rubbery like they’re more akin to toys than actual people. It feels almost as if Sola DigitalArts rendered the entire series through a ps2 rather than using their “cutting edge” CGI technology to make the aesthetic easy on the eyes at least. There’s a reason why CGI is so prominent in the anime industry: it’s cheap, efficient, able to animate large crowds or more complex models in a smoother and fluid momentum. And in a way, that’s not exactly a bad thing. Studio Orange, for instance, did a wonderful job animating Beastars, using a mixture of 2D and CG animation to enhance the movements and facial expressions of various anthropomorphic animals. It was a series that needed 3DCG because of how difficult and costly it was to animate such characters, and in a way, the Ghost in the Shell franchise has used CGI a lot in the past due to how prominent technology is in the series, so it isn’t exactly breaking new ground with it. But, in Ghost in the Shell 2045, they just feel awkward to look at. The fluidity is on point, but the models are so subpar it’s almost like you’re watching a video game cutscene from the early 2000s. I don’t understand why the series couldn’t use a mixture of 2D and 3D animation like they had done for the original 2002 anime. The CG in that still holds up relatively well to this day, so why not build on it? There’s been worse CGI anime out there, but that doesn’t mean that the one used in this show is exempt from any sort of criticism.The actual story itself doesn’t fare any better either. At times, 2045 does feel like it has got a bit of the flair from the original with some of the later, more standalone episodes, though it appears scattered and somewhat confused as to what it wants to be. The first half of the series amounts to just some random series of action sequences like something straight out of a Michael Bay production, with government agents from America even making an appearance here and there. Then later on it just decides to be a politically focused, sci-fi series that explores certain themes and concepts in a cyberpunk world, kind of building on what the original Stand Alone Complex series initially started. In layman’s terms: it starts off wanting to be Metal Gear Solid, then decides it wants to continue the legacy of Ghost in the Shell. Even if it did, it just doesn’t feel the same. Ghost in the Shell has always been a series focused on the perils of technology, how it can be taken advantage of and how living in a world full of androids and cybernetic organisms actually kind of sucks. It’s a show where the worldbuilding is the center of attention, and aside from one episode (which is just so overly comedic and asinine that it doesn’t even feel connected to the world), none of this anime really feels at home with the universe it had set up. The idea of posthumans being created through some sort of tear gas is already ridiculous in it of itself, especially given the more realistic approach to a cyberpunk world that Ghost in the Shell has a huge reputation for, rather than the idealized and magical one that existed in something like Deus Ex. It’s also too political and not in any way philosophical, while the original series uses both to tell a well-realized story.But I haven’t gotten to the worst bit yet. The characters, good god the characters. Every semblance of dignity and badassery of Section 9 has almost been stripped bare. Major Kusanagi now has hax magical abilities similar to Adam Jenson from the Deus Ex games and her role in the series feels a lot more underutilized. There was so much that the creators did with her in the original Stand Alone Complex series, showcasing all her various hacking capabilities and the ways she approaches certain missions. Here, she just shows up to bust some cyborg’s heads open in hand to hand combat, I mean cmon, there’s so much else you could have used this character for. Togusa is now a professional martial artist and apparently very addicted to Bruce Lee movies with the way he makes goofy Kung-Fu noises every time he fights. Also, he’s divorced here and is no longer a family man. Yup, you heard it right, the guy who based much of his work around protecting his wife and daughter is no longer with them. Gone is the most human character in the entire Ghost in the Shell cast. Pazu and Bulma pretty much take a backseat to the other characters, making me wonder why the heck they were even brought back in the first place. Pazu doesn’t even have any lines for Pete’s sake.The show also brings in two new characters onboard. First on the list is Standard, a cocky, way-in-over-his-head soldier that tags along with the recently disbanded Section 9 during the earlier episodes. Ever so constantly, he’s proven to be useless, always getting himself tangled in a knot during firefights and always relying on Major and the team to get him out of dodge. To make matters even worse, halfway through the series, he just disappears. He says his goodbyes and never appears again. I’m baffled by the decision to even include this character if he’s just going to be out of the casting list for the latter half of the series. What a complete waste of a character. And his absence brings in another member of the team, a pink-haired, upbeat, waifu-bait by the name of Purin. And she gets on my nerves a lot. She’s basically what happens when you add a generic anime girl from one of those pesky light novel adaptations into the Ghost in the Shell universe, and it looks so out of place. Her poor attempts at comedy just come across as awkward and too over the top. Granted, she provides more usage to the plot than Standard, but her constant boy scout personality just undermines the serious and mature tone that the franchise has established. The show already has the tachikomas, we don’t need a human version of them in the mix. Oh, and as for the supporting cast, we even have a government agent named John Smith who even looks like a typical agent character with a black suit, shades, and a voice that just screams to you that he’s a villain. Man, for a show that was already ripped off by The Matrix, it certainly decided it wanted to copy Agent Smith from that franchise as well. What a turnaround.Also, what’s with all the corniness? Seriously, 2045 feels like an outright parody of the entire Stand Alone Complex franchise with some of the decisions made. There’s a self-insert posthuman character that resembles the character artist, Ilya Kuvshinov, that spends a majority of his screentime stark naked and performing back handstands like he’s some sort of circus performer. It was so unintentionally hilarious that twitter melded it into a meme. There’re also other elements that just have no place in an anime that’s supposed to be a serious reflection of a dark, gritty, and politically charged cyberpunk society. In one episode, Purin comes face to face with an avatar that resembles a Nintendo mascot, with a CGI goldfish for a face, big lips, and an outfit that looks like it was stolen from King Dedede’s wardrobe. And that was after she got nearly assaulted by a partially naked fat guy. Not to mention, one of the masterminds behind the attacks is a child who spends half his time buried in video games. Given how surprisingly dark the show gets after the halfway mark, it’s astounding that such designs and choices even exist.What on earth was Kenji Kamiyama thinking? He’s pretty much tarnished the reputation of Ghost in the Shell for good now. Aside from keeping Batou’s dignity intact, including more scenes with the adorable Tachikomas, and showcasing Ilya Kuvshinov’s talent as an artist (seriously, his design for the Major is simply perfect), nothing about 2045 works whatsoever. This was basically the final nail in the coffin. I don’t know who to put the blame on, him or Shinji Aramaki, but nevertheless, this is a terrible sequel that ruins everything that made Ghost in the Shell a masterpiece. It would be produced by the same studio, Production IG, with CGI provided by Sola DigitalArts, the same guys behind the Ultraman anime. Kenji Kamiyama, the director for all the Stand Alone Complex installments, was also announced to return to the director’s chair, albeit being paired up with Ultraman director, Shinji Aramaki.

Seriously, 2045 feels like an outright parody of the entire Stand Alone Complex franchise with some of the decisions made. There’s a self-insert posthuman character that resembles the character artist, Ilya Kuvshinov, that spends a majority of his screentime stark naked and performing back handstands like he’s some sort of circus performer. It was so unintentionally hilarious that twitter melded it into a meme. There’re also other elements that just have no place in an anime that’s supposed to be a serious reflection of a dark, gritty, and politically charged cyberpunk society. In one episode, Purin comes face to face with an avatar that resembles a Nintendo mascot, with a CGI goldfish for a face, big lips, and an outfit that looks like it was stolen from King Dedede’s wardrobe. And that was after she got nearly assaulted by a partially naked fat guy. Not to mention, one of the masterminds behind the attacks is a child who spends half his time buried in video games. Given how surprisingly dark the show gets after the halfway mark, it’s astounding that such designs and choices even exist.What on earth was Kenji Kamiyama thinking? He’s pretty much tarnished the reputation of Ghost in the Shell for good now. Aside from keeping Batou’s dignity intact, including more scenes with the adorable Tachikomas, and showcasing Ilya Kuvshinov’s talent as an artist (seriously, his design for the Major is simply perfect), nothing about 2045 works whatsoever. This was basically the final nail in the coffin. I don’t know who to put the blame on, him or Shinji Aramaki, but nevertheless, this is a terrible sequel that ruins everything that made Ghost in the Shell a masterpiece.', 'I never thought I would ever see a new installment of ""Stand Alone Complex"" in this life time, not with all the original cast and Kenji Kamiyama back on both the writing and the director\'s sit. Yet here it is.Though there are still changes, both visual and the music.The absent of Origa and Yoko Kanno really shows how much they played into the identity of SACs. But with the former sadly passed away a few yeas ago, and the latter basically retired from the anime industry by now, it really can\'t be help.However, even knowing that, the music is still just underwhelming, especially...the opening, which I find myself constantly skipping, it could just be me but the style kinda annoys me.As to the visual, the 3D CGI and art style shift seem to be what worry most people, I must say I was worried too, the CGI is kinda weird looking at times, but it nails the action scenes perfectly, and it gets the job done when it comes to the character acting as well, which we should most likely thanks  Shinji Aramaki.Though, I am not a fan of Ilya Kuvshinov\'s character design, especially his depiction of the Major: She looks much younger and slimmer than her former self, it\'s especially jawing when Atsuko Tanaka\'s mature voice comes out of that face. But if we step into the forth wall for explanation, I guess it\'s logical that as you grow older, one would only want to look younger.Another problem with his work is that all the young (looking) female characters look like they are made from a same mould, and it doesn\'t feel like it\'s intentional.However, visual and the music are merely the surface, never really the core when one talk about the good of SAC. They could be overlooked if the plot and performance could hold up.Fortunately they do.Kenji Kamiyama didn\'t have much of a career after the original run of SAC, I was worried that he might have lost it before going in, especially after seeing his more recent film ""Hirune Hime"".Now, 12 episodes in, and I am confident that he\'s still got it, so far the plot is very much in the same tone with the original run, with Kamiyama\'s signature political conspiracy thriller and familiar narrative techniques. Nothing can get more close to the original SAC than this after a 14 years gap. Hell! I\'d say it has no right being so close after such a long gap.If you still have doubts if this series got the SAC spirit, I\'d say maybe try episode 7 first. The first 6 episodes are more like setting up the story. Episode 7 however, is returning to the old ""Stand Alone"" format of the original SAC run. There you can judge by yourself if Kamiyama still got it to run SAC. the opening, which I find myself constantly skipping, it could just be me but the style kinda annoys me.As to the visual, the 3D CGI and art style shift seem to be what worry most people, I must say I was worried too, the CGI is kinda weird looking at times, but it nails the action scenes perfectly, and it gets the job done when it comes to the character acting as well, which we should most likely thanks  Shinji Aramaki.Though, I am not a fan of Ilya Kuvshinov\'s character design, especially his depiction of the Major: She looks much younger and slimmer than her former self, it\'s especially jawing when Atsuko Tanaka\'s mature voice comes out of that face.

It created new visual iconography, new visual language and cyberpunk tropes. In SAC_2045 we witness a franchise flailing about in a last gasp attempt at being relevant. It\'s a show that has nothing to say about anything. I found the many references to the Wachowskis Matrix series during the 2 seasons of this show profoundly pathetic.As mentioned above GitS used to create iconography that influenced cinema and animation, and now it has devolved into blatantly ripping off the Matrix, with no grace about it. Instead we just get straight...homages to Agent Smith, the burly brawl, the highway chase, along with the obligatory and lazy homages to previous better GitS movies and shows (how many more times will we see a metal claw gripping Motoko\'s face as she dangles in the air?).Similarly to the original SAC\'s Laughing Man subplot, SAC 2045 also has a literary homage which comes to the fore in the second season, but as you can tell by now, it\'s lazy and superficial. With characters seeking utopia sincerely quoting Orwell\'s 1984 like it\'s meant to mean something. It\'s like the writers have no idea that ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery."" is supposed to be IRONIC.I thought GitS: Arise was utterly boring and unpleasant to look at, dropping it within two episodes. 2045 is better looking (despite the naysayers complaints), and watchable as simple entertainment. But as a Ghost in the Shell story, it\'s woeful, with the ludicrous character Purin behaving like a 12 year old (that we have to see naked for \'reasons\'), its typical Japanese treatment of Black characters, and crucially relegating Motoko Kusanagi to a side character who barely gets any attention. We never see her by herself, she has no inner life or character arc. She has less screen time than Togusa and Batou, and is effectively nothing but an exposition device.Some people will say season 2 is a vast improvement over 1, but take that with a grain of salt.

This is the new premise presented to the Ghost in the Shell franchise with the intellectual deftness of a drunk Michael Bay. The cardboard cutout grade animation lends nothing to the Major\'s kawaii makeover backed by jazzy action sequences reminiscent of poorly pathed NPCs who are unable to recognize the existence of their own appendages.It\'s musically inoffensive to the point of being relatively indistinguishable from a police procedural, though I caught myself being thankful for the absence of Zimmer braaams.With an episode titled ""Edgelord"", this series provides the transgressive value of a chair.Its greatest act of...subversiveness is the addition of a loli character who\'s thirsty for Batou. subversiveness is the addition of a loli character who\'s thirsty for Batou.', 'The Shell is different, but the Ghost remains the same.After watching 12 episodes of first season on Netflix, I would simply put it: Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 stays true to its legacy, a legacy left uncharted since 2006.15 yeas has passed, both in our world and the world of SAC, things must\'ve change.For starter, the staff could no longer create an anime TV series like they did 15 years ago. The industry, the internet, and the audience, are all changed. People change, as they always do.This is arguably the reason why Kenji Kamiyama(神山健治) builds up this new series with a...six-episodes-long and action-packed opening.

How about the witch-hunting on the social media, the cyberbully from anonymous netizen, and the ""NTH Room-like"" scandal of the dark web?It\'s not until the midpoint of the story(or nearly the end of the first seasons), does SAC_2045 reveals the core literature reference of this new series: George Orwell\'s 1984.And that makes all the difference. We could now gradually grasps the reason of the new setting in SAC_2045, such as ""sustainable war"".In retrospect, the original SAC series in 2002 also reveals its reference to J. D. Salinger\'s The Catcher in the Rye only after the mid-season. Therefore I would not be surprise if Kamiyama decided to do the same.The story ends with a fantastic cliffhanger in its mid-season, and we have to wait til the end of 2020(at least) to figure out Kamiyama\'s whole plot of SAC_2045. I\'ll keep my fingers crossed for the next season.In a nutshell, SAC_2045 is a loyal expansion to the classic SAC series.

Many people are watching the first 12 episodes on Netflix and complaining about an unfinished story... well yea, it\'s only half the season. I think Netflix artificially cut the 24 episodes in half so they could have multiple releases. I really enjoyed the first 12 episodes (it really does feel like the older SAC seasons), but the story is not even close to being resolved. I would recommend waiting for the entire season to be released before you start watching.I typically don\'t like when animes try...the 3D look, but this one is so well done that it actually feels like you are thrown into the world.

Like the point of SAC is that there are standalone episodes that focus on different characters and go towards world building which this season DESPERATELY needed. A SINGLE standalone episode that is still connected to the main plot doesn\'t really cut it. They should have just call it Ghost in the Shell 2045.Visuals:Straight up Motoko is the only character with any amount of effort put into making her look good. The rest of the team varies in terms of quality (What is with Aramaki\'s weird arms and...hands?) with Ishikawa looking the worst. The backgrounds are all very flat and stark. at first I thought this was a purposeful choice with the harsh desert sun but then the lighting changed and I was just like ""... Oh"". The action scenes are visually confusing for the most part and every time there\'s gun fire the area gets weird and blurry and even if the gun doesn\'t move, the bullets scatter. You don\'t have a shotgun, your shots shouldn\'t do that... Any character that isn\'t relevant to the plot looks like a video game NPC and honestly I wouldn\'t be surprised if they make a game using these models. Every character has weird 2D elements on their faces. Lines on their cheeks to indicate cheekbones and eyebrows.

But I wish there was a program that allows them to match the lip flaps from English to Japanese with the CG. Thought all the shading and textures were really cool.

I have to admit I was confused the beginning and found it quite slow but once you start getting into the episodic episodes It was very interesting to find out what was gonna happen I hope the series continues for a long time. ', ""I'm not exactly a 2D purist, but I think the creators are struggling with the move to full 3D. The faces hardly move, which is a problem when you want to convey emotion, and most of the other animation looks very wooden and lacks proper weight, which is a shame considering prior iterations had beautiful animation that helped convey each individual character.The animation isn't the only place where the characters fail to express themselves, either. The paper-thin plot is constantly getting in the way of good storytelling, and the absence of the character vignettes that made SAC (particularly 2nd GIG) great is really noticeable. The...worst part is that the plot uses grand themes mostly as set dressing for the action rather than trying to engage with them in any meaningful way, so it comes up completely hollow. The usage of 1984 as a heavy-handed but empty symbol is a particularly egregious example.This iteration of the series has also expanded the roster a bit, and Purin Esaki is a particularly awful addition. Her fawning over Batou is annoying and the whole fan worship thing makes zero sense considering that the members of Section 9 were wiped from existence almost a decade ago when she was still a kid, albeit a technically gifted one. worst part is that the plot uses grand themes mostly as set dressing for the action rather than trying to engage with them in any meaningful way, so it comes up completely hollow.

The rating may change when the remaining 12 episodes are released.I'm going to preface this by saying that I was rooting for this series to be great. I love GiTS. Despite not being a fan of CG animation, I was excited about this show particularly because of Kenji Kamiyama's involvement and also because of the return of the original SAC VAs. I always put way more weight on story telling than I do on visuals so I was willing to tolerate the changes in animation style. Furthermore, I think it's an...awful practice for people to be unfairly critical of an anime simply because it utilizes CG. Watch the show and then make up your mind. You can't watch a 1 minute trailer on Youtube and come to a fair conclusion that something is bad because it uses CG. That's idiotic. It's a bad habit. Stop it.Anyway, I fall in the middle between liking and disliking this show... Although I guess I am mostly in the like it camp as I am happy it exists. There are elements of SAC_2045 that made me happy. Primarily it was the return of old characters that I love. I enjoyed seeing Section 9 together again. I enjoyed seeing the Tachikomas interact with them. Some of the action scenes in the first few episodes looked really good. The cyber warfare stuff was fun as usual. All that familiar stuff is good for the most part. It's definitely not anywhere near as godly as the other adaptations but there were enjoyable moments here that I was satisfied with. Where the show falls apart is that it pivots from the serious tone and complex storytelling of the earlier series to what is largely a straightforward action sci-fi show rife with comedy. I kinda think it made sense to go this route given the cartoon-like (and mostly god-awful) character designs. Would it really be sensible to tell a story as complex, political, and serious as the Individual Eleven with  cartoon-like characters, many of which look like children? No. So, I was willing to accept a different take on GiTS. I figure that SAC_2045 being more viewer friendly and slightly different from past GiTS doesn't mean that GiTS fans won't ever get a follow up to SSS/Arise. There's no harm in experiencing a different spin on something familiar. That said, this is still a flawed show even with my expectations kept in check. Midway into the season they slowly abandon the action and comedy and start to include more horror and dialogue heavy scenes. The show falls flat on its face when it makes this change because the CG models can't adequately convey the emotion the show is trying to elicit. How am I suppose to feel sympathy for a grieving character when the words coming out of their mouth are not in sync with the mouth movements on their cartoon-like faces? Or when they're sobbing and it looks ridiculous? The horror elements at best look awkward when they're not comically bad. The  cartoon-like designs detract from the mood that the show is trying to set in these later scenes.Another issue with the show is that it takes too long to get interesting. Overall I enjoyed watching it, but it didn't get interesting until the final episode. Everything was too straightforward. There was no mystery to be found until episode 12. While watching GiTS I have always been accustomed to racking my brain trying to figure out where the story was going and trying to understand what I had finished watching after each episode. It can be convoluted and hard to follow at times, but there is fun in trying to make sense of it. SAC_2045 is too simple. All of the political intrigue, espionage, and chess that is common in GiTS is absent here. So this also means that important characters like Aramaki are tossed aside because he isn't given anything interesting to do. He was never given an opportunity outsmart anyone and get his crew out of a tough situation by using his giant brain.Anyway, this review is getting to long. Some quick thoughts:+ Nice CG for the most part... Mainly in action scenes.+ Old VAs return+ Couple of fun episodes+ Nice to see section 9 again- Awful OP animation and OP track- Too much comedy. The majority of it falls flat.- Takes too long for the story to get going- Awful character designs... What the hell is Boma wearing? Purin looks ridiculous.- New characters are unlikable.- 12 episodes in and Aramaki has been treated like an afterthought.- The CG is bad in dialogue heavy scenes and horror scenes. awful practice for people to be unfairly critical of an anime simply because it utilizes CG. Watch the show and then make up your mind. You can't watch a 1 minute trailer on Youtube and come to a fair conclusion that something is bad because it uses CG. That's idiotic. It's a bad habit.

Where the show falls apart is that it pivots from the serious tone and complex storytelling of the earlier series to what is largely a straightforward action sci-fi show rife with comedy. I kinda think it made sense to go this route given the cartoon-like (and mostly god-awful) character designs. Would it really be sensible to tell a story as complex, political, and serious as the Individual Eleven with  cartoon-like characters, many of which look like children? No. So, I was willing to accept a different take on GiTS. I figure that SAC_2045 being more viewer friendly and slightly different from past GiTS doesn't mean that GiTS fans won't ever get a follow up to SSS/Arise. There's no harm in experiencing a different spin on something familiar. That said, this is still a flawed show even with my expectations kept in check. Midway into the season they slowly abandon the action and comedy and start to include more horror and dialogue heavy scenes. The show falls flat on its face when it makes this change because the CG models can't adequately convey the emotion the show is trying to elicit. How am I suppose to feel sympathy for a grieving character when the words coming out of their mouth are not in sync with the mouth movements on their cartoon-like faces? Or when they're sobbing and it looks ridiculous? The horror elements at best look awkward when they're not comically bad. The  cartoon-like designs detract from the mood that the show is trying to set in these later scenes.Another issue with the show is that it takes too long to get interesting. Overall I enjoyed watching it, but it didn't get interesting until the final episode. Everything was too straightforward. There was no mystery to be found until episode 12. While watching GiTS I have always been accustomed to racking my brain trying to figure out where the story was going and trying to understand what I had finished watching after each episode. It can be convoluted and hard to follow at times, but there is fun in trying to make sense of it. SAC_2045 is too simple. All of the political intrigue, espionage, and chess that is common in GiTS is absent here. So this also means that important characters like Aramaki are tossed aside because he isn't given anything interesting to do. He was never given an opportunity outsmart anyone and get his crew out of a tough situation by using his giant brain.Anyway, this review is getting to long. Some quick thoughts:+ Nice CG for the most part... Mainly in action scenes.+ Old VAs return+ Couple of fun episodes+ Nice to see section 9 again- Awful OP animation and OP track- Too much comedy. The majority of it falls flat.- Takes too long for the story to get going- Awful character designs... What the hell is Boma wearing? Purin looks ridiculous.- New characters are unlikable.- 12 episodes in and Aramaki has been treated like an afterthought.- The CG is bad in dialogue heavy scenes and horror scenes."", 'So, after the show I\'ve watched that directors interview that Netflix posted on their YT channel and at one point when they talked about how they used motion capture I thought, ""so even when they use motion capture, they still can\'t make characters walk naturally, uh?""And is because is so obvious how Motoko sways her hips more than a Victoria\'s Secret model in a fashion show or how Togusa looked like a walking cardboard box you can not miss this every time they are on screen and don\'t even make me start with that pink haired aberration taken straight out of the hand of the...newest KyoAni\'s intern and her overly exaggerated cutesy gestures.I\'m not one who criticizes just because the animation, but this cheap crap (yes that is how it looks, cheap!) while not bad for your average kids anime, is really not good enough to even attempt on getting close to the previous SAC or old GitS movies. Sadly for this one, the previous works simply had set the bar too high. Again, CG are not a determining factor for me, after all I enjoyed Ajin even when it looked cheap as hell, I liked Appleseed even when cell shaded was a new thing and I still believe that Spirits Within was a technological feat in the industry even when it was made two fkn decades ago! So why couldn\'t they make something visually more akin to Spirits Within while using this watered down plot they used for 2045? Beats me, it could have been an easy 8.2 even among the hardest audience and it could have been CG still.As usual there is no problem with the voice cast (JP), they were spot on; in the 12 episodes I\'ve watched I just noticed of two times where the dialog sounded weird, one from Motoko and one from chief Aramaki but hey, anyone can err a line among hundreds. On the other hand, opening and background music were subpar at best, they do not fit the CG aesthetics, story mood or the wannabe pseudo-sociopolitical plot. Do you remember how the music gave you this foreshadowing goosebumps when an action scene was about to start in Stand Alone Complex? Well, you can be forgetting about them because that won\'t happen this time, even when action scenes is one of the few things they did well in 2045.What baffles me the most is not that it came out like this even when Aramaki and Sola Digital Arts had plenty experience, no, of them alone when not expecting it, it would have not surprised me, the weird thing is that it came out like this even when working hand in hand with Production I.G. and Kamiyama. One could make a mistake and you would think, well surely the other one will notice and vice-versa, but nope that didn\'t happen and here we are.About the story, this is a watered down GitS. Not much else I can say, they try to sound profound and deep when only mentioning stuff by name, the rest is action scenes and petty dialog, no internal monologue, not character development, no intriguing mysteries to solve. Take this agent Smith as an example, he could have been an interesting plot device but ended up being ridiculed and discarded in the same forced way it was introduced.Overall 5 out of 10 points, while you can eat popcorn while watching this, there are many parts where the dull story will make you yawn (mostly at the start), it gets better towards chapter 9 or 10 when Smith becomes irrelevant but nothing outstanding. You totally can skip this show if you are a GitS fan, an anime connoisseur or a sci-fi fan, you can probably enjoy this release if you like Marvel movies tho. newest KyoAni\'s intern and her overly exaggerated cutesy gestures.I\'m not one who criticizes just because the animation, but this cheap crap (yes that is how it looks, cheap!) while not bad for your average kids anime, is really not good enough to even attempt on getting close to the previous SAC or old GitS movies.

It reminds me a lot of my favourite American TV shows like 'Family Guy' and also 'American Dad', who could forget Netflix's 'Big Mouth' too. I wish however there was maybe an extra sex scene or two? Something else to really stimulate the senses with powerful visuals and audio design. But alas, I'm sure Stewie Griffin (my favourite character hehehe~) would have something not so wonderful to say about this show so I will instead only review it a 6 out of 10 in his honour.Thank u for reading my animeh review guys >.<...<3 <3"", ""Section 9 is back, and I didn't know how nostalgic I would feel when writing that.Let us settle a few things first:-2045 is a direct sequel to the original Stand Alone Complex anime, following a decade or so after 2nd gig.-The character designs were revamped by Ilya Kuvshinov, and the entire series moved from 2D to 3D animation.-This show will be compared unkindly both to the movies and to the other animes, and maybe even the manga. All of these have passionate fandoms that have little sympathy for new, fresh takes of their beloved world, but I do believe this new entry in the...canon has earned its spot and should be given a fair chance by all. After all, GITS as a series has been around for long enough, and taken so many forms, that the people working on it now grew up with it as a formative piece, and when faced with the challenge of writing a new story for today's future, they decided to thread new ground valiantly while never forgetting the series many, many pasts.Now let us dissect this shell one part at a time:The major is back as the driving force for the remaining members of Section 9, and in this particular adaptation I would peg her as more human than previous incarnations, though the path leading to the robotic monotone of the Motoko we see in the movies is starting to show. When she takes the lead, she is the most magnificent lithium flower, but more often than not she takes a backseat so that other members of the team can share in the spotlight.Batou, Togusa and Chief Aramaki are as brilliant as ever, with the shocking news of our human detective having gone through a messy divorce after the wake of section 9's disbanding. They all have fantastic stand-alone moments, which can proudly stand amidst the best their characters were ever offered in any previous entries.The rest of section 9 is sadly as unexplored as ever, though. Ishikawa and Saito reprise their usual roles almost bit by bit, and Borma even gets a line or two this time around! Sadly, Paz doesn't have anything else to say to us (maybe a wink to a certain theory after his one prominent appearance in the original series?), but at least I remembered he was in the show when first writing this review, unlike the new rookie, Clown.Some new faces that do stand out quite a bit, are Japan's new prime minister, Section 9's new technician, and the NSA's operation leader, all of which made me hate them the second they showed up, but quickly grew on me as they each interacted with the rest of the cast. I am reserving my opinions till the next season drops, but these, alongside the new villains, have all been extremely promising new characters, which I'd very much would like to see more of.Also, the Tachikoma tanks are back and in full force, for better or worse. Do with that what you will.On the technical side, we have more of a mixed-bag. Some of the shots were jaw-dropping and clearly only possible thanks the 3D camera, while others seemed rather uninspired. It really depended on who was directing each episode. The music is not half-bad, even if the new intro really took me by surprise. If you found yourself skipping it, you are not alone, though the ending song feels right at home with the show's older tracks.The writing, however, was absolutely spectacular. The moment to moment banter between characters hits all the right notes, while the overarching plot felt complex enough to be familiar, while bringing a veritable barrage of new ideas into the mix. I constantly found myself grinning at bits and pieces of foreshadowing and pay-off, and the last episode actually made my jaw drop... before it made me jump off my seat in disbelief as I found out I'd have to wait for the second season to come out sometime later. If anything, I must congratulate Netflix for giving us the version of GITS most apt for binge-watching.Overall, I am happy, really, extremely happy to have this adaptation and to see the stand alone complex expanded with such love, care, and mastery. Is there room for improvement? Of course there is. Tons, actually. But I can say this iteration of the story managed to hook me in a way I hadn't experienced in a long time.Watching SAC_2045 is like running into a friend you haven't seen in years and sitting down for some drinks with them while you catch up, and that's something I sorely needed right now. canon has earned its spot and should be given a fair chance by all.

The writing itself was pretty basic when compared to previous titles of the franchise, it missed a good chunk of psychology aspect and theme of GitS which was a real turn off for me, it was there but only on a surface level and felt pretentious.Art & Animation 5/10I did not like the animation as I\'ve mentioned above, I just couldn\'t get used to it while I believe the full CGI works fine with GitS\'s universe where showing things from different angles specially during the fights, the camouflage and VR actually work good with it. Full CGI also helps with easily adding the idle movements to characters which makes them look realistic, these small movements are also noticeable in previous GitS titles. One thing that really annoyed me were the character models, they were done by Ilya Koshinov; Motoko, Batou and Togusa look way younger despite being shown 11 years after the events of previous movie, I feel like Ilya drew them inspired by their ARISE models.I loved most of the background art, I suppose it\'s because background art doesn\'t need any movement.Sound 5/10Yet another thing 2045 was lacking in compared to the previous titles, GitS always had great soundtracks, soundtracks that would change the momentum of the sequence, soundtracks that are worthy to remember, soundtracks that make fights more enjoyable. 2045\'s soundtracks came nowhere near that.Characters 7/10At least the characters were the same but they only suffered from bad writing, there was this new character named ""Purin Esaki"" and believe me when I say this, her appearance doesn\'t really matter in fact it would be much better if she wasn\'t in the show. Aramaka the chief and Batou didn\'t play much of a major part in the series like they used to, even tho both of them got their fair share of screentime.Enjoyement 7/10It had it\'s problems and it was hard to comprehend how this is the same Standalone Complex, but if you ignore that then it was still somewhat enjoyable as literally a standalone series not connected to any previous GitS and it\'s purpose to serve a newer audience.Overall it\'s a straight 6, it really depends on how they conclude the story in season 2. ignorant of the results and consequences that are to come with the great amount of AI and it\'s powers.

I’ll start with the bad news.Spoilers ahead. Turn back now if you haven’t been with this show since the first season.***- I initially wasn’t concerned about the decision to do this season using CG because I figured that might mean there would be more action sequences. This is a situation fit for a...monkey’s paw. The fights with Huge and Harts were acceptable. Everything else was a bit excessive. The previous seasons in this series relied more on winding tension and building intrigue. When Section 9 had to start shooting, it was quick and clean. The soundtrack Yoko Kanno composed fit that aspect of the show perfectly and helped tell the story in a way that words and images could not. Without Kanno and with CG, the mood of this show has changed completely.- Section 9 always gets disbanded. That’s fine. I can groove to that. After all, they spend most of their time bringing justice to those who believe they are above the law. This show begins with them already being disbanded. No problem. But wait. Something is amiss. They are working for a foreign PMC on foreign soil. What? In the past, they worked closely with the Japanese government. And they just get let go, but not before they smuggle three Tachikoma’s out with them? This is a weak part of the plot that needed more of an explanation. And them being very expensive is not a good one.- Purin. I initially didn’t have an issue with Purin until I realized what she was. I used to read a lot of fan fiction. I even wrote it. Purin is a Mary Sue. She might even be a self-insert, although I base that on nothing more than suspicion. She would not be half as bad if she didn’t have a crush on Batou and if the Major made it a little more difficult for her to get in good graces with the team.I don’t know why they used her when they could have just as easily used Maven or Kuro from First Assault. I guess they just had to get the moe audience.- The single most offensive scene in the first twelve episodes occurs when the Major has to protect the Prime Minister against the post-human who digs boxing. First of all, wouldn’t it have been a good idea to use Batou here? He can box. There was a whole episode about it in the first season of this show. To brush up on her skills, the Major is seen downloading a program that turns her into Mike Tyson and George Foreman. With a Doritos promotion.No.Absolutely not.You can’t convince me that someone as experienced in combat as the Major wouldn’t have been able to lay that clown out flat without downloading a community fan patch from GitHub. This cheapens her character. Why? Because if anybody in this universe can do that, then anyone can be the Major so long as they have the right kind of prosthetic body and the necessary clearance to access such files.+ The episode where Batou helps a bunch of old people rob a bank and the one where the Major devises a test for Togusa so he will feel more confident about rejoining Section 9 were great. They’ve got that old-school Stand Alone Complex flavor. I was also pleased to see that the Major still has problems fighting anyone who’s wearing one of those pesky armored suits. She’s got to have some kind of weakness. Might as well be that.Maybe she can download something off the App Store to help her with it.+ The Major is my favorite fictional character. Across all mediums. Doesn’t matter what it is, she’s got it under control. I dig that. I wish I could be that kind of person. I found her portrayal in Arise to be lacking and was tickled pink when this show did her right. Atsuko Tanaka doesn’t sound like she took a single day off from the role and I adore her for it. I can say the same thing for Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, especially since this is one of a handful of shows that I prefer to watch in English.I was thrilled that they got Michael McCarty back as Ishikawa. I must admit, when I heard his voice, I had to cheer. They even got Dave Wittenberg back as Saito. Just about all of the American voice actors reprise their roles. It’s so good. I almost can’t. It makes me want to squeal in delight every time I think about it. Too bad Sherry Lynn and Jimmy Neutron didn’t get to come back as a Tachikomas, though. That’s okay. Oh, and Megumi Hayashibara was in this? Wow! This show has some serious star power.***In addition to all the above, I can’t say I cared much for the main plot, but it wouldn’t be fair to say anything about it without seeing the rest of the episodes first. I’ll do that later. I do not believe they will be able to turn this boat around before it collides with the iceberg in front of it, but I suppose there’s always a chance. Though I did not like this show, it was fun getting to see the Major and all her buddies again. I’ll just have to forget this show ever happened when I’m rewatching 2nd Gig.It has been 13 years since Solid State Society. Man. I guess it’s called getting old. Everything you like gets remade for a new audience that you aren’t a part of. The same thing will happen to you as well, dear reader. It’s only a matter of time. monkey’s paw.

With a Doritos promotion.No.Absolutely not.You can’t convince me that someone as experienced in combat as the Major wouldn’t have been able to lay that clown out flat without downloading a community fan patch from GitHub. This cheapens her character. Why? Because if anybody in this universe can do that, then anyone can be the Major so long as they have the right kind of prosthetic body and the necessary clearance to access such files.+ The episode where Batou helps a bunch of old people rob a bank and the one where the Major devises a test for Togusa so he will feel more confident about rejoining Section 9 were great. They’ve got that old-school Stand Alone Complex flavor. I was also pleased to see that the Major still has problems fighting anyone who’s wearing one of those pesky armored suits. She’s got to have some kind of weakness. Might as well be that.Maybe she can download something off the App Store to help her with it.+ The Major is my favorite fictional character. Across all mediums. Doesn’t matter what it is, she’s got it under control. I dig that. I wish I could be that kind of person. I found her portrayal in Arise to be lacking and was tickled pink when this show did her right. Atsuko Tanaka doesn’t sound like she took a single day off from the role and I adore her for it. I can say the same thing for Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, especially since this is one of a handful of shows that I prefer to watch in English.I was thrilled that they got Michael McCarty back as Ishikawa. I must admit, when I heard his voice, I had to cheer. They even got Dave Wittenberg back as Saito. Just about all of the American voice actors reprise their roles. It’s so good. I almost can’t. It makes me want to squeal in delight every time I think about it. Too bad Sherry Lynn and Jimmy Neutron didn’t get to come back as a Tachikomas, though. That’s okay. Oh, and Megumi Hayashibara was in this? Wow! This show has some serious star power.***In addition to all the above, I can’t say I cared much for the main plot, but it wouldn’t be fair to say anything about it without seeing the rest of the episodes first. I’ll do that later. I do not believe they will be able to turn this boat around before it collides with the iceberg in front of it, but I suppose there’s always a chance. Though I did not like this show, it was fun getting to see the Major and all her buddies again. I’ll just have to forget this show ever happened when I’m rewatching 2nd Gig.It has been 13 years since Solid State Society. Man. I guess it’s called getting old. Everything you like gets remade for a new audience that you aren’t a part of. The same thing will happen to you as well, dear reader. It’s only a matter of time.', 'Watching this series without first seeing the 2 seasons of Stand Alone Complex and the Solid State Society movie will leave you feeling disoriented. Character building and backstories are all handled in those, so without the investment of watching those (quite good) anime, you likely won\'t have a clue who any of the characters are.The opening of the first episode is similar to the opening of Balde Runner 2049 - there\'s a large gap between the prequel and sequel, and there are events just casually mentioned which are not fully explained until the 2nd season of 2045. We also are greeted with fast paced action...which is bewildering - our Section 9 team has become mercenaries and they\'re in America of all places. We\'re also greeted with the most controversial element of this series - it\'s fully CGI with that odd cell shading used on the characters.Anime studios are still learning to use computer animation, so it\'s janky af at times, but it never crosses into Berserk levels of absurd, and actually enhances several scenes and aspects of the series by enabling levels of visual detail we didn\'t get in the 2D prequels.One thing that did bother me about the show is the use of terms from today (edge lord for example) cropping up in the show. Yes, they are contextualized to mean something different, but it just feels like breaking the 4th wall to me.Unlike the prequels, where story arcs such as Laughing Man were done in drips and drabs until it shifted into full focus, the main plot of this series (both seasons) is moved to the front fairly quickly and becomes the focus of the series.The prequels often concerned themselves with deeply ethical and philosophical questions and individual episodes seemed to ""stand alone"" (haha) even though they were all part of a larger picture. 2045 usually doesn\'t bother ending episodes with the story concluded and the viewers left to ponder transhumanism. Instead, 2045 plays out like a movie with 24 episodes.The conclusion of the first season is a cliff hanger. The opening of the second season feels more like the prequels and seems to have better animation as well. I can only assume the studio noted feedback to the first season and implemented changes.The conclusion of season 2 is akin to several endings in the prequels - viewers are left to conclude on their own the morals of posthumanism and the ethics of manipulating the entire worldview of the global population.Overall, I recommend 2045, but I realize the animation and lack of moral gray area endings to the episodes will upset some long time Ghost in the Shell fans. Unlike the live action movie, we\'re not guided to a right-and-wrong ending - we do get that grey area in the end. It was a real treat to return to the world of Stand Alone Complex after nearly 20 years from the debut, but like others I found the animation to initially be jarring. As I watched, I became accustomed to it and did find it enhancing the world of SAC overall. which is bewildering - our Section 9 team has become mercenaries and they\'re in America of all places.

There isn't much to say on the environment design since the exposure to the cyberpunk nightlife was limited. The 3D doesn't work: It is plain, and simple as that. Although it facilitates some of the action set-pieces, it is not GITS. Facial movements aren't synchronised, and the plain artstyle takes away the gritty feel of the franchise entirely. Motoko Kusanagi's redesign is probably the worst redesign in history as her now petite high-school figure doesn't even keep up with her movements; her boxing challenge had...an entirely comedic tone to it, and doesn't do her 'Queen Kong' nickname justice either. She feels like a Barbie Doll in the wrong place. Togusa's redesign is the only good thing as it is satisfying to see his rough and tough persona be on level with Batou. Which brings us to the worst of the series(yes, and that is not animation)THE BADCharacters- Let's be honest, characters have been always the weakest front of SAC. 2nd GIG helps this by giving some of the iconic members of Section 9 their own story, but the exposure hasn't been beyond that. Batou is the only Section 9 member(other than Major of course) who gets his screen-time, as in here too. We don't see of Kusanagi much too, since exploring her vulnerability in 2nd GIG. Thereby, the characters are more lifeless than the first season, other than Togusa(Gonna be honest, ironically Tachikomas had more of a personality than the cyborgs here). The other major characters of John Smith and Prime Ministers weren't really appealing either but tolerable. The biggest blunder however was the forced addition of Purin Esaki. I understand the need of appealing to the modern generation viewers but Esaki essentially destroys the no nonsense vibe of GITS, which is in no way a good thing. Pink hair, moe, with a generic shtick of a stalker- she doesn't bring humour to the show, but plain annoyance. Did we really need this? Definitely not. Even the Clown was a better addition to the old team, though unwanted.GITS:SAC was never much of a character driven show and hence it worked so far. However, when you introduce characters that break the immersion and the established tone of the show, you know you've ruined it.THE GOODStory- The reformation of Section 9 and the following introduction to the post-humans felt much in line with GITS. The politics are moderate and the setting of the sustainable war seem very much in line with 1984 by Orwell which was referenced in the storyline directly. All these twelve episodes seem to be building up to the crux of the matter, a glimpse of which we see by the last few episodes. The themes of society, internet ostracisation is moderate and never overbearing. The man machine conflict is yet to be explored, but it is amusing how the show starts with introducing the post-humans as stereotypical evil AI, to gradually breaking them down to something human. The story of Takashi was intriguing and it really leaves you wanting for more by the finale.THE EHHHAdditional Elements- 2045 has been the most drone heavy instalment in SAC and this gives it an unnecessary Appleseed feel to it. The Think Pol system was quite intriguing, before Motoko turned up with superhero hacking barrier to cancel it out(like really? Come on). Same as characters, some of these elements crack the staunch serious nature of the show in favour of something over-the-top that might appeal to the younger audience. But certainly not the old GITS fans.Final Rating- 7/10Conclusion- An unnecessary addition to the sub-continuity that was well rounded up by SSS. It's nostalgic to see the old characters return and the world expanded, but at a heavy price that wasn't worth it. an entirely comedic tone to it, and doesn't do her 'Queen Kong' nickname justice either.

And that is also true...for new titles as well. In fact i think there are only 2 titles worth watching..The rest of them? Holy fucking balls of Satan...Speaking of whom Devilman Crybaby which was as impressive as it could get for a manga and anime adaptation as it could get for the time it was released. Now go forward some 30 odd years or so and Netflix bought the rights and produced what passes these days as ""reimagination""...What that means of course is ""we\'ll take a beloved series and turn it into shit just to anger the fans"".Don\'t believe me..Just go to Google and search the words He-Man and Kevin Smith..That\'s the whole mindset of these morons..But that\'s not where it all ends, is it? Cause being American morons means that politics HAVE to be inserted into this medium as well..Of course we had to endure SJW political agendas shoved down our throats in anime as well..What does all that have to do with GITS?We\'ll come to that in a sec.Firstly, we need to address the relentless attack on our pupils..The god damn animation whici i wish i could say gets better as the series progresses but that\'s not the case at all. Remember those demo games of old on PS3? Well this feels like a longer version of a demo with lifeless eyes, head movements similar to that of stiff corpses and lip syncing so lazy it beggars belief..Which of course in turn takes its\' toll on the voice acting department cause when you have some damn good VA and the lips are working in geological time zones..Well let\'s say it\'s not gonna be a nice, comfy ride. And iff you add the difference between the backgrounds and the characters the result is as appaling as swimming in a pool of shit and sulfuric acid.Speaking of shit, guess where GITS takes place...NOPE, you\'re quite wrong..It takes place iiiiiiiinnnn.......America! So low speed limits, huge burgers and even larger styrofoam cups full of Coke and people so fat you mistake them for interstate buses.The very first things to hit the screen are images of America’s palm trees and blue skies which is a far cry from the cyberpunk streets we all know and love. But hey, at least you get Agent Smith clones and muscle cars and villains straight outta the football pitch.As for the soundtracks...Lord deliver me from songs with ""money make the world go round"" lyrics in them..It\'s bad on another level.As for the story itself..Nothing noteworthy here as well..What we get for our money is the investigation of robotics entrepreneur Patrick Huge and his connection to “post-human” engineering,which sounds interesting but it isn\'t..This economic dystopia is presented with the finesse and depth of...An American actually..This also being American and Bernie Sanders friendly we are presented with terms such as “1-percenter” and “global reset” and the worst offender of them all....Episodes like ""EDGELORD-Revolution of the 14-Year-Olds""...Which is the direct result of SJW\'s marching into every medium and ruining everything for the normal people..It would be no surprise at all if in the next installment we see pink haired lesbians with pussy hats fighting patriarchy and targeting people on twitter for having the ""wrong opinion"".So...Streched thin story with sjw politics, animation that can cause violent vomiting, characters i can no longer care about..Yeah..Don\'t you think it\'s time to stop beating the old horse and bury it? We have so many good entries let\'s leave it at that and let this franchise rest in peace already.

With that said I going to try to be natural on this. Just a heads up.Animation – By far the biggest change in the series and a topic no-one can avoid. In brief it’s good. The animation of the 3D models is on level with the...use within video games with it’s smooth appearance and natural motion, it stands out more than other as it is one of the best and highest quality I’ve seen in recent anime (AAA video game level work we’re talking about here). All character motion and animation are great, immediate setting (in other words ‘rooms’) is well put together. That said there are drawbacks such as more work could be done on backgrounds, in other ‘Ghost in the Shell’ series the background often showed off the scale of the locations (the use of citywide shots everything from the 1995 film to Arise) creating the appearance of a much larger world. But in SAC_2045 all that is completely gone (probably as it’s quite difficult to make a whole city using 3D models) and the world itself feels bland and lacking any character. When an action section happens (i.e. a fight) this is where most of the problems of animation are. Fights in SAC_2045 can range from fairly okay to stupid to rather stupid (mostly the last) and the tone is completely gone out the window (there’s comedic nudity more than once). This is a series that in the past used combat in a mature way it was always used as a last resort (used realistically) and it was meaningful and impactful. SAC_2045 missies that. So animation then is good, but scale is gone and combat isn’t as mature anymore. Also to note the Opening Sequence is in 3D is nice while the Ending Sequence is in 2D and is also nicelyReview for first half story - For me the story in the first half is all over the place as unlike ‘Stand Alone Complex’ season one and season two where episodes where divided into stand alone story episodes and overarching episodes SAC_2045 doesn’t have that (doesn’t feel like than anyway although some episodes are standalone). But the problem is the episodes are wildly different in-terms of focus and tone. We start off with what feels like a mix of ‘The Expendables’ and ‘Scooby-Doo’, with tone more in-line with ‘Scooby-Doo’. The first few episodes are a bit strange was it has to set up a lot of changes that have happened between ‘Solid State Society’ and ‘SAC_2045’ while setting up a main plot. The main plot itself is set up is very odd and makes the whole story feel very wired with also make the episode and characters feel odd. Episodes 7-12 change a bit was it becomes more focused and the pace slows down quite a bit, but tone is still a problem. This is probably the last anime you expect to find comedic nudity (including in fights), but the comedic nudity is followed by a slow gentle episode that is nicely though out. This really is Ghost in the Shell writing mixed with Netflix and a lot of fizzy drinks however I think it works (I explain later). Personally, I feel is written to make a show and sell maybe that why some of potential is lost.Characters – It’s hasn’t changed to much from ‘Solid State Society’ although a few changes happen off-screen to characters that aren’t really explained. There still solid while ‘Purin Ezaki’ (new) makes the show feel fresher. The main cast have felt that they aged a bit, that said that would be expected as the first series took place in 2030 and this series in 2045.As a Ghost in the Shell fan - I said I was going to be natural on this but if I digress of a bit. One of major changes is the (animation duh) tone of the story which is something all other ‘Ghost in the Shell’ anime’s do differently. The stories are much more scuttle by giving very little away to make you look deeper at it and pick it apart which also make people think about it often leading people having different views on the same sense let alone the whole show.While it sounds like I’m ripping it apart it’s (again) because I’m a fan of the ‘Ghost in the Shell’ and my main issue is that it isn’t the same anymore from ‘Stand Alone Complex’ season one and two. All the pacing, mature tone, the thoughtful story, the depth. It’s (mostly) gone from ‘SAC_2045’.It’s hard to say if I would recommend it or not because while it look like I’m ripping it apart I still enjoyed it. The strange thing is that this is a sequel to a show that came out in 2006 (Solid State Society) so change was going to happen. But even more strangely as a continuation to ‘Stand Alone Complex’ it works. ‘Ghost in the Shell’ fans may or may not like it but there’s another way of think about it.Ghost in the Shell as an anime has always (to me) talked about the challenges of modern technology, for example in 1995 the World Wide Web was starting to be used within peoples homes and as more people starting using this the technology it started to develop faster (using the multiplication theory). That the time it was a new thing that could have in gone in any direction. The 1995 film creates a situation using the technology at the time and creates a film around it and a talking point. SAC_2045 does much the same even the fact that Netflix publish it also shows technology (albeit in a not subtle way). As a ‘Ghost in the Shell’ series that is key and it manages it (differently).Again last thoughts animation good (sort of), story is wired (too wired), world is bland, philosophy element still there (sort of). So I would say watch it but it’s wildly different from other parts in the ‘Ghost in the Shell’ series.  Also remember the term ‘Ghost in the Shell’ series is a bit loose (example there is massive different between the original manga (1989-91) by Masamune Shirow, the 1995 film, Stand Alone Complex and Arise (2013-15). Give it a go and see. use within video games with it’s smooth appearance and natural motion, it stands out more than other as it is one of the best and highest quality I’ve seen in recent anime (AAA video game level work we’re talking about here).

Give it a go and see.', '*This review was written in brazilian portuguese.Ghost in the Shell SAC_2045 começou errado por não manter o mesmo padrão de animação das outras temporadas da Stand Alone Complex, trazendo uma animação CG que tem seu méritos, mas não é das melhores. Por esse motivo, grande parte do impacto que essa nova temporada poderia ter tido, foi anulada. Mas isso não significa que o anime é ruim, longe disso.HistóriaSegue o mesmo padrão dos arcos ""Homem Risonho"", ""Onze Individual"" e ""Estado Sólido"" em sua narrativa. Oculta fatos e desenvolve assuntos complexos, tratando o telespectador como alguém que sabe ligar os pontos. Nesse ponto, essa temporada é tão...boa quanto as outras. Uma pena que foi dividida em duas partes, pois ao final desta fica a sensação de vazio, já que a trama estacionada na metade.ArteEsse é o maior problema. Os character design é parecido com o habitual, mas o CG estragou muito a parte de movimento, fluidez e expressões faciais dos personagens. Os cenários são interessantes, apesar disso.

Its definitely not the best iteration of the series or of GITS in general, but is worth a watch, and if they do what they always do and cut it into a few shorter OVAs it may be great. The 3D animation is OK, would have vastly preferred the original S.A.C. art style, but it isn't a deal breaker for me. Story vacillates between amazing and meh. New characters are OK, but I don't like that they get more lines that some members of Section 9. Still worth watching though, especially since...we are all stuck in quarantine anyways. we are all stuck in quarantine anyways."", 'Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045I was texting my friends between episodes ( at least for the first episodes) to give them my first impression on the show. Those messages can be resumed as such: "" Wtf dude"" ""Not that bad"" ""Wow"" ""Why does this character exist"" and then I stopped texting them.""Wtf dude"" was about the first episode and the first scene, giving a taste of unachieved CG and the same with the story. The newly introduced character ( we\'ll call him A) makes no sense at first but he\'s then improved in next episodes, giving a comic relief and revealing the seriousness of the...squad through his external point of view, giving a smile without falling in the cliche. A is new in the squad and not quite prepared for what\'s happening to him, showing that not every soldier can be in the squad, only the chosen are fit to the job ( links with some episodes of the second season of stand alone complex ? )""Not that bad"" was about the CG, at first I found it disturbing and failing to give us the work on lights done for the other shows. But then I saw the tachikomas reflecting their environment which was accurate as they are steel. The end of the first part of the anime also improved what I first thought, there are logic connections, the first critics on cyborgs, capitalism, state security rise.And then comes the bank episode, which was one of the best episode in animation that I have ever seen. Not only a critic of globalization but also a critic of Japan on quite specifics topics ( check the criminality, poverty and jobs of elder Japanese and the history of the Yen before watching the episode, it will make so much sense ). We also see a different Bato than the one we\'re used to, giving him some depth for newcomers.Now comes the worst point of this new show: the new character in the second part (we\'ll call ""that"" B). I can\'t stand it, I tried my best but this new character destroys all the job done on A in the first part. It arrives from nowhere, is like a super-hero (in a non-utopia/ dystopia like GITS), has one of the worst Character design I\'ve ever seen, hides all the work from Ishikawa and Boma, is useless in term of narration and character depth. B is a f*cked up mix between a tachikoma for the silly questions, Ishikawa for the skills, and a damn ""neeee"" Japanese slice of life character in search of respect and recognition. A particular scene irritated me: B comes to the Major and says something like ""hey major look at me I\'ve done this to help you, look how great I am"". Maybe this new character was for the newcomers, to show how badass the squad is, but that\'s so badly done. Gits SAC was so good to show how cool the characters are by just showing the work getting done, and without any search of recognition by those characters and mostly without any unnecessary comments on it. The only cool fact about this character is how the other characters give so little care about it. I seriously think B is not part of the squad as it doesn\'t even understand what the major implicit. The seiyuu was good but you can\'t save such a poorly written character with a good voice acting.I stopped texting my friends at the beginning of the second part, because it is really good, remaining me of the first half of the first season of SAC. With critics and more deeply written character ( like Togusa, the Prime Minister and even the enemies), contrasting once again with the Manicheism we find so often. I especially loved one passage where Bato says that it will be so much easier to use the eyes of the citizens but says just after that he\'s not in the Usa. For Netflix to say this clearly was a big yes for me.briefly :- Story: really good, GITS as we\'re used to- Art: lack of work on light,  but better than expected-Sound: Wtf is this opening, next time try something calm ( I preferred the alternative architecture opening to tell how little to do with GITS it has to do), no especially good music-Character: big yes for all of them except B ( I hope you\'ll leave the show soon and return to lucky star/ nichijou/ the ecchi anime you belong to )-Enjoyment: Cool fight scenes, a good end deserving a next seasonOverall: GITS, what we\'re used to + the character we didn\'t ask for squad through his external point of view, giving a smile without falling in the cliche.

I hate the live-action movie adaptation for almost everything (destroying and mixing characters, a new story for Motoko and Kuze, actors, literally everything). It sucked horribly. In contrary, I like SAC Motoko most even though I started with the original GITS movie when it released and I do not like the New Architecture series equally as I do not like the live-action, which has been already stated.All that being said, this show isn't as bad as it's described. The art and 3D is ok, it looks ok, not great but ok. I even liked this...style - not only it didn't break anything for me but I really enjoyed watching it. Don't despise it, get used to it and it has its own character and charm.The story is nothing new, characters are much worse than originals and the feeling of emptiness remains present almost in all aspect as compared to previous installments but still - it's GITS so compared to all the shit released these days and for last couple of years - that is still the best anime up to date that I've seen. Seriously - when GITS is not great, all the rest must be a total rubbish.In the end, I really liked watching it, I facepalmed a lot but still - for a while I felt like when watching the GITS movies and first 2 SAC seasons masterpieces. It was magic, totally the same even though the show regressed I never feel like this watching any other series. It's just GITS so if you're a fan of it, just try giving it a chance. style - not only it didn't break anything for me but I really enjoyed watching it.

It could be the 3dcg, nostalgia blinders, or something else entirely but honestly it\'s not that bad. I\'d even call it pretty good, I think I like it better than Solid State Society.My biggest problems are:1 - Oh god Togusa my boy what have the done to you? Everyone else looks pretty good but someone on the design team didn\'t like him. Also he has a bad time in the timeskip between the end of old school SAC and the start of this.2 - This is really obviously half a season. Netflix just list it as...a single 24 episode thing.3dcg is a bit of a jarring switch at first but honestly it looks pretty good. Sometimes it even gives me ""holy shit that\'s pretty"" moments. Dub is still solid as hell, VA\'s are killing it. Action is just as good as ever.The introspective philosophical bits aren\'t quite there but there are hints of it and 2nd GIG felt like it took a while to get there as well.

Better than arise not really its familiar characters in a new less visually appealing setting. the actual continuity compared to arise is cool even if the characters haven't changed much. With the exception of one character the sec 9 group have changed very little. That lack of change helps old fans remain attached to characters but is odd considering the time gap. The music isnt bad but it doesn't really impress less ethereal chimming than you might expect. Did I enjoy this show yes a good Netflix binge worthy show. "", ""I was approaching 2045 with fair share of unease, in the end it's a sequel to one of my favourite series. This iteration of SAC isn't as bad as people had painted it, and what I grew to be afraid of (the first scene I saw was from a GIF with one of the characters cartwheeling his way out during the mansion scene, That scene looks silly in a very negative way). GITS anno domini 2020 goes along with its antecedents' tradition and tackles issues of future society (and throws into the bundle couple  accurate comments towards our, contemporary, society). This season's schwartz motif...is too much power in hands of entities concerned with income at the same time trampling over regular citizens, as well as onset of a new evolutionary avenue (it yet remains to be seen whether it was natural or artificially incited).When it comes to the graphics I'm afraid time will not be gentle for this series and it will be hard to look at in a couple of years. In some regards its shortcomings are already noticeable, just to mention backdrops being too sterile combined with bland background textures. 2045 shows that CGI is still not there and the scenes where audience sees photos (which are drawn) further highlight that.In case of the music... it's there serving its role, that's all I can tell about it. No memorable pieces that would entrench themselves in audience's memory, the score is run of the mill and devoid of uniqueness of music in other GITS anime. I had to look up theOP to remember how it sounds. On the other hand the ending is quite pleasant to listen to.Last, but not least, the characters. After Arise franchise finally remembered that Section 9 is a unit consisting of people serving their specialised roles, not just Motoko hauling background extras that are there only for cameos while she is an all singing all dancing one-cyborg-gorilla army. The new trio of supporting characters is a bit annoying in their own way. Agent Smith... that is John Smith leaves air of a careerist and not a professional who should be in that particular position. Although, he might be seen as the embodiment of nation's hubris. Clown, an upcoming hotshot who feels like a forced filler character at the same time serving role of an indicator showing how the original crew is capable. Purin, the last of the newcomers, makes impression of an otaku bait that found herself on a wrong set on her way to an idol show (or, given her gesticulation, Japanese live action comedy that tries too hard to be an anime). However, I have to admit that when push comes to shove she is capable of pulling her weight.To sum up, 2045 is an interesting first dip into new SAC instalment which receives from me 7/10. is too much power in hands of entities concerned with income at the same time trampling over regular citizens, as well as onset of a new evolutionary avenue (it yet remains to be seen whether it was natural or artificially incited).When it comes to the graphics I'm afraid time will not be gentle for this series and it will be hard to look at in a couple of years.

I even watched the rubbish live action movie.From the first announcement for this Anime i was keen to see it. The the trailer dropped i was still open to the idea with the whole CGI animation. Now that I've seen all of season one i can say in my opinion that it is the weakest Ghost in the shell entry to date. All of our classic characters seem wooden and uninteresting. Not even the...original english voice cast coming back ( i love the ghost english dub) could save this show. I feel like there is almost no further character development except for Togusa who ((((SPOILERS!!!!!!)))) gets divorced thats about it.We also get introduced to some new members of the section 9 team Purin Ezaki. Who i found incredibly annoying and couldn't wait to see leave every scene she was in. And Stan who had potential only to be dropped completely out of the show not long into it. Since i haven't read the manga i might have missed this but what ever happened to Azuma? I would have liked to seen him develop more as a character especially after his extended role in solid stateThe animation i was open to it at first but couldn't help but think why Production I.G. didn't just used their normal fantastic animation I would have loved to have seen a update from 2006s solid state society's fantastic animation. While this CGI doesn't look bad compared to other shows i can't help but think that the original opening from SAC season 1 gives it a run for its money.Music and sound design leaves much to be desired here. I was very disappointed with. Don't think any of the sound track will live long in the memory like the original soundtrack from the shows and movies.The story has a interesting premise but it really fails to ignite or really take off the whole way through and i think it has to do with the general all round wooden feeling of the characters and animation in parts. No memorable antagonist like we had with the laughing man of individual elevenOver all score is a generous 5/10 just falls flat on almost all areas and very disappointing. If you are a Ghost in the shell fan just watch any of the past ghost stuff.

It’s clearly written by the same staff (especially Kamiyama) and seems to be building up to something more substantial (it certainly deserves props for the timely commentary on mob justice), but.. often it’s like watching a long string of juvenile, unconvincing cutscenes. Stand Alone Complex had its silly moments—it’s a Japanese cartoon about a hot cyborg chick with purple hair crushing and humiliating people—but those were accompanied by skilled tension, painful beauty and eerie prescience.Whatever this is, it’s.. sort of Stand Alone Complex, sort of trying too hard to appeal to a broad streaming audience (and moe otaku...too?). The second arc is showing a lot of promise; season 2’s payoff as well as a few more “stand alone” pieces might genuinely be worth the drudgery.

Good on Netflix for getting the excellent dub cast back though.', ""There is a stigma against fully 3D anime amongst the western anime viewing audience. To a shockingly large number of this audience, anything that is not 2D animation (or to their naivety cleverly done 3D animation that is rendered and presented in a way that looks 2D) is an “insult” to anime. I can somewhat see why they have this view due to the fact that is most situations, 3D is used as a tool of cutting corners in TV production rather than a purposeful aesthetic design choice. You see bad 3D scenes in TV anime all the time nowadays. However, to hate 3D animation...just because it is not 2D hand drawn is, in my opinion, quite silly.Enter Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045, a show that, in some of its scenes, looks like absolute amateur dogshit while in the others, looks honestly quite amazing. Production IG continues to push their 3D agenda with this fully 3D production and I have to say, they really have made quite great strides in their endeavors. It does take a good getting used to but their character models (especially the Major's and Batou's) look quite great in 3D. Some of the others...not so much but it can be forgiven due to how great the show's lighting and camera work is.Where the visual style of the show really takes a hit in my opinion though is in some of the daytime scenes. This is sort of the blind-spot for most 3D animated work; daytime scenes are much, much harder to make it “look right”. The abundance of light really shows all the imperfections in humanoid models and your animation game has to be fucking on-point or you'll notice jankyness much easier. However, the night scenes in this anime, honestly quite stunning. I 100% dig this new style that the show is going in (which is a relief seeing how horrid Arise looked). I will say though, I still vastly prefer the visual style of the original SAC TV show; not because it was primarily 2D animated but because a lot of the scenes had more...”umph” to the animation and poses. Also the character design seemed much more adult and the world felt more “lived-in” in that previous series.The show itself has...issues. The pacing feels way off. More than half of the season is used to set up the reforming of Section 9 which I feel like is a major misuse of screen time. They spend so much time setting it up that once you are back in Japan, you don't even get a complete arc finished. In fact, the cliffhanger that this season ends on came so out of left field and was so unsatisfying. On top of all of that, the “deepness” that is usually associated with Ghost in the Shell seems quite lacking in this season. It honestly feels like a in-between feeling between the OG SAC and Arise which is not the worst thing in the world, but I was hoping for something much, much, much, muchhhhh more like SAC. The only saving grace of the ending of the show is that we might have a new antagonist that has the smartness and interest of the Laughing Man. However, seeing how this antagonist is part of a group that was already so easily taken down in a previous episode of the series, my fears is that the next season will just continue as-is and will just waste the character's potential.Sound is great, actually it's fantastic. I watched this on Netflix in Dolby Atmos. Very, very, very good sound mixing. The OP is fantastic and fitting given the theme of financial ruin throughout the series. The voice actors are great though this show has a bad case of showing you characters in the background but not letting them speak. Borma is an example of this; I had thought given how much they showed him and didn't let him talk that they did not have a VA for him. He did end up saying like. 4 lines of dialogue but not until around the second to last episode. Other characters that are a staple part of Section 9 literally do not talk nor do...well anything in the series. Seriously wasted potential.Overall this is not a bad production. I enjoyed watching most of it. It does seem like they wasted some opportunities and I have a large fear that the next season will be as...meandering as this one, but it is a very clear improvement over Arise and that is, if anything, a good place to start rebuilding this brand.Enjoyment: 6.5/10Overall: 6.4/10 just because it is not 2D hand drawn is, in my opinion, quite silly.Enter Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045, a show that, in some of its scenes, looks like absolute amateur dogshit while in the others, looks honestly quite amazing. Production IG continues to push their 3D agenda with this fully 3D production and I have to say, they really have made quite great strides in their endeavors. It does take a good getting used to but their character models (especially the Major's and Batou's) look quite great in 3D. Some of the others...not so much but it can be forgiven due to how great the show's lighting and camera work is.Where the visual style of the show really takes a hit in my opinion though is in some of the daytime scenes. This is sort of the blind-spot for most 3D animated work; daytime scenes are much, much harder to make it “look right”. The abundance of light really shows all the imperfections in humanoid models and your animation game has to be fucking on-point or you'll notice jankyness much easier. However, the night scenes in this anime, honestly quite stunning. I 100% dig this new style that the show is going in (which is a relief seeing how horrid Arise looked). I will say though, I still vastly prefer the visual style of the original SAC TV show; not because it was primarily 2D animated but because a lot of the scenes had more...”umph” to the animation and poses. Also the character design seemed much more adult and the world felt more “lived-in” in that previous series.The show itself has...issues. The pacing feels way off. More than half of the season is used to set up the reforming of Section 9 which I feel like is a major misuse of screen time. They spend so much time setting it up that once you are back in Japan, you don't even get a complete arc finished. In fact, the cliffhanger that this season ends on came so out of left field and was so unsatisfying. On top of all of that, the “deepness” that is usually associated with Ghost in the Shell seems quite lacking in this season. It honestly feels like a in-between feeling between the OG SAC and Arise which is not the worst thing in the world, but I was hoping for something much, much, much, muchhhhh more like SAC.

For me it has more been Appleseed  and Patlabor when it comes to future ish animes.But I will say I fairly enjoyed it the art style is not ground breaking but it´s not bad sure there is allot of stiff movements and such so it´s a cheap use of a old but good art style. It is easy on the eyes and looks good I seen far worse in my 25 years of...loving anime. Honestly even allot of the newer anime styles are bloody bad compared to this(Knight of sedonia is rely bad.)The  story is cheap and nothing to write home about but it´s just up my ally of cheesy action/crime  movies/shows. I mean I grew up with Van dam and Steven Seagal so I seen far more cheesy and mediocre story.All in all it was a good watch but nothing mind breaking sadly it had to sully the name of Ghost in the Shell. loving anime.

Happy☆Lesson (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/260/Happy☆Lesson_TV,"['So check this out Happy Lesson is comedy anime but wasnt on my scale for the best anime i\'ve seen but then again theres worse. Basicly the plot is based on 5 teachers who live with an orphan and all try to become his mother and try to make him a better student through different methods. So nothing new right. Seen this in countless anime where a male character lives or are surronded with a bunch of female characters ex. Love Hina.Main characters are Chitose, the orpahn who moves in the house of his deceased parents. He trys to hide his feelings about his...""mothers"" but every now and then they leak.Mutsuki Ichimonji his homeroom teacher and usually cleans and cooks around the house. Shes pressures Chitose to study. At home she wears a maid outfit.Kisaragi Ninomai (personal favorite) she is the science teacher. She seems like shes emotionless but loves her son Chitose alot. You see that she experiments alot on Chitose.Yayoi Sanzenin is the nurse and priestess but the school doesnt know about that. She has a calm demeanor unless she senses danger and then puts her sword skills to work.Uzuki Shitenno is the art teacher and is small. She is for the most part is happy and cheerful. Shes usually wears wings because shes into cosplay.Satsuki Gokajo is the p.e teacher and is serious about her workouts. Shes loud and agressive but can be sweet.And those are the characters you will mostly encounter with the exceptions towards later episodes you will be introduced to Chitose adopted sisters, Minazuki his younger sis and Hazuki his older sis who is a famous singer. You also will be seeing the class rep Fumitsuki who has a crush on Chitose and becomes curious about Chitoses life outside school. Also Kanna Kisaragi childhood friend and develops a crush on him.As far as originality it doesnt set the bar but then agian not many anime do. You will follow Chitoses struggles with dealing with so many moms. The shenanigins that happen when living with moms who are so different from one another. How each ones method for making him a better student work out. The only thing that bothered me were the endings of each episode. They had a very ""after school special"" feeling to them. Like really cheesy. For the most part this occurs with every episode. In the end it wasnt on my OMG I gotta watch this list but If you got nothing to do and time to kill watch a couple episodes, you might like it.

I hated and enjoyed this anime at the same time and up until now I didn\'t even know something like that was possible. This anime is every cliched joke, every cardboard cut-out character and every predictable plot point that has been done to death by a 100 animes before it - jammed into a 13 episode series. I knew very well that being a harem and a romcom I wasn\'t going to see anything profound, but never in my wildest dreams, would I have expected it to be this...bad. Yet ridiculously, like a 5 year old at a sweet-stall, I enjoyed it.The story... no wait there is no story here. It\'s just a single male character with 5 young, infantile looking women and lots and I mean lots of cliched jokes and of course sexual innuendo. The women in question turn out to be the male lead\'s teachers and mothers at the same. To show you just how much the ""story"" sucks in this cliche-fest series I can tell you that even that single, most basic plot point that was established in episode 1 was not properly explained or in fact even covered at all. It\'s something along the lines of ""Hey do you want me to be your mom?"" - ""Yeh, whatever"".The male lead is a no dimensional character. In fact, his only parameter is to be smothered with affection by countless equally no dimensional female characters. I mean, I\'m gonna square with you guys here - there is no need for me to go into detail with the story or the characters because they\'re so banal they might have as well been invented by a cactus. It\'s just an episode after an episode of cliche jokes, sexual innuendo, fanservice, fake drama. In that order.That said, I did enjoy this series and indeed if you look at the breakdown of individual scores I gave this anime you\'ll see an 8 next to enjoyment. It\'s because it\'s so gobsmackingly bad that it crosses the barrier and goes straight into unintentional comedy. Two minuses are a positive and that\'s exactly what happened in here. I know very well that this anime isn\'t meant to be serious or that the makers never aspired to create a masterpiece out of it but it\'s even crap for an average harem romcom. And no, it\'s not a slice of life anime. Nothing presented here has anything to do with real life. So in a way you know it\'s bad but you can\'t help but to laugh at the poor writing. The ending is a testament to that. It starts out dramatically trying to be realistic and there\'s a build up of tension between the characters as they face an insurmountable problem, but then you\'re slapped in the face with a deus ex machina solution. Teenagers solving problems with a submarine and an electrical bazooka? How is that slice of life?That brings me to reason number 2 why I actually enjoyed it. As bad as it is, \'Happy Lesson\' has a decent opening, a surprisingly good OST and a catchy ending which just makes everything more absurd and inadvertently - hilarious.With all that in mind, I am rating it fairly. The story is poor and so are the characters, art is good, the sound is very good and I laughed my ass off. I\'d say that\'s a 5. Moreover I will watch the second season and grab the OST because ironically, the entertainment value here is really really high. bad.

He has a sister who\'s songs and a little sister living with big sister. He is a bit lonely in the house so he let his teachers to live in his house, but there must be a secret because otherwise it can go bad for teachers.Since the teachers stay with him, they help him to get up in the morning to go to school, cook for him, clean and wash house. He said even at the end of the anime that had it not been for them, he would...had dropped out of school and no one would show how it would go with him.Since teachers are like a mother to him, he calls them ""mother"" and they can always find an excuse to have a party!At school there is a president, and it is a girl. She is in love with main character in this anime, but it\'s very difficult for her to tell it to him. He is very cold and dismissive, and she is of course disappointed, but it isn\'t stoping her. In the end, she finds out he has a secret, and do it mostly to find out. How it ends, I\'m not going to tell!The end should I not tell anything about, but I can tell my opinion about it. Because this was a fun anime, not so tension-filled, but fun, so expect not a big ending. I had no expectations about the end, because the anime was just fun to watch, at least I could not imagine how one would be. Although I failed it was the end still fun and easy. You do not sit back with a lot of questions, and it was actually a very nice way to end an anime on.So I will not quit rate: 10/10!The song that big sister song I must say honestly that it was terrible for my taste.

Once he entered High School he was allowed to leave the orphanage and live in the house he grew up in. Except this time with 5 of his teachers wanting to become his new mom.~Story 7/10~The story itself isn't very unique, but I did find some of the elements of the show to be very...entertaining and cute. Some of it had comedy and some of it was simply fan service.Just be warned, the harem fighting starts almost instantly and it is like being smacked in the face 10 seconds into the show.Most of the episodes usually cover some basic anime formula elements.

It was interesting to see each teachers motivations and to see what makes each of them so unique.I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the teachers and why they chose to become the mom of this one particular boy, but I was not impressed by the stories and reasons.Some of the reasons seemed quite stupid while only one of them seemed natural and genuine.Sometimes there would be family quarrels and it felt nice to know that my own family wasn't so dysfunctional.~Sound 7/10~As a musician I usually notice background music, but in this case, I don't remember any.The character voices were done well, but I can't say the same for the English dub.It is overly common to find some of the characters having really high pitched voices and I've become used to that fact.Overall, I enjoyed the show because it was cute and a little romantic. It made me envious, yet relieved that my family wasn't so dysfunctional. There is a lot of comedy, but most of it is overly obvious.

It\'s because it\'s so gobsmackingly bad that it crosses the barrier and goes straight into unintentional comedy. Two minuses are a positive and that\'s exactly what happened in here. I know very well that this anime isn\'t meant to be serious or that the makers never aspired to create a masterpiece out of it but it\'s even crap for an average harem romcom. And no, it\'s not a slice of life anime. Nothing presented here has anything to do with real life. So in a way you know it\'s bad but you can\'t help but to laugh at the poor writing. The ending is a testament to that. It starts out dramatically trying to be realistic and there\'s a build up of tension between the characters as they face an insurmountable problem, but then you\'re slapped in the face with a deus ex machina solution. Teenagers solving problems with a submarine and an electrical bazooka? How is that slice of life?That brings me to reason number 2 why I actually enjoyed it. As bad as it is, \'Happy Lesson\' has a decent opening, a surprisingly good OST and a catchy ending which just makes everything more absurd and inadvertently - hilarious.With all that in mind, I am rating it fairly. The story is poor and so are the characters, art is good, the sound is very good and I laughed my ass off. I\'d say that\'s a 5. Moreover I will watch the second season and grab the OST because ironically, the entertainment value here is really really high.', 'Happy Lesson is about a boy / student who inherits a large house of his parents. He has a sister who\'s songs and a little sister living with big sister. He is a bit lonely in the house so he let his teachers to live in his house, but there must be a secret because otherwise it can go bad for teachers.Since the teachers stay with him, they help him to get up in the morning to go to school, cook for him, clean and wash house. He said even at the end of the anime that had it not been for them, he would...had dropped out of school and no one would show how it would go with him.Since teachers are like a mother to him, he calls them ""mother"" and they can always find an excuse to have a party!At school there is a president, and it is a girl. She is in love with main character in this anime, but it\'s very difficult for her to tell it to him. He is very cold and dismissive, and she is of course disappointed, but it isn\'t stoping her. In the end, she finds out he has a secret, and do it mostly to find out. How it ends, I\'m not going to tell!The end should I not tell anything about, but I can tell my opinion about it. Because this was a fun anime, not so tension-filled, but fun, so expect not a big ending. I had no expectations about the end, because the anime was just fun to watch, at least I could not imagine how one would be. Although I failed it was the end still fun and easy. You do not sit back with a lot of questions, and it was actually a very nice way to end an anime on.So I will not quit rate: 10/10!The song that big sister song I must say honestly that it was terrible for my taste.

Except this time with 5 of his teachers wanting to become his new mom.~Story 7/10~The story itself isn't very unique, but I did find some of the elements of the show to be very...entertaining and cute. Some of it had comedy and some of it was simply fan service.Just be warned, the harem fighting starts almost instantly and it is like being smacked in the face 10 seconds into the show.Most of the episodes usually cover some basic anime formula elements. There is a Hot Spring episode, two with school festivals, etc... But in the end of the day, nothing really changes and everything is neatly tied back into a bow.Each teacher has a dedicated episode that seemed a little ridiculous.There are a lot of times where I didn't like what was going on because it seemed a little to much like a fantasy show.For example, there were robots and exotic animals and super frilly outfits that no teacher would ever be allowed to wear.It just seemed a little too much at times.~Art 8/10~The art is good, the backgrounds are well drawn and you get the usual frilly outfits, and extremely weird hair styles and hair colors.The characters are sometimes drawn in a very cute fashion making me want to continue watching the show and favoring certain characters that don't get much time or character development.~Character 8/10~Since each teacher had a dedicated episode it was a great chance to get lots of character development done. It was interesting to see each teachers motivations and to see what makes each of them so unique.I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the teachers and why they chose to become the mom of this one particular boy, but I was not impressed by the stories and reasons.Some of the reasons seemed quite stupid while only one of them seemed natural and genuine.Sometimes there would be family quarrels and it felt nice to know that my own family wasn't so dysfunctional.~Sound 7/10~As a musician I usually notice background music, but in this case, I don't remember any.The character voices were done well, but I can't say the same for the English dub.It is overly common to find some of the characters having really high pitched voices and I've become used to that fact.Overall, I enjoyed the show because it was cute and a little romantic. It made me envious, yet relieved that my family wasn't so dysfunctional. There is a lot of comedy, but most of it is overly obvious.

Seen this in countless anime where a male character lives or are surronded with a bunch of female characters ex.

Shes pressures Chitose to study. At home she wears a maid outfit.Kisaragi Ninomai (personal favorite) she is the science teacher. She seems like shes emotionless but loves her son Chitose alot. You see that she experiments alot on Chitose.Yayoi Sanzenin is the nurse and priestess but the school doesnt know about that. She has a calm demeanor unless she senses danger and then puts her sword skills to work.Uzuki Shitenno is the art teacher and is small. She is for the most part is happy and cheerful. Shes usually wears wings because shes into cosplay.Satsuki Gokajo is the p.e teacher and is serious about her workouts. Shes loud and agressive but can be sweet.And those are the characters you will mostly encounter with the exceptions towards later episodes you will be introduced to Chitose adopted sisters, Minazuki his younger sis and Hazuki his older sis who is a famous singer. You also will be seeing the class rep Fumitsuki who has a crush on Chitose and becomes curious about Chitoses life outside school. Also Kanna Kisaragi childhood friend and develops a crush on him.As far as originality it doesnt set the bar but then agian not many anime do. You will follow Chitoses struggles with dealing with so many moms. The shenanigins that happen when living with moms who are so different from one another. How each ones method for making him a better student work out. The only thing that bothered me were the endings of each episode. They had a very ""after school special"" feeling to them.

I hated and enjoyed this anime at the same time and up until now I didn\'t even know something like that was possible. This anime is every cliched joke, every cardboard cut-out character and every predictable plot point that has been done to death by a 100 animes before it - jammed into a 13 episode series. I knew very well that being a harem and a romcom I wasn\'t going to see anything profound, but never in my wildest dreams, would I have expected it to be this...bad. Yet ridiculously, like a 5 year old at a sweet-stall, I enjoyed it.The story... no wait there is no story here. It\'s just a single male character with 5 young, infantile looking women and lots and I mean lots of cliched jokes and of course sexual innuendo. The women in question turn out to be the male lead\'s teachers and mothers at the same. To show you just how much the ""story"" sucks in this cliche-fest series I can tell you that even that single, most basic plot point that was established in episode 1 was not properly explained or in fact even covered at all. It\'s something along the lines of ""Hey do you want me to be your mom?"" - ""Yeh, whatever"".The male lead is a no dimensional character. In fact, his only parameter is to be smothered with affection by countless equally no dimensional female characters. I mean, I\'m gonna square with you guys here - there is no need for me to go into detail with the story or the characters because they\'re so banal they might have as well been invented by a cactus.

It\'s something along the lines of ""Hey do you want me to be your mom?"" - ""Yeh, whatever"".The male lead is a no dimensional character. In fact, his only parameter is to be smothered with affection by countless equally no dimensional female characters.

You will follow Chitoses struggles with dealing with so many moms. The shenanigins that happen when living with moms who are so different from one another. How each ones method for making him a better student work out. The only thing that bothered me were the endings of each episode. They had a very ""after school special"" feeling to them.

I hated and enjoyed this anime at the same time and up until now I didn\'t even know something like that was possible. This anime is every cliched joke, every cardboard cut-out character and every predictable plot point that has been done to death by a 100 animes before it - jammed into a 13 episode series. I knew very well that being a harem and a romcom I wasn\'t going to see anything profound, but never in my wildest dreams, would I have expected it to be this...bad. Yet ridiculously, like a 5 year old at a sweet-stall, I enjoyed it.The story... no wait there is no story here. It\'s just a single male character with 5 young, infantile looking women and lots and I mean lots of cliched jokes and of course sexual innuendo. The women in question turn out to be the male lead\'s teachers and mothers at the same. To show you just how much the ""story"" sucks in this cliche-fest series I can tell you that even that single, most basic plot point that was established in episode 1 was not properly explained or in fact even covered at all. It\'s something along the lines of ""Hey do you want me to be your mom?"" - ""Yeh, whatever"".The male lead is a no dimensional character. In fact, his only parameter is to be smothered with affection by countless equally no dimensional female characters. I mean, I\'m gonna square with you guys here - there is no need for me to go into detail with the story or the characters because they\'re so banal they might have as well been invented by a cactus. It\'s just an episode after an episode of cliche jokes, sexual innuendo, fanservice, fake drama. In that order.That said, I did enjoy this series and indeed if you look at the breakdown of individual scores I gave this anime you\'ll see an 8 next to enjoyment. It\'s because it\'s so gobsmackingly bad that it crosses the barrier and goes straight into unintentional comedy. Two minuses are a positive and that\'s exactly what happened in here. I know very well that this anime isn\'t meant to be serious or that the makers never aspired to create a masterpiece out of it but it\'s even crap for an average harem romcom. And no, it\'s not a slice of life anime. Nothing presented here has anything to do with real life. So in a way you know it\'s bad but you can\'t help but to laugh at the poor writing. The ending is a testament to that. It starts out dramatically trying to be realistic and there\'s a build up of tension between the characters as they face an insurmountable problem, but then you\'re slapped in the face with a deus ex machina solution. Teenagers solving problems with a submarine and an electrical bazooka? How is that slice of life?That brings me to reason number 2 why I actually enjoyed it. As bad as it is, \'Happy Lesson\' has a decent opening, a surprisingly good OST and a catchy ending which just makes everything more absurd and inadvertently - hilarious.With all that in mind, I am rating it fairly. The story is poor and so are the characters, art is good, the sound is very good and I laughed my ass off. I\'d say that\'s a 5. Moreover I will watch the second season and grab the OST because ironically, the entertainment value here is really really high. bad.

It was interesting to see each teachers motivations and to see what makes each of them so unique.I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the teachers and why they chose to become the mom of this one particular boy, but I was not impressed by the stories and reasons.Some of the reasons seemed quite stupid while only one of them seemed natural and genuine.Sometimes there would be family quarrels and it felt nice to know that my own family wasn't so dysfunctional.~Sound 7/10~As a musician I usually notice background music, but in this case, I don't remember any.The character voices were done well, but I can't say the same for the English dub.It is overly common to find some of the characters having really high pitched voices and I've become used to that fact.Overall, I enjoyed the show because it was cute and a little romantic.

I hated and enjoyed this anime at the same time and up until now I didn\'t even know something like that was possible. This anime is every cliched joke, every cardboard cut-out character and every predictable plot point that has been done to death by a 100 animes before it - jammed into a 13 episode series. I knew very well that being a harem and a romcom I wasn\'t going to see anything profound, but never in my wildest dreams, would I have expected it to be this...bad. Yet ridiculously, like a 5 year old at a sweet-stall, I enjoyed it.The story... no wait there is no story here. It\'s just a single male character with 5 young, infantile looking women and lots and I mean lots of cliched jokes and of course sexual innuendo. The women in question turn out to be the male lead\'s teachers and mothers at the same. To show you just how much the ""story"" sucks in this cliche-fest series I can tell you that even that single, most basic plot point that was established in episode 1 was not properly explained or in fact even covered at all. It\'s something along the lines of ""Hey do you want me to be your mom?"" - ""Yeh, whatever"".The male lead is a no dimensional character. In fact, his only parameter is to be smothered with affection by countless equally no dimensional female characters. I mean, I\'m gonna square with you guys here - there is no need for me to go into detail with the story or the characters because they\'re so banal they might have as well been invented by a cactus. It\'s just an episode after an episode of cliche jokes, sexual innuendo, fanservice, fake drama. In that order.That said, I did enjoy this series and indeed if you look at the breakdown of individual scores I gave this anime you\'ll see an 8 next to enjoyment. It\'s because it\'s so gobsmackingly bad that it crosses the barrier and goes straight into unintentional comedy. Two minuses are a positive and that\'s exactly what happened in here. I know very well that this anime isn\'t meant to be serious or that the makers never aspired to create a masterpiece out of it but it\'s even crap for an average harem romcom. And no, it\'s not a slice of life anime. Nothing presented here has anything to do with real life. So in a way you know it\'s bad but you can\'t help but to laugh at the poor writing. The ending is a testament to that. It starts out dramatically trying to be realistic and there\'s a build up of tension between the characters as they face an insurmountable problem, but then you\'re slapped in the face with a deus ex machina solution. Teenagers solving problems with a submarine and an electrical bazooka? How is that slice of life?That brings me to reason number 2 why I actually enjoyed it. As bad as it is, \'Happy Lesson\' has a decent opening, a surprisingly good OST and a catchy ending which just makes everything more absurd and inadvertently - hilarious.With all that in mind, I am rating it fairly. The story is poor and so are the characters, art is good, the sound is very good and I laughed my ass off. I\'d say that\'s a 5. Moreover I will watch the second season and grab the OST because ironically, the entertainment value here is really really high. bad.

But in the end of the day, nothing really changes and everything is neatly tied back into a bow.Each teacher has a dedicated episode that seemed a little ridiculous.There are a lot of times where I didn't like what was going on because it seemed a little to much like a fantasy show.For example, there were robots and exotic animals and super frilly outfits that no teacher would ever be allowed to wear.It just seemed a little too much at times.~Art 8/10~The art is good, the backgrounds are well drawn and you get the usual frilly outfits, and extremely weird hair styles and hair colors.The characters are sometimes drawn in a very cute fashion making me want to continue watching the show and favoring certain characters that don't get much time or character development.~Character 8/10~Since each teacher had a dedicated episode it was a great chance to get lots of character development done. It was interesting to see each teachers motivations and to see what makes each of them so unique.I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the teachers and why they chose to become the mom of this one particular boy, but I was not impressed by the stories and reasons.Some of the reasons seemed quite stupid while only one of them seemed natural and genuine.Sometimes there would be family quarrels and it felt nice to know that my own family wasn't so dysfunctional.~Sound 7/10~As a musician I usually notice background music, but in this case, I don't remember any.The character voices were done well, but I can't say the same for the English dub.It is overly common to find some of the characters having really high pitched voices and I've become used to that fact.Overall, I enjoyed the show because it was cute and a little romantic. It made me envious, yet relieved that my family wasn't so dysfunctional. There is a lot of comedy, but most of it is overly obvious. The romance part of the show pulled at my heart strings, but I am very disappointed in the ending, you'll probably see why."", 'So check this out Happy Lesson is comedy anime but wasnt on my scale for the best anime i\'ve seen but then again theres worse. Basicly the plot is based on 5 teachers who live with an orphan and all try to become his mother and try to make him a better student through different methods. So nothing new right. Seen this in countless anime where a male character lives or are surronded with a bunch of female characters ex. Love Hina.Main characters are Chitose, the orpahn who moves in the house of his deceased parents. He trys to hide his feelings about his...""mothers"" but every now and then they leak.Mutsuki Ichimonji his homeroom teacher and usually cleans and cooks around the house. Shes pressures Chitose to study. At home she wears a maid outfit.Kisaragi Ninomai (personal favorite) she is the science teacher. She seems like shes emotionless but loves her son Chitose alot. You see that she experiments alot on Chitose.Yayoi Sanzenin is the nurse and priestess but the school doesnt know about that. She has a calm demeanor unless she senses danger and then puts her sword skills to work.Uzuki Shitenno is the art teacher and is small. She is for the most part is happy and cheerful. Shes usually wears wings because shes into cosplay.Satsuki Gokajo is the p.e teacher and is serious about her workouts. Shes loud and agressive but can be sweet.And those are the characters you will mostly encounter with the exceptions towards later episodes you will be introduced to Chitose adopted sisters, Minazuki his younger sis and Hazuki his older sis who is a famous singer. You also will be seeing the class rep Fumitsuki who has a crush on Chitose and becomes curious about Chitoses life outside school. Also Kanna Kisaragi childhood friend and develops a crush on him.As far as originality it doesnt set the bar but then agian not many anime do. You will follow Chitoses struggles with dealing with so many moms. The shenanigins that happen when living with moms who are so different from one another. How each ones method for making him a better student work out. The only thing that bothered me were the endings of each episode. They had a very ""after school special"" feeling to them.

I hated and enjoyed this anime at the same time and up until now I didn\'t even know something like that was possible. This anime is every cliched joke, every cardboard cut-out character and every predictable plot point that has been done to death by a 100 animes before it - jammed into a 13 episode series. I knew very well that being a harem and a romcom I wasn\'t going to see anything profound, but never in my wildest dreams, would I have expected it to be this...bad. Yet ridiculously, like a 5 year old at a sweet-stall, I enjoyed it.The story... no wait there is no story here. It\'s just a single male character with 5 young, infantile looking women and lots and I mean lots of cliched jokes and of course sexual innuendo. The women in question turn out to be the male lead\'s teachers and mothers at the same. To show you just how much the ""story"" sucks in this cliche-fest series I can tell you that even that single, most basic plot point that was established in episode 1 was not properly explained or in fact even covered at all. It\'s something along the lines of ""Hey do you want me to be your mom?"" - ""Yeh, whatever"".The male lead is a no dimensional character. In fact, his only parameter is to be smothered with affection by countless equally no dimensional female characters. I mean, I\'m gonna square with you guys here - there is no need for me to go into detail with the story or the characters because they\'re so banal they might have as well been invented by a cactus. It\'s just an episode after an episode of cliche jokes, sexual innuendo, fanservice, fake drama. In that order.That said, I did enjoy this series and indeed if you look at the breakdown of individual scores I gave this anime you\'ll see an 8 next to enjoyment. It\'s because it\'s so gobsmackingly bad that it crosses the barrier and goes straight into unintentional comedy. Two minuses are a positive and that\'s exactly what happened in here. I know very well that this anime isn\'t meant to be serious or that the makers never aspired to create a masterpiece out of it but it\'s even crap for an average harem romcom. And no, it\'s not a slice of life anime. Nothing presented here has anything to do with real life. So in a way you know it\'s bad but you can\'t help but to laugh at the poor writing. The ending is a testament to that. It starts out dramatically trying to be realistic and there\'s a build up of tension between the characters as they face an insurmountable problem, but then you\'re slapped in the face with a deus ex machina solution. Teenagers solving problems with a submarine and an electrical bazooka? How is that slice of life?That brings me to reason number 2 why I actually enjoyed it. As bad as it is, \'Happy Lesson\' has a decent opening, a surprisingly good OST and a catchy ending which just makes everything more absurd and inadvertently - hilarious.With all that in mind, I am rating it fairly. The story is poor and so are the characters, art is good, the sound is very good and I laughed my ass off. I\'d say that\'s a 5. Moreover I will watch the second season and grab the OST because ironically, the entertainment value here is really really high. bad.

Except this time with 5 of his teachers wanting to become his new mom.~Story 7/10~The story itself isn't very unique, but I did find some of the elements of the show to be very...entertaining and cute. Some of it had comedy and some of it was simply fan service.Just be warned, the harem fighting starts almost instantly and it is like being smacked in the face 10 seconds into the show.Most of the episodes usually cover some basic anime formula elements. There is a Hot Spring episode, two with school festivals, etc... But in the end of the day, nothing really changes and everything is neatly tied back into a bow.Each teacher has a dedicated episode that seemed a little ridiculous.There are a lot of times where I didn't like what was going on because it seemed a little to much like a fantasy show.For example, there were robots and exotic animals and super frilly outfits that no teacher would ever be allowed to wear.It just seemed a little too much at times.~Art 8/10~The art is good, the backgrounds are well drawn and you get the usual frilly outfits, and extremely weird hair styles and hair colors.The characters are sometimes drawn in a very cute fashion making me want to continue watching the show and favoring certain characters that don't get much time or character development.~Character 8/10~Since each teacher had a dedicated episode it was a great chance to get lots of character development done. It was interesting to see each teachers motivations and to see what makes each of them so unique.I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the teachers and why they chose to become the mom of this one particular boy, but I was not impressed by the stories and reasons.Some of the reasons seemed quite stupid while only one of them seemed natural and genuine.Sometimes there would be family quarrels and it felt nice to know that my own family wasn't so dysfunctional.~Sound 7/10~As a musician I usually notice background music, but in this case, I don't remember any.The character voices were done well, but I can't say the same for the English dub.It is overly common to find some of the characters having really high pitched voices and I've become used to that fact.Overall, I enjoyed the show because it was cute and a little romantic. It made me envious, yet relieved that my family wasn't so dysfunctional. There is a lot of comedy, but most of it is overly obvious. The romance part of the show pulled at my heart strings, but I am very disappointed in the ending, you'll probably see why. entertaining and cute.
