Busou Shinki Moon Angel,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11103/Busou_Shinki_Moon_Angel,"[""This is just my personal view after watching the first episode.It felt like it was a mish mash of everything. It was like they were trying to do everything. The first episode progressed very quickly and I felt that an extra 10min would have been better for the anime to set the scene. The fight scenes were good as they used many angles but the story just seems too far out. It felt like a parallel prequel to Chobits.There was a little cuteness here and there but not everything was clarified.Imagine watching OnePiece for the first time, Luffy is introduced and suddenly the rest...of his crew too. Your wondering who they are and how they met which they will explain in the later episodes but that just takes the fun out of gradually introducing each crew member.What I am trying to say is that it doesn't seem like a good anime but a little longer would have made it better and not make it feel like it was rushed and if this how the rest of the anime is set out then I might just 'kick the bucket' on this anime. of his crew too.

It had the poor boy who wanted to be the best.  The super-secret weapon that escapes.  The boy finds this weapon.  The weapon loses it\'s memory.  Weapon and boy become friends.  The weapon goes loses control and everyone is afraid of it.  Then the shop keeper who used to work at this top secret facility knows all about this weapon.  This weapon is part of a larger top-secret weapon.  Oh...heck, you get the picture.  It\'s all telegraphed if you\'ve seen many animes in your past.  Of course I\'m being generous with the ratings.  The only thing missing is the fan-service appeal.This series isn\'t horrible but it could have been better.  Who am I kidding, it couldn\'t.  We\'ve already seen this story in ""Angelic Layers"". heck, you get the picture.  It\'s all telegraphed if you\'ve seen many animes in your past.  Of course I\'m being generous with the ratings.

Bubblegum Crash,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1348/Bubblegum_Crash,"[""Bubblegum Crash seems to get overlooked pretty often. The Crisis OVA and 2040 already seem obscure enough especially around here at MAL and then Crash is just, completely lost in it's own void. Kind of a shame because Crash is certainly worth seeing if you're a fan of the OVA and new series. My review for 2040 was probably too big, so I'll keep this one a little on the shorter side. It could be a good read along with this review though.Crash is basically a direct continuation of the original OVA and it's completely obvious. The animation and everything in that aspect is the...same, with many improvements because it's newer - this made me second guess myself after saying I liked the redesigned characters in 2040, because Priss, Nena, Linna, and Sylia all looked really cool in this one. The cyberpunk setting is still very grim, dark, heavily detailed, like it rightfully should be! The music also retains its awesomeness from the original OVA, great 80's hair metal that you can't help but love if you grew up in the age. The BGM fits the mood and is great too. Oh and the opening is just downright awesome, timeless stuff!I've head some complaints about this one mainly geared towards the plot being a little contradicting against some events in the OVA. The only issue that might bother me here is that Priss could be a little out of character, with her constant attitude and decision with being a Knight Saber and fighting Boomers changing - but I have to ask, do you really go in watching Bubblegum Crisis for an in depth story and thought provoking characters? Not exactly, if you ask me...  that aside the characters reminded me a lot of how they act in 2040 pretty often. Priss can be pretty hotheaded, Nena is cheerful and weary that the Knight Sabers are breaking up, Linna is just all over the place, and Sylia is her mysterious self but shows a little more character towards the end. They're all fun and enjoyable characters.The three episodes do connect in the end. They're a little episodic, but 40 minutes pure episode isn't bad. The horrible events in episodes 1-2 eventually lead up to the finale, where a previous villian is brought back (one of the best ones from the OVA, with that being said some can maybe make a guess as to who that is). Though the show does get a little silly towards the end kind of like 2040 did, it tries a little too hard to be overly weird and thought provoking. But it's just part of the episode, rather than an entire story arc ... so it's not a huge complaint.Overall Bubblegum Crash is simply put, more Bubblegum Crisis, more Knight Sabers kicking ass, great cyberpunk settings, awesome old school music. It's always been something you shouldn't take TOO seriously, but if you go in just looking for some quick enjoyment with action/comedy this should deliver. If you're a fan of the OVA, 2040, and still haven't seen this - definitely give it a shot sometime. same, with many improvements because it's newer - this made me second guess myself after saying I liked the redesigned characters in 2040, because Priss, Nena, Linna, and Sylia all looked really cool in this one.

Where as Crisis had a unique opening scene for every episode of the series as well as a unique outro, Crash uses a stock opening and a plain credits. The animation is overall less impressive than Crisis' fantastic artwork, the violence is toned down and there are continuity errors particularly in the second episode.THAT ALL SAID - I enjoyed Crash a fair deal. No where near as much as Crisis, but it certainly is not awful. Continuity errors aside, each episode's story is fairly interesting and the...four Knight Sabers are as fun to see as always. It also provides an actual conclusion to the story, which gives Bubblegum an actual sense of closure after Crisis had its mother of all non-endings. There's still a few good cheesy songs as well (though nowhere as many as in Crisis) so the spirit is still there. All in all, Crash isn't a bad way to end the series on, and for all its flaws its still an enjoyable watching. At 3 episodes long, its not even that time consuming either, making a quick fast watch. four Knight Sabers are as fun to see as always.

It has a spetacular Opening, with great visuals and an awesome song. It had improved animation, whichi could only add for its awesomeness. But it lack one little very important thing: It lacked memory. It did not remember its own story. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mother of all Trainwrecks is here. This is the sequel that contradicts its original story. I have never heard of something like this before. This thing here gave birth to my first...Anime-Impulsed Facepalm.It\'s possible that you think that I am overreacting, since Bubblegum Crisis was created mostly as an action show, and for many people, plot is secundary. Well, you won\'t think so when you hear about what happens here.Story: 3 of 10You know what? The story wouldn\'t be that bad... If it weren\'t for the fact that it contradicts the story of the show it is supposed to be a sequel of. And not just any part of the story: IT CONTRADICTS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE SHOW!!! Let me break it down for you.1 - Boomers, GENOM\'s creation, are Cyborgs which are a junction of cybernetics, biotechnology and nanotechnology, that have multiple purposes. They have varying degrees of Inteligence, with many of them reaching sentience. This is particularly true for sexaroids, but present elsewhere. They are widespread, specially, it seems, in the Multiethnical Japan of 2032. Several of them go out of hand, and the Knights Sabers (our protagonists) are there to fight them, among other opponents). One of our protagonists (Priss) eventually befriends two of these (sexaroid) boomers, and fans will probably speculate about the relationship with one of them (probably just fan wank, though). These friendships are actually a key point in the story\'s most important arc.2 - The Big Bad, the leadership of the MegaCorp GENOM, is heavily present in the story. One of the villians from this corporation eventually transfers his consciousness to a Boomer body, and gains a God Complex. This is also a key point in the story\'s most important arc.There are other points to the story, but these are enough for what\'s about to come. So, how does our beloved sequel treat these facts? Here\'s How:1 - In 2034 (Crash setting), a top secret experiment consists of the first sentient boomer, who looks like a tin can... If I recall it right, in 2032 and 2033, SENTIENT BOOMERS ALREADY EXISTED, could be confused for Human, and in several cases, had artificial blood deposits. Now people could come to me and say: \'\'They were probably referring to the first sentient boomer that is entirely artificial\'\'. No they\'re not. They only mentioned boomers, and the fact that you could confuse this boomer for a human being on the phone was considered impressive... :( What just happened here? So, technology is lesser in 2034, and everyone forgot the previous years? First Facepalm.2 - Priss, one of out protagonists, befriended two sexaroids in Crisis. One year later, as if she hit her head somewhere, she doesn\'t seem to recall them, and outright claims to hate boomers. She has a change of heart with tin can later, but... What happened to Sylvie and Anri (the sexaroids)? And nobody else seems to remember anything either. Second Facepalm, in result of the first.3 - GENOM, so important to the narrative of Crisis, controler of even the Japanese Government, is absent from the story altogether, leaving only its gigantic tower behind. Never is the name GENOM uttered, nor is Quincy, the CEO ever mentioned again. Also, the city, with a notable divide between rich and poor, is suddenly cleaner... What happened in here? Third Facepalm.4 - But hey, if you think the main villian of Crisis woudn\'t show up, you\'re quite mistaken. The member of GENOM who resurrected as a boomer with a God Complex, who persoaded one sexaroid boomer that he would free boomers, and who fought Priss with said sexaroid nearby... IS BACK!!! And according to his words, he\'s back to settle unfinished business... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!? This is too much to take in. It\'s messing my mind up as I write this review. It\'s awful. Fourth Facepalm, in virtue of all the others.And you know what\'s the worst part? There are parts of this story that were actually usable. What a waste.Art: 8The art was spetacular. It was the sharpest art in all of the early Bubblegum Crisis franchise. It was awesome. Bright colours, a well drawn cyberpunk setting, great action animation, etc. It even has a spetacular Opening Animation. It still doesn\'t make up for anything though.Sound: 6It brings us an awesome OP song, and three forgettable ones. It has a mostly unimpressive soundtrack... The OST is a shadow of Bubblegum Crisis\' diverse OST, which is awesome to have. Also, while Crisis\' cast was fine before, which even some seiyuu who would appear in other prominent roles, in Crash, Priss\' seiyuu is replaced, and her work wasn\'t that great. Still, she sang the awesome OP and with some effort, she would\'ve made it. She just didn\'t, though. No offense to her.Character: 4I mentioned Priss\' amnesia regarding 2032-2033, right? Priss\' unexplainable hatred of boomers. I shall also mention how Priss dropped her interest in Rock music, disbanded her band, and... tried to record a pop album... Yeah... Also, Linna, another protagonist, seems to not have evolved her character after past events, but because such events were not mentioned on this review, lets not go any further... This is just a part of a whole. Everyone\'s \'\'amnesia\'\' decreases their worth as characters. Sorry, that\'s how it goes.Enjoyment: 6The action saves it from a mediocre rating, and so does the Opening and the Animation... But for all the reasons above, it doesn\'t go above 6.Overall Score is 5. A sequel that kills everything the original was is too lucky for having such a high score.

A sequel that kills everything the original was is too lucky for having such a high score.', 'To speak frankly, one of the reasons that made me watch crisis, other than having the series in my want list since ages ago, was the fact that I had bought the DVD some time ago and it was getting old in the shelve.With Crash we pick up again the series some months after the last episode and events of Crisis. It is now 2033 and Megatokyo has become more dangerous and AD Police is getting it’s hands tied because of political powers from above. The Saber Knights are nowhere to be found and the city is collapsing. Then… Naturally of course they’ll turn around...again to save the day.In these OVAs we had some improvements regarding the first OVA, like Nene, she’s pretty more dependable now than she ever was.And also some bad points, while Nene became a dependable character, Priss on the other side, became a more shallow character, unfortunately.There’s also the Seyuu of Priss, which was the best of the first OVA and here she had left the task to pursue her singing career leaving a new seyuu for the character, but she still managed to sing for the opening and ending songs of the anime, it was still pretty cool.All in all it was a nice way to end the series. I’ve read before the two OVAs were intended to be a series, but I don’t know how they ended up being two OVAs instead. Perhaps they had lost some story in that transmission and some episodes didn’t went as well as others, but they’re still good episodes.Rate; 7.0 again to save the day.In these OVAs we had some improvements regarding the first OVA, like Nene, she’s pretty more dependable now than she ever was.And also some bad points, while Nene became a dependable character, Priss on the other side, became a more shallow character, unfortunately.There’s also the Seyuu of Priss, which was the best of the first OVA and here she had left the task to pursue her singing career leaving a new seyuu for the character, but she still managed to sing for the opening and ending songs of the anime, it was still pretty cool.All in all it was a nice way to end the series.

Bubblegum Crash continues the awesome formula of the original series: Blade Runner style setting, bombardment of 80s culture, brilliant colours, corporations running amok with technology and cute girls laying waste to berserk boomers and cool hardsuits. However, the continuity is messed up so bad you'd wonder if the whole group of writers just suddenly suffered from amnesia!As standalone stories, the plot is standard, entertaining fare for retro cyberpunk anime. Cool fights happen, there's an overarching plot involving people trying to use boomers in a grand scheme to wreak havoc...and perhaps not as much character development as one would like; all just like the original ova. However, so many things just don't match up with the original. The huge overarching plot about this ova is the coming of second generation boomers; more human like, far more intelligent and able to mingle with humans. Except, standard boomers could already do all of that in the first ova! Also, supposed 'combat boomers' are much more humanoid in this ova and have far less combat capabilities than an average boomer mook in the original (being robots with guns as opposed to hulking gorilla mechs with laser cannons in their mouths) Its great that boomers have more of a purpose in Bubblegum Crash, being separated as worker and combat class models as opposed to killing machines in human skin but its just confusing when a boomer made for prostitution from AD Police (which happens even before Bubblegum Crisis) is deadlier than a combat boomer here! Other confusing things is the complete lack of the Genom corporation who were the big bad guys of Crisis; some sequel this is! Lastly, Priss also hates boomers which provides an opportunity for character development, except she had boomer friends in the original ova!Speaking of characters, one thing the continuity didn't mess up is that overall, our main heroines have their personalities carried over intact. The whole crew also had suit upgrades so they have more fire power (or less? they seem to have less attacks now; the exploding punches are GONE!). Nene is now useful in combat, yay! But at the cost of Leon being sorta useless now. The main villain of the first half of Bubblegum Crisis also makes it over as the main villain for Crash. Character development isn't a lot (but at least Linna finally gets some) but that that is to be expected for a 3 OVA series. The 9 rating is for the gorgeous character designs and lively personalities to be honest, what else do you need for a fun anime like this?The art is far up there as far as 90s ova's are concerned; its Bubblegum after all. Mechanical designs are sweet as to be expected. And animation is consistently smooth.Music? Bubblegum Crash isn't so music oriented as Crisis unfortunately. I think only the opening and ending themes have Prisses' voice talent. The the two themes are above average AOR rockers. There is a bunch of synth jazz in there too. 80s music I suppose.Overall, watch this with a casual mindset and do not compare it to the original but rather as a spin off of sorts and you'll have fun! Lots of fun! and perhaps not as much character development as one would like; all just like the original ova. However, so many things just don't match up with the original.

Lots of fun!"", ""I've reviewed two instalments in\xa0 this franchise. The first being Bubblegum Crisis and the second being the AD Police spin-off, which was garbage. Now it's time to look at the sequel that came out from mid to late '91, Bubblegum Crash. Let's hope it's more like Crisis and doesn't resemble AD.Story:We open with an armoured vehicle full of mech suits committing a robbery. The AD Police are called to the scene, but since the culprit isn't an over-sexed, creepy woman, they're useless. The mech suits escape. We soon join the Knight Sabers, Nene, Linna & Priss. Nene wants the three of them to get their...suits and do something about the robberies since the AD Police are useless but Linna is making a fortune with stocks and Priss is about to get a record deal and the pair talk about the Sabers like a thing of the past. Sylia soon returns and the fire gets lit under both Priss and Linna. But there's more to these robberies than meets the eye and the Sabers quickly find themselves embroiled in a major plot.The biggest story issue with this is that the OVA wastes far too much time with the AD Police. And their contribution is pretty much sitting on their asses and otherwise being ineffectual. Very few of their scenes actually do anything for the narrative. They're mostly just boring. It feels like the OVA only included them to advertise that shit spin off. Another issue I have is that the climactic reveal of the antagonist could have been foreshadowed and generally handled better. It ends up being a bit weak.With that out of the way, the narrative does a good job of building things up. The situations the Sabers face are developed well and they have a good amount of tension behind them. The OVA also does a good job of tying all the scenarios together in a way that gives every episode a satisfying conclusion while also seguing into the next. It's also good at balancing triumph, tragedy & bitter-sweet moments. It's just, overall, highly entertaining and compelling.Characters:The best character moments we get involve the Sabers themselves. Their interactions are very strong and we get a good sense of their personalities. I also appreciate that the antagonist does have a pretty well defined motivation. There are some great side characters as well, notably Adama. The AD Police are the weakest part but even then Leon & Daley are pretty well fleshed out characters. They're far better in this than they were in that OVA where Leon was the main character. And yes, I do have to keep taking jabs at AD Police.Art:The series looks quite good. It's well animated, the backgrounds are nicely done, the general aesthetic is strong and the action scenes are damn good. The designs remain a very strong element. Seeing the Sabers go into action against various threats is a treat. I will also give this OVA some credit over even Crisis, it has a lot less fan-service.Sound:Hiramatsu Akiko, Sakakibara Yoshiko & Tomizawa Michie all reprise their roles and do fantastically. Oomori Kinuko quit voice acting work to be a full time singer, unless my information on that is wrong & Priss does get a new actress with Tachikawa Ryoko. Tachikawa does a good job, maybe not quite as good but it's a strong performance.\xa0Crash\xa0also brings back the amazing soundtrack with some great songs being used during the action sequences.Ho-yay:There isn't really any. The OVA doesn't really have romance period. Which is fine because not everything needs to have it.Areas of Improvement:Take out the bulk of the AD Police scenes. While there are a few that actually serve a purpose, most of them just come across as pointless.Use some of that extra time to give some more hints about the identity of the big bad. Like I said, the OVA would have benefited from foreshadowing that better.Use the rest of that time for some more interactions amongst the Sabers. Because the scenes where Nene, Priss, Linna & sometimes Sylia are just spending time together are really good.Final Thoughts:Crash\xa0is exactly what you would want from a follow up to\xa0Crisis.\xa0It features strong action, great interactions and an interesting narrative that keeps your attention. If you're even somewhat a fan of Bubblegum Crisis\xa0I would highly recommend checking it out. If you haven't seen Crisis but the idea of super heroines in robotic suits appeals to you, I would watch that first since this OVA definitely builds off of it. I'll give Crash an 8/10. Same as Crisis. suits and do something about the robberies since the AD Police are useless but Linna is making a fortune with stocks and Priss is about to get a record deal and the pair talk about the Sabers like a thing of the past. Sylia soon returns and the fire gets lit under both Priss and Linna. But there's more to these robberies than meets the eye and the Sabers quickly find themselves embroiled in a major plot.The biggest story issue with this is that the OVA wastes far too much time with the AD Police. And their contribution is pretty much sitting on their asses and otherwise being ineffectual. Very few of their scenes actually do anything for the narrative. They're mostly just boring. It feels like the OVA only included them to advertise that shit spin off. Another issue I have is that the climactic reveal of the antagonist could have been foreshadowed and generally handled better. It ends up being a bit weak.With that out of the way, the narrative does a good job of building things up. The situations the Sabers face are developed well and they have a good amount of tension behind them. The OVA also does a good job of tying all the scenarios together in a way that gives every episode a satisfying conclusion while also seguing into the next. It's also good at balancing triumph, tragedy & bitter-sweet moments. It's just, overall, highly entertaining and compelling.Characters:The best character moments we get involve the Sabers themselves. Their interactions are very strong and we get a good sense of their personalities. I also appreciate that the antagonist does have a pretty well defined motivation. There are some great side characters as well, notably Adama. The AD Police are the weakest part but even then Leon & Daley are pretty well fleshed out characters. They're far better in this than they were in that OVA where Leon was the main character. And yes, I do have to keep taking jabs at AD Police.Art:The series looks quite good. It's well animated, the backgrounds are nicely done, the general aesthetic is strong and the action scenes are damn good. The designs remain a very strong element. Seeing the Sabers go into action against various threats is a treat. I will also give this OVA some credit over even Crisis, it has a lot less fan-service.Sound:Hiramatsu Akiko, Sakakibara Yoshiko & Tomizawa Michie all reprise their roles and do fantastically. Oomori Kinuko quit voice acting work to be a full time singer, unless my information on that is wrong & Priss does get a new actress with Tachikawa Ryoko. Tachikawa does a good job, maybe not quite as good but it's a strong performance.\xa0Crash\xa0also brings back the amazing soundtrack with some great songs being used during the action sequences.Ho-yay:There isn't really any. The OVA doesn't really have romance period. Which is fine because not everything needs to have it.Areas of Improvement:Take out the bulk of the AD Police scenes. While there are a few that actually serve a purpose, most of them just come across as pointless.Use some of that extra time to give some more hints about the identity of the big bad. Like I said, the OVA would have benefited from foreshadowing that better.Use the rest of that time for some more interactions amongst the Sabers. Because the scenes where Nene, Priss, Linna & sometimes Sylia are just spending time together are really good.Final Thoughts:Crash\xa0is exactly what you would want from a follow up to\xa0Crisis.\xa0It features strong action, great interactions and an interesting narrative that keeps your attention. If you're even somewhat a fan of Bubblegum Crisis\xa0I would highly recommend checking it out. If you haven't seen Crisis but the idea of super heroines in robotic suits appeals to you, I would watch that first since this OVA definitely builds off of it. I'll give Crash an 8/10. Same as Crisis."", 'To keep this pretty quick, if you liked Bubblegum Crisis there is really no reason not to watch Bubblegum Crash. I have seen a lot of negative reviews and I think they are completely unfounded. This basically takes the formula from Crisis and repeats it for 3 more episodes while giving the series a more solid ending than what Crisis gave it. Also, you get a little more insight into the characters and how the end of their story would play out. The intro is pretty awesome (far better than Crisis); it has a more rockin tune and better production value. All in all, a...solid little ending to the series that anyone who is a fan of Crisis should watch, if nothing more for completeness sake. solid little ending to the series that anyone who is a fan of Crisis should watch, if nothing more for completeness sake.', ""Whether you're a fan of the Bubblegum Crisis franchise,a cyberpunk fan or even just a casual anime viewer this anime has something to offer.After the events of the original ova the knight sabers have all moved on and taken new directions with their life's while leaving their superhero past.Priss after being signed by a record label is overjoyed over the prospect of being a professional singer.Linna works for the financial district and have found a new passion besides fighting,making money.Nene still work for AD Police and is the only one that truly misses the knight sabers. And Sylia whereabouts is unknown.Trouble brews as rogue criminals...armed with the latest suit technology are going on a rampage through the city in a diabolical scheme to use the latest AI technology in their plot of terror.I really enjoyed this anime,each episode followed the same plot and the pacing was excellent.The characters were  realistic which each having their own distinguishable personality.There some nice humor especially in the second episode.Being an early nineties anime the animation showed its limitation in terms of detail and is by no means the best animation of that period but was still pretty decent.The opening music was nice but otherwise nothing musically inspiring about this.Overall a fun high energy ova that's worth your time. armed with the latest suit technology are going on a rampage through the city in a diabolical scheme to use the latest AI technology in their plot of terror.I really enjoyed this anime,each episode followed the same plot and the pacing was excellent.The characters were  realistic which each having their own distinguishable personality.There some nice humor especially in the second episode.Being an early nineties anime the animation showed its limitation in terms of detail and is by no means the best animation of that period but was still pretty decent.The opening music was nice but otherwise nothing musically inspiring about this.Overall a fun high energy ova that's worth your time."", ""Bubblegum Crash is a fairly decent companion piece to its prequel that - despite being episodic - still manages to continue the plot established in the previous series and does wrap up the narrative. Frankly speaking though, the story throughout most of the series is rather lackluster and forgettable when the focus is placed on the B plots of each episode.With everything else in regards to the visuals, soundtrack, and characters, it's all good to even great in some instances - especially for fans of the original. All the old cast is back and their interactions are always amusing. The aesthetic has a very retro...80s vibe and it's paired together with a nice pop/rock ost to fit the mood.This OVA has some great moments in it, but it's sometimes a slog to get to them and that's ultimately what keeps holding Bubblegum Crash from being something that I'd wholly recommend without first giving warning. 80s vibe and it's paired together with a nice pop/rock ost to fit the mood.This OVA has some great moments in it, but it's sometimes a slog to get to them and that's ultimately what keeps holding Bubblegum Crash from being something that I'd wholly recommend without first giving warning."", 'I’m actually glad that most reviews of Crash! are generally more positive than I thought they would be - I’ve seen this iteration of the franchise shit on so many dang times, even by Kenichi Sonoda himself, and it baffles me that this show has a lower rating overall than 2040. 2040 is terrible! Sure, Crash ain’t perfect, but I will say this much: In spite of having many of the strengths of its prequel series Crisis cut away from it - like any sort of lasting canon around character development, high-quality art, consistently good 80’s music, Priss’s VA, etc etc etc. - Crash! does...its damnedest to play to the strengths of Crisis rather than the weaknesses, and for the most part it succeeds, even managing to pile up some stuff that I wish the original series had managed to play around with.A bit of context before I get going, though: Bubblegum Crisis was made by 3 companies in a joint venture, but Crash was the result of all those companies parting ways and one of them (ARTMIC) trying to continue the series without key elements and the long-term timetable the series usually had. They put 3 episodes out in six months before one of the other companies (Youmex) sued them into bankruptcy, etc. So that’s why, amidst all the copyright issues, GENOM isn’t mentioned, Priss’s VA is different (but not necessarily worse if you ask me!) and only the vaguest sense of continuity carries over, because they couldn’t explicitly reference episodes whose rights they didn’t technically own. Regardless:Story: Story has never been the franchise’s strongest suit, in no small part because of the seat-of-pants production methods even the original series went through, with directors changing almost every episode towards the end of the original OVA’s run. And that’s fine, actually. Like most superhero stories, BGC is at its best when it lets its characters play to their archetype and run around and kick ass and blow stuff up in a generally cohesive narrative background. And for the most part Crash! achieves this. The four Sabers are still largely themselves. Sylia may be a little softer in her methods, Priss may be more generically grumpy (she apparently hates Boomers now for some vague reason despite having gotten pretty close to banging one), but now Nene - yes, Nene, the cute hacker one - is the moral glue who keeps the team together in the first episode, which is refreshing! It takes the best parts of her character from Scoop Chase and builds on that moral pride she has as an ADP desk jockey, the kind of pride Priss and Linna just don’t have. (Oh, and Linna gets a bit more development of her money-crazed character. She’s one-note, yes, but it’s a good kind of one note. Like I said, playing to archetypes). The whole first episode is cliche, but in a good way, in that it’s the Sabers getting back together to kick some powersuited merc’s to the curb with minimal bitchiness from the involved parties. It’s not hitting the emotional highs of the back half of the original series, but it’s getting there.The second episode plays to a strength of Crash! that Crisis actually doesn’t have. Namely, it focuses intensely on Boomers. Boomers were always just kind of there in Crisis, the issues around killer robots and the like coming in and out of focus based on what the director that time around wanted to focus on. Here, though, they’re everywhere, an integral part of life not just as Terminators which pop out of their skin, but as civilian labor. GENOM’s absence notwithstanding, this makes sense, provides a grounding, however weak, to the world that wasn’t really there in Crisis. Episode 2 focuses on a cute little super-intelligent Boomer who as far as continuity goes makes no sense - weren’t Boomers already pretty much Turing-Test-passable? - but the action scenes that he as a MacGuffin cause, with Priss and him running around Megatokyo’s underground trying to dodge a gang of Boomer terrorists and getting into various exotic firefights, are worth the goofiness. Hell, if you take it alone, I’d argue episode two is the best of the bunch.Episode three, on the other hand, tries desperately to a) be all hardsuit-action, all the time, b) tie up the loose story threads previous episodes of both Crisis and Crash! were generally content to leave hanging, and c) bring back Largo for the second fucking time. It’s a mess on most levels - the action scenes aren’t exciting, the plot outline is barely coherent, Sylia almost gets turned into Instrumentality by Largo, it all kind of feels like the ending of 2040 and not in a good way. The less said about Melt Down the better.Art: Crash’s art isn’t as good as Crisis’s art. Not even close, on several levels. Megatokyo feels more utopian-futuristic and less gritty and grimy the way the initial parts of Crisis did, though admittedly the city did seem to slip towards that more optimistic aesthetic over time; color is darker and less vivid; the whole art style feels barebones, lacking the detail of an OVA put together with more time and money. Some say the mecha designs, having been done by a toy designer instead of Sonoda and company, are lacking, but I actually like the new Hardsuits and the Knight Wing, and to a lesser degree the new Boomers (especially Largo’s final-boss forms). Admittedly, the action scenes in which they are involved are significantly less kinetic, more the usual low-budget firing-all-weapons-at-enemy-while-they-dodge-in-another-shot kinda stuff, but even then getting the Sabers hardware that can actually wreck their foes pretty hard - even for dear, sweet, precious Nene - is a good trend, one that 2040 completely ignores to its detriment. I personally like Geo Climbers’ running firefights between Priss and various breeds of terrorist Boomer, but your mileage may vary there. You won’t get anything as cool as Priss vs. the crab-mech from episode seven, but I think you’ll be surprised.Sound: Sound effects are still generally okay, but the magic of 80’s music has been swapped out for a generally more early-90’s sort of synthesizer-jazz mixed with overwrought dramatic pieces that try to emulate Danny Elfman’s soundtrack for the Burton Batman movies. The few vocal songs that Ryoko Tachikawa, and eventually the other Sabers, aren’t bad, though, they’re just not really well-integrated into the episode openings as they were in Crisis. More’s the pity, too. Musical openings were always one of the series strengths if you ask me.Overall: I guess the most I can say about Crash is that it isn’t as bad as everyone thinks it is. Even with less budget and less bottled-lightning magic available to ARTMIC under a time crunch, Crash still manages to hit the highs of what is good about Crisis: Cute girls in power armor whooping Boomer ass in high-octane fight scenes mixed with sci-fi slice-of-life. And really, what more could you ask for in a series, even one marred by episodes as nonsensical as the third one? Well, if you like 2040, you might say ‘deep analysis of the relationship between man and machine’.And you would be wrong. So. Fucking.

I particularly liked the second episode with an advanced Boomer that has a human-level A.I. The big plus this has over the original is I think the characteristics of the four main girls are far more defined; they all have more well-rounded personalities. I also can't figure out why most sources claim the series was cut short due to legal issues, as the 3rd episode felt like a pretty satisfying conclusion to me. Sure, the series is way more lighthearted than the original, but I honestly...can't see why any fans with an open mind couldn't find some enjoyment in this. can't see why any fans with an open mind couldn't find some enjoyment in this.""]"
Burn Up Excess,https://myanimelist.net/anime/370/Burn_Up_Excess,"[""This series has a little common with its predecessors. The cast is the same of Burn Up W, but Excess lacks of the action that this one has. Instead of this, in Burn Up Excess the main subject is the humor. This isn't an action anime, like any person could think before watching it, it is full of weird characters, weird jokes, extremely ridiculous situations, fan service, and a bit of action and fights. I recommend it only for fans of the Burn Up W characters, and it must be watched just for fun. Don't expect so much more. "", ""I personally find this series much better than Burn Up W.(In comparison to Burn UP W)OVERALL:the episodes are much more broad in origin; they aren't just restricted to the cops fighting crimes, they are more interactive amongst other characters and people.It's also funnier. The jokes are much more outrageous and will get you cracking up, although most of them are sex jokes and are centered around Rio being a blonde stereotype. if you don't get offended by this show's crude humor, you will find this show hilarious.it is an equal blend of comedy, action and also a bit of drama.STORYLINE:it's clever how generally every...crime Team Warrior encounter all tie together. they all contribute to unfolding the storyline, (without ruining it for those who haven't watched it) it is all an unraveling from the past one of the members of Team Warrior which makes it quite intriguing,  and generally interesting without getting too dark and emotional. so it won't stir you up.CHARACTERS:the characters are much more unique. every main character has their own personality and are more refined. although in Burn Up W, Rio, Lilica, Yuji, Maki and Nanvel are practically the same. You get to see more of Nanvel and get to know her character better.Also, the section chief seems more like a boss in Exess, in 'W' he is also perverted just like Yuji, so it's kind of just repeating his character. He also makes the show funny by calling Rio 'rookie' and making her appear as mischievous and annoying.also bringing in a wide range of different characters gives the show more broad personalities, involving more cops, suspects, and people they encounter along the way. And all of them are anything but normal. which gives the show more hilarious textures.REGION:Bringing in various regions like the Sahari Desert, Osaka, and also representatives from different countries, gives the show more culture, and it keeps the storyline outside of Neo-Tokyo, so that it isn't so predictable.CONCLUSION:Although this show is Generic Japanese Anime, it deserves praise for how well it is put together and the entertainment value, there are also meaningful messages in some episodes that will help you appreciate it. crime Team Warrior encounter all tie together. they all contribute to unfolding the storyline, (without ruining it for those who haven't watched it) it is all an unraveling from the past one of the members of Team Warrior which makes it quite intriguing,  and generally interesting without getting too dark and emotional. so it won't stir you up.CHARACTERS:the characters are much more unique. every main character has their own personality and are more refined. although in Burn Up W, Rio, Lilica, Yuji, Maki and Nanvel are practically the same.

Excess is my introduction to the Burn Up! franchise, so I will not be comparing it to previous or later entries; that will come when I watching the original OVA, W, and Scramble! Excess is an uncouth ecchi/comedy with a heart of gold. There\'s an agency that employs female armed forces, that assemble to save the day Bubblegum Crisis style; but with a more hardened, foul-mouthed cop slant to the genre, diverging from its forerunners in sheer lewdness. Strap on your seatbelts and be prepared to read about an unapologetically vulgar, action-packed series with a sprinkle of otaku humor mixed into the concoction!This...review of Burn Up! Excess is spoiler free!—Story/CharactersSynopsis: Follows the exploits of Team Warrior, a special anti-terror wing of the Neo-Tokyo Police force. Team Warrior is comprised of the habitually broke Rio, gun-crazy Maya, computer specialist Lillica, tech-expert Nanvel, pilot/voyeur Yūji, and is led by the enigmatic Maki. The team faces a number of missions, ranging from bodyguard duty, breaking up robbery and arms rackets, and providing security for a very powerful tank. Rio and company continually thwart the terrorist aims of Ruby, an operative for a shadowy cabal of powerful men. Before the final showdown, the circumstances behind the formation of Team Warrior, how the precocious Rio came to join it, and Maki\'s painful past will be revealed.Burn Up! Excess is full of lowbrow humor and old otaku references that wouldn\'t make it very popular today, especially when it has a questionable portrayal of transgendered people. I would have been okay with them just sticking to the plot of a group of transgender women collaborating together in an elaborate jewel heist to be able to get sex changes ""in Morocco"" (the ADV dub). The issue with it arises, when the least passable one, she has a cartoonishly chiseled jawline, tries to rape Rio every few episodes. Calling her Stephanie, and saying that he still has a functioning penis. That\'s not the most flattering picture of a pre-op transgendered woman.With that outdated part out of the way, let\'s get into the meat and bones of the story! Most of the vignettes play out like a Dirty Pair episode, like when Rio flirts with an Arabian oil tycoon because she wants to pay off a massive amount of debt, but then crazy hijinks ensure and her plan gets foiled. Or when Rio is assigned a mission to protect a pop star that\'s being harassed by a stalker, the two of them get into a cat fight because Yūji (Rio\'s perverted co-worker) is lusting after the aforementioned pop star, and then they end up being friends!The voice direction in the dub is done so well that there were several scenes that were so funny, that I started crying from laughter. Particularly in Episode 7: Short Vacation! That one was a gut-buster. It\'s impossible not to like the brash, insensitive Rio and the show tries to make her the primary focus. Despite it having a colorful cast of pretty girls, characters like Lilica and my best girl, Nanvel; these women don\'t get enough time to shine, compared to the show-runner. It\'s identical to how Priss steals the show in Bubblegum Crisis.There are a lot of series referenced in Burn Up! Excess, including:* Sailor Moon* Kaiji* Hokuto no Ken* Neon Genesis Evangelion* Golden Boy* Tokimeki Memorial* To HeartThere\'s even a shot-for-shot recreation of Unit 01 fighting Sachiel in Episode 8: Nanvel Kidnapped, and Nanvel says, shortly after the scene has transitioned, ""I mustn\'t run away!""—TechnicalShinichirō Kimura (director)* Chiccha na Yukitsukai Sugar, localized as ""A Little Snow Fairy Sugar""* Chocolat no Mahō (OVA)* Cosplay Complex* Fight, One Shot!

In the mid-2000s, I really hated shows like Maburaho and Karin. Maburaho is notably one of the most wretched series I have ever seen. Despite that, he did well with the Burn Up! franchise, it may have been the script-writing that saved the day, but compared to his later TV anime debuts, this one is among the best; if not, the best. Shinichirō Kimura seems to thrive in the ecchi and heavily moe-centric subgenre of the otaku fandom.John Ledford (executive producer), ADV dubs that he produced:Good Dub: ✅Bad Dub: ❌The series that I haven\'t seen in English are left blank.* 009-1* Ah!

Keep in mind, Mr. Ledford has overseen the localization of hentai OVAs, too, so I don\'t know if the comedy comes from that area of expertise, or just an inherent genius in transcribing lewd scripts. Either way, the English dub deserves to earn an award!Yūji Ikeda (animation director, character design)* Arslan Senki (art director)* Please Save My Earth (art director)* Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: Fūin Sealed Card (art director)* CLAMP School Detectives (art director)* Di Gi Charat (art director)* Dragon Ball (character design)* Dragon Ball Z (character design)* Fushigi Yûgi (art director)* Gensōmaden Saiyūki (art director)* Gosenzo-sama Banbanzai!

I wasn\'t sure if I was particularly going to like the style in this series, because the protagonist Rio, has the big-hair syndrome that is prevalent in a lot of other \'90s anime series. But, coupled with the animation style and the angling of the shots, the designs are very charming and expressive!Toshifumi Takizaki (script)* Big Wars (director)* Crusher Joe OVA (director)* Cyborg 009 (episode director)* Densetsu Kyojin Ideon (episode director)* Dirty Pair (director)* Dirty Pair: Flight 005 Conspiracy (director)* Samurai 7 (director)* Seisenshi Dunbine OVA (director)Commentary: Mr. Takizaki is a very big name in the industry, mainly known as working on storyboards for really famous mecha series, like Sōkō Kihei Votoms and Kidō Senshi Zēta Gundam. The writing and the storyboarding in this series is very clean and succinct, it goes to show that having a veteran in the industry on a project can bring a series to life.Mitsuyo Suenaga (script)* Cobra: The Animation (script)* Cross Game (script)* Patalliro (script)Commentary: From the series I\'ve watched, that he\'s had involvement with, Cobra: The Animation and Paralliro both have snappy comedic timing and a certain quirkiness to their scripts. Burn Up! Excess conveys that same kind of snarky humor.I watched Burn Up! Excess with the ADV dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors. An interesting tidbit about this particular series is that it also has an Italian and Spanish dub!Yuka Imai as Rio Kinezono, notable roles:* Scarlet Ohara, Wedding Peach* Renamon, Digimon Tamers* Marie Ange, Doki Doki PreCure* Yū Hayakawa, Final Fantasy: Unlimited* Eiko Randō, Geobreeders 2* Misaki Matsuya, Excel Saga* Nabuca, Now and Then, Here and There* Yuki, Ojamajo Doremi* Futaba Āsu, Puni Puni ☆ Poemii* Otaru Mamiya, Saber Marionette J* Junior Virey, Saber Marionette R* Eden Orion, Saint Seiya Omega* Jinto Linn, Seikai no Monshō* Wakaba Shinohara, Shōjo Kakumei Utena* Tomochika Shibuya, Uta no☆Prince-sama♪Amanda Winn Lee as Rio Kinezono, notable roles:* Mimiru, .hack//SIGN* Momiji Fujimiya, Blue Seed* Reimi, Burn Up!* Pandy, Dead Leaves* Mika Seido, Geneshaft* Gally, Battle Angel Alita* Rally Vincent, Gunsmith Cats* Rei Ayanami, Neon Genesis Evangelion* Yukiko Amagi, Persona 4: The Animation* Titaniva Mu Koshigaya, Plastic Little* Nancy Makuhari, R.O.D: Read or Die* Saki Asamiya, Sukeban DekaCommentary: Amanda Winn Lee has always been a favorite voice actor of mine. She always gives a clear, earnest performance and her role in Burn Up! Excess is no different. Rio is a lazy, good-for-nothing, self-serving jerk—who\'s likable, despite her insufferable demeanor. Watching her character interact with people and the world around her, is like watching an episode of Seinfeld. Ms. Lee makes the character true to her vices, but immensely likable and funny, at the same time. Great performance!Maya Okamoto as Maya Jingu, notable roles:* Megumi Amano, Chōjin Densetsu Urotsukidōji* Lambda Nom, Haja Taisei Dangaiō* Haruka Minato, Kidō Senkan Nadesico* Fanna, Armed Dragon Fantasy Villgust* Liza Hoyly, Macross Dynamite 7* Emma Sheen, Kidō Senshi Zēta Gundam* Orihime Soletta, Sakura Taisen* Yuki Saiko, Silent MöbiusLani Minella as Maya Jingu, notable roles:* Dolce Saito, Geneshaft* Rouge the Bat, Sonic the HedgehogCommentary: Ms. Minella is very good at making Maya have a fractious, tougher than nails, tomboyish demeanor with a slightly Southern inflection coupled with it. I didn\'t understand the casting choice completely, until Episode 4: Gokudō Father, where it reveals that Maya is a country yokel, whose father is the leader of a biker gang. Lani Minella did a good job of expressing the subtle cadences of the character\'s voice. Great job, Ms. Minella!Sakura Tange as Lilica Ebett, notable roles:* Sakura Kinamoto, Cardcaptor Sakura* Jack the Ripper (Assassin), Fate/Apocrypha* Nero Claudius (Saber), Fate/Extra: Last Encore* Mill Varna, Maze☆Bakunetsu JikūKimberly Yates as Lilica Ebett, notable roles:* Yuka, Burn Up!* Leena, Dirty Pair Flash* May Hopkins, Gunsmith Cats* Azusa Kanzaki, Mamono Hunter Yōko* Yomiko Readman, R.O.D: Read or Die* May Jessica, Sol BiancaCommentary: I was less impressed with Ms. Yate\'s performance than some of the others. Her voice just sounded like a Monica Rial-esque, nasally, high-pitched character impression. I am not typically a fan of the simplicity used to voice feminine, or young-sounding, characters in English dubs. Though, Rial did a really good job voicing Lumière in Kiddy Grade.Yuri Amano as Nanvel Candlestick, notable roles:* Berthier and CereCere, Sailor Moon* Mother Togashi, Chūnibyō demo Koi ga Shitai!* Kallen\'s Mother, Code Geass* Kawai Kawai, Iczer-Girl Iczelion* Aki Kokonoe (Rin\'s Mother), Kodomo no Jikan* Alcyone, Magic Knight Rayearth* Rain Mikamura, Mobile Fighter G Gundam* Yuriko Star, Musekinin Kanchō Tylor* Sayo, Mushishi* Lashara Moon, Photon* Lorelei, Saber Marionette J* Kiyone Makibi, Tenchi Muyō!* Makiko Nagi, Tenjō Tenge* Asaka Nakamura, Ushio to Tora* Moemi Hayakawa, Video Girl Ai* Keiko Yukimura, Yū Yū HakushoKeith Allison as Nanvel Candlestick, notable roles:* Rena Kunisaki, .hack/Legend of the Twilight Bracelet* Leone, Akame ga Kill* Kamome Sengakuji, Akihabara Dennō-gumi* Nuku Nuku, All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku* Leele, Chōjūshin Gravion* Melissa Mao, Full Metal Panic* Tabane Shinonono, IS: Infinite Stratos* Yui Takanaka, Megazone 23* Misato Katsuragi, Neon Genesis EvangelionCommentary: Really great choice for the role of Nanvel. Ms. Allison conveys her character as both quirky and feminine, but also strong-willed and defiant when she needs to be. Nanvel didn\'t get as much focus as I think she deserved to have (the episode focusing on her, mostly focuses on Rio), but she had really good English and Japanese voice actresses to fill the void. Best girl was rectified!Mami Kingetsu as Maki Kawasaki , notable roles:* Nagisa Shiozaki, Yume de AetaraCarol Amerson as Maki Kawasaki, notable roles:* Sayoko Mano, Devil Hunter Yohko* Hikari Horaki, Neon Genesis Evangelion* Nakoruru, Samurai ShowdownCommentary: Like her Japanese counterpart, Ms. Amerson hasn\'t had terribly many accredited roles. I thought her roles a Hikari in Neon Genesis Evangelion fit—as a cute, girl-next-door type of voice. But her role as Maki is kind of plain. She just sounds like an office secretary. Maki has a big emotional arc, towards the end of the series, but it was difficult to feel sympathy for the character with her monotonous inflection.Emi Shinohara as Ruby, notable roles:* Makoto Kino, Sailor Moon* Mokuren, Please Save My Earth* Kaho Mizuki, Cardcaptor Sakura* Ophelia, Claymore* Mari Īmura, Hajime no Ippo* Michiru Satomi, IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix* Kagero, Ninja Scroll* Migiri Yasuri, Katanagatari* Sanae Araki, Kaze no Youjinbō* Kekkō Kamen, Kekkō Kamen* Yōko Mizuno, Maria-sama ga Miteru* Kushina Uzumaki, Naruto* Biko Daitokuji, Project A-ko* Angel Rosewater, The Big O* Natsuhi Ushiromoiya, Umineko no Naku Koro ni* Charlotte Elbourne, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust* Arashi Kishu, X/1999Paula Tiso as Ruby, notable roles:* Ouka, .hack/Legend of the Twilight BraceletCommentary: I have the same opinion of Ms. Tiso\'s role as Ruby, as I did when I watched .hack/Legend of the Twilight Bracelet. She sounds too old for her role. Paula Tiso is typically cast in the sexy character archetype, but her roles sound very low energy, rather than vivacious and spunky.Conclusively, Burn Up! Excess is a breath of fresh air in the cop genre: it has a plethora of otaku references, ecchi, laugh-out-loud humor, and some nuanced design-work and action scenes. If you\'re missing the ambience of a good \'ol, off-the-wall OVA—Burn Up! Excess has all of that campy, cyberpunk goodness that you cannot get in modern day Japanese animation!Rating: ★★★☆☆ review of Burn Up! Excess is spoiler free!—Story/CharactersSynopsis: Follows the exploits of Team Warrior, a special anti-terror wing of the Neo-Tokyo Police force. Team Warrior is comprised of the habitually broke Rio, gun-crazy Maya, computer specialist Lillica, tech-expert Nanvel, pilot/voyeur Yūji, and is led by the enigmatic Maki. The team faces a number of missions, ranging from bodyguard duty, breaking up robbery and arms rackets, and providing security for a very powerful tank. Rio and company continually thwart the terrorist aims of Ruby, an operative for a shadowy cabal of powerful men. Before the final showdown, the circumstances behind the formation of Team Warrior, how the precocious Rio came to join it, and Maki\'s painful past will be revealed.Burn Up! Excess is full of lowbrow humor and old otaku references that wouldn\'t make it very popular today, especially when it has a questionable portrayal of transgendered people. I would have been okay with them just sticking to the plot of a group of transgender women collaborating together in an elaborate jewel heist to be able to get sex changes ""in Morocco"" (the ADV dub). The issue with it arises, when the least passable one, she has a cartoonishly chiseled jawline, tries to rape Rio every few episodes. Calling her Stephanie, and saying that he still has a functioning penis. That\'s not the most flattering picture of a pre-op transgendered woman.With that outdated part out of the way, let\'s get into the meat and bones of the story! Most of the vignettes play out like a Dirty Pair episode, like when Rio flirts with an Arabian oil tycoon because she wants to pay off a massive amount of debt, but then crazy hijinks ensure and her plan gets foiled. Or when Rio is assigned a mission to protect a pop star that\'s being harassed by a stalker, the two of them get into a cat fight because Yūji (Rio\'s perverted co-worker) is lusting after the aforementioned pop star, and then they end up being friends!The voice direction in the dub is done so well that there were several scenes that were so funny, that I started crying from laughter. Particularly in Episode 7: Short Vacation! That one was a gut-buster. It\'s impossible not to like the brash, insensitive Rio and the show tries to make her the primary focus. Despite it having a colorful cast of pretty girls, characters like Lilica and my best girl, Nanvel; these women don\'t get enough time to shine, compared to the show-runner. It\'s identical to how Priss steals the show in Bubblegum Crisis.There are a lot of series referenced in Burn Up! Excess, including:* Sailor Moon* Kaiji* Hokuto no Ken* Neon Genesis Evangelion* Golden Boy* Tokimeki Memorial* To HeartThere\'s even a shot-for-shot recreation of Unit 01 fighting Sachiel in Episode 8: Nanvel Kidnapped, and Nanvel says, shortly after the scene has transitioned, ""I mustn\'t run away!""—TechnicalShinichirō Kimura (director)* Chiccha na Yukitsukai Sugar, localized as ""A Little Snow Fairy Sugar""* Chocolat no Mahō (OVA)* Cosplay Complex* Fight, One Shot!

In the mid-2000s, I really hated shows like Maburaho and Karin. Maburaho is notably one of the most wretched series I have ever seen. Despite that, he did well with the Burn Up! franchise, it may have been the script-writing that saved the day, but compared to his later TV anime debuts, this one is among the best; if not, the best.

Great job, Ms. Minella!Sakura Tange as Lilica Ebett, notable roles:* Sakura Kinamoto, Cardcaptor Sakura* Jack the Ripper (Assassin), Fate/Apocrypha* Nero Claudius (Saber), Fate/Extra: Last Encore* Mill Varna, Maze☆Bakunetsu JikūKimberly Yates as Lilica Ebett, notable roles:* Yuka, Burn Up!* Leena, Dirty Pair Flash* May Hopkins, Gunsmith Cats* Azusa Kanzaki, Mamono Hunter Yōko* Yomiko Readman, R.O.D: Read or Die* May Jessica, Sol BiancaCommentary: I was less impressed with Ms. Yate\'s performance than some of the others. Her voice just sounded like a Monica Rial-esque, nasally, high-pitched character impression. I am not typically a fan of the simplicity used to voice feminine, or young-sounding, characters in English dubs. Though, Rial did a really good job voicing Lumière in Kiddy Grade.Yuri Amano as Nanvel Candlestick, notable roles:* Berthier and CereCere, Sailor Moon* Mother Togashi, Chūnibyō demo Koi ga Shitai!* Kallen\'s Mother, Code Geass* Kawai Kawai, Iczer-Girl Iczelion* Aki Kokonoe (Rin\'s Mother), Kodomo no Jikan* Alcyone, Magic Knight Rayearth* Rain Mikamura, Mobile Fighter G Gundam* Yuriko Star, Musekinin Kanchō Tylor* Sayo, Mushishi* Lashara Moon, Photon* Lorelei, Saber Marionette J* Kiyone Makibi, Tenchi Muyō!* Makiko Nagi, Tenjō Tenge* Asaka Nakamura, Ushio to Tora* Moemi Hayakawa, Video Girl Ai* Keiko Yukimura, Yū Yū HakushoKeith Allison as Nanvel Candlestick, notable roles:* Rena Kunisaki, .hack/Legend of the Twilight Bracelet* Leone, Akame ga Kill* Kamome Sengakuji, Akihabara Dennō-gumi* Nuku Nuku, All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku* Leele, Chōjūshin Gravion* Melissa Mao, Full Metal Panic* Tabane Shinonono, IS: Infinite Stratos* Yui Takanaka, Megazone 23* Misato Katsuragi, Neon Genesis EvangelionCommentary: Really great choice for the role of Nanvel. Ms. Allison conveys her character as both quirky and feminine, but also strong-willed and defiant when she needs to be. Nanvel didn\'t get as much focus as I think she deserved to have (the episode focusing on her, mostly focuses on Rio), but she had really good English and Japanese voice actresses to fill the void. Best girl was rectified!Mami Kingetsu as Maki Kawasaki , notable roles:* Nagisa Shiozaki, Yume de AetaraCarol Amerson as Maki Kawasaki, notable roles:* Sayoko Mano, Devil Hunter Yohko* Hikari Horaki, Neon Genesis Evangelion* Nakoruru, Samurai ShowdownCommentary: Like her Japanese counterpart, Ms. Amerson hasn\'t had terribly many accredited roles. I thought her roles a Hikari in Neon Genesis Evangelion fit—as a cute, girl-next-door type of voice. But her role as Maki is kind of plain. She just sounds like an office secretary. Maki has a big emotional arc, towards the end of the series, but it was difficult to feel sympathy for the character with her monotonous inflection.Emi Shinohara as Ruby, notable roles:* Makoto Kino, Sailor Moon* Mokuren, Please Save My Earth* Kaho Mizuki, Cardcaptor Sakura* Ophelia, Claymore* Mari Īmura, Hajime no Ippo* Michiru Satomi, IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix* Kagero, Ninja Scroll* Migiri Yasuri, Katanagatari* Sanae Araki, Kaze no Youjinbō* Kekkō Kamen, Kekkō Kamen* Yōko Mizuno, Maria-sama ga Miteru* Kushina Uzumaki, Naruto* Biko Daitokuji, Project A-ko* Angel Rosewater, The Big O* Natsuhi Ushiromoiya, Umineko no Naku Koro ni* Charlotte Elbourne, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust* Arashi Kishu, X/1999Paula Tiso as Ruby, notable roles:* Ouka, .hack/Legend of the Twilight BraceletCommentary: I have the same opinion of Ms. Tiso\'s role as Ruby, as I did when I watched .hack/Legend of the Twilight Bracelet. She sounds too old for her role. Paula Tiso is typically cast in the sexy character archetype, but her roles sound very low energy, rather than vivacious and spunky.Conclusively, Burn Up! Excess is a breath of fresh air in the cop genre: it has a plethora of otaku references, ecchi, laugh-out-loud humor, and some nuanced design-work and action scenes. If you\'re missing the ambience of a good \'ol, off-the-wall OVA—Burn Up! Excess has all of that campy, cyberpunk goodness that you cannot get in modern day Japanese animation!Rating: ★★★☆☆', ""This one is just so ridiculous. I think I'll be saying this a lot in my reviews: it's so bad it's good. I love it when a film manages to do that. The characters are mostly one dimensional. It's a great watch if you're looking for something that's kind of mindless and doesn't always make much sense. What others are calling fan service made me a little uncomfortable, but that's also something that I like. The token male character is a total creep and he's always trying to peek on the girls in the locker room.

Birthday Wonderland,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38985/Birthday_Wonderland,"['THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSPros:+Character and world design+Captures magical Ghibli inspired feel+Environmental messageCons:-Propaganda for the privileged (although probably unintentional)-Poorly written villain...Thoughts:The immediately obvious selling point of this film is its visuals. The characters and world are captivating. They bring out a similar spark to Ghibli films. Throughout the film, the characters travel across this breathtaking ""wonderland"", and boy is it gorgeous. However, the world is losing its color due to drought. In order to save it, the main character must go and rescue the prince who can perform a ritual to bring back the rain. They make a point to differentiate this world from Earth, which has already lost much of its beauty due to climate change. That\'s all well and good. I like me an environmentalist movie.Sadly the movie, almost certainly unintentionally, also manages to tell a darker story. We quickly learn that the tale\'s villain comes from the slums. The main character\'s guide, an esteemed alchemist, warns her never to go near there. Already we have an upper class citizen steering our heroine through a biased view of this so called wonderland. The privileged only see what they want to see. To make matters worse, the villain is immediately labeled a bad person because they come from the slums rather than because of the crimes they have committed. And that\'s not all. The main characters are literally on a quest to save the prince--another upper class citizen obviously.SPOILERSIt turns out that the prince and the villain are one and the same. Saving the prince is actually a matter of returning him to ""normal"" from his delinquent form. Immediately upon regaining his privileged-rich-white-boy self, the prince is forgiven and everyone lives happily ever after. According to the movie at least.END SPOILERSI wish I could recommend this film to support the artists and designers who clearly crafted it with passion, but I cannot bring myself to support its damaging message which is especially prevalent in today\'s world of growing inequality.

Definitely, and fairly often, actually. Did it make me roll my eyes? Quite often on that count as well, haha. But most importantly, did I enjoy my movie going experience? I would say yes, and I think I can recommend it without too many reservations.Character: 7I want to begin with this category because it definitely feels like the writers wanted this film to be a character driven...bildungsroman. There are a lot of likable characters present (in particular, I really like the main duo of Akane and Chii, and also momma Midori, although admittedly, her role in the movie is pretty negligible), but the issue with all of them is that they feel one dimensional. Even the main protagonist, Akane, feels a bit flat. The movie is supposed to be a coming of age story about her growing up and taking initiative in her own life, and we see her transformation in the end, but it feels largely unearned. This is in large part due to the plot device of the momentum anchor, which I absolutely HATE. I won’t go into too much detail here to avoid spoilers, but everything about the anchor makes me roll my eyes, especially when it’s brought up again near the end of the movie. The other gripe I have is that the alchemist and Pipo feel like they exist only to spout exposition or move the story along, and are largely under-utilized. Overall, there was a lot of potential here but it falls short of creating super memorable characters.Visuals: 9I found out about this movie, and ultimately watched it, because I’m a huge fan of Ilya Kushinov, the artist behind all of the visual designs. This movie is without a doubt gorgeous. Due to the quality of the visuals, there are some obvious drops in framerate or moments where a still frame is held for just a tad bit long, but I’m more than ready to forgive the movie on that count because, unfortunately, we don’t live in a perfect world where studios have infinite time and money to pour into each project. There’s a lot of great color imagery as well, aligning the themes of the story with the visual experience. This movie very clearly takes heavy inspiration from Studio Ghibli’s takes on fantasy and worldbuilding. It doesn’t achieve the same levels of believability in my opinion, but the victorian-esque fantasy world that is constructed is still quite lovely. The one thing that disappoints me is that unlike Miyazaki’s works, it doesn’t perfectly attach the elements of fantasy with the message that the movie is trying to tell. I was fortunate enough to go to a viewing of the movie where Kushinov flew in all the way from Japan to talk about his work on the film and some of his thoughts regarding the process, and I was simply blown away (RIP my wallet after I bought all his artbooks and a print). For me, the art is the one distinguishing aspect of the movie, and had the fidelity not been what it is, I would have trouble recommending this movie.Story: 5While the story isn’t strictly bad, it feels very rushed and haphazard in organization. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that a lot had been left on the cutting room floor in order to make deadlines. While I enjoyed watching the movie to indulge in the excellent visuals and delightful fantasy elements, the story was hard for me to care about or be engaged with. The quest to restore rain to this ailing land through the drop rain ceremony is very much a MacGuffin, and even upon its resolution feels uninteresting at best. I wish there were more scenes showing how the country and its people were suffering from the lack of rain, rather than the excessive number of moments spent showing cute sheep (which I admit are undoubtedly adorable) or fleshing out the subplot about the knitting competition (which ultimately feels tacked on and unimportant). I mean, come on, the land is gorgeous, green, and lush, and it doesn’t look like it’s in need of a single drop of water. There was also a dark, depressing, London-like city that was meant to showcase the suffering and hardship, but again, it’s not aptly developed or effectively implemented. I would love to see what the studio could achieve by telling this story in the form of a show, rather than a movie. There, you could take full episodes to truly explore the world or show Akane helping the people, rather than forcing everything onto a linear track that slowly progresses towards a predictable conclusion.Sound: 7It’s been two weeks since I’ve seen this movie, and admittedly the sounds aren’t the freshest memories in my mind, but maybe to some extent that means there wasn’t anything particularly memorable for me to recount. That said, I think that in the quieter moments of the movie where the sound design really comes through and pulls you into the world. There are a couple songs that did stick with me, but none of it really stands out as the highlight of the movie. This is kinda cheating, but I also really liked the cover of “The Show” by Milet in the end credits.Enjoyment: 6I think this is one of those movies that in the moment, you can really enjoy while watching it, but as you reflect on it as a whole, it comes apart bit by bit. I do want to point out a couple of the strengths here, however. Overall, the comedy was effective and generously meted out, albeit usually as one-liners or simplistics jokes. In particular, I thought the visual comedy was done very well. If I haven’t gushed enough about the art in my visuals section, I just wanted to point out how beautiful the movie is again, haha. It is, in my opinion, the film’s single biggest strength. Where it falls apart for me is that I wish the movie had done more showing and less telling. The movie equips the audience with two characters that simply explain every foreign object or fantastical detail instead of letting the audience process the information on screen for themselves. Ironically, many of the plot elements also feel under explained or lacking of a clear and consistent line of logic. I think this movie could be a great family experience, but reading subtitles will likely be challenging for kids.Conclusion:I’ve actually never written a review before, but I thought this might be helpful for those deciding on whether or not to see the film, since I was lucky enough to catch an early showing.  I hope my thoughts are helpful to at least a couple of people. I watched this movie in a double anime feature night, during which I watched Weathering With You right after I finished this film and heard the artists thoughts on the process, and the juxtaposition of the two movies really made me wonder what this movie could have been. I think that despite the missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential, the movie still has solid enough legs to stand on. I genuinely enjoyed the experience, and I would say that it’s worth watching at least once. bildungsroman.

The animation is good for what it is, and that's that. The world building makes no sense, the characters are surface level **at best,** it has weird flashback character cuts, it has no idea how to hold tension or pacing, the gags are dumb, the protag is a Mary Sue that suddenly gets better when she needs to, AHHHHHHHH. You can't even appreciate the animation really because of how stupid the movie is.I saw another negative review,...claiming that this movie has good elements, but has a poorly written villain and is hurt most by being a propaganda against poor people (or those who come from the slums, seen as bad, etc.).

Entotsu Machi no Poupelle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35609/Entotsu_Machi_no_Poupelle,"[""Man, I really wanted to like this movie, and there are things that I do like about it. Unfortunately, Poupelle of Chimney Town really isn't one of the better kids movies that came out in the 2020s. The premise at first seems pretty cool: In a town completely encased in smoke, where nobody knows what the outside world looks like, not even the stars, a young boy named Lubicchi spends his days cleaning chimneys despite his fear of heights. One day, a glowing heart gets dropped into a garbage pile, turning into a man made entirely of garbage, whom Lubicchi saves from getting incinerated. After...a rough start, Lubicchi and the garbage man become friends, with Lubicchi giving him the name Poupelle. Their friendship winds up both drawing suspicion from the community and sparking a big adventure where the two of them discover just what's beyond the thick smoke of Chimney Town. The premise reminded me of this manga I'm reading right now called Beyond The Clouds: The Girl Who Fell From The Sky, though Poupelle doesn't have any people with wings in it.Yeah...Poupelle of Chimney Town is pretty much a huge laundry list of cliches right off the bat. Human kid with no friends who wants to see something others don't want to? Check. Mysterious friend who winds up helping him do just that? Check. Sick mom? Check. One-note bullies who pick on him? Check. Mysterious villains who don't want the town to know about life outside their town? Check. Missing parent who influences them and winds up being the key to everything? Check. Follow your dreams and don't conform to the opporessors moral? Checkity check cheeeeeck. I wouldn't have minded all these cliches if the movie actually bothered to execute them well. I mean, my favorite romance anime of all time is Ride Your Wave, and that checks off a lot of clickes, but also managed to stand out on its own by way of the animation and exploring the death of a loved one through a fun, crazy idea it had. Instead, Poupelle of Chimney Town doesn't seem interested in doing anything new with its premise or characters, playing them so straight that everything is about as bland and charmless as white rice.Speaking of the characters, all of them, from Lubicchi even to the side characters, have absolutely zero charm or depth to them, as they're all so cliche and one-note that you can easily recognize them from so many other media that have portrayed their archetypes better. Most of the side characters don't even so much as get any names, including some of the one-note bullies who pick on Lubicchi! Most of the side characters feel lifeless and shallow, with their only purpose being to advance the plot and nothing else. The talkative miner is just there to be an exposition dump who tells Lubicchi the secrets behind Chimney Town and the government, and the villains themselves are stereotypical villains ripped out of other things, yet somehow they don't do much of anything themselves! Lubicchi himself is okay, but he's really bland and forgettable, no different from other characters in other movies who act the same way he does. Even Poupelle himself is just a walking cliche, and you can predict his role in the story literally as soon as he and Lubicchi meet.I'm also pretty mixed on the animation. For one, the movie is mostly CGI, with some 2D animation sprinkled in there on occasion. Honestly, I wasn't a fan of the CGI animation, as it just felt really clunky and uncanny at times, mainly for the human characters. It works better with Poupelle and a lot of the Halloween costumes in the beginning, but that's about it. On the other hand, the backgrounds and the setting fare much better. The steampunk skyscrapers and building designs all have great designs, and the backstory behind the setting really makes it feel like a world that's completely isolated from everything. I'm further conflicted on the soundtrack, as the actual songs are great, especially that epic Halloween-themed musical number that the movie opens on, but the background music itself is kind of obnoxious and could have benefited from holding back a bit. It also commits the cardinal sin of setting upbeat music to what are supposed to be sad moments, which really kills the atmosphere. Also, Poupelle of Chimney Town's pacing is surprisingly fact. The movie begins with Lubicchi trying to save Poupelle, and the two of them getting wrapped up in action packed, heart-racing situations that amount to a grand total of 20 or so minutes before they even get a chance to introduce themselves. Granted, the movie starts to calm down a bit after that, and with the pacing being what it is, it doesn't leave a moment to get bored, but often times it felt like Poupelle of Chimney Town was little more than shiny keys that a parent is waving in front of their kids' faces to keep them entertained.As much as I hate admitting it, in the end, Poupelle of Chimney Town is just another kids movie that just rehashes the same cliches that others like it have done without doing anything new with them. It has a few good ideas, but barely utilizes them. The reason I like other kids anime movies such as Child of Kamiari Month and Okko's Inn is that while they also rely on a few stock cliches, they also knew to try and do new things with them, even if they don't always succeed. Kamiari Month stood out in its emphasis on Shintoism and Japanese folklore, and Okko's Inn went out of its way to rectify a lot of flaws that the original TV series had while tackling the original story it was based on in a different way. They still managed to be fun movies, even if they aren't trying to bring the house down, and I, a 28-year-old adult, still managed to enjoy them. I couldn't enjoy Poupelle of Chimney Town because it's just a boring, soulless cliche fest. If you want to show this to your kids, for babysitting fodder or as a way to introduce them to anime, go for it. You do you. But I'd recommend skipping this one, as other movies with a similar premise have done its ideas and characters better. a rough start, Lubicchi and the garbage man become friends, with Lubicchi giving him the name Poupelle. Their friendship winds up both drawing suspicion from the community and sparking a big adventure where the two of them discover just what's beyond the thick smoke of Chimney Town. The premise reminded me of this manga I'm reading right now called Beyond The Clouds: The Girl Who Fell From The Sky, though Poupelle doesn't have any people with wings in it.Yeah...Poupelle of Chimney Town is pretty much a huge laundry list of cliches right off the bat. Human kid with no friends who wants to see something others don't want to? Check. Mysterious friend who winds up helping him do just that? Check. Sick mom? Check. One-note bullies who pick on him? Check. Mysterious villains who don't want the town to know about life outside their town? Check. Missing parent who influences them and winds up being the key to everything? Check.

Gambo is brutal. No, I'm not kidding.

In America, radiation creates superheroes. It\'s almost like Japan and America have very different narratives surrounding nuclear fallout. If we think really really hard, we might know why this is.Anyway, this animated Gojira 2nd movie is better than Marvel\'s Avengers and you should feel bad for not being weeb enough to realize its superiority. We have better written story, superior storytelling, way less CGI, characters who serve other purposes beyond being marketing baits, and most importantly, we are not watching pg13 rated shonen movie which Marvel Cinematic Universe represents with its content. Ask yourself the question ""Why would...I choose superhero over super awesome?""If the first movie didn\'t impress you with its best scenes such as the one where man saw a flower and burst into tears because mother nature has not abandon humanity, or the scene where dude said ""keikaku doori"" (all according to the plan) followed by everything falling apart 2 minutes later, or the rampage of flying mini-godzillas -- worry not! This time the man himself is here and he is not just your normal Godzilla. No! He is Mecha Godzilla (pronounced megagodzilla)! This is seriously the funniest thing I have seen since the laser-sharks scene from The Lego Movie (2014).Not only that, we have biblical references, tanned tattoo waifus (p l u r a l), gun mags that always have one more shot left, Lara Croft\'s bow-wielding abo cousin, dudes who accept their destiny in 3 seconds like waddup I was born in the tunnels bby, person named Belu-Be, tentacles, nanometals (the worst of all metals!), epic time skips and nice technologies (EMP harpoons, meta missiles and whatnot), electro panic (that song at 42 minute mark), very own me2 campaign, and dialog about Godzilla\'s effect on ecosystem followed by more tentacles. Seriously, that timing, bro. This is the type of greatness that keeps on giving and rewarding those who pay attention. Hanazawa Kana is also there because most people wouldn\'t even consider this anime otherwise.The art and animation follow the same idea as the last one. Meaning this is Netflix\'s own idea of nu-anime, spiced with some Berserk 2017 art design. I would complain, but since the creatures are monsters, I have had a blast calling Godzilla a CGI-Monster instead. The sound directing is from the Hollywood.

As an avid fan of kaiju films, this was an exciting movie! The story was so well done and intriguing, I was hooked for the entire hour and 40-minute ride!The whole story about the Hotua and their obvious connection to Mothra was insane! (The ""dust""/""scale"" on their skin, and what they used to heal the humans, probably scales from the dead body of Mothra herself!) It will be interesting to see if her egg(s) hatch and larva come out to either combat Godzilla or Ghidorah (What a welcome surprise, but it wasn\'t unexpected too much!). This...has to be one of the best takes on the Mothra twins/Shobijin in her film history, and Mothra\'s mythology in general.As for ""MechaGodzilla""... While the design was wicked for the robot himself, we get nothing but a glimpse of him before it evolves into something much greater. The concept of having the nanometals evolve to specifically combat Godzilla over thousands of years was incredible and a welcome change. The Vultures they build to fight Godzilla from above were very Gundam-esque and cool looking. Seeing MechaGodzilla City construct and arm itself was very visually pleasing (As well as that title card!) While this is an incredibly ballsy and different take on MechaGodzilla\'s concept, it is something fresh and new while paying homage to the originals.As for Godzilla himself? A job well is done. This film didn\'t have a ton of Godzilla, but man when he is on screen he is stunning. There is no doubt in my mind that ""Godzilla Earth"" is truly the King of Kings. The story was so interesting and investive that I didn\'t find myself ""needing"" Godzilla to show up like I did in the first film. We get a single tease of him early on, and then when he comes on screen he doesn\'t leave. The end turns mankind\'s greatest threat into the universe\'s.I was taken by surprise when the Bilusaludo turned out to be the enemy aliens and not the Exif. I thought for certain the Exif would be summoning Ghidorah based on the first film\'s ending, but it turns out they merely suffered from the deity\'s mighty wrath.They are doing a great job setting up this huge dogfight between Godzilla and King Ghidorah. It seems that this time around, Godzilla won\'t be needing external aid to defeat him (as Godzilla has never defeated Ghidorah without help). This film has me just as excited for Ghidorah\'s return to the big screen as I am for his first appearance in the American MonsterVerse.Overall, this film was many times better than I expected. It saves all the action for the last minute while delivering a great naratve. The bland characters from the first film were expanded upon and I actually some-what cared for how they fared. Cheers to this film\'s major improvement and the final film in this series! has to be one of the best takes on the Mothra twins/Shobijin in her film history, and Mothra\'s mythology in general.As for ""MechaGodzilla""... While the design was wicked for the robot himself, we get nothing but a glimpse of him before it evolves into something much greater. The concept of having the nanometals evolve to specifically combat Godzilla over thousands of years was incredible and a welcome change. The Vultures they build to fight Godzilla from above were very Gundam-esque and cool looking. Seeing MechaGodzilla City construct and arm itself was very visually pleasing (As well as that title card!) While this is an incredibly ballsy and different take on MechaGodzilla\'s concept, it is something fresh and new while paying homage to the originals.As for Godzilla himself? A job well is done. This film didn\'t have a ton of Godzilla, but man when he is on screen he is stunning. There is no doubt in my mind that ""Godzilla Earth"" is truly the King of Kings. The story was so interesting and investive that I didn\'t find myself ""needing"" Godzilla to show up like I did in the first film. We get a single tease of him early on, and then when he comes on screen he doesn\'t leave. The end turns mankind\'s greatest threat into the universe\'s.I was taken by surprise when the Bilusaludo turned out to be the enemy aliens and not the Exif. I thought for certain the Exif would be summoning Ghidorah based on the first film\'s ending, but it turns out they merely suffered from the deity\'s mighty wrath.They are doing a great job setting up this huge dogfight between Godzilla and King Ghidorah. It seems that this time around, Godzilla won\'t be needing external aid to defeat him (as Godzilla has never defeated Ghidorah without help). This film has me just as excited for Ghidorah\'s return to the big screen as I am for his first appearance in the American MonsterVerse.Overall, this film was many times better than I expected. It saves all the action for the last minute while delivering a great naratve. The bland characters from the first film were expanded upon and I actually some-what cared for how they fared.

With over 700 original movies/TV shows being released this year, Netflix has decided that 30 of those will be anime-related.  Capturing a significant/growing portion of the population who is dedicated to this Japanese genre of entertainment.  That being said, however, the sudden influx of new anime content doesn’t necessarily mean we, as the public, will be receiving a quality product, as it seems that the Americanization of anime has — unfortunately — become a trend.If this were...a 2005 PS2 game, I’m sure it would be an exhilarating experience with plenty of action filled fun; but as a movie, it just feels like a bungling stew of machismo, and misplaced human rage.  Rather than formulating unique battle plans to defeat the “unstoppable” Godzilla, they have the aid of dues ex Machina (i.e. the nano-metal) to solve all of their problems.  Combine this with full-tilt, reckless action sequences, and you’re on your way toward imitating a Michael Bay film.  Because thinking of a way to stop Godzilla’s reign of terror with human technology is too burdensome, even though Hideaki Anno (director of Shin Godzilla) did so a mere two years prior.  In addition, while the crew acknowledges the events that lead to Godzilla’s conception — that being, human pollution and the detonation of nuclear bombs — they seem to lack contrition for their role in his eventual birth.  In their ignorance, they label him as an “evil” creature that must be annihilated, rather than evaluating their own mistakes as a species, and determining how they must remedy the “evil” within themselves.  This harkens to a person who pops pimples on their face, without acknowledging the actions that led to those unsightly clogged pores from manifesting in the first place (i.e. bad diet, stress, over-washing your face).The animation is, in a word: Fremdschämen.  A German term which roughly translates into, “being ashamed for somebody else who is behaving in an embarrassing way.”  I cannot think of a better word to describe my feelings when watching the animation for this movie.  There were moments in which characters appeared to be moving in mechanical ways, resembling the gestures of a stiff action figure.  Godzilla, whiling looking like a roided-out super athlete, also had the appearance of a wrinkly, geriatric dinosaur (similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is “German-ish”).  GEMBA/Millepensee animation (the studios behind Berserk 2016) are probably releasing a collective sigh of relief, saying: “at least there’s another animation studio as bad as ours.”It was evident from the outset that the animation studio wanted to produce a high paced action movie, but why wait until the final 30 minutes for Godzilla to randomly show up to do so.  We already established that this film has very little to say from a narrative level, so why pretend otherwise?  If the end goal is to neglect characterization and an engaging story, then just follow in the steps of Gurren Lagann and embrace full-throttled mayhem.  At least, in that sense, it would have been a semi-entertaining movie.  Instead, we receive a mentally constipated crew of soldiers who muddle around in anger until the MC (Godzilla) makes his appearance. a 2005 PS2 game, I’m sure it would be an exhilarating experience with plenty of action filled fun; but as a movie, it just feels like a bungling stew of machismo, and misplaced human rage.

The positive stuff from the previous adventure carries over, like the music and animation but dear god has it just nose-dived into pure angst.Following the events of Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters, the Aratrum is unable to contact Haruo and the rest after their encounter with the original Godzilla.

The group are telepathically questioned by the Houtua leaders over why they burned their lands, letting them go once Haruo explains they were only attacking Godzilla. Haruo\'s group reunites with Metphies and the other survivors during an encounter with the Servum. During the fight, Galu-Gu realizes that the twins\' arrowheads are laced with ""nanometal"", the nanotechnology used to create Mechagodzilla!The direction is definitely a step down from the previous one getting even flatter in comparison to the more interesting shots of the first.

I will not spoil anything from the first movie. Just watch it yourself.Now for the review:The first scenes was a borefest, full of...needless information and almost no connection to the main storyline. The middle scenes begins with a progressive development to the main storyline. And the final scenes are great in which ended too rushed.The art is good in its own way especially Godzilla. The story is lacking since we have not seen much monsters unlike in the prequel. The characters are heroic and dumb, at least some of them at the same time. Enjoyment is a bore.

I have always loved a good Kaiju movie! If you enjoyed the first Godzilla Planet of Monsters then you will certainly like enjoy this continuation of the story. Just like the other movie the story is what it is. This movie is not going to change the anime world as we know it but it is a fun movie to watch. The story can get a little confusing toward the end but it all works out and the action more than...makes up for the confusion. Just like the first film the characters are interesting enough and the story does further some relationships and put strains on already existing relationships. The Godzilla in this movie is very similar to the one from the first film other than the fact that he is absolutely HUGE!!! Like 300 meters tall! Certainly the biggest Godzilla monster to every grace our screens which is pretty neat! Just like the first film he still seems a bit underwhelming due to his lack of things to destroy. The monster simply walks around a uses a few beam attacks . He never gets the opportunity to truly shine as the big monster he truly is. The film also does a really good job of introducing a certain Godzilla villain in a way you would never expect which was really refreshing.Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I would say it a little better than the first. I will certainly be watching movie number three when it comes out in November!!Overall Rating 7 makes up for the confusion.

Where the first film lacked any kind of real suspense or emotional gravitas, the second film made up for that in spades.  This film pretty much rests on a question that is both spiritual and ethical: ""Does one become a monster in order to defeat a monster?"".  The answer to this question is incredibly dramatic and powerful.  And, of course, full of explosions.Again, the animation on this movie is beautiful for 3D, especially in the final battle scenes.  The only thing lacking is character design,...as 3D always makes the characters look generic.  The score was powerful, although, it\'s pretty much the same score from the first film, but it was all enhanced because you actually care about what\'s going to happen.  The film itself does a really good job of building up a sense of impending doom  throughout, so you\'re left wondering how bad it\'s going to be.  As a person who likes unhappy endings, that feeling is valuable.  I will not say whether Godzilla 2 actually delivers on that doom, so as not to spoil anything.  But it had a real ""Blassreiter"" kind of a feel to it.  In fact, this anime really reminds me alot of Knights of Sidonia now that I think about it.  It\'s good.This was a strong followup to a generally weak first film and really makes me want to see Godzilla 3.  Which I will do right now. as 3D always makes the characters look generic.

I still wish this could've been a full anime series instead of three movies because there is a lot of world-building without fully using it. Things are brought up without needing those new elements in the story. If it were a full anime series, we could spend more time with those things rather than using a tiny bit of them as plot devices. I also disliked the main character. I dislike main characters that are emotional and value their own things over the things of other people.

To summarize the story revolves around our planet earth having been dominated by Godzilla, causing humans to be forced to flee into space, and accompanying the attempt to retake...the planet through the destruction of Gozilla, are also shown some other races, which are basically humans who have evolved in other ways, films also deal with religious beliefs and fanaticism, in a slightly generic and weak way, but they treat, the central protagonist is very simple, those protagonists who are decisive, optimistic and with a sense of justice and duty, the rest of the cast of characters has no muuuuita relevance, of course, they have, mainly, the blond / white guy Metphies, and the twin sisters who actually live in the land, well, at least he has good soundtracks, some I just hope that being a CGI anime would have more action scenes, after all, it\'s the studio that made Knights of Sydonia, but it was not what happened, unfortunate mind.

But coming back to the film, it was clear that they could try to learn about the place and try to figure out better ways to confront Godzilla so powerful, so why the hell did they do that in the face of a suicide attack that was obviously going to go wrong? Even using the city ""Anti-Godzilla"", with her friends who went crazy and wanted to merge the city, the protagonist ends up giving up, I do not know, he wanted to save the woman he loved?

Ginga Tetsudou 999: Eternal Fantasy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3602/Ginga_Tetsudou_999__Eternal_Fantasy,"['&quot;Galaxy Express 999: Eternal Fantasy&quot; was actually one of the first anime movies I had ever seen back in the 90&rsquo;s, and while it hasn&rsquo;t aged that well, it still remains an entertaining movie. Basically our hero Tetsuro wants to get revenge for the murder of his mother by the hands of machine people. (Humans that gave up their bodies in order to become immortal robots) His only means to do this by riding the Galaxy Express 999 (a space train of sorts) in order to get a machine body himself and kill his mom&rsquo;s murder. The only way he can do this is by...way of a young women named Maetel, who offers him a ticket if he takes her with him.Story: 8/10It is basically a movie that summarizes everything that took place during the TV series, only it whittles it down to about an hours worth. The story is quite well written as you can see from above, it really gives you a feeling that you are riding with Tetsuro on the express ways, as they tend to introduce different planets that have also been under oppression by the machine people, along with love, sadness and surprising plots twists, which are especially nice considering this is only an hour long movie. The action scenes themselves are fair enough, but lack a really visual appeal and flare. I know some may feel that it was appropriate for its time, but there still were much more fluent titles out there around this era. (such as Robotech or Captain Tsubasa) Still, it gets the job done well enough! It contains a bit of blood shed (doesn&rsquo;t ever spurt or flow though) and some of the scenes show women in a more erotic manner, so it might not be appropriate for all viewers. These scenes are few and far between, but I still feel they are worth mentioning.Soundtrack: 8/10Really has a great one! The live &quot;symphony&quot; style of music really sets the mood for the movie, and even holds up well by today&rsquo;s standards. And the closing theme &quot;journey to the stars&quot; was so darn catchy I immediately downloaded it to my ipod! It does seem a bit dated looking back on it, but it still has a lasting affect! My only complaint with the music, is that there isn&rsquo;t much to it as far as variety goes. Its pretty sparse through out, but the parts that it does show up in are well timed and moving. Most people may view the background tracks as &quot;sad, &quot; but heck they did kill his mom, so its what the designers were trying to make you feel with it! Sadly, there is no opening theme to this title. The character voices were some hit and misses, I felt that the two main ones were well placed and appropriate, but others (like the conductor) just came out plain funny! Which I guess is ok, especially considering this is a sad movie, and some viewers might find the funnier voices stimulating.Art: 6/10Without a doubt it is very dated, this sort of style was very popular in the 80&rsquo;s era, so to some younger viewers out there it will most likely be a turn off. As far as the character design goes, I just wasn&rsquo;t a fan of it myself. With the exception of Tetsuro on most parts, the other characters just look weird and not proportioned right, and kinda come off as more silly than actually threatening or mature. (which is what the movie is shooting for) Still, whether you love it or hate it, its well detailed and does contain a character design all its own.Characters: 9/10Which is really what this movie is all about! The great chemistry between them, whether it be loss of a loved one, happy times meeting new friends, to touching moments between them! You feel a deep satisfaction of feeling what the characters feel themselves. And even though it wasn&rsquo;t able to pull off the most touching story for a movie, it still leaves you with a happy yet sad feeling when it finishes. The characters themselves are also interesting in their design. They range from humans, to alien conductors, to people made out of pure crystal, so there is a good variety to them as well!Bottom Line: 8/10If your not into the whole classic anime tag, then &quot;Galaxy Express 999: Eternal Fantasy&quot; probably won&rsquo;t make you change your mind. But if you are interested in what was going on back in older anime titles, its a great find. This movie may be a bit too dark and depressing for some though, so if your the type of viewer who prefers happy movies then I would avoid it, as it does have its tear jerking moments. I recommend it for fans of old school, or people who like more mature drama in their anime diet.One Final note I feel I should mention: if you do decide to get into this franchise, be prepared for some very confusing detective work. As there are so many spin-offs, sequels and prequels that it can sometimes get quite frustrating! way of a young women named Maetel, who offers him a ticket if he takes her with him.Story: 8/10It is basically a movie that summarizes everything that took place during the TV series, only it whittles it down to about an hours worth. The story is quite well written as you can see from above, it really gives you a feeling that you are riding with Tetsuro on the express ways, as they tend to introduce different planets that have also been under oppression by the machine people, along with love, sadness and surprising plots twists, which are especially nice considering this is only an hour long movie. The action scenes themselves are fair enough, but lack a really visual appeal and flare. I know some may feel that it was appropriate for its time, but there still were much more fluent titles out there around this era. (such as Robotech or Captain Tsubasa) Still, it gets the job done well enough! It contains a bit of blood shed (doesn&rsquo;t ever spurt or flow though) and some of the scenes show women in a more erotic manner, so it might not be appropriate for all viewers. These scenes are few and far between, but I still feel they are worth mentioning.Soundtrack: 8/10Really has a great one! The live &quot;symphony&quot; style of music really sets the mood for the movie, and even holds up well by today&rsquo;s standards. And the closing theme &quot;journey to the stars&quot; was so darn catchy I immediately downloaded it to my ipod! It does seem a bit dated looking back on it, but it still has a lasting affect! My only complaint with the music, is that there isn&rsquo;t much to it as far as variety goes. Its pretty sparse through out, but the parts that it does show up in are well timed and moving. Most people may view the background tracks as &quot;sad, &quot; but heck they did kill his mom, so its what the designers were trying to make you feel with it! Sadly, there is no opening theme to this title.

The first movie missing all the important parts of the TV series, the sense of a long journey and the character growth Tetsuro went through. The second movie felt like just a remix of the same plot points of the first. And then this movie, that just feels like a total disconnect from everything.Starts off bad right off the bat, you see the 999 flying and its rendered in hideous CGI. This is perhaps a bit of a contentious topic as CG becomes more commonplace or generally...accepted but for me it always looks worse than hand drawn. It can still look good as an end result, though I think hand drawn would always look better. Some shows use it better than others, Last Exile is a good (and fairly early) example of good CG. But here its just disappointing to see.ok CGI rant overThen we get to the Tetsuro redesign, they had aged him up in the previous 2 movies and sorta looked like a young Harlock. But here hes back to being more of a young kid like in the TV series except hes so ugly looking now. I mean dont get me wrong, he was pretty dopey looking in the TV series and I always got a chuckle out of him and some of the side characters how ridiculously high their eyes were, but he was goofy looking in a sort of cartoon endearing way. Here hes just ugly looking though. The rest of the art is ok, some background arts are nice, some extra detail on characters here and there but not nearly as nice looking as the previous films or as charming as the TV series.Story-wise, it sets up a new evil menace for Tetsuro and Maetel to contend with, but its just sort of random feeling and lacking in any of the personal growth side of story that the original series had. It could maybe blossom into something, but the main issue is this is only 50 something minutes long and is basically just an intro OVA to the real story.... that we never got. The ending is a cliffhanger before getting to anything real interesting. Maybe this is continued in one of the manga releases, I'm not sure. But as it is I really dont feel like you are getting much from this. I guess if you, like me, are also on a 999 binge you may feel compelled to complete the set but honestly you're time is best served elsewhere like watching one of the gazillion spin-off stories from this story's universe. accepted but for me it always looks worse than hand drawn.

It does a solid job of setting up what needs to be known, for both returning fans, and first timers as well. It\'s also the first proper reintroduction of fan favorite Maya Fey, now all grown up into a adult, although first timers will likely be a little confused if they hop in completely blind, as to a lot of who she is and what her and certain characters are talking about, since it\'s based on already long established lore....But you really shouldn\'t be jumping into the series at this point anyway. I\'d definitely recommend at least checking out the Gyakuten Saiban: Sono ""Shinjitsu"", Igi Ari! anime, which covers quite a bit (if not all) of Maya\'s backstory within it, if you don\'t want to play the actual games that come before.Anyway, overall this is a solid prologue. It reintroduces the important characters, introduces the important new ones, sets up the concepts that fuel the game, and generally just does what it\'s meant to in a well executed manner.

The characters would be forgettable .In the OAV for Haruka...1, the characters were introduced too quickly. If I haven't watched Harukanaru Toki no Nakade ~ Hachiyō Shō, I wouldn't even care about it. Haruka...2 also suffered because of it.Now Haruka...3 is longer. 2 OAVs with a total runtime of 2.5 hours, which is equivalent of about 7 or 8...anime episodes. Although it has more runtime than Haruka...1's and Haruka...2's OAVs, it still wasn't enough.The problem is that Haruka...3 started in media res. You have to quickly get acquainted with the characters, but you also have to quickly get into the plot, which is too much to take. In the first OAV, you cannot make sense on who the characters are, especially that their characterisations are far different to the anime characters. In this second OAV, some characters can start getting more interesting, but it's not enough time to care for all of themIn Kyou, two factions are at war, the Genji and the Heibei. It goes without saying that the story is far different to Haruka...1 and Haruka...2.Of the 3 Haruka games adapted for animation, Haruka...3 is the superior one. The miko has been trained to fight. The character designs for the Hachiyō look more masculine, even though they are supposed to be eyecandy. The characters here are more complex. The stakes are higher, and the millieu puts a strain on our protagonists.As mentioned already, the OAV format is unfortunate. As much as people like to shit on the anime TV series Harukanaru Toki no Nakade ~ Hachiyō Shō, its virtue lies in that we were given time enough time to get to know each Hachiyō. (If that anime wasn't released and we only get to watch the Ajisai OAV, I would be lost and confused as to who the characters are.)Since the characters in Haruka...3 are complex, among other virtues, I think it would've been better if this has been adopted into a 2-cour, or even 3-cour, anime.The story had potential, but with the constraints of the OAV, it failed to live up to that potential. anime episodes.

Hakubo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34972/Hakubo,"[""This was the biggest load of barnacles I have ever seen. The promotional video looked promising, with excellent visuals and what could have been a decent plot, and gave me high hopes that this short-ish film will be worth my time. After watching it, it’s confirmed that nothing about this movie was good except the gorgeous animation.And when I say gorgeous animation, I mean the backgrounds and the scenery. The character designs were pretty mediocre and looked like they came straight out of 2010. Even worse than their designs, however, were the characters themselves. They possessed totally unbelievable character traits that no real human...being would ever come close to. The main characters themselves were less interesting than pieces of cardboard, and the romance was half-assed and cringe. The forced drama in an attempt to make it a more compelling plot landed flat on its face and makes you roll your eyes in exasperation.The scriptwriting and the plot were terrible, meaning there was no plot. Sure, it's hard to achieve a complex and deep story in a 52 minute runtime, but this movie accomplished absolutely nothing. Nothing happens at all for the duration of the movie. Don’t let the description fool you into thinking that it will detail the lives of people after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the effects it had on the population, as it was barely even mentioned. The writing felt like it was done by a six year old as it involves girls smelling each other and killing their friends because they got a boyfriend before themselves.tl;dr - If you’ve come for a compelling, heartfelt, or even remotely believable plot, you have come to the wrong place. You can choose to stick around for the beautiful background scenery, but that’s about all this movie’s got going for it. being would ever come close to.

Watch it if you enjoy staring at screensavers.Hopefully that is enough to give you the gist of the movie but honestly I had nothing better to do and watched it knowing it would be mediocre at best. I think because the movie tried to be dramatic but failed in every aspect, it ended up being entertaining to me anyway, but thats because im braindead.I think the main plot definitely had potential. The idea is that the main characters were involved in the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami back in 2011 and, while admittedly...not the most original concept, could have still made for a nice drama. It isn't that for two reasons: the characters and the story.The characters are about as bland as the animation. The animation is kinda meh.  The personalities of the main characters, in what I think is an attempt to make them look melancholic and troubled, only come out having flat character arcs. Heck even the ending (I won't spoil) felt like a cheap gimmick and not to mention it was very much predictable. So predictable in fact, it was exactly how I imagined it would end, frame by frame. It matched my prediction so well it's my favorite part. Probably because I have no life.Next it the Tohoku earthquake. If you blink for one second during this movie you might miss this. The tragedy contributes so little to the story I'm pretty sure that was just there so they could put it in the description and lure idiots like me. In short they weren't even trying.Then we have the story progression. It honestly surprised me that I would only realize something important happened way after it occured in the movie. The film is only 50 minutes long I have no idea how they manage to fail to get my attention.But it had less cringe than I thought it would so bonus points for that? not the most original concept, could have still made for a nice drama.

Remember, this was about 'the now and present' condition that twos people needed to get along with their new life. Ofc its just about their school life situations, and a bit spicy tastes of romance additional just been added to their relations to gave the show more nuances. But, they still tried to keep it to its main point. Then, its about their now live.The girl as always hinted as a no good person to attached with her new live before meeting the boy. Its...indeed talked about the gloomy feeling, and surrenderring all of the good times she had at the school just to enjoy the twilight, alone. The boy himself felt unrealistic, tho, acted strangely, looked too embarassed, and even never got a chance to forgot his first love that missing from the earthquake events. By their fate of encounters, they both granted a huge changed, a big development over their new life. They both enjoyed it. They both had a fun with how beautiful panoramic it had in their surrounding. At the end, its just a simple story of people that needed to move on from their previous comfort zone. And for me, its just so soothing, and pretty decent.Idk how people just staked up the movie with such a high expectations, instead of just enjoying the simple meaning. Its just, need to chill down a little bit and enjoyed their amazing art and animation behind all of those gorgeous backgrounds. The story wise was okay with its simplicity. Nothing bad about it. Or people just hate a simplicity over the same clicheness of a romantic school life drama in its progressed. Oh, well, what a touchable reason.For me, once again at my sole satisfaction, this is deserved on my 8/10 for my Overall.Its not that great. But surely its had a good moments on it. The storyline somehow had some issues that maybe irritating some elitist people. For me, its just a 7 by knowing how its simple and really easy to understand if really just wanted to enjoyed a simple movie about the classic romantic drama of the high schooler. Yeah, peoples nowaday had so much stake on its head.A nice art detailed on the background together with its okay animation. Its not my liking, tho. So i found it quite okay. This might be the best aspect for the movie. But, i fit it in 9 just in cased that i still stay true on my previous statement. Its pretty enough, right? Or else its overrated? Whatever, this is my decision. Lol.The soundtrack and the inserting songs felt good too on my hearing. Who hate the violin rythym mixing it with Beethoven components of music? I am certainly not! The ED quite smooth and attached well too on my heart. So, its matched up on my 8.The characters hit my fine level. Its nothing bad about it. Its just, simple. Its about their youth life. Its about their puberty. Why so exaggerating about it?

Thats it for me. indeed talked about the gloomy feeling, and surrenderring all of the good times she had at the school just to enjoy the twilight, alone. The boy himself felt unrealistic, tho, acted strangely, looked too embarassed, and even never got a chance to forgot his first love that missing from the earthquake events. By their fate of encounters, they both granted a huge changed, a big development over their new life. They both enjoyed it. They both had a fun with how beautiful panoramic it had in their surrounding. At the end, its just a simple story of people that needed to move on from their previous comfort zone. And for me, its just so soothing, and pretty decent.Idk how people just staked up the movie with such a high expectations, instead of just enjoying the simple meaning. Its just, need to chill down a little bit and enjoyed their amazing art and animation behind all of those gorgeous backgrounds. The story wise was okay with its simplicity. Nothing bad about it. Or people just hate a simplicity over the same clicheness of a romantic school life drama in its progressed. Oh, well, what a touchable reason.For me, once again at my sole satisfaction, this is deserved on my 8/10 for my Overall.Its not that great. But surely its had a good moments on it. The storyline somehow had some issues that maybe irritating some elitist people. For me, its just a 7 by knowing how its simple and really easy to understand if really just wanted to enjoyed a simple movie about the classic romantic drama of the high schooler. Yeah, peoples nowaday had so much stake on its head.A nice art detailed on the background together with its okay animation. Its not my liking, tho. So i found it quite okay.

It\'s realistic for two artistic and sensitive souls to fall in love with each other, and the way the Hakubo tied to it to the main female character\'s musical aspirations made sense. The plot progression between the male landscape painter and female violinist was handled with a lot of care and depth.There has been a large trend with romance anime to include quirky and rambunctious love interests (e.g.,  Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!). While I think that may...suit the palate of some people, it is unfair to judge other romance anime with the same standards. Hakubo is a much slower and tender in a manner that feels more authentic. The classical music in this anime was incredible, and some scenes, such as being inspired by the breathtaking twilight, were conveyed well. I think people who are deep into classical music or landscape painting would like this anime.My only complaint is some of the background art in certain areas did not jibe well with the character art. Some of the background art contrasted the character art a little to much, but overall, it was a good anime I highly recommend if you\'re in the mood for a subtle, heart-felt romance story that involves two artistic youths. suit the palate of some people, it is unfair to judge other romance anime with the same standards.

This movie wasn't that bad as people reviewed it to be. There really is no story or plot here. Just a slow mundane kind of setting growing into romance between 2 people. And whats wrong with that? The animation is really good. Probably the strongest plus point of this movie is the animation. The characters are alright. The main female lead is very relatable to certain degrees. She is quite, innocent and also seemed very pure. Very likeable character indeed. But the male lead seemed pretty high on puberty. The movie also felt kinda rushed and that's also a downside to it....It did lacked a lot of element that a romance movie should have. But nonetheless it was still enjoyable.PS- I don't think i wasted 50 mins of my life and i think you're not going to waste it too. It did lacked a lot of element that a romance movie should have.

The description is VERY MISLEADING. I thought this was gonna be about the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami from 2011 but throughout its entire runtime, there isn\'t a single mention of it. No, it\'s not even a part of the story. I\'m sure that they only included it to try and lure people in. The story lacks depth and doesn\'t really go anywhere, nor does it have some sort of message that it tries to give the viewer. What about the plot? There is no plot.Next, let me talk about the actual story. What the story is...actually about, is a generic ""girl meets boy"" romance, and it even fails in doing that.Art & Animation - 4The background art is great... and that\'s just about the only good thing this had to offer.The art style and the character designs look like they\'re from 2009 or something like that. It wasn\'t pleasing in the slightest and sometimes the characters look kinda ugly. They go off model a lot and that really takes away from the experience.The animation isn\'t even good either. Actually, it was bad. The characters movements felt stiff, clunky, and unnatural. It didn\'t feel realistic. The worst part is the part when the girls are playing their violins for their exhibition. It looked like really bad CG, and the movements felt uncanny and the characters were shaking a lot. It reminds me of how the characters tremble in Aku no Hana. It felt rotograved or like they traced CG animation! There were even parts where I could tell it was CG!Sound - 4At least the music wasn\'t terrible. The ending song is okay, but the rest of the music was forgettable and most of the time I didn\'t even notice it. The voice acting isn\'t very good, especially the male lead.Characters - 1I didn\'t really care about the characters. They were all bland, generic, and 1 dimensional. The main girl, Sachi wasn\'t very interesting and the only ""trait"" she really has is that she can play the violin.

Hakubo is a very solid movie;it's a simplistic love story revolving two teenagers brought together by the Hakubo. Hakubo being the title for the scenery near their bus stop. They begin a relationship that naturally progresses into a romantic relationship. The movie doesn't do much or attempt to do much.

The hook that its about the lives of teenagers post the 2011 earthquake is of little to no significance in the narrative.That out of the way, it's an okay high school romance.

The heroine, Sachi, is a 17-year-old girl who is a violin enthusiast, in the midst of her quest for identity, but who doesn\'t really seem interested in social relationships. She has her own music club, and that\'s enough for her. Rather introverted, she likes to enjoy simple things alone, such as sunsets. The narration, from her point of view, is initially enough to try to understand the high school student and her way of seeing the world. Her meeting with Kiji, a boy...her age, will (of course) upset her tidy daily life. An artist too, he paints in his spare time, and seems to have the same passion as Sachi for twilight. Inevitably, they both fall in love. Their romance is rather cute, although there is nothing original about it. Its evolution is predictable despite some ""twists"". We could have blamed it on the format of the film, namely a medium-length film, which doesn\'t have time to develop this one. But the romance, somewhat rushed, is not the only one to have been botched in the end. Above all, what interested me in Hakubo was the willingness of the director and the studio to highlight the March 2011 catastrophe that hit Japan, and particularly Fukushima. So one could imagine that the story would naturally take place after these sad events, telling the traumas resulting from them on the inhabitants of the region. But it is not, or almost not. So yes, Sachi seems to be marked by the earthquake and what came after it. However, we only learn about it because his sister talks about it, otherwise it is not obvious. For Kiji, the trauma is indeed more present. But the film once again hovers over this intrigue which, however, could have given Hakubo a boost. The medium-length film would have needed it, because apart from the romance, not much happens. Beyond the romance and the failed message that Yamamoto Yutaka wanted to convey about the March 2011 drama, there is little left to say about Hakubo. Apart from the main couple, the other characters are only extras and bring nothing to the plot. Nevertheless, we will retain Hii, Sachi\'s very annoying friend, whom we can\'t help but hate so much because she is so selfish and unbearable. But that\'s all. On the other hand, I really appreciated the simple and soft atmosphere in which the film plunges us, with a certain serenity which emerges from it. The soundtrack is effective, with violin pieces in perfect harmony with the visuals, and above all, the sumptuous representations of the sky. Special mention for the ending Tooku interpreted with great delicacy by Azuma Hitomi. If the sets are indeed rather successful, the animation can leave one skeptical. There is a certain contrast between the shades of colors of the sky worked with precision and the rather singular chara-design. The facial expressions are hardly perceptible, especially the smiles. And the animation is sometimes very (too) fast and sometimes almost static. This is a pity. I won\'t go as far as to say that Hakubo is bad. Let\'s say that it is a nice entertainment but very far from being transcendental. I didn\'t have high expectations for the movie, but it still left me disappointed and somewhat frustrated. The poetry of the beginning fades very quickly in favor of boredom, all the more so since the romance, the real interest of the film, turns out to be tasteless and above all dispatched.

Blood-C,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C,"[""Blood-c is one giant troll of an anime. Unfortunately, it proved so good at the gimmick it used that it chased away most of the audience before the good times started rolling. I was going to give it a stinky 3 by episode five but then I continued watching and by the end it had redeemed itself. Still, that is no excuse for those awful, eye-gouging first episodes.Story:Since you are most probably a returning customer to the Blood franchise, you are already familiar with the story. Sword-wielding mystery girl in a high school uniform fights man-eating monsters. Mystery is solved in a gory, splattery,...bloody, dismembering, brain-bits-flying, bone-cracking way.Blood-c has no continuity with the previous anime of the franchise. It takes the basic story and spins a different tale. So, if you, like me, were expecting more Haji—gawd, there can never be enough Haji!—you will be sorely disappointed. Sigh~ (Allow me a moment to once again overcome my disappointment in this crucial omission)So, is this a good story? In a word, yes. But that becomes apparent only when you finish it. Once again, the first few episodes are trolling you in a very horrible way. This would have been acceptable in a 24 episode show but in a 12 episode show it did irreparable damage. So, it requires a certain masochism to get you through to the good part.Characters:It is very difficult to talk about the characters without including major spoilers, so I'll do it this way…Saya is a high school moe-tard klutz by day and a kickass, monster-slaying, katana-wielding warrior by night. How could that possibly be combined, you ask. Watch to the end and be amazed.The rest of the cast—no, I am not being lazy, it has to be this way—are just as they should be. Watch to the end and be amazed.Animation:Anorexic 7-feet-tall people design courtesy of CLAMP aside, this anime really rocks the fight scenes. Smooth, sleek, gory; these scenes are the main reason to watch this anime. Every time it was blood--fest time it was like the anime became ten times better. Even the animation came alive.Music:I noticed three distinct soundtrack groups. One for the horrid slice of life wannabe. One for the creepy times and one for the fight scenes. I must say the creepy times soundtrack impressed me the most. It was exquisitely creepy.OP: Awesome. Fluid and beautifully stylised animation with a standard j-rock ditty. I wish the whole thing could have been like the OP.ED: Boring. I skipped it every time.Overview:It is very difficult to recommend this because it sabotages itself with a horrible beginning but if you are into gory stuff, this will not disappoint. It is not called “blood” for nothing, you know. Some of the brutal stuff I saw popped my eyes out and I was even watching the censored version.

Ruined or half assed, story wise?STORY: Years ago there was an unfortunate case of assault, the victim? Blood the last vampire, a popular movie that spawned an even more popular over-hyped anime series: Blood+, the perpetrator had no motives, it was a cruel and brutal assault in form of a live action, and ever since, Blood has been hospitalized in a vegetative state and was never heard from again... Until...In the year 2011 however, a famous group of manga creators, CLAMP, visited Blood in the hospital in order to try to revive it from...it\'s vegetative state, in form of a new Blood, Blood Clamp AKA Blood C AKA Blood Crap AKA Blood Crazy...That\'s a true story, I swear!Anyway, I\'ll cut to the chase and out right say what we all said: What the fuck happened Clamp? I know we can\'t trust you girls to make a decent ending for your manga anymore (Tsubasa for example), but now we can\'t trust you girls to do a remake of popular franchises as well? To be fair, lots of people fuck up remakes, but a lot was expected.Alright I\'m riding Clamp too hard here, it\'s not all their fault for this failure (I\'m being as lenient as possible here), Production I.G. shares some of the blame as well (The series creator is supposedly overlooking the creation of Blood C, but apparently he\'s letting Clamp do what they want and not paying attention to what\'s going on).Where do I begin with whats wrong with Blood C, the beginning? The beginning? Or the ending? A beginning that drags on for way too long, which isn\'t a problem... for a 20 something or longer episode anime, Blood C, however, is 12 episodes long (And with a movie coming up too? They\'r clearly over estimating their new series)! With 5 episodes of some of the worse character pondering I\'ve seen in a while, in a supposedly action anime fulled with irritatingly dull cliches and Clamp cliches... Which all of it is even more frustrating towards the end with quite a dumb plot twist.While Blood C isn\'t afraid to waste your time (Some of the characters act like they\'re self aware of the nothingness that occurs at one point, I guess that\'s clever, but it ends up more obnoxious than clever and then there are scenes where a voice keeps talking about things don\'t stay the same forever, they make you want to tone out all the nonsense... Nonsense that is relevant however), it\'s also not not afraid to push irritating characters, as a couple of twins with no point of being there at all do all the annoying things you expect them to (I\'m hoping that I\'m not alone in wanting the twins dead... LOL), an emotionless father, and even the main character, Saya, herself! A clumsy school girl with stupid hair (The animators are either lazy or she uses countless cans of hairspray to keep her hair in place outside of the cool looking action scenes) that has a terrible personally swap between serious sword wielding warrior and cute clueless school girl.But while Blood C isn\'t wasting your time (with character pondering), it\'s showing you spectacular and very bloody (The one it gets perfectly right most of the time) battles. Every episode ends with a fight between Saya and a creature called a Elder Bairn or whatever, often ending up with a bloody shower. These fight scenes are the meat experience of Blood C, they\'re not battles that you can only experience in Blood C, but they are well animated and well choreographed (Especially the first episode).However, the blood and gore eventually goes over the top, like Fist of the north star or Devilman over the top. But it\'s so fucking crazy that it\'s really comical in a way, especially the final episode, it\'s one of those so bad it\'s actually kinda good episodes that makes you wish the anime was like this from the start.That\'s the real shame about Blood C, instead of production values, battles, blood, and gore, more time should had went towards crafting a better story or at least one that doesn\'t feel like a waste of time, especially for the fans of the Blood anime that came before it.While I am not a big fan of Blood+ or Blood the last vampire, there really should have been at least a little more for the fans that watched those series first. Of course that\'s a good thing that they aren\'t relaying on using the same elements from those series, apart from Saya, the creature she fights, and a of course the sword she has to use in order to kill the creatures, but at least throw the old fans a bone once in a while, most of the time it feels like Saya is conserving with absolute strangers, at least have one other recognizable character or element that veteran fans can latch on to.And there is one more thing to be said, the later episodes drop a huge ball. Let\'s just say Clamp has gotten extremely lazy these days and has decided to bring up a plot device from one of their previous series to advance the plot. So when I said that there\'s nothing for Blood fans to enjoy and be familiar with, there\'s actually plenty for fans of a recent Clamp title... It\'s actually kinda infuriating that Clamp would actually do something as lazy as that.The story ends up becoming a retarded fan fiction in a way... But never fully embraces it though, it just overlooks it in a way that it kinda has no point in being mentioned at all.Another thing that\'s pretty lazy is the character development and story twists. They are so uninspired that you\'d think the creators are making it up as they go along. And the character developments... Let\'s just say that everything\'s so half-assed that CLAMP was actually making it proceed in that way just to waste even more of your time...ANIMATION: Like I said before the fights are well animated (Most of the time), and fans of clamp are treated to clamps distinctive character designs (Skinny, skinny teenagers with long limbs and perfect bodies), But a lot of the characters designs look bland, and Saya\'s new design looks just plain stupid.SOUND: Another thing that actually had effort put in it, the music. It\'s all great, the fight scenes have great background music to go with them, the voice acting is good, but there\'s one thing you may want to rip your ears out, Saya has a habit of singing, for a long time, about the most pointless stuff. It\'s hilarious at first, but later you\'d wonder, ""Is that really important for us to suffer through her American Idol try out practice?""But to kinda make up for it, both the opening and ending theme music are great (Leave it to the professionals to do the singing Saya), the opening theme song, Spiral by DUSTZ, will be the one good thing you\'ll look forward to each episode, and the ending, while not as good, is a great way to end each episode.At least this is one thing that Production I.G. cared about.OVERALL:The Good:+ Cool battles, when they\'re animated well.+ Great music and opening theme song.Mixed:+/- Good animation, and Clamp character designs/ Clamp characters designs, Saya\'s redesign.+/- The last episode/ the last and second to last episode.The Bad:- Terrible character pondering, such as Saya and her terrible singing.- Isn\'t afraid to waste your time with absolute pointlessness.- Annoying characters, especially the twins.- Nothing for even fans of the original movie or Blood+ to keep their interest.- Clamp relaying on one of their previous series for story development.- No point of the character developments of anyone not named Saya- Ludicrously violent scenes to the point of being cartoonish and comical.Despite what I said, I\'m actually looking forward to the sequel movie because if the anime continues to go the way the last episode did, at least Blood C will become Blood Cult hit. it\'s vegetative state, in form of a new Blood, Blood Clamp AKA Blood C AKA Blood Crap AKA Blood Crazy...That\'s a true story, I swear!Anyway, I\'ll cut to the chase and out right say what we all said: What the fuck happened Clamp? I know we can\'t trust you girls to make a decent ending for your manga anymore (Tsubasa for example), but now we can\'t trust you girls to do a remake of popular franchises as well? To be fair, lots of people fuck up remakes, but a lot was expected.Alright I\'m riding Clamp too hard here, it\'s not all their fault for this failure (I\'m being as lenient as possible here), Production I.G. shares some of the blame as well (The series creator is supposedly overlooking the creation of Blood C, but apparently he\'s letting Clamp do what they want and not paying attention to what\'s going on).Where do I begin with whats wrong with Blood C, the beginning? The beginning? Or the ending? A beginning that drags on for way too long, which isn\'t a problem... for a 20 something or longer episode anime, Blood C, however, is 12 episodes long (And with a movie coming up too? They\'r clearly over estimating their new series)! With 5 episodes of some of the worse character pondering I\'ve seen in a while, in a supposedly action anime fulled with irritatingly dull cliches and Clamp cliches... Which all of it is even more frustrating towards the end with quite a dumb plot twist.While Blood C isn\'t afraid to waste your time (Some of the characters act like they\'re self aware of the nothingness that occurs at one point, I guess that\'s clever, but it ends up more obnoxious than clever and then there are scenes where a voice keeps talking about things don\'t stay the same forever, they make you want to tone out all the nonsense... Nonsense that is relevant however), it\'s also not not afraid to push irritating characters, as a couple of twins with no point of being there at all do all the annoying things you expect them to (I\'m hoping that I\'m not alone in wanting the twins dead... LOL), an emotionless father, and even the main character, Saya, herself! A clumsy school girl with stupid hair (The animators are either lazy or she uses countless cans of hairspray to keep her hair in place outside of the cool looking action scenes) that has a terrible personally swap between serious sword wielding warrior and cute clueless school girl.But while Blood C isn\'t wasting your time (with character pondering), it\'s showing you spectacular and very bloody (The one it gets perfectly right most of the time) battles. Every episode ends with a fight between Saya and a creature called a Elder Bairn or whatever, often ending up with a bloody shower. These fight scenes are the meat experience of Blood C, they\'re not battles that you can only experience in Blood C, but they are well animated and well choreographed (Especially the first episode).However, the blood and gore eventually goes over the top, like Fist of the north star or Devilman over the top.

Never have I seen so much bitterness and hatred against a show. Well, let me be the first to present the opposite of the mainstream opinions: I loved Blood C (gasp!) Before you turn away however, please let me explain.Blood C is literally a creative liberation from the two sister series in the Blood franchise; the only connection (so far) is that they all focus on a girl named Saya who wields a sword and fights monsters. Blood + had 50...episodes, and thus had plenty of arcs and time to develop its very large cast- Blood C, on the other hand, at the most, has 12 episodes, and thus uses most of its time to build up atmosphere. Which it excels at, at the expense of fleshing out the secondary characters. Before you rain on my parade, there are a few things to note; Blood C is part of the Blood franchise, which includes the movie Blood; The Last Vampire, and Blood +, the sequel anime show. Please, please stick this in your head now: Blood C has absolutely nothing to do with these two installments. It is a mere sister series with the shadow of the concept. Thus treat this as an entirely new show.That said, I will put it out forward: Blood C is either a show you are going to loathe or that you are going to love. Most people hated it, some people liked it. I loved it. It is not for people who are looking for interesting fabulous fleshed out characters (this is coming from someone who is the biggest sucker for character development). This is a show that focuses on atmosphere and building it. It is a horror series. It is not an action series, though the action scenes in this show are some of the most creative, well animated ones I have seen.It is literally horror at its best- I assure you that if you're a sucker for the type of horror which is more psychological than just pop-outs, this show is for you. If you hate slow build ups, move on. The first half of Blood C focuses on instilling the surreal setting and life of the show into your head. I won’t deny it; the first four episodes or so are pretty dull because they are monotonous; Saya sings a song to school, chatters with her buddies, and fights a monster. What you don’t realize is that this is all- and I mean all of it, pay attention to all the details- for a very good reason, which comes later. This is the part where I admit that there are some flaws; this could have been easily condensed into three episodes max. It still does a good job of developing a very eerie aura though; you have the constant feeling that something is very wrong about this town, and yet you can’t place your finger on it. There's an eerie tension consistently kept despite the seemingly innocuous events; a tension that's about to snap and yet you don't know when or how.So whereas the first half spends its time just fleshing the atmosphere and setting of the world Saya lives in, and the latter half spends the next half tearing that world down.  Allow me to present you the latter half of Blood C, which absolutely shines like no other. Halfway throughout this show, you are literally smacked in the face. Repeatedly. In each episode. This is the real deal- you are given cruel reality of the situation; and goddamn, it is cruel. It is merciless. I am not just talking about the gore, which mind you, is on par of that of Narutaru, which has some of the most disturbing scenes I have seen yet. The gore is of course, censored (not the show’s fault, the network’s fault, something which will be fixed when the DVDs come out and dear lord then you can let your stomach churn), but that’s not what makes it horrifying; it’s the way the gore happens, the way no one is spared in this show, the sounds which are so gruesomely realistic. This is not a show for the faint of heart. But the gore is only the sprinkles on the actual cake. The cake is the series of red herrings and plot twists that wrench your heart. You will witness in horror, how everything in front of you, how every trope known to anime kind, is smashed and ripped apart. If anything, Blood C excels at building atmosphere and horror. The fight scenes are as fabulous as they are gruesome.  But yes. Blood C's purpose and key to the show is how it builds up the plot layer by layer, paranoia by paranoia. The villains are completely ruthless, and there is no battle fought without someone dying.The characters are where things get messy. There’ s two very good reasons why none of the cast except Saya is fleshed out. Nevertheless, they are pretty stereotypical, and are very CLAMPish. But once again; you don’t really end up bothering about them for good reasons. Saya herself is very likeable; you come to empathize with her situation if anything and while you might get irritated with her….inepititude, at times, you have to understand what she’s going through. In the end, this show is about her for reasons you have yet to find out, so don’t be quick to judge!Which brings me to the last, and most important aspect of an anime; how it ends. I have two huge problems with anime, as someone who has seen more than enough for a lifetime.1.) The ending is rushed. You have no idea how frustrating this is. This is not a tv drama in which a season’s ending can be bad and can pick itself off the ground later on. This is a conclusion and nothing is more irritating and annoying than loving a show only to see the worst plot holes and resolution possible.2.) Animes that build up to a movie, or huge series, tend to be terrible. Let’s look at two prime examples; .hack//ROOTS was the buildup to the game series, .hack//G.U Trilogy, and it just failed as an individual series because it only left us with very little to deal with and just a fancy commercial to buy the games. Higashi no Eden had wonderful, wonderful potential but got axed by the fact that it was nothing but a mere leg for the two movies to follow. As individual series, these tend to absolutely collapse.Blood C completely surpasses these two typical faults and succeeds. It paces itself extremely, extremely well; the finale was fantastic and does not leave any open ties that cannot be answered by a movie sequel. The buildup to the finale itself is wonderful, for the most part; while the first part lags a little, it’s not a huge problem and hell, once you’re in, you are stuck in for the biggest ride. Not only does it separate itself as an individual show, and actually solve most of the problems raised in the show and leave a resolution (or many) for it to be complete on its own, but it manages to still raise questions and leave some unanswered so that it can tie itself over with the movie. You are left with a feeling of excitement and resolution; you want to go back and rewatch the series again, but at the same time you’re excited that some big questions are going to be answered in the movie installment.What's even greater is the subtlety- you can go back through this series and catch on the really tiny moments and dialogue that what were once usually tasteless random things, are now essential ‘oh!’ moments where you realize there’s two (or more) things being said. I’m a huge fan of subtlety and I guess that’s why I’m such a passionate fan of this show, and I’m really glad they’re doing stuff like this.Basically, Blood C was fabulous for me. It had the layered buildup of Shiki, the horror of Ghost Hound and themes of Jigoku Shoujo, and gore of Shadow Star. If you like horror, and well paced ones, then totally go for this. It’s not for everyone though, and it’s definitely not for the faint of heart. It takes huge, huge risks, risks that most series would not go for, but it manages to complete the leap and land with a very solid and steady landing.  I personally, I believe Blood C is a remarkable show that pushes the boundaries of the Blood franchise and creates horror by clashing it with the mundane, ordinary life- only making it more frightening than ever. episodes, and thus had plenty of arcs and time to develop its very large cast- Blood C, on the other hand, at the most, has 12 episodes, and thus uses most of its time to build up atmosphere.

So many unanswered questions as the plot thickens (if there is one). I feel sorry for the fans of the original. I really can't stand the random deaths that occur in this anime, FANS of BLOOD-C you know what I'm saying because you cant say that you haven't noticed it. Its like you're playing this horrible video games and your at a boss fight and you...have to rescue bystanders (come the f*%k on y when you see a something that looks strange would you wander in its direction if it was me i was hauling ass out of there). No logical was put into the brains of the background characters (pay close attention to episode 6 and point out all the faults I'll point out one pay attention to Nono's appearance look at the street pretty empty for a town filled with shops, businessmen appears out of thin air OH look a random merchant dies what the hell was he doing in that alleyway as he came out running to find out if Saya was alright. You catch the drift.The best thing about this anime is that its almost over. I read a couple comments on the forums and what I don't get is how some of you could say 'this is SO much like CLAMP good job with this anime', WTF how is this anything to what clamped has produced over the years it's not even close to what you'll expect from them if you check my list you'll see that all of CLAMPs' production that I've see and those that I've yet to list was some of the best anime and that i really enjoyed it by checking my score. Blood-C you're my rage bar filler and by the time I've finished watching this series i will read a very entertaining novel by a very world renowned novelist to remove the dark spots on my brain.[END OF UPDATE]Final review at the end of this animeThis is what I wanna do after watching this. Cry, Blow my brains out, be resurrected as a zombie and terrorize the living daylight out of the guys at CLAMP.After watching 2 episodes of this I am really really disappointed. The story is going no where, its predictable and omg the slow plot and the fact that she's singing please stop, it's the singing that makes me want to roll my brains down Mt. Everest. The time it takes where she is sing can be better put to use like developing a plot with one of the other characters that was introduced in the 1st episode.Everyone that has seen Blood+ I suggest you watch it to get an idea of what your supposed to be watching and if you have seen it already re-watch the first 2 episode compare it to Blood C and you'll know what a total let down this is.I will not drop the series because there is still room to see what's gonna happen after all it's only 2 episodes, 'right.'My point system based out of 10Character design-The fact that she is a supposedly badass, the glasses long squiggly twin tail hair is just plain bad. She fights in the same uniform she goes to school with after going home her father could atleast provide her with a new fitting of clothes along with her sword. (4)Art design-The art isn't bad but it isn't that good either each character was well drawn but they lack the memorable depth that was realized from the Blood+ series. The only memory that gonna stain your brain is that badly drawn hair of Saya. Who knows maybe they'll decide to cut it or remove the wookies that hold it together. (6)Story-JUST PLAIN BAD! ugh. (2). Hopefully this would change after all it's only 2 episodes 'right'.Overall-There is allot of room that can change my view of this series, like I've said perviously it's only 2 episodes so far and my review is subject to change after the first arch is completed.

(5)"", 'This is a spoiler free review.Also this is my first review, so be nice. And English is not my native language, so sorry if there are some mistakes.Ok, So this is the third installment in the Blood franchise by Production I.G. Which is a great studio that had done some amazing things, but at the same time it\'s no stranger to failing miserably, as demonstrated by this particular anime.*Story*Well, if you\'re familiar with the previous \'Blood\' installments, you\'d know that the premise is about a schoolgirl with a sword who fights vampire-like creatures known as \'Teropterids\' in the original movie,  and \'Chiropterans\' in Blood+....In this version she fights creatures that are nothing like vampires, but basically just man eating monsters. Which is actually a pretty cool change that I\'m okay with. Anyway, Since this is a remake, it goes without saying that the premise nothing new, but to its credit, at least it tries to change it a little bit (though it doesn\'t pay off, unfortunately).The story itself is very weak, because it lacks actual content and a lot of the episodes are semi episodic and they don\'t reveal any significant clue about what the monsters are and what\'s underneath the surface here. That is except for the last two and a half episodes. That means you can basically watch the first 9 episodes and be none the wiser about what\'s taking place than you were in episode 1. In fact, you\'ll only have more questions (though not many since hardly anything happens that seems important). All you have happening in each episode is some boring slice of life/school stuff.. which hardly has any bearing on the plot (and very little on character development) and then it goes straight to the next monster battle.It has a weak presentation and despite being a much shorter series it\'s pacing seems worse than Blood+\'s pacing. At least in Blood+ you had 50 episodes in which things actually progress through out them, even if it was a little slow.. Here you have a pointless monster of the week formula, boring dialogue and some minor clues here and there for 9 1/2 episodes and only the remaining 2 1/2 have the meat of the story (which makes it very rushed and badly planned).So it probably could\'ve worked (slightly) better if it was just a 6 or 7 episode OVA instead of 12 episodes + a full length movie. Speaking of which, this series might remind you of some bad Gore OVAs from the 80s, but with modern moe girls and pretty boys etc\'.Anyway,  I won\'t spoil anything, but in the last 2 episodes of the series an insane twist is revealed that was supposedly in plain sight the whole time (which to its credit, was cleverly foreshadowed).  But be warned since it is very farfetched and poorly excused, so you\'d most likely be left scratching your head... Yes, even with the poor amount of story it has, it fails to make sense of it. The twist is just a bad excuse for every absurdity in this anime. I did like the basic idea behind it, but it was done very poorly.Oh and it ends with a cliffhanger, so you  have to watch the sequel movie for the conclusion (which was so boring, slow and mostly predictable,  I nearly fell asleep watching it).So In a nutshell, the story has little quantity, no quality, a corny and anti climatic conclusion. So yeah, I\'m gonna say the story is pretty bad.*Characters*The main character\'s name is Saya and she has different personalities in each Blood installment. One thing they have in common though is that they all have a badass monster hunter mode and a normal girl mode.In the original movie Saya was actually pretty bland, but that was only a 50 min movie, so there\'s not much time for fleshing out characters.In Blood+ Saya had a great personality that was fleshed out properly. She was kinda cute, but I\'m sure nobody would argue that she was a moeblob. Besides, she behaved in ways that were very believable and realistic. Pretty much what you\'d expect from a teenage girl in that situation.In this version on the other hand, she IS more of a moeblob that panders shamelessly to the otaku base. No attempt for realism here.She\'s a cute and sensitive klutz who\'s good at sports.. So you\'re probably wondering how a klutz can be good at sports? does that add up? Though I might be wrong here, I really don\'t think it does.. But who cares!? she\'s a fetish for fanboys!But regardless, even the part about her being ""sensitive"" and ""caring"" which is established quite clearly in the beginning of the series, is thrown out the window later on when she doesn\'t even flinch at the sight of her friends and others who live in her village being brutally slaughtered by monsters (and notice that this is not when she\'s in badass mode).Not to mention that she recovers way too fast after witnessing these horrible deaths. Some of which she could\'ve prevented, but didn\'t for no reason whatsoever (or rather, the reason is just to show gorey deaths). So the little character development it has is laughable. On top of that, Saya is the only character with a backstory and even the one she has is very lame and vague.The rest of the cast isn\'t even worth mentioning. They\'re all familiar cardboard cutouts you won\'t care about, and/or just there to die. Oh and the monsters have no personality either. No surprise there though.The characters are horrendous!*Art*I\'m personally not a fan of Clamp\'s artwork and though I know some people are, I doubt even they will claim that Clamp\'s skinny + moe + bishounen + bright colors art style fits an anime as grim and Gorey as this.To its credit however, the animation is fluid and certainly an improvement over Blood+.Also the monsters have pretty creative (scary) designs and each monster is unique and fights differently. Much better than the Chiropreran in Blood+. And the monster battles themselves are very well done and with extreme Elfen Lied-style exaggerated gore (actually this is even more Gorey than Elfen Lied).The only problem I have with the battles is that Saya could\'ve got a little more injured to make most of the battles less one sided.The art\'s really good overall though not really my cup of tea.*Sound*Not much I can say about this department.The opening sounds nice, but it has a lot of engrish, which is kind of annoying.The ending song is ok, I guess.The sound effects are good, but they sometimes feel out of place. For example when Saya clashes with a monster with her sword, it sounds like the monster is made out of metal.Can\'t say much about the OST, I guess it\'s pretty forgettable.Even though I don\'t know Japanese, I guess the voice acting\'s ok, nothing special though.The sound as a whole ain\'t bad.*Enjoyment*This is a very subjective part of the review, so let\'s put it this way: if you Like Gore, you will enjoy this. If you like a little bit of moeness and Gore combined you\'ll enjoy this even more.That is of course if you can overlook the quality of the storyline and the characters. Personally? I didn\'t enjoy it much. The whole thing just felt unnecessarily mean spirited and unpleasant. Don\'t get me wrong,  there are some nice battles that were fun to look at, but they also felt empty because there isn\'t much context behind it, and you don\'t care about the characters involved. In fact, you might end up rooting for the monsters at some point.*Overall* 4/10It\'s not the worst I\'ve ever seen, but overall it\'s pretty damn bad and it takes the franchise a few steps backwards instead of going forwards.I\'ll give this series some credit though - it\'s among the most violent anime I\'ve ever seen (it\'s insane!). Though the violence in it is stylized differently, it should still be up there together with Genocyber, Violence Jack, Shigurui, the Hokuto no Ken OVA and others. In this version she fights creatures that are nothing like vampires, but basically just man eating monsters. Which is actually a pretty cool change that I\'m okay with.

Most of the /really/ gory stuff in censored, but you still get a general idea of what's happening in the scene.The fighting is excellent, Saya...sure knows how to handle a sword! I've seen about six/seven fights in the series so far, and each one makes my heart pound when I watch it.The art is brilliant, the character designs are very fresh, and go easy on the eyes when you look at them, my favourites happen to be Saya herself, her father, her best friend, and her teacher. The character development is little, but the series still presents enough for you to pick up on.Don't even get me started on the music, the opening (combining both Japanese, English, AND french) is just amazing, I had to replay it over and over when I first listened to it, the same goes for the ending theme, too.Overall, I think this is a very good series to pick up on, most of the negative reviews are coming from people who are sorely disappointed because Blood-C is not a duplicate of Blood+.

I\'m a fan of ""a girl with sword fights monsters"", and because of it, I usually am quite forgiving, but this is a truly dreadful show.It starts innocently enough - the characters are pretty to look at, and the setting, a small town, a high school and a temple, pleasant enough. The first couple of episodes fool you with a promise of goods that will never be delivered.The characters are pretty flat with no development to speak of. I could not bring myself to like Saya, who, as the protagonist, too many times just...stood there, watching people, even her friends, die. We can forgive a hero the deaths when they try hard and fail, but watching and not acting is simply indefensible.It seems like there was no story to tell - most episodes are repetitive, filled with a battle scene and piling up dead. There is a touch of mystery, as Saya tries to remember some vague promise, which, at this point, just seems like a poor attempt at creating drama.In the end, there are two things I enjoyed - the art is the only redeeming feature of Blood-C and Saya\'s song, catchy, but abandoned after the initial few episodes. Both not enough to save the show as far as I am concerned. With just 3 episodes left till the end, I can\'t imagine anything Blood-C can do to change or improve. stood there, watching people, even her friends, die.

Will edit this into a ""full review"" once the series has ended.Story: Not much to say here other than what most people probably already knew, that this series has the same concept only in different variation to that already found in the other Blood franchises which started from ""Blood: The Last Vampire (2000)"" and followed by ""Blood+ (2005)."" As an introductory episode, it left me some very good impressions that this anime is something I’ll definitely be looking forward watching week-after-week.For the actual episode itself, it begins...with some interesting discussion about the definition of a person then progress to the introduction of the main character and the people around her. All in all the events was pretty standard for first episodes. The highlight of the episode is in the later part concerning Saya\'s duty which immediately shifted the mood from lighthearted to serious and the fight in the end which have some good slasher moments.Animation: The color tones used are a bit dull but it fits the overall theme of the series which is more on the darker side. Character designs is very CLAMP; the facial features in distant camera shots appears to be detailed so it is something noteworthy for me. The environmental detail is a bit lacking and doesn’t appear HD quality to me but it was offset by the grainy details that are observable in the animation. I like how the battle is animated in the final minutes, very well choreograph although the enemy lacks detail, it just look like a big piece of moving muddy rock, it could be better.Sound: OP and ED themes are good but not something I’ll be listening every time I watch an episode of Blood-C. The soundtracks are however great specially in the fight scene; It composed mostly of tracks that sounds strangely familiar which I may have already heard from somewhere else, but the overall impact are great. The voice behind Saya did a very good job giving life to her character and charm (I like the scene of Saya singing, and I felt…Oh! It’s a wonderful voice), I could also recognize some very familiar voices which I’m excited to hear more as the series progresses.Character: I’ll talk about Saya, so far I like how she transforms from a carefree individual into someone so BADASS (with that fiery-looking eyes); I’m a person with a natural inclination for female characters with strong personalities, granted she didn’t look like someone fitting that description from the outside, but after witnessing how calm she was battling her opponent, I’m convince that she has it inside her. As for the other characters, not much details are revealed so I it is something I will be looking forward next episodes.Enjoyment: The episode did well and I felt that it did what any first episode should do —- give a good impression to its viewers that will make them look forward watching the series, obviously I have a very good enjoyment on it. Initially, I felt the character design is out of place but after quickly remembering that it is done by CLAMP, my impression quickly rebounded positively. I have watched this episode 3x already before this writing.Updates:ep.6: Massive while-lines across the screen, it somehow kills the enjoyment, had to watch the BD versions once it\'s out.ep.7: Story is getting more interesting in exchange, the animation quality is dropping considerably compared to the first few episodesep.11: Am I suppose to laugh at these episode? It’s amusing and unbelievably funny, I was laughing from disbelief on all the revelations this episode, the way it’s executed, and the character reactions.ep.12: I say the ending redeems the series for me as it reminded me again that feelings I have from watching episode 1 and other Blood franchises, the very feelings why I watched Blood-C in the first place.I’m still gathering my thoughts on how to rate this series as it is shown to me, I like to write a proper final impression for Blood-C, it’s a wild ride, but it’s a worthy wild ride. with some interesting discussion about the definition of a person then progress to the introduction of the main character and the people around her.

I was a little disappointed with how it was made. However, I am not going to be one of those people who will say that Blood-C was ""a giant troll of an anime"" or ""half assed"". Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of what they think of the anime and should not persuade others who are going to watch it, to stay away because they think that it was terrible.The story follows a Shrine Maiden, Kisaragi Saya, as she lives a normal school life by down and hunts down...and kills these ""Old ones"", who eats humans. In every episode, there is a guarantee that she kills at least one per episode... which is kind of repetitive. In my opinion, the story really starts to pick up towards the end, at around episode 10. In the first few episodes, I was putting Blood-C off, thinking that it was boring. As I progressed further into watching it, I was addicted to it and was intrigued by the end. I hope that the movie will turn out better than the series, and that it will finish.The art is decent in this anime. Although, it was sloppy at times. There wasn\'t a whole lot of effort put into the art, as it wasn\'t that detailed. For example: a person is killed and when there is a different angle, you won\'t see that person that is killed anywhere on the screen.The sound was pretty repetitive throughout the same series. Saya would always sing different songs about her daily encounters, but with the same tune. There wasn\'t a variety of background music that was used.For characters, I would\'ve liked to know some characters a little bit better, like Tokizane Shinichirou. Many of the characters were shrouded in mystery, viewers didn\'t get to know them. The characters were just... there.Overall, this anime was pretty enjoyable. I was really captivated by it near the end. I just wished that the producers would\'ve let it end in the series instead of making it into the movie. Well, since they are getting funded by the Japanese Government, the movie better be good... considering the money spent on this movie could\'ve gone to a better cause. and kills these ""Old ones"", who eats humans.

Yup, a movie which features Newborn Porn and countless numbers of necrophilia is more fun to watch than Blood-C!Congratulations Production IG and CLAMP! You made A Serbian Film tolerable! By making the worst iteration of the Blood franchise exist, you...guys pretty much made A Serbian Film more tolerable!Seriously, this is one of the worst anime of 2011. It\'s up there with Rio! Rainbow Gate and Oniikoto as thee worst anime iof 2011. But atleast Rio! had some decent fanservice to make up for it\'s shittiness. This? NOTHING!There is nothing in this series that can make up for how bad it is. Hell, not even Nana Mizuki tries her best to improve this pile of shit. Hell, whenever she talks about cube marshmallows and sing the same fucking song in every episode, you can just hear Nana Mizuki\'s inner thoughts saying:""Seriously, i have to do 12 episodes of this shit. What the fuck am i doing here? I was expecting some xxxHolic and Geass, but i got this?!""And speaking of CLAMP, they did a really shitty job at EVERYTHING in this series. The character designs are really awful, and it doesn\'t even stack up to their other character designs. And nanase Ohkawa wasn\'t even trying to make this series better. It\'s like she just copypasta\'d the first half of episode 1 into the other 11 episodes. The writing of this series is so bad that you feel like you\'re watching a shittier remake of Endless Eight as written by Uwe Boll.And what sound? What music? There\'s nothing memorable about any of the music of this series. Nana Mizuki\'s morning song in each episode sucked, and the OP is just some shitty J-Rock filer music by some band i don\'t even give a shit about.In conclusion: IT SUCKED. It made even the worst film in history look good. it made Mars of Destruction and Dragonaut look like Citizen Kane! I dropped this shit after episode 3 because i\'d rather read all the other summaries of the other episodes on 4chan than watching this series. That shows how bad it is. Oh, and i want to cockpunch anyone who claims to like this series. If you even say that you like this series, then you\'re an asshole and you deserve to lose your genitals just like all the other male characters drawn by CLAMP.Fuck this, i need to go for a drink. guys pretty much made A Serbian Film more tolerable!Seriously, this is one of the worst anime of 2011.

The writing of this series is so bad that you feel like you\'re watching a shittier remake of Endless Eight as written by Uwe Boll.And what sound? What music? There\'s nothing memorable about any of the music of this series. Nana Mizuki\'s morning song in each episode sucked, and the OP is just some shitty J-Rock filer music by some band i don\'t even give a shit about.In conclusion: IT SUCKED. It made even the worst film in history look good. it made Mars of Destruction and Dragonaut look like Citizen Kane! I dropped this shit after episode 3 because i\'d rather read all the other summaries of the other episodes on 4chan than watching this series. That shows how bad it is. Oh, and i want to cockpunch anyone who claims to like this series. If you even say that you like this series, then you\'re an asshole and you deserve to lose your genitals just like all the other male characters drawn by CLAMP.Fuck this, i need to go for a drink.', 'Oh how the mighty have fallen, CLAMP, one of the most highly regarded group of mangaka, decide that their fame and good word of mouth was just too much. In order to forever scar their reputation, they decide to get their Blood the last vampire/Their own series they made cross over fanfiction animated, and the result?Blood C, one of the most hideous and disgusting things to have ever spawn from the inter hateful and disgusting minds of beloved manga creators, CLAMP.Hateful? I\'ll get to that in a minute, but unarguably disgusting no doubt. Where over the top meets pure carnage where even the most tortured...soul from Hostile will be again thrown into a fit of pure agony.And it\'s only insulting when all of this occurs after you have already gone through meaningless, pointless, time wasting and infuriating six to ten episodes of nothingness. All of that precious time gone, and what do you get in return? Well, you get enough unexplained plot points (Unexplained as in, the explanations are too farfetched to believe in) to reassure yourself that nothing made any sense in the end, an ending that only shown you that you HAVE to watch what comes next for the end of this garbage.And a lot of the frustration, correction, possibly all of the frustration actually comes from the cast of bland throw aways (Literally) and an idiot who fails at level of what a ""hero"" is supposed to do, or for that matter, care about what she should do.Saya, a bubbly dimwit who loves to sing about what she ate for breakfast, is a high school student of school of essentially food for whatever random monster (Random is the best way to describe it, from giant samurai to raving rabbits on steroids, there is no rhyme or reason for their designs) comes to town fiending for a midnight snack, is quite simply, uninteresting, even at night where her ""father"" sends her to fight the creatures of the night. I\'ll admit, I found myself rewatching the first episode\'s beat down for how well animated and choreographed it was, despite some ""huh?"" moments (Her neck isn\'t broken? That monster\'s arm must have been made of lead.), to only be pleasantly disappointed by the next round of monster bashing (Monster train car and a tachikoma/Audrey 2 from little shop of horrors hate-off anyone?).Hold on a sec, I lost track of who I was talking about, Saya was it? Well, if I can go on to other things while I should be explaining her character, then my single word description might be dead on, when talking about her good traits... If she had any I guess.Other characters, meh, ehhhh, bland throw aways? If only that was the absolute case, but for this reviews sake, I\'ll only say you might as well slap troll faces on the entire cast, even the puppy dog that walks around is full of bullshit and giggles (You have to see it for yourself by how much bullshit it really is).Oh, there I go again, Saya is boring blah, blah, blah... But then there\'s her bad, no, just horrible traits. For CLAMP, I can only guess they were trying to throw something new into the bag of ""pin the trait on the hero"" party amusement, a trait where she only fails until the last second, but ultimately still failed. But that itself fails on every level, you surprised? You really shouldn\'t be, because who the hell can root for a failure who, no parentheses holding a snark comment, literally watches everything around torn to bloody desert dishes for the hungry hungry monsters, and literally yells ""I WILL RESCUE YOU!"" or something similar to that. Saya is a character that simply sits around and gets trolled throughout the entire series (In fact her life is simply the product of someone fucking around with her), and fails to protect friends and loved ones, which comes to another point, a one point she protect a classmate who comes out to her by admitting his affection for her, the next episode, he dies, dies a truly pathetic death one befitting a back ground character, and Saya practicably shrugs it off, no joke.It\'s moments like those that made me wonder, characters, like named ones, are dying left and right, like how a nobody stock character would. Many could say there was something suspicious about it, but the reveal is simply a middle finger, mocking you, Saya, the fans of CLAMP and good twists in general. But I could forgive that, as long as there was something to get out of it, maybe the action scenes and battles? Okay episode one sure, but the ending spits on that possibility with nauseating gratuitous gore and blood flash floods, Itchy and Scratchy renditions of overblown proportions that disgust and impress, like an awe inspired crowd that somehow witnessed a septic tank set off like a nuclear explosion.It impressed me, that CLAMP would go this far, it\'s almost... fetishy in a way, like the anime is getting off from from the blood and guts being feverishly devoured, and the last episode enforces that, it\'s too sickening to think about it any further. I mean, where\'s the director in all this? Well, he allowed it, in all of CLAMP\'s bloody desire for violence on a disturbing level, and to the most fucked up way imaginable, especially how people are massacred endlessly in this anime (I will never look at a blender the same way ever again... Urgh, you really don\'t want to know what a blender has to do with anything in this anime). It\'ll really get you thinking, like does CLAMP really think in such horrible ways? How fucked up do you have to get to conceive the idea of making mass murders like this series lovably displays? I know of other series that me personally feel like my stomach dropped out of my body (Shigurai is pretty fucked up), but the cartoonish approach to the slaughter isn\'t just vomit inducing, it\'s insane with a capital Blerrrgh. %100 unnecessary and %100 flat out gross.In short, Blood C is ultimately a disgusting gigantic waste of time, I can only recommend to watch it to only to see just how vile it really is, and if you didn\'t see what was so disgusting about it, I\'d probably recommend seeing a psychologist immediately, chances are you might be just as fucked up as CLAMP\'s bloody horrific mind set. soul from Hostile will be again thrown into a fit of pure agony.And it\'s only insulting when all of this occurs after you have already gone through meaningless, pointless, time wasting and infuriating six to ten episodes of nothingness.

I was disappointed.Proudly wearing my blood-colored spectacles, I admittedly was, from the first episode, biased against Saya Kisaragi. Her goodie-two-shoe personality, her ""Kyou wa ii tenki"" song, the pacing of her story, her odd...schizophrenia, her friends, her family, everything about her world just didn\'t feel right. It didn\'t feel like Blood.But then, as I continued inexplicably to watch this show every week as soon as it came out, realization struck me: Blood C is not a bad show. Hell, Blood C is a good show. Indeed, Blood C doesn\'t have the dark romance of a soul-bound chevalier. It does lack the harrowing depth of an eon old epic. And it\'s lead character does not possess the heartbreaking ephemeral delicate elegance of a schoolgirl neither human nor monster. But what Blood C has it has in great volume: entertainment value.From its OP to its ED, Blood C presents a solid music score does its job of setting up the background and atmosphere. Blood C\'s art style - done in the standard Clamp fashion - has both moments of devious beauty (Saya\'s smile at the end of the opening) and moments of sheer oddity (Saya\'s hair-puff, male characters). The animation from Production IG, however, is as always excellent and both complements and compensates for Clamp\'s art style (which is usually very hit-or-miss).In terms of show content, however, the character and story develops slowly. The beginning episodes of the show, admittedly, present us with a rather bland plot and highly Clamp-cliched characters. But these characters, the story, and Saya\'s world develops and grows (albeit slowly) and, by episode 5, the tide of bloody darkness has already dyed with color the initially monochrome Saya and crew.Thus while certainly not the best show this season (for me, that title is reserved for Usagi Drops), Blood C is nevertheless a solid anime. Saya may not be the most likeable or emotionally realistic character this season, I still find myself intrigued by story.

The premise of the anime is pretty similar, girl Saya lives among humans protecting them from creatures and can't really say more of the basic premise and how it's similar without giving away spoilers.But my point was that the elements of story line are similar, but that's about it. The almost total lack of plot, plot development, character models, character development. Just about anything, it's basically just the elements of story line thrown...together into a mush with filler added. Even the dialogue and ways in which the characters express themselves is dull.By episode three I wanted to stop watching, but after reading other reviews and wanting to always give all anime's a chance, I watched tell the end and I got through it. All I can really say is that this was honestly a horrible anime, with the only memorable parts being the gore, the average art, and the strings of storyline that made an awesome anime when they where in Blood+.If you like the elements of story line present, and want to see them presented in a much better way I recommend checking out Blood+. Stay away from this train wreck unless you have time to kill and expectations to crush. together into a mush with filler added.

Stay away from this train wreck unless you have time to kill and expectations to crush."", ""Blood-C is a lot of things, but above all, it's a very painful series to watch. Is it painful to watch because of how interesting and moving the characters are? I wish I could say that but no, it's painful because I could only take five episodes of this garbage before considering whether or not to outright drop it.As a long time fan of the Blood series, I expected a lot more from this show and if I had not been a fan beforehand, I'd likely have dropped this instead of seeing it all the way through. Now don't get me wrong, there's value...in watching this show, but don't expect to actually enjoy it as much as you'll enjoy using it as an example of how 'not' to make a new addition to the Blood franchise.Honestly, at first, the show appears as if it has an interesting premise, using much of the first episode to build up for a potential climax, in which we see our slow protagonist suddenly drawing a blade and butchering some evil dohicky that's likely going to be our show's antagonist. It was built up step by step to reach the climax of the episode, where our bland and boring, yet rather cute protagonist goes through a series of sequences - That she repeats in every single freaking episode for more than five minutes with little to no changes between each one.Nearly -all- of the episodes are the damned same, and not even in a good way that makes you want to continue watching, they're just literally presented in the same manner. I'm not even talking about a Haruhi repetition, this was outright just rehashing the same plot for every episode without changing -anything-, while briefly introducing us to other boring and uninteresting characters, but hey, that's fine. It's in a modern setting, the characters aren't supposed to be especially interesting. - EXCEPT MAYBE OUR PROTAGONIST, who has about as much personality as a walking, singing doll.Moving along, the action scenes at the end of nearly every single episode are worth watching but not worth the amount of time you have to wait to actually get to them. There's nothing to feel about the monsters she's killing, they're just the generic bad guys that she's been given the duty of slaying by her weirdo father who barely ever speaks to her. The name of the series is Blood,  and they do a good job in nailing that in, OVER AND OVER with gigantic blood baths in every single episode. Now, I liked this at first. If the series has no interesting characters and no change in plot every single episode, I might as well enjoy the gore, right? Wrong! In the versions I watched at least, they began censoring all of the gore about half-way through the damned series. When the Japanese start censoring gore, something just doesn't feel right.I assume the DvD release had an uncensored version but even so, I'm not fortunate enough to be able to afford such a thing and to be honest, I'd never want anyone to spend money on this garbage.This series could have been so much better. I like Studio Clamp, I like the Blood Franchise. Clearly, this show is a good example of why you shouldn't try to mix the two together.On a more positive note, I like the art. It's nothing spectacular or out of this world. If you enjoy works by Studio Clamp, you'll definitely enjoy the styling of the characters, with those big heads and elongated limbs! No, honestly. They look cute, it's a pity they couldn't have given them personalities at the same time.It's filled with blood, blood everywhere, which is fine but at the times I wish they would have taken a more subtle approach in some of the episodes. It might be called Blood but we can see that from the title, you don't have to go all out on us in every episode. The Blood Franchise is more than just a cheesy horror story, just look at Blood+ for an example.The monsters look ridiculous, stupid and not a single one of them shares anything in common with the others. I think this would have helped the series a lot if this matter had received just a little more attention.As I said before, if you don't buy the DvD release, you're stuck with the most horrible form of censorship imaginable after the first few episodes. Massive white bars that obscure most of the screen. What kind of garbage is this, Japan? Seriously. Don't censor your animé. That's one of the most appealing things about it.I didn't think much about the sound-track on a personal note but it does fit what's happening in the series, the background music is well chosen and helps to build up the atmosphere. I didn't really think much of the opening and ending songs, they were substandard and completely boring to watch or listen to, likely because the show itself has that effect on people.I can't say I enjoyed this series and that's rare for me. It does pick up during the last few episodes, more or less the last two, where the plot changes drastically and we have a few nice twists, but I'd say they were executed much too late into the damned series. In a series like this, you can't just throw it all out at the last episode because nobodies going to want to watch it for that long. I also enjoyed a small cameo appearance of another one of my favorite Studio Clamp characters, but you'll have to figure out that one for yourself.Honestly. Just watch it if you have the time, and make a list of why it's a horrendous piece of magnificent stupidity. You'll have fun just doing that.

The second paragraph will be an update based on having seen the series in it\'s entirety.  I\'m just too lazy to actually write something brand new lol.  Anyways, On to the review...Story: 3The story has been weak for me and falls far short of expectations.  I was expecting something dark and similar to Blood+ in many ways but perhaps with a fresh twist, however, what I have seen thus far is basically...a high school slice-of-life drama with about 5 minutes at the end of every episode that give a slight nod to this series\' predecessor, Blood+.  I understand this a new series with an alternate take on the story but this pales in comparison to the previous version.  There has been little progression in the story other than through character development (the little that there has been anyways) and there hasn\'t been an explanation offered for these ""monsters"" that Saya keeps fighting despite already having seen 1/4 of the season.  The story just isn\'t entertaining and is convoluted and obscure.This hold true for about half of the season.  Then after episode 5 the series begins to become a little bit more action oriented but offers even less character development and zero plot progression as a result.  Then an entire seasons worth of plot, build-up and all, is dumped on the viewer in the final two episodes with the last being a gore-fest.  I understand what the story was aiming for and I even understand the approach that as attempted, but I felt the story was just crammed into two episodes at the end thus it rushed to me and failed on it\'s delivery.  SPOILER: Also,if this matters to you at all, even knowing there is going to be a movie next year, the series ends with information but no resolution.Art: 7As far as the art design goes it\'s not bad and on par with other anime.  The animation itself is nothing spectacular with the exception of Saya\'s fight scenes.  Though a little too dark at times, the animation instantly improves and I will say that I am happy to see fluid sword movements in some scenes without excessive repetition.  Other than that, however, it is basic.  Not bad but not great.  The character designs are ok, though I must admit I am not that much of a fan of Saya.  The hair is just ridiculous for someone who has the responsibilities that she does.  Again, the previous Saya from Blood+ was far superior in this respect again.  Also, for supposedly being a high schooler, Yuuka Amino sure has the design of someone who just stepped out of the russian mafia.  I feel like she is drawn far older than her character is intended to be.As the series finished, I pretty much retained the feelings I had after episode three.  Bad character designs and great actions scenes.  Actually the latter became even better.  Especially in the last episode when Saya fights ""Thundercat"".  You\'ll knw who this is when it happens.  And the ensuing fight scene is probably one of the best I\'ve seen in an anime in a very very long time.  The action is fast, almost ""what just happened"" fast, yet still clear.  The sword movements are swift and non-repetitive.  Overall, the action is the saving grace of this series from an artistic point and I can only hope the action style is incorporated into other anime in the future.Sound:6I am not an audiophile so for me I look for basic clarity and voices.  I can hear things clearly, so it passes my clarity test lol.  As far as the voice choices, I haven\'t adored any of them other than Misato Fukuen.  The voice actors are alright and don\'t take away from the story.This held true throughout the series.  An average score for average voice acting.Character: 3Here is the big one for me.  What. The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. Saya.  She is beyond lacking common sense.  She is beyond ditzy even.  She is a whole new level of clueless that is shocking to even have to witness.  She has ZERO awareness as to what\'s going on around her unless it has to do with that dog, Tokizane, her father, or fighting.  It\'s painful to see a main protagonist be so absentminded she doesn\'t even realize that her friends, who are but five feet away from her, talk about her to her face, and then snap into battle mode in the remaining few minutes.  Also, I think that her adoration for her father is kind of odd.  It\'s a little too much daddy\'s girl for me.  Not that the show ever hints that the relationship is odd, which I think makes it even more odd since it was probably unintended.  The other characters fall flat and seem bland.  The saving grace to this show are the twins.  They are cute and funny.This is about the most interesting part of the series since so much happens in the last two episodes to either change perceptions or reaffirm suspicions.  Saya remains beyond ditzy and clueless till the last episode and everything else would spoil surprises so I will simply say that character development is still extremely slow and uninteresting.  It\'s hard to relate to characters and care about them when their personalities are so generic and underdeveloped.  However, the last two episodes change this.  For better or for worse is up to you.  For me,it made it interesting.  Most will probably just rage.Enjoyment: 4At least the fight scenes are entertaining, despite the fact I have no clue what she is fighting or why.  Still, as stated above, this is where the animation picks up a bit.This hold true thought an explanation is given at some point.  The animation still remains the biggest plus for this series.  The fight scenes are good, even if they are a little sparse in the beginning.  I actually kind of like the ""twist"" at the end.  The deliver was a complete failure and thus this series will be rated very low on average but I like the attempt.  Again I understand the why, but it doesn\'t change the fact it failed.Overall: 4Explained above. a high school slice-of-life drama with about 5 minutes at the end of every episode that give a slight nod to this series\' predecessor, Blood+.  I understand this a new series with an alternate take on the story but this pales in comparison to the previous version.  There has been little progression in the story other than through character development (the little that there has been anyways) and there hasn\'t been an explanation offered for these ""monsters"" that Saya keeps fighting despite already having seen 1/4 of the season.  The story just isn\'t entertaining and is convoluted and obscure.This hold true for about half of the season.  Then after episode 5 the series begins to become a little bit more action oriented but offers even less character development and zero plot progression as a result.  Then an entire seasons worth of plot, build-up and all, is dumped on the viewer in the final two episodes with the last being a gore-fest.  I understand what the story was aiming for and I even understand the approach that as attempted, but I felt the story was just crammed into two episodes at the end thus it rushed to me and failed on it\'s delivery.  SPOILER: Also,if this matters to you at all, even knowing there is going to be a movie next year, the series ends with information but no resolution.Art: 7As far as the art design goes it\'s not bad and on par with other anime.  The animation itself is nothing spectacular with the exception of Saya\'s fight scenes.  Though a little too dark at times, the animation instantly improves and I will say that I am happy to see fluid sword movements in some scenes without excessive repetition.  Other than that, however, it is basic.  Not bad but not great.  The character designs are ok, though I must admit I am not that much of a fan of Saya.  The hair is just ridiculous for someone who has the responsibilities that she does.  Again, the previous Saya from Blood+ was far superior in this respect again.  Also, for supposedly being a high schooler, Yuuka Amino sure has the design of someone who just stepped out of the russian mafia.  I feel like she is drawn far older than her character is intended to be.As the series finished, I pretty much retained the feelings I had after episode three.  Bad character designs and great actions scenes.  Actually the latter became even better.  Especially in the last episode when Saya fights ""Thundercat"".  You\'ll knw who this is when it happens.  And the ensuing fight scene is probably one of the best I\'ve seen in an anime in a very very long time.  The action is fast, almost ""what just happened"" fast, yet still clear.  The sword movements are swift and non-repetitive.  Overall, the action is the saving grace of this series from an artistic point and I can only hope the action style is incorporated into other anime in the future.Sound:6I am not an audiophile so for me I look for basic clarity and voices.  I can hear things clearly, so it passes my clarity test lol.  As far as the voice choices, I haven\'t adored any of them other than Misato Fukuen.  The voice actors are alright and don\'t take away from the story.This held true throughout the series.  An average score for average voice acting.Character: 3Here is the big one for me.  What. The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. Saya.  She is beyond lacking common sense.  She is beyond ditzy even.  She is a whole new level of clueless that is shocking to even have to witness.  She has ZERO awareness as to what\'s going on around her unless it has to do with that dog, Tokizane, her father, or fighting.  It\'s painful to see a main protagonist be so absentminded she doesn\'t even realize that her friends, who are but five feet away from her, talk about her to her face, and then snap into battle mode in the remaining few minutes.  Also, I think that her adoration for her father is kind of odd.  It\'s a little too much daddy\'s girl for me.  Not that the show ever hints that the relationship is odd, which I think makes it even more odd since it was probably unintended.  The other characters fall flat and seem bland.  The saving grace to this show are the twins.  They are cute and funny.This is about the most interesting part of the series since so much happens in the last two episodes to either change perceptions or reaffirm suspicions.  Saya remains beyond ditzy and clueless till the last episode and everything else would spoil surprises so I will simply say that character development is still extremely slow and uninteresting.  It\'s hard to relate to characters and care about them when their personalities are so generic and underdeveloped.  However, the last two episodes change this.  For better or for worse is up to you.  For me,it made it interesting.  Most will probably just rage.Enjoyment: 4At least the fight scenes are entertaining, despite the fact I have no clue what she is fighting or why.  Still, as stated above, this is where the animation picks up a bit.This hold true thought an explanation is given at some point.  The animation still remains the biggest plus for this series.  The fight scenes are good, even if they are a little sparse in the beginning.  I actually kind of like the ""twist"" at the end.  The deliver was a complete failure and thus this series will be rated very low on average but I like the attempt.  Again I understand the why, but it doesn\'t change the fact it failed.Overall: 4Explained above.', 'Sexy action heroine. Check. School life setting. Check. Gratuitous violence. Check. Monster of the week format. Check.So what went wrong here?Well first of all, there is a serious lack of plot progression in the first few episodes which IMO should be the most important of the story. The first few episodes are the ""hook"" that will make the audience decide whether they will watch the next episode or drop this show. The director and the writer failed at this part. Yes they made a decent 1st episode but the succeeding ones are almost carbon copy of the 1st one with minor variations. Example: Saya...eats her breakfast, goes to school, talks with friends, a random but vague hint/foreshadowing appears and then time to kill the monster of the day. The show basically wasted 3-4 episodes before getting to the interesting part of the story.Second. The story\'s pacing. The director and the writer purposely extended a rather simple story by dragging or adding scenes that doesn\'t necessarily contribute to the plot. Blood-C\'s story(including the upcoming movie) can fit in a 12 episode format with proper direction and storytelling. There is no doubt about it.Third. Incohesive story. Blood-C is a mystery story. The plot revolves around the ""truth"" about Saya, the monsters and the town. In order for a mystery story to work the writer must occasionally drop hints at the right time that will create interest or excitement to the story and at the same time reveal a part of the plot a little bit. The show failed at creating interest by hammering the audience with repetitious vague hints/flash backs. How many times have you heard of ""the contract"" or ""the promise that Saya made""? Did it enlighten you a little bit when you heard those phrase or did it leave you clueless and confused? Only in the last few episodes have we learned about the truth. Was it satisfying? Maybe. Are there any audience left that will watch the ""explanatory"" episode? You know the answer.Overall I enjoyed the action and maybe the fanservice but the story just bored me to death. So in conclusion, Blood-C is one of those anime that could have been something unique and interesting but end up bad. eats her breakfast, goes to school, talks with friends, a random but vague hint/foreshadowing appears and then time to kill the monster of the day.

So in conclusion, Blood-C is one of those anime that could have been something unique and interesting but end up bad.', ""Being a fan of Blood+, I was completely disappointed by this spin-off series.The main character, Saya, is obscenely annoying, and pathetic. She is from a family of fighters, and destined for a dark and brutal fate, yet she STILL acts like an annoying, selfish, and naive brat.There really is no plot development until the last few episodes (how many people had to die before that happened I wonder)There is no character development. (Sorry, the annoying, pathetic naive main character NEVER gets cooler. At all. Sorry.)The only thing satisfying thing in this series, is the amount of gore made from the...monsters attacking the humans (while our main character stands there dumbfounded while they tear people apart), if you are into gore and all that. It can get pretty disturbing.Overall this series sucks. Unless you are just in the mood to watch a bunch of ordinary innocent people die in disgustingly brutal ways, you probably won't enjoy it. At all. monsters attacking the humans (while our main character stands there dumbfounded while they tear people apart), if you are into gore and all that. It can get pretty disturbing.Overall this series sucks. Unless you are just in the mood to watch a bunch of ordinary innocent people die in disgustingly brutal ways, you probably won't enjoy it. At all."", ""Blood-C is another installment to the famed Blood anime franchise. Re-envisioned by the prolific mangaka group CLAMP and animated by equally as respected studio Production I.G. Sounds like a recipe for success, right? Well, unfortunately it didn't turn out that way. Blood-C is unbearably slow, gratingly cryptic, and the epitome of mediocre writing. A real shame, because it certainly had potential to be good.First off, it's worth pointing out even though it is attached to an existing franchise, Blood-C doesn't connect to Blood: The Last Vampire or Blood+, besides the basic premise; as such it should be judged on its own merits rather than compared...to the other two works. That said, Blood-C fails all on its own.To be fair, Blood-C does have the makings of a good story. As with its predecessors, the story follows a sword-wielding girl named Saya, who hunts man-eating monsters. The big difference here is that this version of Saya is a bespectacled air-head (at least by first appearances) who lives in a small town and leads a normal life by day. Of course she is living a double-life, and by night she defends the town from the inhuman Elder Brains... or at least that what she thinks she's doing, because it becomes increasingly clearer (to the viewer) that things in Saya's quiet little town are not quite as they seem. Throughout the show Saya's life begins to unravel; the actions of those around her become increasingly suspicious to the viewer. At the same time, it is implied by an mysterious narrator that Saya is involved in some kind of twisted game. Mix this cryptic intrigue with the show's graphic violence, and you have what should have been a been an effective horror story.So, what goes wrong? Well, for one, the pacing is very bad. Yes, the show is supposed to be cryptic and mysterious, but even then it feels like it is just dragging on forever. Shows like Monster, Higurashi, Boogiepop Phantom are good examples of how deliberate pacing can keep the viewership on edge; Blood-C is not. The problem is, unlike the other examples I just gave, Blood-C has very little character or plot development until the last three episodes. This means most of its run time is spent on gristly battles (which are admittedly quite good), boring school-life scenes, and waving the mystery in the viewer's face while explaining nothing. Watching Saya have strange visions and collapse is captivating the first time around, but after the same thing happens four or more episodes in a row without even an inkling as to what any of this even means, it loses its edge. The story takes so long to reveal anything that by the time it does (in long tiresome exposition) the viewer simply doesn't care more.The problems with pacing could have been remedied by a good cast of characters, unfortunately, Blood-C has a distinct lack of that as well. In fact, the characters are likely the worse things about this show. Saya isn't a particularly interesting lead despite the mystery that surrounds her, because she lacks personality; really, she just doesn't stand out as far as female leads. Cafe manager Fumito, and to a lesser degree Saya's teacher Ms. Tsutsutori, are the closest any character gets to being genuinely interesting because they seem to be the ones who know the most through a majority of the show. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional dead ends, each defined by a single character trait (that's right, not even a set of character traits) such as the class rep having a crush on Saya, or Tokizane being a brooding loner; this is the laziest characterization imaginable. These characters are so weak that once the initial shock of seeing central characters getting killed off subsides, their deaths have little to no impact at all. Of course, the plot twist in episode 11 might inadvertently explain why the characterizations were so weak to that point, though this is probably more of an excuse than valid justification. However, even then the characters come off as one-dimensional with the shallowest of motivations.There is one thing that is high quality in Blood-C, its technical merits. CLAMP is well known for their unique visual style and Production I.G. for the high production value of its shows; Blood-C clearly benefits from the marriage of these two juggernauts of the anime world. Character designs are eye candy; Saya and her friends, heck all the characters in fact, are more attractive than most can ever hope to be. The monstrous Elder Brains are bizarrely eye-catching as well, each wonderfully imaginative in their distinctive (and often gruesome) appearances. Supporting the character designs is fluid animation courtesy of Production I.G., along with strong backgrounds, and very graphic violence and gore (as I can assume by the heavy censorship). The music is quality stuff; perfect for embodying the mysticism, mystery, and menace that envelops the show. Really, it is a shame the writing is not on par with the visuals and music; the show would have been good if it was.Blood-C really feels like potential wasted. It has what could have been the making of a great show; not to mention quality art and music. However, the sluggish pacing and the dirt poor characters ruin any chance the show had of being good. I can only hope that the movie sequel will fair better; at the very least Blood-C might be a marketing success... because regardless of how you feel about the show as a whole, the final episode will probably leave you wanting to watch the movie. to the other two works.

There\'s no real developpement until the last episodes and that\'s why it\'s hard to appreciate. I think I liked it more because I watched it all in one go, it\'s a lot less painful that way. My other advice would be to watch the unscencored DVD and BD version because the gore is one of the most extreme in recent anime.Story 6/10 (8/10 with the ending)The story is almost non-existent until the last episodes, it\'s mostly atmosphere and events without clear context.

Count me hooked for Blood-C: The Last Dark.', ""This anime is only just 2 episodes away from its finale, so my ratings are as follows:Story- Fair 6According to other MAL users who made the same review as I was doing, this 12 episode anime is part of CLAMP’s “Blood +” franchise, Oh by the way, I have not watched any anime nor have I read any manga related to ‘Blood +”, except this one (manga not included). So, the story just follows the usual arc were a hero is out to hunt down monsters terrorizing the community, but in this case it is a heroine by the name of Saya Kisaragi a miko...at Ukishima shrine located on a small picturesque prefecture somewhere in Japan, who, every night would go out to hunt down the Elder Bairns or Furukimonos who are terrorizing the neighborhood (at first). However the story has a strong mystery genre like: why are the Elder Bairns out to either feast or kill people living around the village, who is Saya’s really is and what and to whom did she made a promise to, and who is the main villain in this anime. These are the questions which makes this anime to have a “Fair” rating.Art- Mediocre 5.The art together with the characters has some resemblance with Code Geass franchise and 07-Ghost, you know, where everyone looks tall and skinny, btw, I really hate Saya’s pigtails.Sound- Mediocre 5.I just have nothing to say in this part, except that I like the opening theme.Character- Good 7.The characters roles in this anime were simply mend to  either be meat in the grinder or part of the mystery as having something to do with the Elder Bairns or Furukimonos, so who are they, I’m dividing them in 3 categories:Heroine:Saya Kisaragi –  behind her sweetness and clumsiness is a student by day and a hunter by night, she uses her mother’s sacred blade to fight off the Furukimono’s who are out  preying on humans, she under the guidance of her father Tadayoshi who happens to be the shrine priest. As the anime goes, she get even more busy dealing with the Furukimono’s who started to go out even in broad daylight and on a rampage so much so that her friends and classmates become live prey for them Furukimonos. She is a mystery as to who she really is, and why does she have the ability to heal quickly after a battle with a Furukimono aside from having the capacity to fight. She is fond of the talking dog whom she encounters every now and then, though she consults with the dog, she has no clue as to what it is talking about, because the dog itself talks in a cryptic manner. She’s friend with Nene, Nono, Yuka, Itsuki and Shin’ichirō, she’s a regular at Guimauve café where the owner is her father’s junior way back from their high school days.Meats in the grinder or Saya’s friendsNene and Nono Moete – twins who talk at the same time, cheerful, witty and they’re dead in episode 6, one becomes a Furukimono’s appetizer, while the other becomes another Furukimono’s lunch. They reappeared in episode 10, but it is yet to know if they’re spirits,Furukimonos or illusions made by Saya’s homeroom teacher Kanako Tsutsutori.Yuka Amino- a tall athletic beauty, part of Saya’s friends, died protecting her other classmates from being part of a Furukimono’s menu in episode 9. She wasn’t eaten, but she was skewed to death.Itsuki Tomofusa- also Saya’s friend who the class rep in Saya’s class and he’s the only one who got away from being part the Furukimono’s diet in episode 9.Shin'ichirō Tokizane- he’s Saya’s supposed lover, but in episode 10 he becomes another  Furukimono’s dinner instead , at first I suspect that he has something to do with the death of his classmates from his class in episode 9.Suspects:Tadayoshi Kisaragi – though he’s Saya’s daddy and sword trainer, he does little to help his daughter to fend off the Furukimonos and when his daughter feels sad after witnessing the deaths of her classmates he does little seem to comfort her and if he does he seems to pretend to sympathized with her, in fact he hides a lot of secrets from her. In MAL’s forum one commentator (It didn’t came from me) suggested that Saya’s father may not be whom Saya thinks he is and may in even be the  main antagonist himself.Fumito Nanahara – owner of Guimauve café where Saya and her father are regulars since they’re both at bad at cooking, his closeness and shows of affections to Saya is very suspicious that one can’t help but to think that he could either be the main or the her secondary antagonist of this anime, In MAL’s forum there is another commentator (that too didn’t came from me) who suggested that the Guimauve marshmallow that he’s giving to Saya contains blood from the Furukimono which she had killed and even suggested that both him and the latter’s father are accomplices.Kanako Tsutsutori – Saya’s homeroom teacher, what makes her also suspicious is her sense of timing co’z she seem to be in the right place in the right time,  in one episode she was in school when Saya arrive alone to find out that classes are suspended  and started to also question  about the promise to someone whom she (Saya) has no idea of and in episode 9 she arrived and met with Saya a few minutes after the latter had killed the Furukimono who massacre her class, she doesn’t show any signs of shock which one would normally experience when they either saw or heard something appalling in fact she even acted as if nothing happen as if the student killed are just some livestock's whom are ready for the slaughter. What plans does she have for Saya after showing her something which would change her life; we have yet to know in the up coming episode 11.Itsuki Tomofusa – ok, maybe he is or maybe he’s not an Elder Bairns, but, he having escape from being part of a Furukimono’s diet is suspicious enough.Dog- what about him? We still have yet to know.  All was known is that this talking magical dog was part of another anime “xxxHolic.” Or at least, according to some MAL user from the forum, besides I haven’t seen that anime yet. He is the only one were Saya can find comfort, but he may or may not have anything to do as to what is happening in the town where a lot of bad things are happening.Enjoyment and overall good 7.Ok, so this anime’s genres are the following: Action, horror, mystery, drama, vampire, slice of life and supernatural. Here’s the thing of all the mentioned genres only action, horror, and supernatural were the most prominent in this anime, the rest are just trivial, as for the vampire genre, I don’t think that Furukimono’s eating humans whole would qualify as one. But you know the real stars of this anime is the raw violence that comes with the horror genre and the mystery that surrounds the characters that arouses one’s curiosity  as to find out more about the strange things that happens in a small town where our heroine lives, overall it is something to be enjoyed with curiosity . at Ukishima shrine located on a small picturesque prefecture somewhere in Japan, who, every night would go out to hunt down the Elder Bairns or Furukimonos who are terrorizing the neighborhood (at first). However the story has a strong mystery genre like: why are the Elder Bairns out to either feast or kill people living around the village, who is Saya’s really is and what and to whom did she made a promise to, and who is the main villain in this anime.

In MAL’s forum one commentator (It didn’t came from me) suggested that Saya’s father may not be whom Saya thinks he is and may in even be the  main antagonist himself.Fumito Nanahara – owner of Guimauve café where Saya and her father are regulars since they’re both at bad at cooking, his closeness and shows of affections to Saya is very suspicious that one can’t help but to think that he could either be the main or the her secondary antagonist of this anime, In MAL’s forum there is another commentator (that too didn’t came from me) who suggested that the Guimauve marshmallow that he’s giving to Saya contains blood from the Furukimono which she had killed and even suggested that both him and the latter’s father are accomplices.Kanako Tsutsutori – Saya’s homeroom teacher, what makes her also suspicious is her sense of timing co’z she seem to be in the right place in the right time,  in one episode she was in school when Saya arrive alone to find out that classes are suspended  and started to also question  about the promise to someone whom she (Saya) has no idea of and in episode 9 she arrived and met with Saya a few minutes after the latter had killed the Furukimono who massacre her class, she doesn’t show any signs of shock which one would normally experience when they either saw or heard something appalling in fact she even acted as if nothing happen as if the student killed are just some livestock's whom are ready for the slaughter. What plans does she have for Saya after showing her something which would change her life; we have yet to know in the up coming episode 11.Itsuki Tomofusa – ok, maybe he is or maybe he’s not an Elder Bairns, but, he having escape from being part of a Furukimono’s diet is suspicious enough.Dog- what about him? We still have yet to know.  All was known is that this talking magical dog was part of another anime “xxxHolic.” Or at least, according to some MAL user from the forum, besides I haven’t seen that anime yet. He is the only one were Saya can find comfort, but he may or may not have anything to do as to what is happening in the town where a lot of bad things are happening.Enjoyment and overall good 7.Ok, so this anime’s genres are the following: Action, horror, mystery, drama, vampire, slice of life and supernatural. Here’s the thing of all the mentioned genres only action, horror, and supernatural were the most prominent in this anime, the rest are just trivial, as for the vampire genre, I don’t think that Furukimono’s eating humans whole would qualify as one. But you know the real stars of this anime is the raw violence that comes with the horror genre and the mystery that surrounds the characters that arouses one’s curiosity  as to find out more about the strange things that happens in a small town where our heroine lives, overall it is something to be enjoyed with curiosity ."", 'Ok, so my opinion of blood-C is that it is an amazing anime. Right now I\'m noticing alot of bad reviews and ratings but I feel that it\'s only because the series is only on it\'s 4th episode. The anime hasn\'t had the chance to really speed up into that super crazy awesomeness most anime\'s hit. But I\'ve actually been enjoying it very much. Maybe it\'s due to the fact that I\'ve only seen some of blood+, but hey doesn\'t that just been i\'m not biased into saying blood-C sucks because blood+ is sooooo much better. Come on, you\'ve got to have an open mind...and take blood-C in completely! So far in blood-C we know that Saya Kisaragi is a seemingly nice and kind girl by day, freaking awesome monster killer by night.How is that not awesome? I mean the girl sings walking to school in the morning, picks up garbage, eats at the cafe near her house, tries to help stray animals and is nice to everybody. Yet come night time, she kills these horrible crazy monsters risking her life for her town under her fathers orders and hurt or not always returns covered in a whole lot of blood and ready to go to school and repeat that whole process of the day. THIS IS SO COOL!!!Now I know the main character has yet to prove her total awesomeness, but I feel that her purity is starting to crack. Normally she\'s able to kill these monsters and able to return to the normal nice girl during the day like nothing happened. BUT. Now that these monsters known as ""the old ones"" have been spouting nonsense about ""the covenant"" Saya seems to becoming more physically and emotionally strained. Not to mention confused about whatever this covenant is. As well I noticed how she\'s getting more hurt every time she fights these monsters. I bet you anything that within the next few episodes Saya\'s true character is going to take off and pull this anime -not with her- but ahead of her! Hey maybe we\'ll learn more about that beautiful and mysterious guy in her class? Hmm? I HOPE SO!!Therefore I gave the story an 8, because I like the mysterious and slow feel to it so far, and I just know that this is only the calm before the storm. The story is truley going to pick up very soon, and hey this is only the beginning. Didn\'t blood+ have like 50 episodes or something?For art i gave it a 10, because I feel that the art is beautiful. Saya\'s character is so unique and beautiful, as well many characters in this anime are. My fav other than Saya is the mysterious guy from her class Shinichirou Tokizane, he\'s just so cool looking. The scenery in this anime like the shrine, the cafe, the town and her fights. I love her fight scenes they\'re so well drawn out.Sound I gave it a 7, because it just doesn\'t seem all that significant to me.Character I gave it a 10 because of how much I love Saya, I can\'t wait to see what happens to her in the next episode! I mean come on! She fights monsters EVERY night! As well I love the humour of the other characters and the mysteriousness of some of them.Enjoyment I gave it a 10 because i  really like this anime. The action scenes are killer and no matter what I can\'t help smiling at Saya\'s cute and Corky character.Overall I gave it a 9. Just wait, when this anime really kicks off everyone will feel the same as me =) and take blood-C in completely!

I wanted to watch it because I heard good things about the series and its storyline, but had problems getting past the first episode. So, when I heard about Blood-C, I found myself excited because I was hoping the storyline would be a remake that was simply dulled down a bit violence wise. However, my excitement diminished greatly once I got into the series.My personal opinion is, Blood-C felt way to much like an amature fanfic. The specific kind I...am thinking of, is where the fanfic writer takes the original material and decides to create an amazing AU (alternate universe). However, when you start reading this fanfic, you can't recognize the characters or world at all, because it is in truth not fanfiction, but original work disguised as fanfiction.This type of fanfic is actually frowned upon in the fanfiction community. This is even true when the writing is considered good, because the readers are seriously left wondering why original work wasn't created in the first place. Of course, there are some people who gush praise over the work because it comes across as original and refreshing, but they forget that the work is supposed to be derivative, not stand alone.This is exactly what has happened with this Anime. I honestly feel that CLAMP should have simply created their own vampire novel, rather then placing Saya's name on some random character. That, and the fact that the military is involved is the only thing that really stays the same. But that honestly isn't the only problem I have with the plot of the Anime.One of the things that has bothered me about CLAMPS work, is the fact that much of there work has some sort of tie in with something else they have done. Blood-C is not spared from this, as the character Kimihiro from xxxHolic makes an appearance. Thankfully, the crossover actually works and proves to be important to the storyline.However, because I am not sure if I want CLAMP touching other Anime again, unless they are upfront that they are doing a crossover. Which is another element that makes Blood-C feel like a badly written fanfic, truth be told. Some fanfic crossovers manage to only do one fandom justice and it feels like it was xxxHolic here... and that wasn't supposed to be the fandom they were focusing on.Speaking of xxxHolic, Blood-C is also done in the same style. I remember some people wondering about this when the series first started. There was a few variations, almost like CLAMP tried to meld the two styles, but it honestly didn't work that well. Some shots felt wrong in the animation, like in the beginning few episodes, Saya seemed way to long in limb.On top of this, there was censorship of the blood and gore scenes. I might have been fine with this, if it hadn't been for the fact that flashes of light to cut down on the violence is hands down considered poor technique when you are choosing to cut back. There are other ways to do this, ways that would come across better.Other artistic aspect lay in the music. To be honest, I liked the opening theme very much, but the truth is, it didn't match up with the rest of the series. For example, we had Saya's horrible singing to contend with. Well, it wasn't that bad, but the soundtrack to the actual Anime didn't seem to match up with the quality of the opening, which did not help in this series being a major let down.Also was a major let down were the actual characters. There was no major character development until the last two episodes. The characters were one dimensional and not really ones that you could become attached too. Some people will argue that the turn of the events in the last two episodes should explain all of this, but I honestly think that they could have cut a lot of filler and had a much longer storyline.To be honest, I did enjoy watching the Anime. This is another one though, that I didn't enjoy it for the reasons the creators wanted me too, unless they really were trying to make the worst remake ever in Anime History. I kept shaking my head, wondering how CLAMP could have been serious at this, or how this wasn't a true remake. Reminds me of the Mario Brothers live action movie kind of, now that I think of it.Anyways, I am highly disappointed. am thinking of, is where the fanfic writer takes the original material and decides to create an amazing AU (alternate universe).

Don\'t you dare talk about this series if you didn\'t see until the last episode. It\'s not just about plot twists or anything, you simple don\'t know anything if you didn\'t saw. Story with no progress? Dense characters? I really want to spoil a ton of things to those who said those craps about this serie but i wont.Ok it\'s my first review and i\'m not fluent in english but i\'ll try to do a decent work here because I just can\'t stand people talking anything they want about this anime when they dropped after two episodes.Story: 10/10The problem here is...that I can\'t tell anything about the true story without spoil a lot of important things. I admit, i thought it was going to be about nothing more than a girl with a sword and tons of blood, and if you didn\'t see at least to ep. 10 you\'ll think that too. In the first episode you\'ll see Saya doing her routine, going to school, and in the last third of the ep she receive a sword from her father and is send to fight a monster. It\'s no just any fight, like you see in any shounen with background changes, a lot of useless conversation and lot of explosions and effects. No, it\'s like a real fight (if you don\'t mind the monster), you got fluid moviments, incredible sword techniques, i just can\'t explain, youtube it if you want to know.Art: 10/10It\'s beautifull, simple beautifull, backgrounds, characters, fights, everything. Too bad there is no lolis, but we can get over it because everything is so well done.Sound: 8/10Well, i don\'t really pay too much atention to sound, if the op or ed are too bad i\'ll just skip it. Nothing to talk about here.Character: 7/10Here is a problem. I know, the characters are just dense, stereotyped and don\'t show any progress. But again, if you say that you simple didn\'t see everything to the end. I can\'t say too much, in fact, I can\'t say anything, because you simple don\'t know anything until the end. But believe me, if you watch until the last episode, you\'ll understand that those dense and stereotyped characters fit their roles in the story and I can tell you that every single one of the characters is important, even those strange twins.Enjoyment: 10/10You may think it\'s painfull to watch an anime that just start to clear things after the tenth ep. But know what, i didn\'t even noticed it was already at the end when they started to reveal things. Each episode was so good that i still don\'t believe they all have 24 min, seriously, i don\'t remember how many times i\'ve gone ""Eh? End? Already? Seriously?"". And hell, I could watch a full 200 ep of Saya fighting Elder Brains without getting tired. That\'s how increadible the whole thing seems to me.Overall: 10/10If you just watched two~three eps and are going to drop this anime, fine, you really, seriosly don\'t even start to having a clue of what you\'re losing. I know, if you just value plot over incredible fight scenes, waiting until the very end to know anything is just painfull. But believe me, it\'s worth enduring it (watch a girl covered in blood with a sword fighting giant monsters, painfull, really). Well, just try it. But please, if you didn\'t watch the whole thing, stop talking nosense, you just don\'t know anything abou the plot, seriously, absolutelly nothing. that I can\'t tell anything about the true story without spoil a lot of important things.

It took me more than a couple times to get into this anime. As a spin-off of Blood + I did come into this series with high expectations. My first impression was that it was...interesting. I kept watching because I wanted to see how CLAMP would try to pull it off. I gave it a second chance because I liked the art style, but my opinion on that was quickly changed. What I will say is, don't come into this anime expecting it to be anything like Blood +. The only real connection I can find is that both protagonist's...names are Saya.Characters 3/10The heroine of Blood + is likable, and powerful, while the heroine of Blood-C is weak and definitely does not keep her promises. As awful as the main character was, the other characters did not do any justice whatsoever. I am only giving the characters' portion a three out of ten because, surprisingly, there was one decent character whom I enjoyed throughout the series. Only one.Story 2/10I didn't see an actual explanation of what was going on until about episode three. So until that episode three, I was watching this girl kill these random statue monsters without knowing what they were or even why they were there. I never thought I would actually have to guess what was going on. And all of these things she was doing was probably not legal, or logical. I honestly don't find a huge man-eating bunny to be very relevant, because first of all, bunnies are cute and secondly, I half expected what Saya was to be killing to be vampires or at least something mildly scary. The worst part about it, is that when I did finally figure out what was going on, I was still confused. That being said, the way they explained things in this show was utterly disconcerting and caused confusion.Art 2/10I have to admit, I actually really liked the art when I saw it the first time. I thought that Saya looked super adorable with her glasses and long black hair. And then, I saw their bodies. I'm sorry, but I'm not too fond of lanky, disproportionate, stick bodies. Enough said.Overall, I would have to rate this show a 2/10 at best.

First of all, if you have a weak stomach, don't watch this anime.---STORY--- 3A story about a schoolgirl fighting monsters. Yep. That's the entire plot. Nearly every episode it is the same thing; a boring day on school, and then at night a gory fight with a monster. There is almost no progress in the story, and until the last episodes nothing is revealed about the mysterious monsters she is fighting. In the end the writer tries to catch your attention again with A HUGE TWIST, but he or...she fails, as it was an expected and quite stupid twist.---ART--- 7Decent art.

The opening is a weird mix of French, Engrish and Japanese, but it is okay.---CHARACTER--- 2Everybody but the main character has no story. I'm serious. They are boring people without any personality. They are like decorations, just being there without purpose. Well, they have a purpose... to die horribly. So the main character does have a story, which is extremely lame and vague. She is your typical clumsy and cute girl that turns into a monster hunter at night. Apparently her goal is to save everyone, but she fails horribly. When people are about to get killed by monsters, she just waits politely until he finishes.  She seems to get heavily injured after every battle, but somehow is the next day completely healed. In other words, these 'characters' are just horrible.---ENJOYMENT--- 3Unless you really like seeing people's organs, I don't think you can really 'enjoy' this anime. The battles are sometimes interesting, but not interesting enough to cover the horrible story line and characters. After a few episodes you probably will be bored already, as there is almost no progress.---OVERALL--- 4Unless you really like gore, you will not enjoy nor like this anime.

And without knowing its predecessors Blood+ & The Last Vampire all I knew of this movie was its mediocre reviews.First Impression: Great Visual Art Style, Good Character-design and overall Artwork. Movements are also really good (dodging in the water or pulling the katana from its sheath). Standing out as well was the wonderful music with a violin-main-theme and some roaring action-themes.The story begins really calm and takes it time to build up the characters in school, at the cafe or at the shrine in her home with her father. The...characters seem realistic and likeable (The twins got on my neves in the end though). Therefore it takes a while, until the real Story picks up speed.But not only the story takes its time, but also the gore, I am no fan of. I even dropped Elfen Lied for the exact same reason and Blood C did well in showing the gore only after some episodes, so I didn\'t wanted to stop anymore. Most parts it is in a reasonable frame showing the evil demons, but in the end it was a bit too over the top and unnecessary.The fights themselves look really great in terms of animation and choreo, even though you never see anyone else than Saya fighting making it a little bit repetitive.Having some unexpected story twists and some likeable characters, I found the anime to be really good in the end and I\'m looking forward to finish the series with the movie ""The Last Dark"".It is definitely no masterpiece, but most of the flame and low scores are not fair and therefore I give this anime a 8/10 for increasing the average score, while you as a patient reader can look at it as a 7. characters seem realistic and likeable (The twins got on my neves in the end though).

Most parts it is in a reasonable frame showing the evil demons, but in the end it was a bit too over the top and unnecessary.The fights themselves look really great in terms of animation and choreo, even though you never see anyone else than Saya fighting making it a little bit repetitive.Having some unexpected story twists and some likeable characters, I found the anime to be really good in the end and I\'m looking forward to finish the series with the movie ""The Last Dark"".It is definitely no masterpiece, but most of the flame and low scores are not fair and therefore I give this anime a 8/10 for increasing the average score, while you as a patient reader can look at it as a 7.', 'I almost want to rate this higher than a 6 because there is some great Stuff in this Anime when it\'s not being boring as all hell. It\'s got some issues.Lets start from the beginning, The first 4-5 episodes are mostly extremely, and I mean Painfully dull.  Do you want to follow a schoolgirls mundane life at school as she walks to school singing awful songs and having boring mundane conversations with her friends at school for 15 minutes each episode? Because that\'s what you are going to get and its painful to watch.Now the other 5 or so minutes an episode is...all about some really cool action scenes where Shes fighting some cool looking monsters with a very nice art style and solid animation. I really got into that and my deminer would change to ""Wow this picking up now"". Only to go to the next episode and have to listen to her mundane conversation with her friends till the next fight scene.There is no plot reveal at all till the last 2 episodes with some hints as to what\'s going on by episode 6. By the end you understand why they couldn\'t reveal what was going on but come on did you really have load us up with pointless filler for the first 4-5 Episodes???After Episode 6 it does start to pick up but if you\'re looking for a good story you wont get it here. while as I said the last 2 episodes it does make sense and it isn\'t that bad and throughout the Anime it has some great action and fantastic fight scenes and are bloody and violent as hell. The gore detail is insane and you will see some horrendous stuff in great detail.Characters aren\'t really anything special. Most of them are pretty bland and dull even the main character till the later episodes, She does start getting a bit more interesting and as well as some of the other characters towards the end.The Voice acting is pretty solid, the Art style is actually very good as well as the animation being very solid. The Music is nothing special and I cringed when ever Saya started to sing.Whoever oversaw the action in this anime did a bang-up job and is the highlight of this anime and for those of you who like great action is what you will enjoy out of it barring you can get past the mundane crap at the start.I recommend this anime if you are looking for some really cool action.You will just have to suffer through some crap to get to it all about some really cool action scenes where Shes fighting some cool looking monsters with a very nice art style and solid animation. I really got into that and my deminer would change to ""Wow this picking up now"".

Is she just going to chop up monsters for 13, 26 episodes? Hopefully not because then it would be a huge disappointment. So far we have seen two episodes of pretty much the same thing Saya wakes up, eats at that cafe, sings, goes to school, has some kind of interaction with some character, goes home and at night goes out ""hunting"" for monsters. I wouldn\'t have mind if it were just the 1st episode, but the same thing for the 2nd? Come on Clamp. They try...(I guess) to make it interesting with questions regarding certain objects like for example a sweet that Saya eats at the Cafe supposedly is suppose to feel like something and then later Saya finds out that it feels like a kiss according to the twins, which kind of left me like, ""what that\'s it?"" It was a waste of time in my opinion.Art wise it isn\'t bad, but you might not like it if you don\'t like the Clamp style of art with the long limbs and thin look on characters. Action wise it is done well with good fluidity and motion, but some of the scenes were too dark to see clearly what the heck was going on. Personally I like the art, but wish they\'d fix up the issue with those ""too"" dark scenes.Sound wise I really like the opening song. Catchy. Voice acting isn\'t bad, but we aren\'t really introduced to a very complicated or great script here. Some of the time there is lots of silence, which can lead to boredom. The fighting sounds are pretty good though.Characters, so far are pretty weak. We do not know much about them at all. You would think by this time at least there would be some more info on Saya and her father, but we don\'t have any of that. It appears that the next episode will explain this to us, but with the way things are going I\'m not getting my hopes up.Enjoyment/Overall, first episode was enjoyable, but with the repetitive nature of the 2nd episode, I got kind of bored of it. Repetitiveness and no story line is what made me drop ""Blade"" in the first place, I seriously hope they move the story along because I\'ll probably drop this if they don\'t. So far I have to give it a 6. It\'s pretty mediocre, but the art and a few songs save it from being a lot worse.EDIT:Well I watched the 3rd episode and it was for the most part the same thing as the previous two, just with a little bit more twist, which imho isn\'t enough to really merit a higher score. I gotta say I\'m quite disappointed. They spend half of the episode with pointless blabber and about the only thing interesting are the fights mainly due to the unique enemies Saya faces.I think from now on I\'ll just watch the 2nd halves of the show, since the rest imho is pure crap.EDIT:I watched the 4th episode today and well, it was pretty much the same thing again, but we got a little bit more info on who exactly Saya is fighting. Even so, the information is pretty vague and simplistic. The pace of the story is horribly slow.EDIT:Finally we get to some better action. So we find out more about the covenant. Basically it appears to be some sort of agreement between humans and the monsters, exactly what? We still don\'t know, but the way this episode 5 was structured it really kept you watching. I don\'t know how the heck they didn\'t do this for the past 4 episodes, it would have made a big difference even with the slow plot. The music has really grown on me. I love the opening and ending songs and the eerie song that is transposed into different was throughout the anime is done very well, still the story is really slow, like snail slow. You have to have a lot of patience.After watching the latest episode it seems that the monsters have pretty much found out who Saya is and have even targeted her friends. It looks like the story is reaching it\'s middle part. It became a lot more interesting since the last one. Now we see better sequences in the story, still lacking, but better nonetheless.Final edit: Well after finishing this I gotta say it really comes together at the end, but at the cost of keeping the audience excited for more than half the series. For the first few episodes you are given the run around with Saya doing the same thing (probably a result of the plot) which can cause people to lose their patience and drop this one. As the story progressed near the end you are given hints of what is going and eventually it is all revealed in the last episode. Also the the final episodes are extremely gory so caution for those that don\'t like to see that (I don\'t mind). Only downside of the end? You are given a cliffhanger. Whether you like it or not is up to you. I think if it\'s well done, it\'s ok. I give it a 7 overall.

', ""As a fan of Blood+, Blood C anime would be definitely a good news. When I saw the first episode of the series, I thought that the battle scene is somewhat like from the Blood+ and that's all I can see. To start of:STORY - 7There is this typical high school girl named Saya and she always go to school every morning, but every night, Saya was tasked by her father to slay off furukimono-tachi (Elder Bairns). From episode 1 - 12, you can always see that and nothing more. I'm a bit disappointed with the anime because I really hoped for a unique...plot that's coming from the Blood series and all we get is those battle scenes (though at some point I can't deny that they're still good when the series is in its middle airing).ART - 8In one glance, anyone can tell. With those skinny and tall characters, those eyes are like of a doll and sweet and bishie faces that is similar to xxxHolic, Tsubasa Chronicles, CLAMP would be the first thing that came into my mind. The art, although not similar with Blood+, suits Blood C in a unique way and it fits with a bloody/thrilling anime.MUSIC/SOUND - 7OP and ED of this series is nice and you can feel the aura that it's all about monster slaying demon's type.CHARACTERS - 7A girl who fights demons is not that common. Saya's character is a cheerful type in morning and a serious type at night. Indeed, it is like a shounen character. Her friends characterization is good though these things are very common in this type of anime.OVERALL - 7To sum things up, the story is somewhat boring within the first, but still I continued to watch it and some episodes were good and exciting. The main characters reminded me of a mixed up in some of CLAMP series and also, the most related anime, Blood+. The art is good and this is also one of the reasons why I continued and finish to watch Blood C. The OP/ED is good, others are okay. If you're a fan of a dark/gory/thrilling anime, this should fit your taste. plot that's coming from the Blood series and all we get is those battle scenes (though at some point I can't deny that they're still good when the series is in its middle airing).ART - 8In one glance, anyone can tell.

I\'ve heard of this for two reasons. The first is that it\'s related to Blood+ which I may review at some point but haven\'t gotten around to it yet. The second is that a lot of the Blood+ fans hate it. Now, I\'ve seen Blood+ and to give my thoughts about it in brief, it\'s okay. I thought that it did some things pretty well and others kind of poorly. Am I going to be ticked off if Blood C doesn\'t follow it? No, no I\'m not....Frankly I don\'t care what they do with the franchise as long as it tells a good story. The one thing I\'m really hoping for is a less whiny Saya because the Blood+ version got on my nerves a bit. So let\'s take a look at Blood C and see if we get an interesting story and, possibly, a better Saya.Now that I\'ve seen it, I just have to start by saying that I\'m not going to be bringing up Blood+ for comparison purposes except for maybe when I talk about the character of Saya. The two anime are completely different so there\'s really not much to be gained by the comparison. Now, a lot of the big plot details are spoilers so I won\'t explicate on it too much. The basic setup is that Kisaragi Saya is a shrine maiden who lives in a small town with her father and fights monsters at night. But there\'s a secret that she only has vague inklings of. That\'s as far as I can go without giving spoilers. I will say that the horror label in this is code for ""it has monsters"" since the anime isn\'t scary in the least. There are things that the anime does well. The mystery surrounding everything is interesting and, once you learn the truth, the concept behind it is interesting. However, the execution is flawed in that the hints are pretty minimal and the reveal comes at the end when it\'s too late to do much with it. Another basic problem is that Blood-C lacks impact. A lot of the events that occur should be tragic but they aren\'t because there\'s not much reflection on them and a lot of them are rushed through.The characters are a bit lackluster. The only really interesting characters are Saya and, arguably, the antagonist. The rest of the characters do and say very little aside from some exposition. I will say that I did like Blood-C\'s Saya better than the Blood+ version since she\'s more determined and a lot less angsty.You can tell that Clamp was involved with this from the art. The characters have limbs that are too long for their bodies and tiny waists that shouldn\'t be able to hold all of their organs. I will say that it looks better than the art in Xxxholic. It\'s actually pretty decent if you can get past the proportions. The action sequences are really well done, even if the amount of blood that ignores the laws of physics to gush out of wounds is ridiculous. The monsters are pretty hit and miss. Some of them do look pretty interesting, but others just look silly.The voice acting is actually really well done. They had a great cast including Mizuki Nana (who is always excellent), Asano Masumi and Fujiwara Kenji. The music is good sometimes but others it\'s pretty underwhelming.The yuri factor is a 4/10. There are some scenes involving Saya and her teacher or some of her female classmates that are pretty homo-erotic. They don\'t go anywhere though.My final rating for Blood-C is a 6/10. Like Blood+ it\'s okay. There are some things it does well and others where it falls short. Saya is a good character and there are some interesting ideas but the execution falls short and it really ends up being more of an action anime than anything else. If you\'re expecting it to be like Blood+, don\'t. But give it a try if you enjoy bloody battle sequences or if you\'re curious about the mystery.

However, the show itself hints something which is related to Blood series and this is the thing that those people forgot about.I have to admit that I watched this show because Mizuki Nana with no knowledge about Blood series and it was so wrong idea. If anyone decides to watch it, I recommend you watch Blood+ or Blood: the last vampire first because the storyline will easily mesmerize audiences with expectation. If you're too lazy to watch the previous Blood series like me, I think it's still o.k. as well...because you'll get more excitement and imagination. because you'll get more excitement and imagination."", 'I have a certain hate against wasted potential and tend to be harsher toward those series.  Yet, I find myself sometime to highly contradict my way of reviewing with some shows that should deserve plain hate for legitimate reasons, but end up by being one hell of a show for me.  It’s true; Blood-C should have all the merit of being a bad show, and a very bad one I must say. The protagonist is an oblivious dumb girl, the story doesn’t go anywhere and the violence is plainly gratuitous. Certainly, nothing of quality should be left after that.  However, it’s actually...for these very same reasons why I absolutely adore Blood-C, placing it in my top shows of 2011.There is lack of caring and drama in Blood-C that makes it pure entertainment.For one thing, Blood-C is very dry with its story telling. The first episode consists of Saya in her everyday life where she would go to school, meet with her friends and sing a joyful song, until she goes back home and beat the crap out of a monster.  As Saya isn’t questioning her role, nor does she mix her secret life with school, the story really lacks at explaining what is really happening with the monsters, or the nature of their existence. In contradiction, the force of show actually resides in the fights between Saya and the enemies. Surely, the fight scenes should be labeled as pointless, too long and way too violent for no reasons, but it’s actually the first time in my life where I truly admired Clamp’s work. As it is, while the fights were great at showing off Saya’s personality, which is quite lacking logical emotional feelings, the way it depicted the monsters was absolutely fascinating. It is not rare to see an anime with monsters killing humans, but blood-c did it in a way where those creatures actually acted like real monsters. They don’t act on feelings of hate and lust of blood; they act on instinct which makes them more terrifying than your typical shounen antagonist.  The big problem with blood-c is actually how far one need to suspend his disbelief.  Even if the obvious contradictions worked as foreshadowing elements, it is not beyond the fact that the village is very dumb and stupid and that Saya has one of the most contradicting personality ever made in anime. For me, I enjoyed the story for what it was. It stayed true to its business, and didn’t go into something deep and useless.And there’s a lot to say about Saya, the monster hunter. Probably hailed as one of the most worthless hero of the year, she makes use of the “protect everyone” trope quite actually well. By that, I mean that she doesn’t protect anyone, nor does she actually feel bad about it. If she would fail to protect someone, the next day she would sing a song about the nice weather.  And again, she doesn’t question her supposable super powers and her extreme headache. Quite the dumb heroine I must say.  On the other side, the other characters don’t really serve any purposes other than being gore material.Visually, Blood-C has the reputation of being one hell of a bloody mess.  Regretfully, most of us had to deal with the censorship that, while it wasn’t too bad, was definitely taking away some of the experience. As for the monsters design, it has to be some of the slickest and interesting ones I’ve seen in a while. In comparison, it is fair to say to it resembles some of the creatures in Mohiroh’s works.  As for the character design and the environment, there’s really nothing much to say. If there’s one thing that would stand out as being original, it probably would the school uniform that I actually rather liked.  The animation is actually handled quite well. For sure, some of the fighting animation might feel awkward, but the studio did use the monsters to their capacities, which makes them feel more real and alive.The music is not really distinctive in the anime. It accords itself to the situation, but there isn’t any wow factor. Opening song is good, ending song is forgettable.In conclusion, this review tended to explain Blood-C for what it is. Either way, you may find yourself that you’ll hate or love this show after reading this.  And for me, I’ll have to place myself in the loving camp. For what it is, Blood-C works remarkably well at lacking anything deep, not trying too hard and simply being mild entertainment. for these very same reasons why I absolutely adore Blood-C, placing it in my top shows of 2011.There is lack of caring and drama in Blood-C that makes it pure entertainment.For one thing, Blood-C is very dry with its story telling.

As for the monsters design, it has to be some of the slickest and interesting ones I’ve seen in a while. In comparison, it is fair to say to it resembles some of the creatures in Mohiroh’s works.  As for the character design and the environment, there’s really nothing much to say. If there’s one thing that would stand out as being original, it probably would the school uniform that I actually rather liked.  The animation is actually handled quite well. For sure, some of the fighting animation might feel awkward, but the studio did use the monsters to their capacities, which makes them feel more real and alive.The music is not really distinctive in the anime. It accords itself to the situation, but there isn’t any wow factor. Opening song is good, ending song is forgettable.In conclusion, this review tended to explain Blood-C for what it is. Either way, you may find yourself that you’ll hate or love this show after reading this.  And for me, I’ll have to place myself in the loving camp. For what it is, Blood-C works remarkably well at lacking anything deep, not trying too hard and simply being mild entertainment.', ""Story:I began to watch Blood-C, ended up with 3 episodes.

To make it short, there is no real development in this anime until the last two episodes and trust me, it\'s not worth going through 10 episodes of Saya\'s amazingly boring daily life just to...see that.

I'm surprised by how much I think about this show.Blood C is a violent anime. A very very very violent Anime. Maybe even shockingly so. I watched Elfen Lied and that seems almost elegant compared to this.Maybe it's the copious amounts of blood and gore, maybe it's the sheer viciousness with which characters are unceremoniously dispatched, maybe it's how exasperatingly inept the main character seems to be, either way, I'm convinced now that Blood C is a show that is much better in retrospect than it while you're watching it.Most people...watching Blood C do so because they're trying to get a bit more out of the Saya story, and are maybe even hoping for some continuity with Blood +. Well, no such thing. This show's all new, and while some of the basic themes remain the same, everything else is completely different.Here's the thing, I hated this show while I was watching it. I thought the main character was pretty much brain dead, and I found myself yelling at my screen more than once. But Blood C is like a scar on your soul that stays with you once inflicted, and over time, you may come to see it as a unique part of yourself, and even think fondly of it.While I can't say I think fondly of Blood C, I must say that few anime's have stuck with me the way this one has. There's just something about the setting, the fights, the characters, hec the entire plot, that is very very creepy when you think about it. And it's insight into human nature is certainly not appreciated at first - no, that comes after you've stopped hating this version of Saya. No, the subtle genius of this show only becomes clear in hind sight.I still can't put into words why I think this show is worth watching, but it's a definite for any fan of the blood series.

The aesthetics are visually stunning, the characters are engaging, and the action scenes are intense. It\'s a unique anime that, despite public opinion, I strongly recommend for its captivating blend of beauty, character depth, and adrenaline-pumping action. However, it\'s crucial to note that some scenes are notably gory and violent, which may not be suitable for everyone. Yet, these moments are not gratuitous; they serve a purpose within the narrative, adding depth to the story. Give it a chance, and you might discover the underappreciated charm of ""Blood C."" ', ""As a fan of both Blood franchise and CLAMP, Blood C had an initial success in attracting me.However, as episodes pass by, it bore the heck out of me. I could have finished this series in 1-2 days but it took me a week because it was THAT boring for me. What the heck is wrong with this series?The plot was there. Art was good (bishounens, anorexic (err, very thin) characters with long extremities, and very good details in costumes and the setting. Yup, definitely CLAMP). Blood and gore, check. My major problem is the slow pacing. Yes, for a 12-episode anime it's slow...in terms of progress. Add the fact that the first few episodes were, how do I call this, routine episodes/episodes that pretty much contain the same things with minor variations here and there, and it's only in the last 3 episodes that the series managed to redeem itself, although they seemed to suddenly attack head on and fitted all the major happenings into the last few episodes. Kind of like how students cram at the very last minute. Please don't get me started on comparing it with its predecessor because this might end up as a comparative essay rather than a review.Overall, Blood C is good and its only major problem is the very slow pace.

I've only seen four episodes thus far and it's likely my opinion will change when I've viewed the whole series.The set up of atmosphere in this series works very nicely.

I watched the original Blood+ and thought it was a decent anime, but the story was a little contrived.

But anyways...1. Story and direction - weak. The background story is not being properly introduced (or rather not being introduced at all to the audience). We had to make assumptions. Poor directions -  not knowing where this is going and this is the bad kind of ""not-knowing"" and the worse kind of ""lost"". Overused storyline left a bad...taste in the mouth like the leftovers from 2 days ago (i.e. the girl is going to school and singing to herself about how good the weather is, then saw a dog-like creature, contemplating whether to touch / pat its head or not while realizing she\'s already late for school, decided not to and dashes to the school, girigiri safe as the teacher is about to check the attendance. Repeat for at least 3 episodes). Score = 2 [Worse, could not be tolerated, too late to be corrected].2. Animation - not that bad, but very generic CLAMP animation\'s characteristics. Censorship or not, it could not save this series. Very dull colors but at least it is not as pathetic as Togainu no Chi\'s overall quality of animation. TogaChi is on its own level of dreadfulness and eye cancer to the max, but that\'s another story. Score = 5 [Average, not too bad but not remarkably done either].3. Characters - very poor. Also, generic CLAMP characters that could be found in most of their work. Characters with really long legs, megane, twins, insufferably kind people, twin tailed girls, silent male characters, recycle characters from other CLAMP works (hello, Watanuki.. so you\'re a dog now, huh?), basically useless characters that made us wonder what is the purpose of these characters and whether they would do this series any good by appearing in it. I couldn\'t find myself to like any of these characters and at some point, I was glad that they died. I do not feel any connection to any of the characters. Score = 1 [Worst, but still get a point for trying].4. Voice acting - poor. Mizuki Nana should focus on singing. Fujiwara Keiji should not focus to voicing father/dad characters and should voice badass characters like Ali Al-Saachez (god I hate him in this but he\'s done a good job to make me hate the character), Ladd Russo (so badass I think Shizuo is the Ikebukuro version of Ladd Russo), Maes Hughes (so he\'s a father but also a badass soldier and confidant) and Sonchou (who\'d resist a kappa?). Other voice actors done a fairly average, to forgettable acting. Score = 2 [Worse, could not be tolerated, too late to be corrected, a disappointment].5. Sound (OP / ED / BGM) - below average.

Blood C is a reboot to the popular Blood franchise, following in the footsteps of Blood the Last Vampire and Blood+. It is brought to you by Production IG, the studio that handled both of the anime mentioned above, as well as other popular titles like Ghost in the Shell, Eden of the East, and most recently Robotics;Notes. The series composition and art were handled by the one and only CLAMP. Smells like a recipe for success doesn\'t it? So how in the world did things go so wrong?[ Story 1/10 ]The...bare bones version of the story is the same as it was in the previous iterations of the Blood franchise. Powerful high school girl Saya slays dastardly demons with her almighty sword. Very simple. But the difference with Blood C is that it forces its boring slice of life side on us for the first 5 or so episodes. This wouldn\'t have been so bad if the characters had actually been interesting people who actually did things or discussed something interesting. At the end of the episode, we see Saya slaying demons, giving us a tiny glimpse of the Blood series that we know and love. Fortunately, the fight scenes are very well done and interesting.We get no backstory on Saya until episode 11. Her boring friends get NONE. The story is almost nonexistant, mostly consisting of Saya doing boring stuff with her boring friends during the day, and slaying demons by night.  Many people die. Some people die twice. And its never pretty. Also, there\'s the surprise twist in Ep 11. The one no one saw coming. The one I don\'t want to spoil for you. The infuriating twist that makes you feel like you sat through this godforsaken anime for nothing.The violence in Blood C is over the top, grotesque, and stomach churning. Now I know what you\'re going to say. ""Well duh! It\'s called BLOOD C!""Fair enough. But Blood C takes it violence to the extreme. It makes Blood+ and Blood the Last Vampire look like children\'s cartoons. It makes other notoriously violent anime such as Elfen Lied and Mirai Nikki seem like My Little Pony. Hell, it even puts some live action movies to shame. Blood C is extremely violent for no reason. The violence is disgusting, overdone, and put in there purely for the shock value. People get devoured in this anime. They get cut to bits. They literally get crushed and ripped apart. They get ground into pieces. Their limbs get cut off. And they bleed a lot. And to make things worse, its always coupled with some equally nasty sound effects. Here\'s a fun little fact. The human body contains about 5.6 liters of blood. Clearly the creators of Blood C were like ""No! Fuck logic! Lets give everyone in this anime 5 whole gallons of blood and make them into human geysers! And quadruple that for any monster!""The last episode is probably one of the most disgusting things you\'ll ever see in an anime. By that point, the anime had just gotten so far up its own ass that it had turned into unintentional comedy. Or at least it was until monsters starting killing and eating hordes of people. Arguably one the worst scenes in the anime is when a monster stuffs a bunch of humans together in what looked like a huge bag, changes its hand into a sort of blender, and grinds up the horde of humans with blood flying everywhere. Now is all that necessary? No it is not.Now there is nothing wrong with some violence in fictional entertainment. But there is a limit to what a human can take before it stops being entertaining and starts getting sickening. Blood C took a huge honking dump on that limit.In short, here\'s a summary of the story: moe, moe, moe, LET\'S KILL A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, moe, moe, moe.[ Characters 1/10 ]Characters are all unlikeable. Our main heroine Saya is generically cheerful, cute, and klutzy. She\'s always tripping over herself, yet she\'s skilled in sports and with the sword, which makes no sense. To reiterate, the only backstory she gets in a stupid twist near the end of the anime. She goes on and on about protecting everyone, yet in multiple scenes where monsters are mercilessly slaughtering people, she just stands there and does nothing until after everyone is dead and cut up. Ironically, whenever Saya vows to protect everyone, people die. She\'s an annoying and poor heroine.Supporting characters are all one dimensional archetypes with no personalities to speak of. They get no backstory, no development, and you won\'t even care what their names are. Though to be fair, you may like some of the supporting characters at first. Until that infernal surprise twist.[ Art and Sound 8/10 ]The art and animation are the best parts of the anime. The anime sports some fluid animation and some pretty sweet fight scenes between Saya and the monsters. Well that is, when they\'re actually trying to animate a great fight scene and not just trying to make you throw up. CLAMP handled the gorgeous character designs so no complaints there either. Equal care was put in to the beautiful, sunny, lush town that the anime takes place in.Opening and Ending themes were ok. The insert songs are forgettable.[ Enjoyment 2/10 ]I enjoyed looking at the great art and some of the fight scenes. Like I said, by episode 11, the anime had gotten so bad that it became unintentional comedy. The only reason I didn\'t rate it a 1/10 is because I was able to get a laugh out of this anime. And it\'s not even a comedy! Amazing! But I would not watch this anime again, nor would I recommend it to anyone, unless I really hated them.[ Overall 2/10]Blood C is a train wreck of an anime that crashes and burns pretty badly. What could have been a decent action anime becomes a comedic gore fest galore. I got to wonder what kind of drugs were passed around when this anime was conceived. I wonder how such talented people could churn out such a disappointing and disgusting anime. Fans of the Blood franchise and maybe even fans of action anime in general should steer clear, there really is nothing to see here but an anime that insults your intelligence and turns your stomach.+ Superb art and animation+ Great fight scenes+ Great character designs- Abysmal story- Unlikeable, uninteresting characters- Stupid plot twist- Terrible cliffhanger ending- Unnecessary, grotesque, and nauseating depictions of characters frequently being mercilessly butchered or devoured bare bones version of the story is the same as it was in the previous iterations of the Blood franchise. Powerful high school girl Saya slays dastardly demons with her almighty sword. Very simple. But the difference with Blood C is that it forces its boring slice of life side on us for the first 5 or so episodes. This wouldn\'t have been so bad if the characters had actually been interesting people who actually did things or discussed something interesting. At the end of the episode, we see Saya slaying demons, giving us a tiny glimpse of the Blood series that we know and love. Fortunately, the fight scenes are very well done and interesting.We get no backstory on Saya until episode 11. Her boring friends get NONE. The story is almost nonexistant, mostly consisting of Saya doing boring stuff with her boring friends during the day, and slaying demons by night.  Many people die. Some people die twice. And its never pretty. Also, there\'s the surprise twist in Ep 11. The one no one saw coming. The one I don\'t want to spoil for you. The infuriating twist that makes you feel like you sat through this godforsaken anime for nothing.The violence in Blood C is over the top, grotesque, and stomach churning. Now I know what you\'re going to say. ""Well duh! It\'s called BLOOD C!""Fair enough. But Blood C takes it violence to the extreme. It makes Blood+ and Blood the Last Vampire look like children\'s cartoons. It makes other notoriously violent anime such as Elfen Lied and Mirai Nikki seem like My Little Pony. Hell, it even puts some live action movies to shame. Blood C is extremely violent for no reason. The violence is disgusting, overdone, and put in there purely for the shock value. People get devoured in this anime. They get cut to bits. They literally get crushed and ripped apart. They get ground into pieces. Their limbs get cut off. And they bleed a lot. And to make things worse, its always coupled with some equally nasty sound effects. Here\'s a fun little fact. The human body contains about 5.6 liters of blood. Clearly the creators of Blood C were like ""No! Fuck logic! Lets give everyone in this anime 5 whole gallons of blood and make them into human geysers! And quadruple that for any monster!""The last episode is probably one of the most disgusting things you\'ll ever see in an anime. By that point, the anime had just gotten so far up its own ass that it had turned into unintentional comedy. Or at least it was until monsters starting killing and eating hordes of people. Arguably one the worst scenes in the anime is when a monster stuffs a bunch of humans together in what looked like a huge bag, changes its hand into a sort of blender, and grinds up the horde of humans with blood flying everywhere.

I watched the series as it came out (thank you Internet), but unfortunately, it was censored. So all the lovely gore that I was looking forward to was a bunch of bright lights and mosaics. Please take that into consideration.Story (5): Well the pace of the story starts of balls slow, which is intended I\'m guessing, but I feel like some people were looking for a more fast-paced intro. When they didn\'t get it, they disliked it. So if you\'re starting...off this series, be a little patient, it will pick up. I found it to be predictable, but still thoughtful enough to keep watching. However, I think plot could have been more developed.Art (9): What can I say? CLAMP\'s art style makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Shoujo-esque characters, and then you have the more gruesome side to it with the ""monsters"". It flowed very well, and from what I could see that wasn\'t blurred out, it was well detailed. It was a nice contrast as well to the bloodsplosions and gore. If you\'re looking for an art style more rough around the edges, this might not be what you\'re looking for, but give it a shot anyway.Sound (8): Aside fromt he OP and ED (which were lovely) the rest of the music during the show was quite nice. Or at some points, lack thereof. It balanced out the scenes well, and I wouldn\'t mind listening to the soundtrack outside of the series.Character (3): I was honestly expecting more out of this series in terms of characterization. Sure, there were twists to characters, but most of them were fairly obvious, and I didn\'t really sense any development...perhaps aside from some moments with Saya.Enjoyment (6): I can say that I did enjoy this series, up until the last two episodes. It was good fun to watch, and I might actually watch it again (uncensored of course). I looked forward to the new episodes coming out weekly.Overall (6): Well I\'ve seen better series, and I\'ve seen much worse. The artistic aspect I think balanced out the lack of character development and story. My advice is to take Blood -C very much separately from Blood+ etc, and I feel like you\'ll like it for the most part. Take it for what it is. off this series, be a little patient, it will pick up.

Take it for what it is.', 'Well, this is my first review, just to say this first. I\'ll write my true feelings about this show.I don\'t know why I write my first review about Blood-C, but I had just a feeling I should write one when I watched the last episode. Okay let\'s start.To be honest I can\'t say I liked it and I can\'t say I disliked it either. I\'ve seen neither Blood: The last Vampire nor Blood+ so I wasn\'t prepared for what might come. It was ... bloody. That\'s the only thing I can say about it, if you ask me to discribe Blood-C with only one word....Coming to the story. It was kinda complicated for me, since the real thing came really late. The meaning of everything what happened. I think it was not fully explained, so I hope it will in the movie. At first it was all sunny, fluffy and nice with a bloody red aftertaste. Then it turned more and more red with sorrow and death.The motto in this show, at least for Saya was ""I will protect everyone"", but it was quite the opposite what happened. I think if you take the story, this was really good. If you take the feelings that come out of this, it\'s just sad and frustrating. Someone can easily imagine what Saya felt. And I think that\'s an important part of a story. So I\'ll give it at least a 7.Now the art. I think it was good, nothing much to say about it. Get\'s a 8.Sound. Well I didn\'t have many anime which sound was bad. So this one is an anime with great sound just like many others. The sound suited the scenes perfektly and I personally liked the dramatic one. The Seiyuu cast was a great choice just as always (imo). Deserves a 9.Now characters. Well it was dissapointing. Since at first everyone seemed very symapthic to me, later it turned out to be a total farce. Characters I liked turned out to be assholes (excuse me :x), but well that is part of the story, and since it makes the characters the way they are (unfortunately), it\'s good. I think I shouldn\'t rate characters low, just because I don\'t like them. I should judge about how they suit the story and how they act.Now for the character design. It was not as much CLAMP as other series of their manga for example. I don\'t really like the character design of CLAMP, but since it wasn\'t this extreme, I liked it very much. Overall it get\'s a 8.Now the most important part imo. The enjoyment of this anime. I did NOT enjoy it. I found it interesting. I found the morals, persons and how the show would progress interesting. Note that it is not the same as enjoyment. I give it a 2.Since I don\'t enjoy bloodshed, especially not this much and I don\'t enjoy massacres. Though I thought some specific characters deserved it at the end. I cryed about only one death. Especially the extreme massacre at the end was the worst of all and if it would\'ve been at the start I would\'ve dropped it right away.Overall I think it wasn\'t a bad anime, but it wasn\'t very good either. It was just bloody, but it had an interesting story. I look forward to the movie. But I hope those massacres won\'t continue. I would prefer it to have more story, since much has to be cleared.Thank you for reading. Coming to the story. It was kinda complicated for me, since the real thing came really late.

One thing is clear though - it is another story, not a sequel, prequel or anything to Blood+, so everything is possible and strange things may happen.The first 3 episodes gave subtle hints. A bit strange phrase here, a look there, a slightly illogical act or a somewhat misplaced object. The 4-th episode adds more of that, but also makes some mysteries clear and evident. A great setting is ready, but it is yet unclear if this anime will perform to expectations.Story: 7. Actually, n/a...- it is too early to tell. Maybe 10. Maybe 4, no less.Art: 9. The drawing is ordinary in style, possibly classical, but very well done. Colors match one another exceptionally well and the color style is not that common. The screen goes from colorful to almost monochrome or even black and white and back. We often see 2 layers, each in its own palette, separating objects into 2 groups and guiding our attention. The key protagonist colors are white, black, and red.Sound: 7.

Read with discretion.Blood C is an installment of the Blood franchise, which contains one awesome movie, one crappy live-action movie, and a fifty episode series I still haven’t seen. The star of Blood C is Saya Kisaragi, another incarnation of that iconic character... Don’t ask... Who’s a super popular, super pretty high school student by day, and a cold-blooded monster slayer by night. She lives with her father, and has five very loyal, very lively, very god-awful annoying friends....As the story goes on, and the monster attacks begin to strike closer and closer to home, Saya slowly begins to realize that there might be more to this situation than meets the eye.Blood C was animated by a company called Production IG, which has been around since 1988. Taking a look back at their filmography, a lot of their work may look dated by today’s standards, but there’s no doubt that the majority of their shows were the best looking shows of their time. Blue Seed, FLCL, Ghost in the Shell SAC, and most recently, Attack on Titan. They’re known for bringing their A game to most of their projects, and Blood C is no exception. Characters move fluidly, the fight scenes look awesome, and the artwork from Clamp looks equally inspired... But while Saya and the monsters she faces may look really good, it’s her friends that make the art design look a bit... awkward.At first, the story is kind of a mixed bag. You have to deal with Saya’s friends at school, as they openly parody Clamp’s notorious character design tropes... I wonder why they bothered, since they already did such a good job of that in xxxHolic without even trying... But on the other side of the coin, you have Saya’s battles with the monsters, which is a plot seed that starts off with a lot of promise. You see her fighting one on one with some kind of gargoyle, which is a lot of fun to watch, but then you get to see her fight the very monster that drew me into the series... Eyeball Samurai. This fight didn't disappoint, either. It’s staged well, it’s paced well, it ends on a great note, and Saya actually manages to save some poor girl from being killed. She saves somebody’s life. Why am I drawing so much attention to this? Well...  To speak in the broadest possible strokes, it's her job to save people from being gruesomely murdered, and she is blisteringly incompetent at it. Hell, this girl couldn’t save a sandwich with a Ziploc bag!I’ll admit that it’s kind of cathartic seeing monsters devour her irritating friends, but it doesn’t take very long to see the real reason why she can’t save any of them. The real reason why her power is so conveniently inconsistent. As good as this show looks, and as much promise as it shows, it’s gore porn. It’s not a horror title, it’s not an action title, oh no, it’s gore porn. The main character’s credibility isn’t important,... The dialogue isn’t important... The story isn’t important... The villain’s motivation is certainly not important... All that Blood C cares about is delivering as much gore porn as possible, and if every other aspect of the show has to dumb itself down to accommodate this, then so be it.That’s not to say that it doesn’t TRY to be more than the sum of it’s body parts... There’s some social commentary on mankind’s relationship to the food chain, but the way it’s delivered is just heavy-handed, tasteless, and a transparent excuse for more gore porn. I don’t mind gore porn... I will begrudgingly admit that I’m a fan of Elfen Lied, a show riddled with problems of it’s own. But at least there was more to Elfen Lied than it’s fetishy abuse of red paint. The only elements of Blood C that had any real care or effort put into it was the art and animation, because they wanted better looking gore porn.All in all, Blood C doesn’t really have that much to offer. If you’re looking for a gory anime that‘s centered around epic battles, you’d have a much better experience watching Berserk. If you wanted to see giant monsters gobble terrified people up, you could just watch Attack on Titan, a show that does an exceptional job portraying the struggle against hopelessness. If you wanted to see an anime that pokes fun at man as a dominant predator, you could get that and so much more out of Madoka Magica. But Blood C dumbed itself down so much to maximize the squicky blood fountains that it unintentionally created one of the least effective heroes in the history of fiction.It’s hard to watch, and not in a good way, which is why I have no choice but to award Blood C with the dubious honor of a 4/10.  And I don't care what MAL says, that score is not decent.

I think i know why: they wanted a Blood + sequel or remake, with the same story, kuuderes bishonen like Haji and lots of action. Don't get me wrong, Blood + is good, but i think Blood -C is better because it risked more. It's not the typical shonen odf the high school MC who slays monsters andfights evil, it's a seinen with tons of blood and a interesting message.The first episodes are slow, they show us Saya's life in the village with his father, going to school with her friends by day and...slaying monsters called furikimonos by night. She lives every otaku's dream. But when her two lives starts to stop of being separeted, many of the creatures she fights attack her beloved ones, and despite all her powers, she can't help their deaths. This is an interesting way to show us that this life is not that wonderful we believe it is, and give us a hard lesson: unfortunetly, you can't save everyone you want to.Many people complain aout the lack f action(???????) and why Saya doesn't discover anything, but i think they should rewatch the story and pay more attention to the plot and don't skip the fight scenes cause the gorey stuff and less attention in where the hell is Haji.Saya started to wonder since the furikimonos started to talk to her, but she didn't trust them becuase they are supposed to be human flesh- eating monsters, her enemies. But then everything started to be more and more suspicious, and Saya didn't realize before for one simple reason: she doesn't wanna discover the truth.Despite is fake, is her life and she's happy with it.The final twist is not the happy end we get used to, with the hero defeating the villain.

I must say it: Fumito is one of my favourite villains.

The soundrack is just brillaint, really matchs the scenes, and the animation by Productions I.G. is amazing as always. slaying monsters called furikimonos by night. She lives every otaku's dream. But when her two lives starts to stop of being separeted, many of the creatures she fights attack her beloved ones, and despite all her powers, she can't help their deaths. This is an interesting way to show us that this life is not that wonderful we believe it is, and give us a hard lesson: unfortunetly, you can't save everyone you want to.Many people complain aout the lack f action(???????) and why Saya doesn't discover anything, but i think they should rewatch the story and pay more attention to the plot and don't skip the fight scenes cause the gorey stuff and less attention in where the hell is Haji.Saya started to wonder since the furikimonos started to talk to her, but she didn't trust them becuase they are supposed to be human flesh- eating monsters, her enemies. But then everything started to be more and more suspicious, and Saya didn't realize before for one simple reason: she doesn't wanna discover the truth.Despite is fake, is her life and she's happy with it.The final twist is not the happy end we get used to, with the hero defeating the villain.

Blood C did not know what it was doing with itself.It tried to mix multiple genres into the original action/ gore of the original franchise. It was almost as if they wanted to confuse the audience by incorporating slice of life and romance tropes into the story on purpose but it was not done successfully at all.At the same time as trying to mix genres that should not go together the world that informed audience members were familiar with was expanded...to introduce ridiculous characters with even more ridiculous names. I mean, come on, one was just a giant eyeball. They were certainly a downgrade on the terrifying Chiropteran's in the original film and Blood+.The art work used was too light and resembled a comedy series which just made the dark themes impossible to fully appreciate.Saya as a character has been one of my personal favourites since I was eleven years old but I just hated her in this. She was utterly useless in every situation and had little character development despite there being plenty of chances. She did not question anything and trusted too easily. Even amnesiac Saya of Blood + knew there was something off from the beginning. Blood C left me praying to every deity every created she would stop singing.So disappointed that this sequel to one of my all time favourite animes was only a jumble of unexplained plot twists, unneeded fights and useless characters. to introduce ridiculous characters with even more ridiculous names.

Very intricate and intriguing; by the end of the show itself mind you. I notice that most people who watch this show tend to complain about how obscurely the show conveys the story. This isn\'t untrue, for the first good chunk of the show (five to six episodes or so). Each...episode for this \'chunk\' maintains a fairly rinse-and-repeat formula: The main character sings her way to her high school life for the first 16 minutes, and then proceeds to have a well-animated battle with a single demon for the remainder of the episode. However, after that certain point in the show, the show begins to reveal important facts relative to the ultimate story. Eventually, the I was able to piece together the plot given to them into something that actually makes some sort of sense. Finally, when the show was over, I didn\'t find myself confused too much.TL;DR The story isn\'t confusing by the time you finish the show, but it takes a while to take off in terms of actual plot. The few twists the show threw at me managed to surprise me legitimately and ultimately revealed an entirely new perspective on the show itself which is further touched upon in the movie Blood-C: The Last Dark.The art is very aesthetically pleasing, and the battle animation is smooth or crisp when it needs to be. The animation has that signature I.G. effect that I\'m quite fond of myself. The animation isn\'t anything outstanding, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless.The sound is one of the weaker points this show is equipped with. Aside from the memorable opening and ending themes, the show doesn\'t exactly have any other boast-worthy soundtracks. It\'s highly probable that I could recall one or two songs that were repeated every episode: One for when Saya walks to school and another for when she has her ""battle of the episode.""Most of the cast started off as characters who lacked that unique touch that I generally look for in anime, however, there are a few characters whom I found much depth towards the ending portion of the show. Aside from the main antagonist, only a select few other characters managed to capture my interest during the run of the show. Each character in the show has their fair share of layers that are gradually revealed and developed over the course of the show. However, the most interesting developments happen to be for the main character and antagonist. For spoiler reasons, I\'ll refrain from going into too much detail.Overall, I enjoyed the show very much; and the experience was made even more of an impact with the addition of the movie. While watching the ending of the show as a whole, I had thought that the show had just left me on a major cliffhanger, but that opinion quickly changed after I had finished the movie sequel. The battle animation was pleasant and felt exciting to watch, the action was intriguing and had me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the battles. The characters aren\'t necessarily boring, instead, they gradually evolve over the course of the show from one stereotype into a completely unique and new person altogether. The story was very fascinating by the time I had finished the show in its entirety, the movie in all. When I had finished the initial show at first, I had a set conclusion that I had come to regarding the plot. However, when I had finished the movie, that conclusion had completely been negated and a new perspective on the story was revealed to me.I\'d recommend this show to someone who\'s interested in a show mainly focused around the fanservice of great battle animation, because realistically the strong and powerful battles are the show\'s strongest points. If you\'re looking for a story that impacts you heavily, this show will be a gamble for you. The story isn\'t weak, but I can definitely see how someone\'s expectations would fall short.

It can also underline a dark atmosphere, telling you that the environment the story takes place in is harsh, brutal and knows no mercy for people making mistakes. That is something we all know (or should know) from series like Berserk, BLAME! or (to mention animated material) Umineko. Of course, this terror-spreading bloodstained medal of gore has another side to it. Let\'s talk about Blood-C.- The Story:To...be honest, (although not being completely satisfying) Blood-C actually follows an interesting base frame considering the storyline. The story of innocent shrine maiden Kisaragi Saya, who is fighting against demons for the sake of her village, starts out as your typical monster of the week action show. This section is, looking back after seeing the whole picture, well made and pretty enjoyable. The action is exciting and Saya and her schoolmates are sympathetic and easy to get used to. While watching her slaying demons and handling her school life, there are always little hints, weird moments and mysterious lines that keep you on your guard for some bigger mystery behind the scenes to emerge sooner or later. The problem is, when that happens, rushed explanations and plot holes keep you from being satisfied. By then, it\'s already too late to save the show, anyway... More of that in the next paragraph.- The Atmosphere:The big problem of Blood-C is NOT the excessive depiction of gore and violence, but its purposelessness. Saya\'s battles with the demons often take their toll on casual bystanders. In the first episodes it is still shocking, to see what the demons are capable of, when Saya is too late to rescue someone from being devoured alive.After a while, though, the attentive audience starts to wonder:""Well, she COULD have saved this poor bloke BEFORE he was turned into a bloody pulp, couldn\'t she?""And once you realized this, you\'ll start to ask yourself, if there maybe is a hidden purpose to this depiction of innocent people being gorged on (while the main heroine humbly waits for the monster to finish dinner), or... if this show is just about gore and brutality... for the sake of gore and brutality.By the end of the show, after seeing countless people being tormented to death without identifiable reason, you are so fed up with random violence that you don\'t care about explanations anymore.- The Design:As for the character design, there\'s not much to be said: It\'s CLAMP. Long, thin bodies with typically formed eyes and messed up proportions. You either hate it or like it. Looking at the design of the demons Saya has to face, most of them are designed rather well and have a unique feel to them. Regarding the quality of animation, although you get the feeling that some episodes use smaller budgets than others, most of the animation is done well and most of the fighting sequences feel dynamique.- Final Conclusion:Before realizing that most parts of the show emphasize violence for the sake of violence, Blood-C serves well as a typical dark monster-of-the-week action show with a mysterious subplot beneath it. The purposelessness of the extreme level of  depicted gore and the (for me) unsatisfying and rushed conclusion in the final episodes of the show corrupt what could have been an exciting and interesting dark action mystery experience. be honest, (although not being completely satisfying) Blood-C actually follows an interesting base frame considering the storyline.

Do you remember that one time when you thought maybe your whole life was a conspiracy and everyone was just figments of your imagination or constructs of a cynical reality that you\'d built up in your head? What, you mean you don\'t recall all those times where it felt like you were just on the cusp of realizing some greater truth before being pulled back into the mundane tedium that is day-to-day life? WELL GET READY TO FEEL THAT WAY, BECAUSE YOU\'RE WATCHING BLOOD-C.1. THE STORY: Woah trick you better step off if you think...you know what\'s going on in this damn show. This isn\'t for entry-level weaboos, so if you don\'t understand rhetorical tools like genre inversion and narrative dissonance, go back to sucking your thumb and watching Dragon Ball Z or Doraemon or some shit. For real though, I don\'t expect some scrubs to appreciate the thickly woven narrative that is Blood-C. Basically, the plot of this shit is that Saya has to kill the monsters, which is the plot of every damn ""Blood"" anime so get used to that shit. However, due to the genre inversions and other tools at work, this show manages to be unique and fucking compelling. First of all, the show is done by CLAMP. Yeah, you know, the shitlords who make anime like XXXholic, Card Captor Sakura, and Chobits. Now, you might be like, ""Hold up I read that production IG--"" and here\'s where I\'m gonna cut your ass off. CLAMP did the story and character designs and pretty much was in control of everything but the animation itself because I guess CLAMP is too busy making dojinshi or some shit. Anyway, the whole point is that you go into the show thinking that it\'s some typically moe CLAMP bullshit, but it turns out that\'s the furthest thing from the truth--and this is fucking compelling because it\'s true for the characters in the show too. HNNNG I get so damn hard just thinking of how well played that shit is. I\'m not gonna spoil the plot, but it\'s a damn 10/10 due to perfect pacing, foreshadowing, development, and themes at work.2. THE ART: Look, I already covered why having CLAMP work on one of the most brutal titles ever is pretty much awesome, but there\'s a lot of shit going for this show in way of art. For instance, the agoraphobic and tense atmosphere that arises due to having such a colorful CLAMP town be fucking desolate is unsettling. Especially since it\'s like that in a load of anime, but it\'s given special attention here. Every time you start to take some typical bullshit anime approach to the art or direction of a scene, BLOOD-C kicks your damn teeth in for that shit and makes you hella noided. Now, I\'m not gonna wax this bitch\'s shoes forever, because some of the fights are pretty slow paced, but that\'s just to accent the more fast paced ones. There\'s times when the animation is so damn fluid I want to tear my eyes out because goddamn I probably won\'t ever see anything more slick air on TV ever again. I HIGHLY STRESS getting the DVD or BLURAY version of this series, since they had to censor the Jesus out of it--and I mean, literally, Jesus shows up in one scene and you can\'t even see him in the TV version because of the pillar of light they put in to censor his lord and savior. On the real though, you\'ll miss monsters brutally destroying the face of everyone in a fifty mile radius, and that\'s pretty damn important to watch given the dichotomy I\'ve explained earlier.3. SOUND: If that intro doesn\'t get you pumped to watch this show, nothing will. DESPAIR IS THE ONLY TRUTH YOU\'VE GOT, BRO. Aside from that ass-kicking intro, there\'s also a pretty damn good soundtrack to go with this animation magnum opus from CLAMP and IG, but I don\'t even need to tell you to listen to it--just watch the damn show. So many times are unsettling tracks put alongside routine life that you start to feel that no one is comfortable living in this damn town. It\'s well done, because it establishes thematic elements at play without having to flat out tell you shit. If you\'re so dense that you don\'t get what\'s going on in the plot by episode 9, you probably need to wash the wax out your ears and turn up the sound, because the damn soundtrack brings you places you wouldn\'t go to otherwise.4. CHARACTER: Look, I\'m not trying to spoil this shit, but the characters in this show are fuckin\' perfectly done, given how it unfolds. Everyone\'s a seemingly flat anime bullshit stereotype and that\'s the damn point. The show itself parodies the state of the industry in its macabre dance of insane bloodshed and narrative dissonance. Within a twenty-minute setting, you\'ll be listening to Nana hum out the most kawaii~ tune, and also see the character she voices cut down a monster twice her size, covered in its blood, after it murders half a dozen people. This isn\'t the same shit as those other wannabe shows like Mirai Nikki or Higurashi--the juxtaposition of violence and cuteness is done tastefully and purposefully in this show and isn\'t just there for random hijinks.5. ENJOYMENT: Holy goose on the loose, I\'d be lying if I say that this show doesn\'t get like a 15 for enjoyment. You\'d have to dig up old fuckin\' OVAs from the 90\'s to find something this brutal, and not to mention--there\'s so many clever and well played instances of foreshadowing that if you\'re scratching your head when big twists happen, you should be kicked in the dick. When the twists happen, the sensation is more akin to being slapped in the face by the same disembodied hand you\'ve been staring at for the last three hours. Everything is there for you, and the show does an amazing job in its tedium and pacing to keep you involved and watching without giving up everything right away. The whole point is to not take things at face value, otherwise this\'ll just seem like a monster-of-the-week pandering show, which is exactly what the narrative itself defies in its existence. If you can\'t perceive narrative depth, then this isn\'t the fucking anime for you, but that\'s probably part of the creator\'s intent--to weed out the plebeians and reward the truly astute consumer of anime. In that regard, it is enjoyable in an entirely different way.6. OVERALL: Hot damn, BLOOD-C doesn\'t fail to impress. It\'s attractive in so many ways, just like that girl who lives down the street that everyone really likes but no one will admit and you\'ll just keep telling yourself she\'s just some average chick--but you know the damn truth, man. Don\'t just let BLOOD-C get old without you, ask her out and enjoy your damn time together, even if you know it\'s gonna end on a movie-setup cliffhanger. Who gives a damn? She\'s worth it. you know what\'s going on in this damn show. This isn\'t for entry-level weaboos, so if you don\'t understand rhetorical tools like genre inversion and narrative dissonance, go back to sucking your thumb and watching Dragon Ball Z or Doraemon or some shit. For real though, I don\'t expect some scrubs to appreciate the thickly woven narrative that is Blood-C.

Now, you might be like, ""Hold up I read that production IG--"" and here\'s where I\'m gonna cut your ass off. CLAMP did the story and character designs and pretty much was in control of everything but the animation itself because I guess CLAMP is too busy making dojinshi or some shit. Anyway, the whole point is that you go into the show thinking that it\'s some typically moe CLAMP bullshit, but it turns out that\'s the furthest thing from the truth--and this is fucking compelling because it\'s true for the characters in the show too. HNNNG I get so damn hard just thinking of how well played that shit is. I\'m not gonna spoil the plot, but it\'s a damn 10/10 due to perfect pacing, foreshadowing, development, and themes at work.2. THE ART: Look, I already covered why having CLAMP work on one of the most brutal titles ever is pretty much awesome, but there\'s a lot of shit going for this show in way of art. For instance, the agoraphobic and tense atmosphere that arises due to having such a colorful CLAMP town be fucking desolate is unsettling. Especially since it\'s like that in a load of anime, but it\'s given special attention here. Every time you start to take some typical bullshit anime approach to the art or direction of a scene, BLOOD-C kicks your damn teeth in for that shit and makes you hella noided. Now, I\'m not gonna wax this bitch\'s shoes forever, because some of the fights are pretty slow paced, but that\'s just to accent the more fast paced ones. There\'s times when the animation is so damn fluid I want to tear my eyes out because goddamn I probably won\'t ever see anything more slick air on TV ever again. I HIGHLY STRESS getting the DVD or BLURAY version of this series, since they had to censor the Jesus out of it--and I mean, literally, Jesus shows up in one scene and you can\'t even see him in the TV version because of the pillar of light they put in to censor his lord and savior. On the real though, you\'ll miss monsters brutally destroying the face of everyone in a fifty mile radius, and that\'s pretty damn important to watch given the dichotomy I\'ve explained earlier.3. SOUND: If that intro doesn\'t get you pumped to watch this show, nothing will. DESPAIR IS THE ONLY TRUTH YOU\'VE GOT, BRO. Aside from that ass-kicking intro, there\'s also a pretty damn good soundtrack to go with this animation magnum opus from CLAMP and IG, but I don\'t even need to tell you to listen to it--just watch the damn show. So many times are unsettling tracks put alongside routine life that you start to feel that no one is comfortable living in this damn town. It\'s well done, because it establishes thematic elements at play without having to flat out tell you shit. If you\'re so dense that you don\'t get what\'s going on in the plot by episode 9, you probably need to wash the wax out your ears and turn up the sound, because the damn soundtrack brings you places you wouldn\'t go to otherwise.4. CHARACTER: Look, I\'m not trying to spoil this shit, but the characters in this show are fuckin\' perfectly done, given how it unfolds. Everyone\'s a seemingly flat anime bullshit stereotype and that\'s the damn point. The show itself parodies the state of the industry in its macabre dance of insane bloodshed and narrative dissonance. Within a twenty-minute setting, you\'ll be listening to Nana hum out the most kawaii~ tune, and also see the character she voices cut down a monster twice her size, covered in its blood, after it murders half a dozen people. This isn\'t the same shit as those other wannabe shows like Mirai Nikki or Higurashi--the juxtaposition of violence and cuteness is done tastefully and purposefully in this show and isn\'t just there for random hijinks.5. ENJOYMENT: Holy goose on the loose, I\'d be lying if I say that this show doesn\'t get like a 15 for enjoyment. You\'d have to dig up old fuckin\' OVAs from the 90\'s to find something this brutal, and not to mention--there\'s so many clever and well played instances of foreshadowing that if you\'re scratching your head when big twists happen, you should be kicked in the dick. When the twists happen, the sensation is more akin to being slapped in the face by the same disembodied hand you\'ve been staring at for the last three hours. Everything is there for you, and the show does an amazing job in its tedium and pacing to keep you involved and watching without giving up everything right away. The whole point is to not take things at face value, otherwise this\'ll just seem like a monster-of-the-week pandering show, which is exactly what the narrative itself defies in its existence. If you can\'t perceive narrative depth, then this isn\'t the fucking anime for you, but that\'s probably part of the creator\'s intent--to weed out the plebeians and reward the truly astute consumer of anime. In that regard, it is enjoyable in an entirely different way.6. OVERALL: Hot damn, BLOOD-C doesn\'t fail to impress. It\'s attractive in so many ways, just like that girl who lives down the street that everyone really likes but no one will admit and you\'ll just keep telling yourself she\'s just some average chick--but you know the damn truth, man. Don\'t just let BLOOD-C get old without you, ask her out and enjoy your damn time together, even if you know it\'s gonna end on a movie-setup cliffhanger. Who gives a damn? She\'s worth it.', 'This is like one of the fewest anime that ive seen that differs from the rest and that;a why i am liking this anime. I was getting bored of the same story line over and over again where they start of with many friends, then evil dudes or monster come, and then get defeated by the main character o or maybe one friend dies, but after that that they live happily ever after. i know the story for this anime is hard to get but pay att and you will find out why things happen.If you want to watch something different than any other...watch this one.PS. watch for every hint they give you and it leads to answers as to why things happen. watch this one.PS. watch for every hint they give you and it leads to answers as to why things happen.', 'Blood-c is a perfect example of an anime with a ""good"" plot, but horribly fucks it up for, well.

So anyways I\'m not surprised that it\'s score lowered as soon as it wrapped up.The story. Well you can just search for the Truman\'s story plot and add murder on it. That\'s pretty much itArt is fine. Infact, it gets better when you disfigure it and maim it!Sure it\'s shit on the outside, but you do get some meaty enjoyment out of it.

The reason I started this anime was because of Blood+ so I went with high expectations, but then… Boom! Disappointment started.The story in general felt really bland, I’m glad that there were only 12 episodes because the pacing was horrible and it felt repetitive with the monster-of-the-week episodes, and the characters that were so boring! Everytime Tadayoshi appeared...I wanted to sleep because all he did was to say “Saya…” like all the time, god. Although I did find the twist at the end nice, I knew Fumito was involved in some sense, but I never could have guessed what was really going on, so kudos for that.Also I found that some of the monsters were ok and originals, but others lmao were just utterly ridiculous, and there’s really just one who made an impression on me and was actually scary, the spider-like that appeared in episodes 8-9, that one made me shiver and I felt uncomfortable.Finally, if you're into gore then this anime is for you, because honestly Blood-c is one of the most violent and gorey animes I’ve ever seen, I mean that final episode… I cringed so much in the final scenes, I was seriously disturbed by the violence, and this is coming from a person who has seen a lot of gorey animes.But overall, was BLEH. I feel like it totally ruined the Blood franchise and people should just stick with Blood+ to be honest, there you have an amazing Saya and also let's not forget Haji :) I wanted to sleep because all he did was to say “Saya…” like all the time, god.

I was a big fan of Blood: The Last Vampire and Blood+ and I was really hyped up for this show. That was until I watched the first three episodes. It was just so boring I couldn't take it any more. The story is nothing special. I thought that the fighting could save this show in my books but the fighting was boring too. The only good thing about this show is the art. Try it out for you self, just don't expect anything special.

Yeah, I might be at risk of getting eaten by terrifying monsters, but hopefully I\'d be a character that will be able to kick ass. This anime heavily reminds me of Devil May Cry & Bayonetta, two game franchises that I have a personal love for. The actions scenes kept me gripped to my seat & had me saying: ""OMG"" repetitively. The amount of gore & violence in this anime kept me excited as I have a thing for graphic content in anime. The main character, Saya looks like the cutesy...love child of Dante & Bayonetta, but she also seems like a cooler version of myself. She may be a kind, clumsy & helpful schoolgirl but she has the ability to f*ck up anyone who tries to hurt the people she cares about. I also loved how she always sang to herself about her day; I tend to sing a lot to myself as well. She is honestly one of my favorite anime characters of all time. The OST for this anime is also one of my favorite anime soundtracks next to Another\'s soundtrack. Whoever composed the music for this anime deserves an award.Episodes 10 - 12 of Blood-C are getting so much sh!t from people it\'s scary. Don\'t get me wrong, I was quite baffled myself when I watched these episodes, but the thing about this anime is that it\'s meant to be a tragedy as well as an action, horror, & supernatural show. There\'s bound to be some shocking revelations about Saya & her past. However, I will say that these revelations were in my opinion a bit too shocking. It would\'ve made sense if most of the revelations didn\'t choose to tug at my heart strings so harshly.Overall however, I highly recommend that you watch Blood-C.

Everything that didn't make sense will make sense.

But by episode three I could basically predict what was going to happen in that episode. From there on it goes from its usual to a bloodbath. The only thing keeping this show together is a mysterious dog that Saya meets. The flashbacks show the same thing over and over again and drag to plot out.

After chapter 7 it start becoming more decent but still, difficult to enjoy.The action scenes are not bad animated and are more or less entertaining, but, she fights against monsters as a routine, so when it finish is like she did nothing.And how about...the final?

The lasts chapters were the most interesting thing of the series, but is not worth to get to it.In short, Blood C is a waste of time that i would not recommend anyone. the final?

Wow.This is on the level of ... Terra Formars (also known as ""Cockroach Death-o-Rama"").  Actually, it is even worse. Didn\'t think it was possible.Basically, this is an anime with okayish visuals, a few very, VERY nice fight scenes, decent music, and absolutely abominable story and characters. I\'m not sure what happened to CLAMP and producers of this anime, but this is junk with no redeemable qualities. The few nice fight scenes are completely outweighed by the garbage anime pulls off afterwards.Story: 2/10.The idea was apparently to make a mystery, start with a lighthearted daily life scenes, slowly make the story go darker...and darker, then make shocking revelation, except that none of this worked. The ""cheerful daily life"" part is so cliched that it is completely unbelievable. The ""darker and darker"" amounts to throwing an endless stream of Diabolus ex machinas and ""Break the Cutie"" episods at the viewer. There\'s so much gore that it is not shocking but simply annoying. Also... the hints are so obvious that shocking revelations could be predicted several episodes ahead of time. (Somebody did too much hinting. Way too much hinting. The ""subtleness of sledgehammer"" kind of hinting).Art: 5/10:Nice, detailed backgrounds. Detailed characters... with proportions similar to the ""noodle people"" from XXX holic. It is not quite ""noodle people"", but I think characters are at least 8 heights tall. There are few very amazing and fluid animation scenes, but the number of those is small. Animation in general is quite fluid, but in action scenes it lacks shading, and enemies are quite flat. Also, every thing killed in the anime has metric ton of pressurized blood, meaning they all go ""pssshhhhh!"" when sliced in half. This gets annoying.Sound: 6/10:The main theme is very nice and interesting and is close to something I\'d listen to. Some of the combat music is quite good as well. Voice acting does not stand out.Character: 2/10:Watching character interaction is pretty much painful. There are no likeable and no believable characters. All interactions are stereotypical, and people act in completely insane fashion. It is on ""Someone got horribly killed in front of our eyes! Let\'s have a funny chat and blush"". Ridiculous. Everybody is either some sort of stereotype or a carton cutout (filled with pressurized blood). There are also many situatiosn when somebody patiently waits till someone gets killed. Very patiently. Sigh.Enjoyment: 2/10:Well, I loved the fight in the first episode - that was amazingly done. However, past that point the anime kept going downhill becoming worse and worse  after every episode. The overuse of ""Diabolus Ex Machina"" trope. The wooden horrible interactions. Heroine being an airhead that is dumb as a brick. Predictable events. And bland scenes where somebody startes at someone else with completely dead eyes. By the episode 10 I hated it.Overall: 2/10:This is junk. If you want to see what good this anime has to offer... watch the second half of the first episode, it has a very well done fight in it. It is pretty much the only one such fight in the series, following ones are less interesting. And then listen to the main theem on youtube or something. Then skip the rest of the anime.Even without being part of the ""blood"" franchise, this is junk - because gore alone is neither shocking or interesting enough.So, the best idea is to skip it. and darker, then make shocking revelation, except that none of this worked.

If you\'re planning to watch this show, I hope you really like it, because you\'ll be hearing it a lot.  And I mean a lot.  Here\'s the thing though, Saya, if you\'re going to say that several times per episode, it would help if you tried actually protecting people, instead of just standing there glaring at the monster-of-the-week while it merrily chows down...on the first few bystanders. You see, Saya royally sucks at protecting people.The show starts well enough.  The monster designs are probably the highlight; they\'re a weird and diverse bunch, and Saya dispatches them in a series of well animated fight scenes.  Problems set in within a few episodes though, primarily one that CLAMP is frequently guilty of, namely repetition--endless, nauseating repetition of the same plot point, over and over until you can\'t take it anymore.  Blood-C has about six episodes\' worth of plot, stretched to 12 episodes.

I can see where it's a series that you can love or hate.The story was good but I wanted to see some background on how this experiment was conceived (maybe the movie will answer that question).   I also wished they gave more back story to some of the characters.  I liked how the story had some twists to keep me guessing.   The characters were developed but I think there was room for even more development....As far as art goes, I really enjoyed that aspect.

Even when it got violent and bloody, the artwork was still great.  Even the music was good, 'Spiral' was a great opening as well.I'm not a big fan of really bloody shows but this is one of a few that I liked watching.  It was slow at first but as it proceeded further the pace picked up and it was the perfect speed.

She will really show that she has split personality  because of  rapidly switching from of her terrifying face in fighting scenes and to this sweet innocent school girl.

It\'s the case of Blood-C, having met a cruel and unfair depreciation because the Blood fanbase, who is responsible for watching and evaluating this show, are crazy in love with Blood+.I haven\'t watched Blood+ and I couldn\'t care less about the Blood franchise either. Wether this is better or worse in my opinion doesn\'t have any relevance because as it stands alone I found...it to be a great great show. It is a bit different from other animes out there and I can probably figure why it fell from grace in such a horrible way. But I have to say one thing: Blood+ fanboys and fangirls, stop blaming the pacing!-About that pacing...-All episodes are basically divided in two halves: the slice of life half and the gory half.Now, that slice of life half was extremly boring for most people, I found it fascinating. Because this show just begs to differ. Any mystery show out there starts with blatant introduction of fishy characters, you know right from the start who is the good guy, who is the bad guy and who are the suspects. Well in Blood-C, the tension is bitter sweet because the boredom and silence and stillness that characterizes the characters and the surroundings are confusing as hell and they do a perfect job in creating the  so called ""silence before the storm"". Its is THIS feeling that makes this show great. Because it would have been easier to put tags on the bad guys and throw in a somewhat induced subjectivity, but if you really like mysteries and mindtwisting stuff this  is the right thing for you.-Art & Animation-Not very imrpessed on the art. I heard it\'s Clamp, but since i never liked Clamp I guess it\'s explainable. 7feet tall characters look deformed anyway, add to that an undersized head and you got... something ugly. And this thing with the heads happens in quite a few scenes and it\'s distracting as hell. Other than that, Clamp designs kind of lack... shadows and shine. And probably details also. Actually it\'s more like an unproportional distribution of details: we have graphic details in some places (like some useless hair bangs) but lack details on more important stuff - like the face. Animation on characters isn\'t too great either, they kind of lack expression and they are overall pretty stiff... lifeless.BUT the gory fight scenes are awesome. Instead of using cheap ""shining blades"" tricks to draw attention from the actual moves, I think they did a pretty good job here. And it\'s not only about the way the animation was done, but the coreography was perfect also. Very enjoyable fights, cool moves and such, and, ofc, some blood pouring with quite some generosity here and there in a very ""organic"" way... not the silly ""blood spray"" things that we see in some other shows. What can I say... blood splashes are always nice :D-Sound-I liked the music. The symphonic type of music, I don\'t recall hearing any silly high school tune. It\'s teh kind of background music that has a great effect when associated with the dedicated scenes, it gives you shivers and scares you to death when people get beheaded, but you would never probably listen to it alone: losing it\'s context, the magic just fades away. But that is good because my winamp already has too many songs to scroll.-Characters+plot-Well to speak about these would require some spoilers so i\'d rather not. Overall,  I found the characters okay, the strong point would be that they are uite enigmatic and it takes a while to figure out what they want and what they play. That is, in my book, a good thing because it helped me enjoy this piece. Saya however, I wouldn\'t be surprised if people would find her annoying. At least in the first half (the slice of life thing) because she is doing a lot of silly things and is very clumsy.

I finished it and then went of myanimelist to see if there was a sequel. While looking I noticed that the reviews were really low. The show got a 6.71 overall and normally I won't even watch a show if the score is under 7.5 or so. That was when I realized that a disproportionate number of viewers probably watched the first few episodes and gave up. That sucks because, as I have discovered, there aren't that many truly engaging anime out there and unless one is a big fan of...ridiculous looking giant robots, the list gets narrowed down pretty quickly.Yes the first few episodes are pretty bad. The story doesn't exist and the contrast between normal time and monster fighting time is ridiculous. That said there is actually a reason for this but the reason doesn't really matter so if you are having trouble dealing with the first few episodes then skip to episode 6 or if you're a real extremist just start at 10 because that is where the plot really picks up.I know that I'm supposed to review all the aspects in order but most of them don't matter. Sound is fine. I never watch the intro or closing sequences so I could honestly care less about what they sound like. The characters neither add nor detract from the story because they don't really exist. Until the massive plot twist at the end. Even then they still don't really matter all that much.The art deserves a mention because it is a little weird. Imagine that you are torturing someone made of rubber on a rack. Got it. Now imagine you stretch them way out. Well thats kind of what the characters look like. This doesn't bother me at all, and actually, after watching xxxholic, I have come to enjoy that style. The fight sequences are good and the animation was reasonably smooth. Good enough for me.The most important rating here is the one for enjoyment. It doesn't matter what I or anyone thinks about individual parts as long as when they come together the parts form an entertaining whole, and they did. This show was good enough to have me search for a sequel and that means something because Im pretty picky about my anime. So before you ditch this show.

The rest of the characters, the twins seem to be a bit annoying, but I ended up liking them for some reason. For the rest, I really don\'t care about them since they just seem useless including the twins.Overall:Would I recommend Blood-C? Not really.

You either love it, or you hate it, and I didn\'t love nor hate this series, and even if I said, ""I fucking hate this piece of shit series,"" I\'d still go back for more. Hahahaha...7/10 (for me)Overall:This series was painfully disturbing, disappointing, and eye-gougingly gruesome, but the ending left me wanting more! More blood! More pain! More heartache, but the series sucks, so don\'t watch it... Unless you have BIZARRE taste! I for one must have.6/10 and I\'m highly anticipating the upcoming, Blood-C Last Dark Movie this Summer. I look forward to the conclusion of this truly shit, bad excuse for a Blood series, no sarcasm.Story:There is hardly a story, apart from some girl who lives in THE MOST FUCKED UP TOWN on Earth, and has THE MOST FUCKED UP friends ever. There were some ""seemingly"" nice people in that town, but by the end of the story, you\'ll hate everyone - even Saya herself, but... even though there\'s hardly any story, there is a story noneless, but is a good story? Yes. Will you like it? Probably not. (I did for some reason. lol)7/10Art:The art for this series was a little lacking, but I loved the design for those bizarre school suits that they wore at Saya\'s school. It was nonetheless, decent... for a Production I.G anime.6/10Sound:The best freakin\' part of the series! The opening is by far the best part of this series, and you\'ll probably only watch this series because you though, ""Wow, the opening\'s amazing! Surely the series is, right?""

Indeed, Saya is back. For the better or worse, the only unchanged thing from old Saya is probably her name, hair color and fighting style, to the point where you can\'t be sure whether she\'s the old Saya or not... Story is completely new and unrelated to Blood+ series so you can watch them in either order, although Blood+ does provide a lot more background story.Anyway, Saya is back to murdering stuff. And she does so in peaceful village, where she lives with her father in a shrine. She lives happily, helps cleaning shrine, drinks coffee, sings a song in the morning, goes to school, has lunch with friends, doing pretty much everything a japanese anime high school girl does. Problems occur when weird evil monsters threatening village appear. As a good shrine maiden, just like her mother she\'s sworn to slay them all with her trusty katana and protect the village. Smells fishy? For a good reason too, you\'ll have to see for yourself.What I didn\'t like about the story was probably it\'s pacing. The overall idea is nice, but they turned it into episodic monster kill with gore as its main element. Felt like whole thing could be summed up in 2 episodes.ArtHas some nice rural vistas, animation was ok at first but seemed pretty shitty (and sometimes hilarious) towards the end. The feeling I got from watching could be described as ""cheap"".Saya\'s new character design is not too bad but god damn does she have hair. Where did it all come from should be a movie by itself. Other characters are not really memorable or special in any way (maybe just the cute twins). This anime being designed by CLAMP, you can expect to see tall characters with long limbs and males with triangular faces.SoundI don\'t like to talk too much about music, since it depends on opinion way too much. I\'ll just say the it was mostly fitting the situation. Voice acting was nothing special, it did convey the character types as they intended to, so I guess it\'s ok.CharacterTough to say something without spoiling, but I\'ll try. Characters include Saya, her father, her coffee maker and few of her classmates. Interactions between them are pretty much on level of any generic slice of life anime. With a twist. Not spoiling.Every other villager is there for the sole purpose of being eaten or ripped to pieces by one of the monsters.EnjoymentWas hyped at start, getting progressively less excited throughout the series, then little more excited again at the end. That being said, I didn\'t enjoy most of it, mainly because of the ""episodic monsters"". They were completely pointless and didn\'t lead anywhere.OverallIt is no secret that a lot of people die in this anime. It\'s pretty bloody! What bothers me is that I didn\'t feel anything watching most of them die, simply because it was overdone. Those people played no role in the story, you didn\'t know them, they didn\'t know you. Their death was pointless yet creators still decided to put a lot of emphasis on it, because it has ""blood"" in a title so there has to be a lot of it. As fan of CLAMP\'s works this anime felt like betrayal.

With that in mind I decided to watch this one, but I tried my best not to compare them too heavily to one another since I did want to give this one a chance.I will not say that Blood-C is a BAD anime. In reality I did enjoy it, but there are several criticisms that left me reeling during and after having watched it.Firstly, a lot of the violence was rather senseless, to me. It had a very ""KILL ALL THE THINGS!"" mentality, which is apparent in the first few episodes alone. The fight...scenes were enjoyable less for their unpredictability (because they were rather predictable) than for their sheer intensity.That said, the fights WERE very intense - much more so than they were in Blood+. Dare I say, there is a lot more gore (although much of it is censored out, perhaps thankfully) than in its cousin, Blood+. The main character is a lot more likely to kick ass than Saya Otonashi was.The revealing of information is a little slow and it isn\'t very organized. It IS a relatively short series, at 12 episodes, but they could have revealed information at a different pace than they did.In all, as I said, I did enjoy the anime and I will say that it is good. I feel as though, however, it could be refined and it does not match up to the artwork that was Blood+; at least to me. scenes were enjoyable less for their unpredictability (because they were rather predictable) than for their sheer intensity.That said, the fights WERE very intense - much more so than they were in Blood+.

Too bad this shoots well past excessive and lands somewhere between gratuitous and seventh circle of hell.The show\'s pacing is inconsistent.  It usually dawdles along, but sometimes switches to ultra-violence mode.  The overall effect is a cross between slice of life and mechanical problems in a red paint factory.  I kept thinking of God in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (""Get on with it!"").As early as the third episode I was asking myself, ""why did she stand there watching while...that guy went inside and got slashed to ribbons?""  This continues throughout the show.  She just stands there and watches, even though she spends half her time going on about how she has to protect everyone.  After all the gushing finishes she finally decides it\'s time to start moving.Likewise, the show is slow to start moving. By the time it does, the last episode is half over.

Viewer Discretion is HIGHLY advised]When I saw the opening for this anime back in 2011 when it was announce, I just had to see this series for art appeal. I did not fully care if it was good or not, I just wanted to watch it on what I was saw in the OP and images. I hated Blood+. Disliked really, but it just wasn\'t that good. The whole basis of some major conspiracy as the hook in Blood+ was not...at all intriguing and the action and gore was just disappointing.Step in Blood-C, a deceiving little anime that spends its time sitting there and being a generally generic bit and then BAM! Glorious gore! Beautiful blood! All sorts of violence happens in the series in some way, and the series never stops to top itself.So let us get down and simple, what was good about this series? From the listing above my writing panel, we start with the Story. It\'s okay. It\'s not a mystery plot, it\'s a series written to make my primitive need to see violence be sated.Art and Sound was generally alright and well done. I can\'t complain all too much. Characters are basically designed by Clamp and as such have a Clamp aesthetic to them. Nothing much else to say.And to talk about Character, let us bring up the recurring character, Saya. In each Blood series, there is a character named Saya. All of them are sword wielding women who fight monsters that prey on mankind and the plot twist of who they are tends to be the same. Having not seen the original Blood: The Last Vampire, and never caring to, I can\'t say anything about that particular film. But when comparing the two Saya\'s between ""+"" and ""C"", C\'s Saya is just an all around better character on the simple note of an actual will to fight and be a total bad ass about it.You see, what I remember about Blood+ goes about so: For most of the series (+)Saya is just generally unwilling and incapable of fighting until drinking Haji\'s blood. And even then, the fights she had just weren\'t memorable. And she was just downright bland really. I did not like her personality or design. She actually is not appealing even down to just how she looks. As I said, Blood+ was not particularly good on the action side, more so paying attention to a lackluster mystery. But at the same time, it\'s like the series was confused as to what it wanted to be in the first place.So in Blood-C, the Saya we are introduced to is a happy-go-lucky, ditsy school girl who sings on her way to school. And then at night she turns into a badass monster hunter with a terrific fighting prowess. When she fights, she has the will to do so. When she fights, her fights have me just rooting for the next clash of her blade against the foe. Her character design is quite pretty as well, it was really what sold me on the series in the first place. Her appearance in the OP was just gorgeous. Especially near the end when it does a close up on her face. Those eyes man accompanied by those glasses just captures my heart.So overall, I really enjoyed this series. I might be giving this a score in comparison to Blood+, and also a bias there of, but really, if I had to compare it to series like Hellsing, Black Lagoon, and the so forth, this pretty much whets my taste for action and violence. Be prepared to bring towels, a wetsuit, and many umbrellas though. It may as well be raining blood by the end of this series.

And maybe limbs and organs depending on the episode.', 'One word for this anime for me: HORRIBLE.The story, i have to admit, is the only thing that i liked from the anime. The Gore was epic, i thank god for the blur and the censors. The mystery is keep hidden until the 11th Episode. The damage caused from the monster to Saya was unusual. Saya should be dead from few fatal slices that should turned her into human fillet, but, as we all know, Saya lives on like Rambo survives a hail of bullets. ', ""Ok, I personally liked this anime alot. I love the designs of both characters and the monsters.I like how each episode has a unique monster and how cold her father seems but I do admit the talking dog is over the edge. The story was lacking but I found this to be a pleasant time waster. It was amusing enough to keep me interested and yet it was simple.BUT! I noticed people who loved Blood+ loath this anime.So it's safe to assume that if you love Blood+ this isn't the anime for you.Just walk away slowly and find something else.Now if your like me...and enjoy watching anything that's a combination of soft core porn and mass amounts of gore(which is basically every horror movie out there) then you'll enjoy this.Or if you have nothing better to do and your bored as hell.Just don't take this anime seriously, go in with no expectations and you'll have a good time. But if you go in expecting glory and wonder then you ganna be as pissy as every reviewer on here. and enjoy watching anything that's a combination of soft core porn and mass amounts of gore(which is basically every horror movie out there) then you'll enjoy this.Or if you have nothing better to do and your bored as hell.Just don't take this anime seriously, go in with no expectations and you'll have a good time. But if you go in expecting glory and wonder then you ganna be as pissy as every reviewer on here."", ""This is my first review, I'll try to keep it as unbiased as I possibly can (Blood-C is one of my all time favourites). I rate pretty nicely so keep that in mind.Deciding whether you'll love this anime as much as I did or hate it depends on your mainly your tastes. So if you're a fan of psychological, gore, mystery, an underlying love/hate relationship, and a little school life then this is for you. If you don't like blood and gore then perhaps you should just walk away from this one. If you love revenge plots then you could consider this a build...up/prequel to the revenge plot of Blood-C: The Last Dark.It's a part of the Blood franchise but you don't necessarily have to have seen the previous series to enjoy Blood-C, I for one haven't seen any of the previous works. Keep an open mind and don't compare it so much to the rest, if you do then you might not enjoy it as much.Story - 8/10 - The storyline is basically your average psychological/mystery. As the story progresses it turns increasingly dark as you begin to gather pieces of the mystery through the protagonist Saya's mind. Although it's an average plot that doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyable. It is a short series so the plot isn't too complex and lacks detail that you'd have to hunt through the manga to find, and it is complex enough to keep you entertained episode by episode. However it does end at a cliffhanger so you'll have to watch the sequel movie Blood-C: The Last Dark.Art - 10/10 - If you're a fan of CLAMP's animation style then you'll love Blood-C's animation. The animation was clean and crisp, and was never lazy. The character designs were cohesive with the apparent black and red colour scheme, and remained simple in a nice way. The backgrounds were beautiful as well. The blood and gore was very nicely done, and the gorey parts in beautiful detail as well. The fighting scenes were enjoyable and were complex and challenging enough for Saya that you'll stay entertained during every enemy battle Saya partakes in.Sound - 10/10 - This soundtrack was simply amazing. The cheerful and innocent music contrasting well with the dark and suspenseful music was a nice touch. It suited the show well, especially with how it played off of what Saya was feeling. The voice actors in Japanese were great, the English dub is also pretty good. In a sub vs dub debate I'd have to say sub, Saya's voice sounds more natural and the voice actress plays her part amazingly well.Character - 9/10 - The character development was mainly just that of Saya Kisaragi, the other characters didn't have much development. Saya's mind throughout the length of Blood-C was a heartbreaking place and her pain was clearly portrayed, you got to understand her at a nice level with the external conflict as well as her internal conflict. I found Saya to be very inspiring as well, she suffers quite a bit in the plot and yet always finds the strength to stand up and follow through with her plans (especially in the Last Dark sequel).Enjoyment - 10/10 - I. Loved. It. It kept me on my toes. I knew nothing about Saya going in and so everything that was new to her was new to me. It will always remain a favourite of mine.Overall - 10/10 up/prequel to the revenge plot of Blood-C: The Last Dark.It's a part of the Blood franchise but you don't necessarily have to have seen the previous series to enjoy Blood-C, I for one haven't seen any of the previous works.

Make sure to watch this while you are not eating anything (especially Pizza\'s)You may not like this series in the first 3-4 episodes, I literally felt like dumping this anime in the middle, but i don\'t know what kept me going. The series is very horribly structured that is the main issue with this anime.The character designs are pretty good, considering the double personality of Saya, it has been created in a very distinct manner. The demon side of her and the cute and kind personality of...her, other character design are fine as well, but since i am writing this in 2016, there is a great graphic difference, so don\'t expect the anime t be that great in visual designs.The sounds are okay, okay. Not the best once again. I myself have downloaded the highest quality (8-Bit audio system) and watched it but then again, the sounds could have been better, the opening song is good as well.The story is the main issue where it falls behind, or otherwise this anime would have an average of like 7-7.5 which would be really great. As i had mentioned before the story writer of the anime is not the best. In the middle of the anime is gets interesting and gives you the urge to keep on watching but at the end you would think to yourself why did i spend son much time watching this series. Yes trust me i had felt this as well. But if you are the kind of person that does not care about stupid endings then this is fine for you.Overall this is a good anime for a person, who has run out of animes to watch. So i don\'t highly recommend this anime to you, but if you want a change from all those ""Slice of Life Animes"" then this would be good for you.

The main character is one of my favorites in terms of how she's drawn and her personallity. Saya is a very sweet, innocent, and carefree character who loves the little things in life. Her secret life, however, is a very dark one filled with the dutiful, secret task of wreaking blood and havoc upon monsters to keep the town safe. She is very...well drawn, very attractive with the black and red school uniform, the stockings, and the red ribbons laced through her hair. This show has a tiny bit of romance but I wouldn't consider it a romance anime at all. If you love stories that turn from carefree happiness and cuteness to utter despair and tragedy and a good mystery then this is the show for you. Be warned, you may have a lot of questions after, with maybe half of the mystery yet to be solved. There is a movie that takes place after the show but I have yet to watch it.Please take a look at my favorite characters and watched animes and send me any recommendations please.

I'm always looking for my next fix."", 'Wow so Blood-C.I can summarize it with one sentence but I\'ll go on. Blood-C is about a high school girl who\'s part demon (Elder Bairn) or something (skimmed through all the good parts on YouTube but still got the main idea) who makes a promise to a dog that can talk (assuming he\'s a spirit, it actually never says) that she has to save everyone from monsters in her town. She discovers she\'s part demon and can fight these monsters that eat the people in her town with a sword that was supposedly blessed by a maiden in the old shrine she lives in...with her father.The animation was REALLY good. That\'s probably the best thing I\'m going to say about this show. The music was that kind of thriller, monster fighting scary music. It wasn\'t good but it set the mood.These monsters that killed the people were BRUTAL. I have never seen a more gruesome show that animated killing people in such a fashion. The only thing that kept me watching (skipping through the show to gory parts) was the shock factor of seeing these people maimed and killed unreasonably. And no one is safe but the main character which sucks in my opinion. Everyone around her is dying and just when she dives and saves a guy and you\'re like, ""Whew at least she got that one,"" *Monster knocks her out of the way.

That\'s probably the best thing I\'m going to say about this show. The music was that kind of thriller, monster fighting scary music. It wasn\'t good but it set the mood.These monsters that killed the people were BRUTAL. I have never seen a more gruesome show that animated killing people in such a fashion. The only thing that kept me watching (skipping through the show to gory parts) was the shock factor of seeing these people maimed and killed unreasonably. And no one is safe but the main character which sucks in my opinion.

However, what Blood C really excels at is extremely grotesque violence, and character balancing. Throughout the show, to me, Saya did not seem over-the-top like many main anime protagonists with special abilities are, and that's pretty rare. The actually story itself wasn't all that terrible and it really is more of a mystery show than anything. Honestly I didn't know what exactly to think because when everything was brought to light in the show it kinda surprised me.

I got completely hooked after watching 3-4 episodes. I stayed up all night finishing the entire anime. The story is very good as you kinda know what is going to happen throughout the show.

I'm not gonna go into too much detail as I'd rather not spoil it for anyone who'd like to watch Blood C.Blood C is a really good anime as you'll get to know all the characters and you'll like all of them. The show starts off a little slow but it's totally worth finishing...it. This anime is the first anime I have ever seen in my life that had a plot twist that hits you like a fricking truck.

I wanted to like this seeing as it was a spin-off to one of my favorite animes of all time (Blood+ as well was Blood: The Last Vampire) but couldn\'t. Sucks because it actually had some potential to be decent too.First, Saya\'s personality makes her one of the most unlikable female protagonists in any action anime I\'ve ever watched. She\'s a total airhead. A shy, clumsy (yet somehow a master with her sword), awkward girl with glasses.. it just doesn\'t fit the ""hero"" role or whatever role they were trying to make her at all. Also, so much animation time, especially in the first...few episodes, is wasted with her just running from place to place, tripping and falling or walking around singing for like 30 seconds sometimes (which is cringe worthy annoying, I almost dropped it right there the first time I heard her sing). All of this time could\'ve been put to better use maybe by developing the other characters since none of them were memorable at all.After the first episode my only thoughts were ""well.. at least the ending theme is good"". I figured since it was only 12 episodes I could just tolerate it and maybe it will get better and while it sort of redeems itself in the last few episodes by throwing a plot twist to everything, I didn\'t feel satisfied enough for being bored to death during the first half because of how slow the pacing was.Onto the good, well the art is nice. Character drawings are pretty and the fighting scenes are well animated. The horror aspect is also very present during the monster scenes along with plenty of gore but maybe too much at times. When you stab someone with a sword you wouldn\'t expect blood to gush out like you just opened a fire hydrant. Those are really the only appealing things about the show.If you don\'t care at all about the story, like seeing people get senselessly cut up, disfigured, eaten and you haven\'t seen anything better to compare this series to you might like it, but even then I would say just watch a compilation of the death scenes on youtube to get the same shock value and save yourself the time because this really is the longest 12 episodes I\'ve ever watched.

This anime is underrated and I can see why!

I didn’t know what the others had complained about, yet I still decided to give the show a shot. After having finished it, I understood the negative reviews and I agreed with them. I didn’t regret having watched it, but I know it’s something I’ll probably never watch again. I can only recommend it if you like dark and violent stuff. So what went wrong? Did anything go right?Setting:Saya is a teenage girl who studies at school and is a shrine maiden on her free time. During the night, however, she...hunts demons known as Elder Bairns who feed on humans. Some things about Saya’s past, identity, her school, father, and the town are clouded in mystery. A teenage girl who has to struggle with school, kill demons, and keep it a secret from her friends does have some potential an interesting setting, but instead falls rather flat due to issues with pacing, story development, dull side-characters, and excessive violence.Characters:There’s only one real character, and that’s Saya. She initially appears as a goofy klutz, but when she fights demons she’s a serious and deadly fighter. Makes you wonder which one is the real Saya is, huh? Saya herself isn’t interesting enough to carry the show, unfortunately. It’s fun watching her fight and kill demons, but not much else. Despite appearing as a caring and sensitive girl, she doesn’t seem to care much about her friends dying gruesomely one by one. Sometimes she barely acts. She doesn’t grow or change until the end when we find out who and what she is, but that’s where the anime ends.There’s also her classmates, teacher, and father. But all of them are boring. Even her father, who is clearly hiding things from Saya, fails to be of any real interest. A lot of people die without warning, but you don’t really feel anything for them. You never get to learn who they really are, or learn anything interesting about their backgrounds.Pacing & story:The anime has a bad and weird pacing. Sometimes it feels like the story is going on a loop, making everything look repetitive. Many episodes can be summarized as Saya starting her day by singing, visiting a café and talking to its charming and mysterious owner, being at school, and finally brutally fighting and killing a demon that feeds on humans. The next episode, the same happens except she fights another demon.After three or four episodes, I wondered if there’s an overarching plot. With each episode, not much new is explained or shown, leading to a poor pacing and story build up. In the last two episodes, everything is fully explained. I could pretty much have skipped the first nine or ten episodes and not missed much, except for gory fighting and cozy café scenes. This anime wasn’t designed for a typical 12 episode anime season. If it had been condensed into say 8 episodes it could have gone better.It was painfully obvious who the villain was. You can pretty much figure it out in the first or second episode. The twist about the town and school, however, did take me a bit by surprise, though I did have my suspicious that something was off.Animation:One good thing about the anime is the animation. The characters and environments are detailed and sharp. Sometimes however the characters look very lanky when seeing their bodies from the side. Close ups on faces from the side can also look weird. The lightning and shading during the night scenes look great. The movements are fluid and easy to follow. I wish however that the details on the violence and gore could have been toned down a bit.Action:The fighting scenes are fast, intense, with good choreography and much violence. Expect lots of blood splatter and gore. Saya’s final fight is epic and the best one. It was probably the only fight I decided to watch again. The designs for the demons are well done, coming off as creepy and mysterious. Though Saya has superhuman attributes and swordsmanship, she does sometimes struggle against enemies and does get hurt, badly even, which is something I like. No one likes overpowered protagonists who win too easily.Music:The music is another thing that the anime does well. I watched the catchy and cool opening several times. Many soundtracks are dark, somber, and creepy, as if taken from old horror movies. It fits the dark and depressing setting. Some songs are happier and merry for the more casual and lighthearted scenes.Oh, and finally, the anime has a sequel. A movie called Blood-C: The Last Dark.

By day, she is a cheerful, ditzy, and well-mannered girl devoted to her father and her friend Nanahara at the village’s coffee café. By night, she is a fearless and superhuman fighter with an enchanted sword that lets her kill monsters called Elder Bairns. As Saya fights these monsters, she starts to learn more about herself and her world, and the life she knows begins to crumble. Blood C is a twelve episode series that aired in 2011. It was based on the manga illustrated by Ranmaru Kotone and produced...by Studio Production I.G. and CLAMP. It is a dark fantasy/supernatural/mystery/horror genre show that can also be considered a psychological thriller.Blood C\'s story is very well written and executed, starting out as subtle, and slowly giving you more hints of the truth with each episode. Those who are not used to the genre and not good at picking up clues may find it difficult to see an overarching plot at first. Such viewers may only seeing the obvious things: clumsy girl at school each day, brutal monster fighter each night. The atmosphere of the show quickly gives it away as having an element of mystery and dark twists, however, to anyone familiar with the genre. Blood C is a great anime for making you think, and if you pick up on the clues, you will probably find the answer like I did just an episode or two before the big reveal.As a writer, I\'m always interested in story structure, and Blood C used an outline that I like a lot in short novels and 10-12 episode series. Episodes one through three establish the setting, the characters, and the picture of how life ""should be"" in this world. At the same time, this beginning arc leaves information gaps that force viewers to wonder what is really happening. The rising action culminates with plot point one (the first major hint given) at the end of the third episode. The second major development occurs in the fifth and sixth episodes. Episodes seven to nine form the next part of the story, ending in the defeat of a major monster and the feeling of Saya\'s world coming to an end. Episode ten serves as the buildup for the final two episodes, wherein everything comes to light. This story form is extremely well suited for twelve episode series and is used in many anime, including Madoka Magica.I am not an artist and I cannot provide terribly well-informed reviews of art. All I can say is that I loved the animation style and was impressed with it. I thought the colors, character designs, action sequences, and scenery were all good enough, though nothing spectacular. Some viewers don\'t like the art style and describe it as having ""lanky"" characters. As for me, I get tired of seeing one style all the time, so I love animators that deviate from the norm. It looks like a lot of thought went into the creation of each monster, so I enjoyed seeing them.The music in Blood C caught my attention and significantly contributed to my enjoyment of the anime. After all, music is one of the most crucial tools in building up suspense, portraying horror, and giving a mysterious atmosphere. The main recurring theme in the score does not have a name that I am aware of, but the OST track 1 ""Destiny"" features a fast-paced, thrilling version of the melody that appears throughout the anime. There are creepy scores as well as upbeat ones like ""Cafe Guimauve"" and soft, touching tunes like ""Yakusoku."" The opening song isn\'t my favorite but the ending song, ""Junketsu Paradox,"" is great.There wasn\'t a lot of detailed characterization in Blood C, and although they are someone what one-dimensional, I find the characters unforgettable. This is especially true if you watch it to the end, since certain aspects of the characters are not shown until the second to last episode. Although you can probably find out who the villain is once you get about halfway through, the villain\'s goals or reasons for his actions are never made exactly clear, which is one of this anime\'s shortcomings. The character of Saya herself, however, is very interesting from the start, prompting viewers to ask questions. Why is she so devoted to her father and the shrine? How is she strong-hearted enough to get through those fights when she seems so airheaded at school? Is there a reason she can\'t seem to look at her surrounding world with a clear, objective view? Finally, I loved the character of the dog, who is never named in the anime. He provides some moe and some occasional comic relief.There are many specific things about Blood C that I enjoyed and wanted to comment on, but virtually all of them would be spoilers. Personal enjoyment is my most important measure in rating anime, and I give Blood C a nine out of ten. by Studio Production I.G. and CLAMP.

The characters are forgettable and at times, it feels like torture porn. However, I must say that I was absolutely entertained the whole way through. Don\'t get me wrong, this anime is NOT something you should watch if you\'re looking for something serious. However, watching this with a friend was so funny that it\'s the only reason I remember this anime. Completely picking apart the failures of quality and consistency in the story and characters is a delight.

I have nothing against remakes, if they are done once every 20 years and try to offer something new to the table. Yet look at this; three iterations of the same premise in less than a decade? This is plain overkill and on top of that it was becoming worse with each new entry.The bait of the show is that the drawings are done by CLAMP, the team of women who are famous for their...spicy premises, taboo relations, and skinny tall pretty characters. It is present here as well, making the series 300% more kawai and anorectic than before. Everybody looks so cute and all; they even included a pair of identical twin girls, like those in xxxHolic in an attempt to sell more. Down to it, it’s a visual gimmick that does not add anything important besides a weak lure of the sort ‘Oh, hey, CLAMP artstyle with twins’. Another bait is that they named it Blood just to attract the fans of the previous versions, which is another cheap trick since all three entries have close to no relation with each other.These baits ended up backfiring, since most of said fans were disappointed by the very loose relation. They ended up comparing it all the time with the previous versions and other CLAMP works, instead of just seeing it as an individual show. Which is a bad thing since a show must be able to stand on its own two feet instead of needing earlier works for support. But it’s ok since it still managed to find a way to be remembered for something. Blood the Last Vampire is a cult movie for its weird animation. Blood+ is famous for its dark themes. Blood-C will forever be remembered as THE MOST RIDICULOUSLY GORE FINALE OF ALL TIMES. Further analysis on that later on, let’s focus on some other aspects first.The first thing that made an impression on me is the heroine’s looks. In this version, besides looking as a typical anorectic CLAMP character, she also has very long hair and glasses as extra accessories. Both combined with her being absent-minded and you have an excuse to make fun of her silliness. She is also a miko priestess assigned to kill monsters from the very start. And if we are to take something out, NO RED LIPS, a detail that made her previous iteration annoying to look at.Besides that, there definitely is a lot more moe in here, as well as a far better feel of physics. Blood+ was notorious for its serious looking characters and the badly done visual effects that made motions and backgrounds to feel artificial. Blood-C did far better in terms of fluid animation and a setting that feels alive instead of artificial (although in-story it’s actually the other way around). Production I.G. definitely improved the visual appeal and also turned Saya into a walking collection of fetishes, like klutz, athletic, wearing glasses and miko uniform on top of an already school uniform. The otakus are going to huff and puff heavily with her, unlike the one in Blood+ who looked and acted in a very plain way, and it was easy to get bored of her. On the other hand, her beginning as a normal girl and progressively turning into a monster slayer had a charm of its own. Too bad it took dozens of episodes and had numerous resets of progress because she was very indecisive.So this new Saya is now a klutz, like any typical shojo character, yet during sports or battle scenes she kicks ass. Is this even possible? No it isn’t, it’s just there to make her look silly; later on a revelation proves that all that are just moe smokescreen for her real persona. So the core idea is still the same, as she again has no clue who she really is, she has a sort of amnesia, and the whole thing is finding out about it and dealing with it. In a way it improved her version from Blood+ where she was boring for being very passive and indecisive for a long period of time. She is not a crybaby anymore, who needs dozens of episodes to realize who she was, what her dark persona was, and to find the courage to start fighting.This does not mean that the story moves faster because it is only a 12 episode series. Despite removing the slow build-up and beginning as an already full-fledged monster buster, most of the episodes are filler. And despite trying to make you think she is not passive and indecisive this time, she still freezes whenever a monster attacks her friends, a thing which results to a huge death toll that could have easily been avoided if she WASN’T FREEZING for no apparent reason. Thus, believe it or not, the old Saya, yes the boring one, made more sense since it was in her character to be inactive. This version has her freezing for no in-story reason and it’s done just so the monsters can kill people first, for easily avoided gore. Aka, it’s mindless entertainment.The character roster is far smaller in this version, which doesn’t affect the plot since none of them were doing anything, but also make her far more isolated as a character. In the previous version she had several relatives, allies, enemies, even renegades, and all of them played an important role in her development, as slow as it was. It also did wonders in fleshing out of the setting. Here most of the characters are nothing but minor schoolmates and monsters with no personality, thus there is almost no fleshing out. The former are just doing silly cute stuff and the latter just kill people, thus you are not given enough reason to care about them.The action part of the show is a hundred times more exciting that any battle in the previous version, which was simple and sluggish to the point of yawning. Here, the choreography is damn detailed and well played out… although hardly plausible. Saya’s veeery long hair doesn’t seem to hinder her at all. I mean at one point she is fighting in a lake where her hair must have absorbed water equal to a small pool. And her glasses never seem to fall off despite the very violent shakes and strikes. Are they sown on her ears or something? Does she even need glasses with those Chiropteran evil eyes of hers?The action is also very inconsistent, since despite having some cool choreography, the power scaling is all over the place. Sometimes the heroine is faster than light, sometimes she freezes when the monsters attack and butcher people. Sometimes the monsters attack only at night, then for no reason they can attack at daytime. It is supposed to surprise you, although there is very little effort placed on fleshing out the characters, thus the result is hardly as shocking as the director may have intended. Hey man, I don’t know these people, why should I be shocked?The show goes for a major plot twist in the end, in a last attempt to amaze us with a last moment revelation. Besides being far-fetched as hell, it also pretty much turned the whole show into a farce, not only mocking the heroine for being so oblivious all this time, but also the audience who expected something more serious from all that. Out of nowhere we get this huge exposition dump that feels like you were being trolled the whole time. And they made it as farfetched as they could, as if they wanted you to facepalm every 2 minutes. If the plot twist had taken place sooner and was presented in a slower manner instead of all at once, while bothering to flesh out the people involved, it could have been amazing. Instead of that you mostly get a monster of the week formula with dull plot and a rushed and messy revelation in the end. Yet, as sloppy as it was in this aspect, it definitely wins in a different one. I officially consider the final episode THE MOST RIDICULOUSLY GORE FINALE OF ALL TIMES. And that will probably be the only thing people will remember this show for. It made even Elfen Lied to look like a papercut.Other than that, yeah it was pretty shit. It’s like the writers got bored of their own nonsense and like disinterested children they destroyed the sand castles they had spend hours in building. Cartoony characters, mindless violence, and trollish ending is all you get. Despite its numerous problems, Blood+ is the better series. spicy premises, taboo relations, and skinny tall pretty characters.

And if we are to take something out, NO RED LIPS, a detail that made her previous iteration annoying to look at.Besides that, there definitely is a lot more moe in here, as well as a far better feel of physics. Blood+ was notorious for its serious looking characters and the badly done visual effects that made motions and backgrounds to feel artificial. Blood-C did far better in terms of fluid animation and a setting that feels alive instead of artificial (although in-story it’s actually the other way around). Production I.G. definitely improved the visual appeal and also turned Saya into a walking collection of fetishes, like klutz, athletic, wearing glasses and miko uniform on top of an already school uniform. The otakus are going to huff and puff heavily with her, unlike the one in Blood+ who looked and acted in a very plain way, and it was easy to get bored of her. On the other hand, her beginning as a normal girl and progressively turning into a monster slayer had a charm of its own. Too bad it took dozens of episodes and had numerous resets of progress because she was very indecisive.So this new Saya is now a klutz, like any typical shojo character, yet during sports or battle scenes she kicks ass. Is this even possible? No it isn’t, it’s just there to make her look silly; later on a revelation proves that all that are just moe smokescreen for her real persona. So the core idea is still the same, as she again has no clue who she really is, she has a sort of amnesia, and the whole thing is finding out about it and dealing with it. In a way it improved her version from Blood+ where she was boring for being very passive and indecisive for a long period of time. She is not a crybaby anymore, who needs dozens of episodes to realize who she was, what her dark persona was, and to find the courage to start fighting.This does not mean that the story moves faster because it is only a 12 episode series. Despite removing the slow build-up and beginning as an already full-fledged monster buster, most of the episodes are filler. And despite trying to make you think she is not passive and indecisive this time, she still freezes whenever a monster attacks her friends, a thing which results to a huge death toll that could have easily been avoided if she WASN’T FREEZING for no apparent reason. Thus, believe it or not, the old Saya, yes the boring one, made more sense since it was in her character to be inactive. This version has her freezing for no in-story reason and it’s done just so the monsters can kill people first, for easily avoided gore. Aka, it’s mindless entertainment.The character roster is far smaller in this version, which doesn’t affect the plot since none of them were doing anything, but also make her far more isolated as a character. In the previous version she had several relatives, allies, enemies, even renegades, and all of them played an important role in her development, as slow as it was. It also did wonders in fleshing out of the setting. Here most of the characters are nothing but minor schoolmates and monsters with no personality, thus there is almost no fleshing out. The former are just doing silly cute stuff and the latter just kill people, thus you are not given enough reason to care about them.The action part of the show is a hundred times more exciting that any battle in the previous version, which was simple and sluggish to the point of yawning. Here, the choreography is damn detailed and well played out… although hardly plausible. Saya’s veeery long hair doesn’t seem to hinder her at all. I mean at one point she is fighting in a lake where her hair must have absorbed water equal to a small pool. And her glasses never seem to fall off despite the very violent shakes and strikes. Are they sown on her ears or something? Does she even need glasses with those Chiropteran evil eyes of hers?The action is also very inconsistent, since despite having some cool choreography, the power scaling is all over the place. Sometimes the heroine is faster than light, sometimes she freezes when the monsters attack and butcher people. Sometimes the monsters attack only at night, then for no reason they can attack at daytime. It is supposed to surprise you, although there is very little effort placed on fleshing out the characters, thus the result is hardly as shocking as the director may have intended. Hey man, I don’t know these people, why should I be shocked?The show goes for a major plot twist in the end, in a last attempt to amaze us with a last moment revelation. Besides being far-fetched as hell, it also pretty much turned the whole show into a farce, not only mocking the heroine for being so oblivious all this time, but also the audience who expected something more serious from all that. Out of nowhere we get this huge exposition dump that feels like you were being trolled the whole time. And they made it as farfetched as they could, as if they wanted you to facepalm every 2 minutes. If the plot twist had taken place sooner and was presented in a slower manner instead of all at once, while bothering to flesh out the people involved, it could have been amazing. Instead of that you mostly get a monster of the week formula with dull plot and a rushed and messy revelation in the end. Yet, as sloppy as it was in this aspect, it definitely wins in a different one. I officially consider the final episode THE MOST RIDICULOUSLY GORE FINALE OF ALL TIMES. And that will probably be the only thing people will remember this show for. It made even Elfen Lied to look like a papercut.Other than that, yeah it was pretty shit. It’s like the writers got bored of their own nonsense and like disinterested children they destroyed the sand castles they had spend hours in building. Cartoony characters, mindless violence, and trollish ending is all you get. Despite its numerous problems, Blood+ is the better series.', 'Synopsis:Blood-C is about Kisaragi Saya, a second-year high schooler who lives in a quiet town, who is a shrine maiden, being a cute moe blob by day but a badass katana wielder by night. She is protective of those she loves and fights against the monsters ""Elder Bruins"" at night in order to keep them safe.Characters:Saya, honestly, was hard to watch at times, but as a moe blob she was alright. I think her redeeming characteristic, honestly, was her character design; I love it. She looks awesome. Now onto the next characters: They\'re nice cliches and all, but their character development is...very shallow. When the makers of this anime tried to add motivations to certain characters, it was less about making them sound like actual people and more like making them easier for the watcher to like or hate. Just point out characters and I could say ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" and that would be fact. However, this is a coming of age story, and the coming of age story is Saya growing to become more than she was at the beginning of the first episode. If you like to see 180 degree character transformations, this may be the anime for you.Story:You have to be patient with this anime. The first few episodes are building the premise, and the rest is molding your perceptions of what you thought the premise was. As I was watching, I kept noticing gaping plot holes, which completely broke the realism of the story. There were also red flags, too many to be in any sort of show. I was taking this all in mind but I kept watching because, honestly, I thought this anime was a big joke. If a more expectant person watched this, however, I expect that they might be a little more than pissed. Maybe even drop it. However, I implore anyone that begins Blood-C to stay until the end. If you\'re patient, all (okay, almost all) of your questions will be answered, but they might not be the answers that you expect at all.Art:The characters look great; everything else, not so much. It combines an almost blinding amount of common town-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-where-everyone-is-good-friends kind of color scheme with an often dark scene or premise. I know this is a type of artistic contrast made often in moe-horror shows, but this one was done pretty horribly; laughably even in many scenes. Especially gory scenes, or scenes with monsters were just kind of ridiculous, and purposely failing to set up the atmosphere to fit the scene is not very acceptable. Personally, I thought the bloody scenes were also kind of ridiculous; Saya uses a certain kind of ending attack so often it feels like a gag, but you just might like it. Also, the monsters look very stupid. end quote.Sound:All I could think when I heard this one track was that it sounded eerily like a track from D-Grayman. It\'s pretty distracting but apart from that it was not memorable at all.Enjoyment:The only thing that made me think ""oh that\'s cool"" is the art. Every character looks sufficiently distinct, especially Saya, who, as I mentioned before, looks totally badass both in daytime and nighttime form. Pretty much everything else I kind of face-palmed at. Every ""oh my gosh!"" kind of plot twist or reveal I saw from miles and miles away, although it might not be that way for you. Even when they make everything right by the end, the answer to everything I found to be very weak. AKA it was frustrating as a serious watcher, and barely enjoyable as a casual watcher.Overall:A 6/10. Not too great but at least it told the whole story by the end.My tips for watching (if you do):-Please be patient with Saya. She\'s a huge blockhead and can\'t think at times, but she\'s protagonist-number-one, so you better get used to her.-Watch closely and don\'t disregard things, because although a lot of things that happen feel out of place, they point to the final answer at the end of the tunnel. very shallow.

To preface, I have not watched any of the previous blood series.Where do I even begin. I think the worst part of this show has to be the story it told. It was a really interesting premise, and I\'ll admit I sat the entire story on the edge of my seat waiting for the interesting plot twist that would blow the repetitive nature of the episodes out of the park and make the whole thing worth it. Spoiler alert, it never came. As I watched I thought of many different ways they could have used the same...plot basis and different ways that it could\'ve gone for a more interesting story, but no. Instead, we got a horrendous ""tell them don\'t show them"" explained plot twist ending. Don\'t worry viewer, nothing will be left to your imagination, because they will simply spell out every little detail and question you may have had about what was going on. Oh, did you care about any character besides Saya? That\'s a real shame. Well, it\'s not like there was much substance to them anyways. I almost forgot to mention, the first 4-5 episodes were essentially just the same episode. Saya talks with her father, goes to the cafe, sings a little song on her way to school, has lunch and is oblivious to others, comes home, goes out to kill, and then comes home. The only reason I kept watching after episode 3 was the hope that some of the small things they dropped would grow to be interesting plot points later, and while many of them did become plot points, I don\'t know that I would consider them interesting. There was so much potential in this story. So many branching paths, so many potential arcs, so much lead up to a tragic boring finale that has you sitting wondering why you just wasted so much of your time.Speaking of boring, the majority of the characters in this show are all nothing. There is no substance to them, even after the big reveal. There is next to no character development for anyone besides Saya, and don\'t worry any character that seems to be gaining just a touch of development will no longer be an issue immediately after! The characters, for reasons later spelled out to you, are simply all basic slice of life tropes. There is no depth to them, for more obvious reasons that are revealed at the end, (**Major spoilers here, skip to the next paragraph if you would like to avoid**) but even when their true personalities are revealed there\'s still no depth. You have the annoying twins that turn out to be.... annoying twins! The weird teacher who turns out to be a weird scientist, and the bad boy love interest turns out to be just a bad person. And when it comes to Saya? I think she is the only character executed somewhat decently. Considering her circumstances, her behavior makes so much sense. She is what keeps the viewer watching, wondering ""what is up with this chick"" and as the story goes on you keep on anticipating the big reveal and questioning what is going on, who is she really, why do her eyes change color, etc etc etc. The monsters in this show are also quite interesting. Well, the ones that can talk at least. I think it says a lot though that single episode monsters with probably somewhere like 60 lines combined max so brightly outshine every other character in the show though. Once again, so much potential within these characters, but nothing to show for it.The only redeeming qualities to this anime are the sound and animation. The fight scenes are almost always incredibly animated, the opening is fantastic, the background music isn\'t necessarily something to rave about, but I have no complaints either. The character designs are nice, ignoring the slendermen-esque lankiness of them, and the overall art style is consistent. The gore is drawn well, and as I said the fight scenes are epic. I really enjoyed the art style.TLDR ratings:Story : 4/10- Left much to be desired- Little to no character development- Cliche finale trope- Repetitive- Wasted potentialCharacter : 4/10- Basic tropes- No development- No real motivations behind their actions- Boring at best, annoying at worstArt : 8/10- Smooth epic fight scenes- Interesting/pretty character design- Odd body proportions- Mostly consistentSound : 7/10- Nice Opening- Nothing noteworthy or ground breaking but not badEnjoyment : 4/10- Constantly wondering when it will get good- Disappointing ending- Disappointing.Overall Rating : 4/10I just wish they had put more effort into writing this story.

So much wasted potential.', 'So, I just finished blood-c, and this is my review:I am sorry for my English, English is my second language.I\'ve started this series because I saw an AMV on youtube with blood: the last dark (I did not watch that one yet). I am writing this review and I had only watched the blood-c entier series and the first 5 episodes from blood+ (I stopped because I can not find a site that has it at very least 720p).Blood-C is not as bad you guys think, but I do really think the first 7-8 episodes are totally useless. The series could\'ve been so much better,...the potential was insane (my opinion) but the production was very bad. For the first 7-8 episodes is just looping the same plot, then things get better, I rated this anime 7/10 (if I could I would\'ve rated it 6.5/10) only because of the last 4 episode. If the anime was for 12 episodes like the first 8, I would\'ve rated it 4/10.Story: it pretty bad, as I said. We do not really know anything until ep. 8. Until then, it just an anime about ""Saya"" that has to ""prove"" or ""find"" something.Art: it fine, it not too much to say about it. The fights are kind of lame sometimes. The best one is at the end (in my opinion).Sound: guys, studio... you guys really ran out of budget when it came to sound? Like, it the same ""tananaaaaaa naaaaa"" for the entire series. God...Character: without any doubt, Saya is the best in the whole anime. Also her ""father"". The other characters are just lame and we will not find anything about them until episode 11.Enjoyment: I guess a 6 is fine. It\'s not like is ""thrash"" or impossible to watch or ""I better watch Shrek."" When it came to enjoyment is just fine.Overall: If you gave this series any rate lower than 5 you are just delusional or a tryhard fan of blood + anime. It still an anime, and it was a lot of work to make it. But in my opinion: if you have any other anime to watch: don\'t watch this one. I watched it because I saw a lot of people talking sh*t about this anime, and it bad, yea, but not as bad as you all talk. In the end, I think the anime is showing us that in the end: is only you, and you can not trust anybody. That is what I like to think about this anime.6/10After edit: I was wrong about some things, and I was capping. I realized it after a few good months. This anime can\'t get any higher than 6/10. No matter how you put it, it just bad (because of the first 9 ep, and that is like 85% from the anime). My final rate is 5/10. Pretty damn bad.

Needless to say, I had high hopes and that's never a good idea. I was at the verge of dropping the anime with every single slow and boring episode, but something kept me going 'till I finished it in record time. Here are my overall thoughts:Main character - Horrible.Pacing of the anime - Slow and boring, which actually had an upside as well, since my whole attention was on the...small details that helped me put the puzzle pieces together pretty early in the anime and most of the ending (including the plot twist) became clear as day.Monsters and fights - Not impressive, but better than Blood+Plot - Predictable. (Don't know if that's cause of me, since I've seen a good amount of anime already, or it's predictable in general).Gore level - Way too high. (It's not even scary or affecting you in any way, or I'm simply immune to it at this point.) To me, personally, more gore doesn't make for a better anime. Quite the opposite.Any characters worth watching for - Not really.Ending - Well, I both enjoyed it and didn't enjoy it. It might have hit much harder if I wasn't already aware of everything that would happen, or if I actually  cared for the characters, which I honestly didn't. None of them grew on me and made me care for them. To be honest, I liked Blood+ better.And with all of this out of the way, my conclusion is a 5/10 and I'm being pretty generous. small details that helped me put the puzzle pieces together pretty early in the anime and most of the ending (including the plot twist) became clear as day.Monsters and fights - Not impressive, but better than Blood+Plot - Predictable.

It can't really fit into the horror category as it's not scary, or unsettling, though it can become unintentionally funny, courtesy of the over the top violence. Its story is fairly simplistic, it starts off in a quaint school setting and then weird stuff happen. It's got plenty of action and bloodshed, so if you like this kind of stuff, you will find things to enjoy here. Personally, I do not like gore or splatter, I find it boring and rather tasteless, hence when I watched this I lowered my standards,...I came here expecting only torrents of blood and no story whatsoever. Yet, I was surprised. The story does actually have some value to it, the characters aren't terrible either, more or less what you'd expect from any other anime series out there. That's not to say that the story is a masterpiece or anything, just that it's not a completely run-of-the-mill gorefest, and ultimately I found it to be good enough. It's only 12 episodes so you can watch it in one sitting if you fancy, some people may complain that it drags on for too long, but given how long some series are, I think 12 episodes are pretty good. Overall, I can't say I hated it, it could have been better but it also could have been worse, so I took it for what it was and I wasn't disappointed. It's a simple gore anime with plenty of monsters and a simple (yet not bad) plot twist at the end. For 12 episodes only, it was worth my time.

What attracted me to Blood C was the copious amount of sexy violence, and to see a schoolgirl slaying demons. And I have to say, Blood C does certainly not disappoint when it comes to that, so let me get this over with right away: If you cannot handle blood, gore, people getting torn apart, eaten, bludgeoned or whatever other horrific death you can imagine, this anime is most definetly not for you and you may as well stop...reading now.If you are still with me here, allow me to backtrack a little bit. Blood C is part of the Blood franchise, being preceeded by Blood: The Last Vampire and Blood + and suceeded by Blood: The Last Dark. Now, I have not watched either of the two first ones. From a story perspective it does not matter too much, since there is no direct continuity, however you might hear from many that both Blood: The Last Vampire and Blood + are vastly superior, and I do want to watch those either to verify the veracity of these claims. Forgive my digression, let's continue.[Story: 5/10] The anime follows Kisaragi Saya, a seemingly normal schoogirl, a tad clumsy, somewhat awkward and oblivious to what is going on around her at times, but a cute, friendly person nevertheless. Of course that's not all there is to her, after all I am not reviewing Moe here, so of course she is a badass who slays demons, or Elder Bairns (Furukimono), as the anime refers to them. As the story progresses we learn more about Saya, the demons and the relationship between everything, since not everything is what it seems. The story however, takes its sweet bloody time actually going anywhere, and spends the first 5 or so episodes meandering about, taking a somewhat „monster of the week“-esque approach to its story-telling, which for a 12 episode series is just ridiculous. Which is a shame, because the story is not even that bad, but Blood C shoots itself in the foot by not fucking telling it for almost half of the show. What we get instead are fight scenes (which are the best part of the show) that end in very slightly increasingly ominous ways. The final act a.k.a the last two episodes, then proceeds to show us the characters' true motivations and backgrounds. Like, all of them, including the main bad guy. And the ending, while not bad, forces whomever wants to get some actual fucking closure, to watch the sequel movie. If the show had a more even build-up to its story, it might have been a lot better, but as it is anyone is forgiven for dumping Blood C into a dumpster after the abortion that are the first episodes.[Characters: 5/10] There is no way around this, so I'll be brutally honest, the characters are shit. Except for Saya, and the main baddy, whose name I cannot reveal so as not to spoil the twist at the end, there is no character-development, no one I could empathize with, no motivation that seemed believable... in short nothing positive. The twins are annoying, not cute, not adorable, just annoying and the rest of the gang never escapes the clichés we have all seen before. They don't contribute in the slightest to the story until the very end, so they are of no real importance besides being cannon-fodder. Now, Saya is done fairly well, so is the main baddy, but even there, since the story does not conclude until the end of the subsequent movie, their arcs don't conclude either, which might leave those of you, who don't feel like watching the movie (although, you might as well, if you've come as far, as the last episode) a bit disappointed. I have to be a bit lenient, since the story was not meant to finish there, and the movie does conclude them fairly well, but again, I have to be critical of the characters, who similarly to the story, don't change, don't evolve, until the final act of the anime, with the only arguable exception being Saya.[Art: 6/10] The art and animation are, for the most part good, if unexceptional. The character designs are nothing to write home about, except for the Furukimono, which do look quite nice. Saya's design is cool, no complaints there. The animation does of course stand out gloriously during the glorious fight scenes, which is also where the violence does its merry dance under the spotlight, which is nice. There are a couple of scenes, where the proportions of the characters are jarringly strange, which really caught my eye, but thankfully that is not frequently the case. Overall, the aesthetics are a bit bland, but nothing criminally bad.[Sound: 7/10] The sound was good, everything from the characters' voices to the music is solid with some standouts, like the OP and the main theme. The sound does its job, the music emphasizes the action, smoothes the calm moments, all when needed. Even Saya's little cheery song, which she sings constantly, is cute, and when the story starts showing its tragic side, the song becomes more dissonant adding to her development. The characters' voices add to their personalities and development, but none of them stand out in any way. I have nothing to really complain about here.[Personal Enjoyment: 7/10] As I mentioned in the introductory sentence, I did not watch the show expecting it to be the next Ergo Proxy, I did not expect to be utterly blown away. I wanted blood and gore and a schoolgirl killing stuff with a Katana, which is exactly what I got. I do have a soft-spot for that type of stuff, and if that is what you are looking for, if all you want is some action, that does not require your full mental capacities to follow, you might wanna check out Blood C, and by extension the sequel movie and previous installments. Expect nothing more though, as you will leave disappointed if you do. Also, watch an uncensored version, because otherwise you will be watching a white or black screen for much of the exiting bits, which is annoying, and as I said, if you cannot handle violence, you should not be watching this anime in the first place, since it is incredibly bloody and gory.So, all in all, I was not disappointed. I was annoyed at the first episodes, at the characters and some other minor stuff, which might seem to contradict what I said just now, but I really was not disappointed; I got what I wanted, nothing more, not too much less. The show could definetly have been executed a lot better, if it paced itself more competently, but I do not mourn over it, like some fans of the franchise might. I don't regret watching it, Saya is a badass, whom I enjoyed as a character, some of the music I still listen to at times and I have something to recommend to all those who want some bloody, fun, action and badassery.[6/10] reading now.If you are still with me here, allow me to backtrack a little bit.

This is spoiler free but if you want to read my rant on this anime check my blogpost on my profile.***Story: 6***While the first few episodes are very odd and slow paced, not adding anything significant to the plotline, it's the last (and second last) episode that makes it up. The first five episodes are lengthy and you will feel frustrated because nothing makes really sense storywise, but after that, the pacing gets a bit...better and will pique your interests.However, it's a pity the first half of this series is executed quite badly - since the final episode proves you that the producers/writers know how to write a good story. The potential of a good story is there, but it's the way it has been told that irritates me. Also, there are way too many plotholes.***Art: 7***The art was, in my perspective, nice to look at. It is a feast for my eyes to see 'pretty' characters in a gory, splatter anime. The animations were clean and done well - I have seen animes with much 'lazier' animations.***Sound: 8***The sound was probably one of the best things in Blood-C. The main piano theme is hauntingly beautiful, catchy and very memorable. The opening song was fitting too.***Character: 5***Other than the protagonist, Saya, there were no real character developments overall in the series. The side-characters were so-so and were nothing special at all - except for the twins who kept saying the same things at the same time (yes, I'm talking about THAT 'twin' clichée thing in almost every anime containing twins *eyesroll*) which made them especially annoying.Again, there was quite a potential for some more interesting, in-depth character growth overall. Even though the amount of episodes (12) might not seem enough to do that, I beg to differ, since other animes the same length have handled that better.***Enjoyment: 6***If you are a splatter/gore anime fan, you will enjoy this, since the action is entertaining enough to keep you watching. However, the lack of profound story in the first few episodes can limit your enjoyment of watching Blood-C.***Overall: 6***Overall, I give this anime a solid and fair 6, since it was able to make me want to watch the sequel. The last two episodes are game-changing and reveal so much story that it frustrates me that they threw the potential of a bomb anime away; as already mentioned, the pacing was way off in the beginning and the story overall could have been told better.

The scheme is the same - beautiful scenery, some singing, classes and the last 6 mins- fast battles with demons that doesn\'t look that good graphically in comparison with the anime as a whole (this is until ep 4). BUT then, oh my, prepare for LOTS OF DEATHS....BLOOD EVERYWHERE. There are censored moments for the younger viewers but sometimes i regret that.

She goes from sweet ditzy schoolgirl to badass monster killer at the drop of a hat, and it honestly seems like they are two very different people. Saya is super cute, and her desire to protect everyone is rather endearing, while not being...entirely annoying. Badass Saya is kind of cold hearted, and I wish I saw more of her backstory and personality. She kind of reminds me of Moka Akashiya from Rosario+Vampire actually.Other characters like her various friends at school manage to not detract from the series. They get just enough airtime that I don't find the 'filler' to really be filler. They show the juxtaposition between normal saya and her bizarrely bland and sheltered life with badass Saya who can kill a monster with one blow.Her father and the shop owner do keep me from being completely lulled by her boring day life. They manage to be somewhat unsettling in how they treat her, especially in how they speak to her. I'm not going to get into it however.Things I didn't like were probably the annoying censorship that was super inconsistent and obvious. You see blood in one shot, but they just add the most glaringly obvious white or black bar in another. It kind of defeats its purpose because you still see the gory details anyway since they don't keep the bar up. I dunno, that was real stupid to me.Sometimes the music also did not fit the mood of a scene, and that made scenes feel weird and wrong for no reason. It wasn't the whole series, but some in the beginning especially were like that.In general I am really liking this series. I mean characters and storyline are decent, and I did enjoy the fight scenes a lot.

Pretty much every episode has creatures known as Elder-Bairns dying by the main character, Saya, stabbing them through the face, neck, or slashing them in half with a ""sacred blade"" and also people being brutally killed by the creatures.The first...couple of episodes are repetitive, and it\'s basically monster of the week, but I thought it set up the anime by showing how happy and nice Saya is, and to familiarize the viewer with the cast and Saya\'s duty to kill Elder-Bairns. Saya is a shrine maiden who drinks black coffee every day at a coffee shop named Guimauve and sings on her way to school about how happy her life is. At night, and in later episodes during the day, she goes out to kill Elder-Bairns. It\'s really simple in the beginning, and it\'s what gets people to drop this show after 3 episodes.The story really only appears at the end, where the whole situation with the Elder-Bairns is (for the most part) explained, and Saya and all the other character\'s situations explained. It\'s a bit difficult to understand, but  you can basically piece it together fairly easily despite how weird and unreasonable it all is. There\'s a few parts which may or may not make you feel sad about, but I teared up towards the end.The action is very well done, and the blood part is over exaggerated. Some parts about this show are inconsistent, and small things are forgotten like ""she didn\'t pick up her sword after dropping it"". Sometimes I felt they didn\'t do a good job of animating, especially when the people\'s bodies are all big and the head is so tiny, but other than that it was sleek and smooth. The monsters are sometimes just one color such as a shadow turning into a monster, and a train turning into some white mass of jelly.Overall I rate it good, but I can\'t really pinpoint what makes it good. I doubt YOU will like it, but it\'s worth a try. couple of episodes are repetitive, and it\'s basically monster of the week, but I thought it set up the anime by showing how happy and nice Saya is, and to familiarize the viewer with the cast and Saya\'s duty to kill Elder-Bairns.

The plot was split between hacking n slashing and some cutesy teenager slice of life garbage.  when i started watching this i accepted it wouldn't be a direct incarnation or even a sequel and could just be piggy backing off the name but this anime in all honesty was the biggest let down of the season for me.Seriously do not waste your time on this, it took me less than 2 episodes to know that it was terrible but i went threw with 4 more just to see if they would...twist it into something better. Its tasteless and not worthy of the title. twist it into something better.

They will not understand the unique set up of this story. I give Clamp props for taking this in a new direction as well as giving tribute to the previous Blood franchises.The Story: This is not a usual story for an anime and is actually pretty dark. The basis of the plot is along the lines of the age old theory of Nature vs. Nurture. In the case of this anime, it explores deeply this concept and the psych of a person when their seemly...normal life is shattered over and over. A lot of this is hidden behind happiness and well placed foreshadowing that can easily be missed. It really begs the question of what would happen to a person when all that they are is stripped and all that is left is false memories and people? Also a lot of death. A LOT.Art: Nothing major really. The animation flows well and the fight scenes are well done. Not the best animation I've seen but hey it's not even close the the worse or even the average. It's just like any other Clamp animation and I am okay with that.Sound: The voice acting (I mostly watched dubbed) was well done. The voices matched the characters even if Saya at times was annoying. I'm pretty sure this was on purpose though to showcase the major changes that Saya is experiencing at the time and if you watch the movie it will be more obvious (I was surprised by the difference in tone since the same voice actor was used in both the series and movie). The music blends well with the rest of the anime and though not earth shattering it did not cause awkward moments due to ill-placed timing. The sound effect were spot on as well.Characters: There is not much to say about the characters as they are not explored in-depth really. The only real character that gets development is Saya. She must explore deeply into who she is and question everything that she knows. All the 'main' characters show little development for the purpose of the twist near the end. They appear as normal students and have little sway in the story but that is also on purpose. The only character that needs to have any impact really is Saya and there is a lot to her character if you look. And yes even I found her annoying at times but really how can she not when she is constantly under influence and kept clueless. Oh, and all the extras are creepily disregard as 'human' and treated as livestock basically.Enjoyment: I was scared to watch this anime for a long time because of all the bad things I have heard. I actually saw the movie first and enjoyed it then bought both on sale. I think I might enjoy this because of the fact that I was a Psychology major. All the human conflict and motives intrigued me. I have followed the Blood franchise for a long time and each new series had a different take on Saya. I sort of felt a connection between this series and some of the others. The uniform in the memories (and the beginning of the movie) is close to the original and a sense that Saya has been around for a long time but has been involved in both Japan and America also hints to the original plot.Overall: I would not write this anime off easily. It's actually pretty deep and really dark and disturbing. It made me think hard. I also watched the movie which brought back the 'real' Saya after her experiences in the series. I would recommend both but caution to not bunch it together with all the other Blood series because it is different. This story explores more of a mental battle while still providing killing of the usual 'monsters'. The movie is actually closer to the old Blood series well still focusing on how the events in the series is now effecting Saya as she seeks revenge. normal life is shattered over and over.

I'm just going to be straight forward outside of the live action Last Vampire movie so I can't say if this is better then any of those entries I can however say it's better then the live action version of Last Vampire tho and I am a big fan of this version of the franchise.This series is a co-production between female manga group CLAMP who are the team behind the hit series xxxHolic and Production I.G who worked on the world famous Ghost In The Shell. The animation is done by Production I.G and if you've seen of there work regardless of what series it is then you'll know that they always do top notch animation. In my opinion tho the animation in this show isn't the companies best don't get me wrong it's really good but tho there are alot of times where the animation just looks cheap and poorly done.I have to say that there is a fairly solid twist that happens near the end of the series i'm not going to spoiler what it is but I will say that you'll want to keep an eye of Saya's friends. For me this twist works because it's something that you don't see coming and that's what a great twist should be like it should be something that you don't see coming and this twist actually has an impact on the plot of the show as well.I have to talk about our main character Saya even tho she is indeed a bada*s she also has the personality of a piece of paper. I'm not even kidding there's nothing to this character outside of the fact that she fights monsters and is sometimes late for school which lets be honest that last point is typical anime lead character but there's nothing that defines her as a character she's just a bland hero and that's a shame because she's the person we're meant to be rooting for so you'd think that the creative team would put some effort into giving her this thing called a personality.Not only is there a great plot twist there's also a twist on who the villain of the show is and unlike the first twist the shows does leave a few clues here and there as to who the villain of the show is. I will grant people this there not big clues all they'll do is show the villain from behind but it's still something because then you have something to go of and the episodes dealing with those reveals are honestly some of the best that the show has to offer.Something which I kind of noticed and it's the oddest thing but if there's a girl and she happens to be someone who's going to make it to the end then chances are there going to have a large chest. Now granted this isn't true for the twins but for the vast majority they have large boobs and a few of them make it out of the series alive surely I cannot be the only one who's noticed this please tell me there's someone else as well.In my personal opinion I think that the series is one long prequel to the movie since the Saya we meet in the movie is alot different from the one that we meet at the start of this series. If that is the case which given that the two were produced at the same time it very well could be then it seems weird to me that there would be hours of prolog just for one two hour movie if anything it would have made sense for the movie to have a separate storyline and for the anime to have two seasons.Now it is said that this version of the Blood franchise takes in the same world as xxxHolic because the character of Dog is meant to be another character from xxxHolic and they even have the same voice actors. I will say tho that's as far as the connection really goes they don't outright say that the two exist in the same world be merely make a suggestion that they do and for that works because i've never seen xxxHolic and given how many anime series that franchise has i'm not going to anytime soon.This is a horror anime so that means that we have to talk about the horror aspects of the show in terms of scares simply out there's nothing that scary well I say that but if you've not seen that many horror films then you might find this series scary but if you've seen alot of horror films and shows then your not going to be scared by this show. There is however alot of gore and when I say alot I mean alot like the people in this show must be filled with alot of blood because when they get ripped open alot of it comes gushing out and while it can be awesome it does get a bit boring after a while.Overall this isn't a bad series but it does have alot of problems mostly because for alot of the series run it feels like an average episode of Power Rangers in that the villain sends a monster to attack our main hero every week which is what the villain of this show does every episode but it's also an entertaining series so it gets a 6 out of 10 from me. the characters in this show are cast perfectly but I do have some bias because i'm more familiar with the dub.This is the third entry into the Blood franchise with the other two being Blood The Last Vampire , Blood+ and the live action version of Blood The Last Vampire.

The story of Blood + was focused on Saya slaying Chiropteras which were depicted as vampires while in the story of Blood-C was about Saya slaying Ayakashis aka ""The Aged Ones"". Blood-C was the worst of the Blood Franchise and possibly one of the worst animes around. Clamp was not best suited to create this anime. Blood-C\'s genre is mainly Supernatural bullcrap about Ayakashi which was completely different to its predecessor Blood+ which was Sci-Fi/Supernatural. Although the anime\'s story failed at every turn, the Main Character was undeniably prettier than the previous anime Main Character.

It does pull of a very ""monster of the day"" quality, but in the same vein, it captures a life of Saya we had not previously viewed as Blood fans.If this is your first entry to the Blood series, then I hope you realize what you are in for. This series is chalk full of nightmare fuel. After finishing it in one sitting, I had to think about what I saw because it jarred me for a while. I was pretty shaky about it, especially in the...last episodes. Having grown a little since then, I realized that this is probably the most gory anime I have seen. If you do so happen to make it to finish all the episodes, I applaud you. I never quit what I start, so I was determined to watch this anime and give it a fair shot.After finishing this anime, you are left with anger and resentment. The movie clears up a lot of that, leaving you with a happy feeling that is odd coming from a gory anime. However, this anime does give you a sense of what has been missing from the Blood series for quite some time.Saya is powerful as ever, but that has never been a problem. It\'s her humanity that we see, and how she is so trusting to everyone around her. We see a side of her that we know will someday snap, so we keep watching. The Elder Bairns are frightening, and I give the writers credit for making me shaky. Imagine fighting those, and going home to sing like Saya does. Her dual nature is astounding.I think what makes it so intriguing is how they portray her. She is like an on/off switch, and can snap at any second. It\'s deadly how scary it is. Perhaps the true fear and nightmare fuel in this anime is how scary Saya is. She really does feel like a killer, but a good one at that.There is one scene in particular that gave me nightmare fuel, which is in the last episode. I am sure you will see it and feel the same. Let\'s just say, it involves very badly deaths of humans and made me think on it for days. I lay awake in bed one morning just pondering it like, ""God. How scary.""I dunno, it\'s usually the visuals that startle me. But I have grow more immune to it, mostly because I want to be brave in anime. There are tons of animes out there to witness, and I don\'t want to hold back because of fear.If you are squeamish and hate blood, then you probably won\'t like this. Give it a shot, watch one episode. If you are not feeling it, back out and watch a fluffy anime to feel better. But don\'t miss out on this anime if you like it.

The last episode actually kept me wanting more but it ended, what the hell.   The entire series had no plot or substance, the author waited to the end to make you get into the series.

The show could have had more episodes in it because it was too quick.I loved the voice actress who portrayed Saya. It really brought out the character. The art, by CLAMP is of course, amazing! Although I have to say its too gory for my taste. Way more gory than Blood+ for sure. I'm only giving it a 9 for the sound because they really got the bone crushing, pulling apart limbs from limbs, and chewing sound...down. Also I loved the music :)I'd recommend this anime to viewers who love bloody anime, a quick storyline, loves CLAMP artwork, a lot of action, and doesn't mind having a few nightmares. down.

The amazing thing about Blood Franchise is the stories are always packed with almost all elements needed for an amazing and very interesting story. There is supernatural, drama, a little bit of romance, psychological, mystery, suspense-thriller, and tons of actions. Plus, it is about a female in action. I just love stories about female in actions, particularly girls with katana or...a sword for that matter which I really love. And because it is supernatural it is very mysterious. The mysteries keep on piling up with every episode which make the story absolutely exciting and interesting. And because of that, the revelations at the end is very anticipating and worth the wait. There is a lot difference from Blood+; from the story to characters to the animation. The story is more mysterious, dramatic, psychological, and a lot more gruesome or there’s more blood. Well, the title is blood so it is given that every new adaptation would have more blood than the usual. However, because of its mysteriousness the storyline can be really confusing. Well, the story is made by CLAMP which is known for their very confusing yet so damn interesting storyline and plot. Their work can be really confusing but in an amazing and brilliant way.About the CHARACTERSAside from the main character, literally all the characters are very much mysterious and so interesting. There’s even an important character that you wouldn’t understand if you are not a CLAMP works follower or if you don’t know the series which the character is from. As always, that character crosses over in this series as it is a very well-known trademark of CLAMP.  Characters that crosses over to many different series is one of the most amazing and brilliant work of CLAMP. With all the confusion with the story, his character somehow can be considered as an assurance about the revelations later. In the previous Blood franchise, all the monsters looked almost alike but this time it varies with so many kinds.About SAYACompared to the previous protagonists, Saya is cheerful and naïve to what really is happening around her. More than being so mysterious, she’s the most confusing of all because even after people die she can just have a nice coffee or sing a song or say good morning the next day. It is pitying and pretty irritating that bodies are keep piling up around her and let it happen even while watching. It is not very heroic at all considering she keeps on mumbling that she promised that she would protect everyone. She would make some cool moves right after everyone is dead which is extremely useless. AND SO I THOUGHT………………. It turned out that she’s the most pitying of all. There’s nothing more horrifying than finding out that everything you knew was just one hell of a lie. And what’s even worse, she is just being played by literally all the people she thought she knew.About the ANIMATIONThe animation is the best so far among all the Blood Franchise. It is very latest and you really can feel that it is very now. The fight scenes are just heart-pounding and so amazing. That’s one of many reasons why I love Blood Franchise. For someone who has been following CLAMP works for so many years, somehow I practically guessed that the characters are designed by them even before knowing it. You can definitely feel that it is their work. And the characters are probably one of the most gorgeous characters I’ve ever seen.Let me just say that waiting for another work from the franchise is so damn worth the wait. Blood Franchise never ceases to amaze me. It can be really confusing for almost all parts of the whole series but let me tell you that the revelations at the end is just so worth it. This is one of the amazing things about CLAMP’s stories; they will give you so much mixed emotions with their work and later will amaze you with its true plot. With the combination of the two most successful in the world of anime and manga, Blood Franchise and CLAMP definitely brought us an elevated anime experience. With a very irritating ending because of the villains getting away, the movie is genuinely anticipating. a sword for that matter which I really love.

I finished this only because I just went with the flow, seeing where it was going and how it could possibly end. But the writer seemed to make it look like he was making it up as he went along, because the concept I was getting throughout the time I was watching it was completely changed in the last episode. I enjoyed the idea that was going but the problem was breaking the flow at the end,...then leading onto the movie (that I still need to watch at this time). But if I was to mention good points about the Anime, it would be the extreme blood, painting the walls.  Even though in the last scene it just takes the whole thing to a stupid level. I would only recommend this to people who just want to see people bleed to dead and getting limbs ripped off. then leading onto the movie (that I still need to watch at this time).

(Can't say anything else otherwise it'll be ruined)......At first I blamed her appearence in the town on everyone, then her friends and the I managed to pin point who was responsible for it all and kept on watching. turns out I was partially right and partially wrong.the story line itself is quite confusing to me but I didn't have to watch any of the episodes over again to understand it. I do think its a bit rushed though and should of been extended. As it only has 12 Episodes and we start to learn the truth about Saya near the end in episode 11 it makes the other episodes seem a little bit pointless to me, only because I would of started revealing more in episode 8 if the series was only 12 episodes long . but I guess that's for you to decide and not me.The series is amazing but I wish I could of seen a few more episodes and less blurs over dead bodies as ive seen it all before and because of this i have to give this series a 4 star rating.

There is a lot of blood and gore and weird moments that can and probably will make your skin crawl, heart pound, and head scream.Story: The story is an interesting one. I don't really want to give it a summary because that I feel that it won't do the show any justice. It's 12 episodes of monsters and blood and gore and happy school days, but the last 2 episodes some crazy stuff starts to happen.Art: The visuals are very nice in the show. They're very consistent and they nothing really seemed out of place...at all during the series. The blood and deaths are animated well, almost too well. The fights aren't terrible but they can be lackluster.Sound: This show introduced me to my favorite opening theme I've ever heard. The ending sounds very good too but it still doesn't hold a candle to the opening in my opinion. The music in the show is great. There were about 3 prevalent tracks that set the mood and tone to the situation very well. The sound however was a little weird. When Saya, the main character hits things with her sword it doesn't sound right and its a little too loud for the most part. It only sounds satisfying when she lands the slices instead of bouncing off the target.Characters: The characters are all kind of boring and don't get much screen time aside from the MC, which plays to the advantage of the end of the show. There isn't much development until the end though. It was a good move for what the show is but it left me with a dry taste in my mouth about the whole thing.Overall I enjoyed the show. I indulged my inner masochist that wanted to cringe at the horrible and brutal deaths and bone chilling, blood curdling screams. Don't go in expecting something amazing, but go in expecting a monster blood fest with some weird stuff going on and it should turn out ok for you. at all during the series.

While it does have its moments, the pacing of the story feels rushed. Additionally, I was disappointed by the portrayal of Saya in the ending. It seems as if the anime prioritizes gore over proper pacing, which is a shame. However, I could be overthinking things.With that said, the story itself is decent enough. It has its moments and can be engaging at times, but the pacing issues do detract from the overall experience. On the other hand, I do appreciate the art style of the anime, which is visually pleasing and adds to the...overall atmosphere.It seems that the overall opinion of viewers and readers is split down the middle, with some enjoying it while others are left disappointed.

You can see this title, as the weak copy of Blood +, which no one needs.In this work, the creators set themselves up.I understand what they tried, but the implementation was incredibly sluggish and boring. Episode 1-9 have all been set up for the twist in episode 10. Yes, the twist was not bad, I expected less. The movie that ended the series later was also fine. But the 10 episodes you have to struggle through are...simply not worth it.The fights are boring, monotonous and dragging on. She fights every Monster for moments, gets beaten up, before she transforms and defeats it in 5 sec.  The animation of the fights got worse and worse from fight to fight, they got good animations at the start. The dialogues were horror (understandable for some characters). And there wasn\'t a single interesting character. The main protagonist was going to dring caffe each day, sing a song (1 min) on the way to school and do nothing for the other 50% time of the episode (expect maybe fighting someting).In the sense, I\'m skipping all the criteria here. You can hardly say anything about the work. They have implemented the genre as best as possible for these circumstances. The story was only good after the twist.

It is worse than genuinely poor & talentless attempts at animation. This is simply due to the fact that it daringly wastes your time with tiny bits of bait in the middle of the episode luring you with microscopic rays of possible excitement. There was literally 1 second -- and no I\'m not exaggerating here -- of captivating or immersive animation throughout the entire episode and there was also exactly one moment of something even resembling character development for the main character, except it amounted to nothing.If you absolutely...must watch this show, watch a montage or clip assembly on YouTube or skim through literally everything until you get to the ""desired bits"".

What I appreciate about the anime is how it subtly hints at something being abnormal while maintaining a facade of normalcy. It demonstrates the ""how"" of events without delving into the ""why,"" leaving viewers intrigued.Watching Saya\'s journey can be unsettling due to her lack of awareness about her surroundings, yet despite the anxiety it evokes, I found myself unable to look away, eagerly anticipating the unraveling of the mystery. The monsters are impressively designed,...drawing from a blend of Lovecraftian and Japanese mythological influences.While the final two episodes neatly tie up the loose ends,  some may argue that the show occasionally indulges in unnecessary violence. I was particularly impressed by how the main characters undermine Saya\'s values, almost as if they\'re mocking both her and the audience for becoming invested in the story, which adds a unique dimension to the narrative. drawing from a blend of Lovecraftian and Japanese mythological influences.While the final two episodes neatly tie up the loose ends,  some may argue that the show occasionally indulges in unnecessary violence.

She's your average high school girl just looking for friends, and loves helping her father at his shrine... Or does she? Or is she? Wait, what are we talking about? The first few episodes (and I'm feeling generous) just DRAG on with the SAME format over and over. I have to admit, while watching the said 'first few episodes' I was playing a game,...but in my defense, I went back and re-watched them because I thought I was going crazy. It went something like this:Girl loves dad, girl sings song about loving dad, girl goes to cafe, girl is late for school, girl talks with friends for an extended period of time, girl watches someone die, girl kills bad guy, girl wakes up in bed. Rinse and repeat 10 times, and congrats! You made it just in time for the last 2 episodes.There really isn't a ton to say about the episodes before the last couple, but it essentially boils down to this: none of the characters have ANY depth at all, which would make sense if they have succeeded in their ambitious Truman Show angle, but they didn't. Saya gets constant visions of a conglomerate of stuff, and a narrator who is giving us useless riddles. But as it just so happens, none of it is going to make sense. None of it is hinting to a particular ending. If Blood+ had any important information, feel free to let me know, because the measly 12 episodes felt like years with how hard my head was spinning. Don't get me wrong, I love a good twist ending, but when nothing else has any substance, it really felt like I should have just watched the ending and called it a day.So why mixed feelings? Truly, the worst part was the plot (you mean the most important part? yeah.) the soundtrack is fine, the intro and outro are quite nice and the combat was FUN. The MC's actions were quite inconsistent, but when she was fighting, it was enjoyable.All in all I'd give it a boring/10. I feel like it could have been good, but the producers were trying to do too much at once. A 10 episode build up would make more sense for something with more time, but that just didn't happen. The result? Boring characters, a confusing plot with little substance, and a ridiculous ending. but in my defense, I went back and re-watched them because I thought I was going crazy.

The other characters really delivered a punch and impact into the plot.We have the lovely CLAMP universe crossover, the dog, which plays a ""big role"" but sadly NOTHING gets explained as to how the dog helped and what the secrets behind this xxxHoLiC crossover was.

This was a disappointment.The sound unfortuantely sounds like their budget got cut in half, every fight scene used the same damn annoying music that really gave it a 90\'s throwback of poor fightscene music.

Kanokon has returned to assault our senses and kill brain cells with its ridiculous story and characters.  Chances are if you really liked the original then the boobs and fan service will be just more for you to love.  Though if you hated it, then there is nothing here to make you change your mind.The OVA retains the spirit of the original, as far as being a borderline hentai, however while the first series at least had a rudimentary storyline this has basically no plot at all.  Most of the time specials and OVA\'s that spinoff a full...series revolve around fan service and place the characters in echii situations.  Though with the original being so extreme it’s hard to see how they could have taken it any farther.  Nothing of substance ever has in the story though.  There are absolutely zero plot or character developments from the original.  A number of side stories do go on around the main characters and the one revolving around Akane and Tayura is more interesting than anything that happens between the key cast.Chizuru continues her molestation/rape of the shota target Kouta.  The ""story"" unfolds too solely to remove Chizuru\'s clothes or to have her rub Kouta\'s face between her boobs.  Kouta is typically shocked and dismayed every time she ""makes"" him look at her naked body.  Honestly why at this point he is even bothered by seeing her naked is probably the most unbelievable aspect of the series.The only character that really stands out is Chizuru.  I did find her pretty amusing most of the time.  Though I still can’t really find any reason why she is so attracted to Kouta, but it is pretty amusing the way she has to fend off all of her rivals.  Kouta remains as one of my most hated characters.  This is mainly because he looks and acts like such a wimp.  While this is not a shocking development in these kind of stories, he is so unmanly and looks like a small boy that it makes all the echii situations and romantic elements seem outright indecent and illegal.Fans of Nozomu are likely to be disappointed with this show as her role is extremely small and she rarely even speaks.  Considering she was the primary rival from the first series I thought this was pretty odd.  On the bright side though she is naked for practically every one of her scenes.  Fans of loli boobs rejoice!  The remaining supporting cast is mostly forgettable and uninteresting with the exception of the aforementioned Akane and Tayura.  I did like their little burgeoning romance together and it was probably the only thing believable and interesting thing to come out of the story.The artwork and animation is overall pretty good.  I would normally go higher for a score for this but the character design for Kouta is that annoying and frustrating for me that I just can’t give it any higher than I did.  Besides our childlike lead, the rest of the characters are pretty cute and well drawn.  Chizuru\'s measurements are a bit over the top and if you like big curvy girls then you’re probably going to enjoy Kanokon R\'s visuals.Kanokon R does feature a very good seiyuu cast.  They do the best they can to make this as watchable as it can possibly be with what they had to work with.  The music is also a bright spot overall for the series.If you totally loved the original Kanokon then you likely will want to watch this.

Kidou Senshi Gundam MS IGLOO: 1-nen Sensou Hiroku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1917/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_MS_IGLOO__1-nen_Sensou_Hiroku,"[""What an unexpected gem this was! A true find among Gundam series. I started this with no expectations and was amazed that this OVA was so good in almost every respect.Story and CharactersThe year is Universial Century 0079. The series is mostly seen through the eyes of Oliver May, a technical officer in the Zeon 603rd Technical Evaluation Unit , in charge of testing new military technology. Stationed in the Jotunheim, a civilian transport ship that was converted into military use, Oliver must head into battle and experience the One Year War, only this time from the perspective of a weapon tester who struggles to...make an impact on an evolving war during changing times.The 3 OVAs tell stories of 3 different weapons and their technical champions. The first is about a mass cannon who quickly finds a champion in the Jotunheim's gunnery master. The second is a tank which showcases its best power in the hands of an experienced artillery instructor who has a little bit of a drug problem. Finally there is the Zudah mobile suit piloted by a handsome war hero, but all is not what it seems to be.If I had to rate the OVAs separately, I would have to say the second episode as a standalone would deserve a 10, with the other two being between 8.5 and 9.The way the plot played through was very good. Each character had their point of view and was fully fleshed out in a very short period of time. I got to like them all very quickly and before I knew it I was emotionally involved. It's the characters more than the weaponary that makes this series great, even though the protagonist(s) all have an affinity and passion for their favorite weapon. Let's just say shedding tears is possible during Gundam.Art/AnimationCGI type similar to Final Fantasy Spirits Within/Advent Children. Some details are unbelievable (can see individual eyelashes and strands of hair) while others look very obviously CGI'd (repetitive explosions) which seem chunky and blocky. Overall, this was well done compared to most of the older gundam series which has dated animation. The animation is more of a personal preference as to whether you like the CGI or cell drawings.SoundSound was the weakest part of this anime. Voice acting was good but music was so so. Except every time they play that sad violin music the viewer gets so well trained that they inevitably expect someone else to die ...EnjoymentI was very surprised by how good this OVA was and thoroughly enjoyed it.

You can\'t catch up to the worlds largest fool?""There was so much that could have gone right with this series.If I was to sum up MS IGLOO, the words that would be best used to describe it are ""It was a complete disaster"".The concept sounded promising, a re-telling of the One Year War from the Zeon\'s perspective. Sounds great, I mean, finally we get to hear what the One Year War was like from the Zeon\'s point of view. Already you have me hooked, I mean we\'ve seen what it was like from Amuro\'s point of view in the original Mobile Suit Gundam,...8th MS Team showed us how the One Year War was for a group of conventional Mobile Suit pilots and 0080 effectively shows us how the war is for a little child. So when I found out about this series, I couldn\'t pass up the opportunity to hear what the Zeon\'s thought of it.Oh what a bad move that was.If there is one positive from this OVA\'s story, it\'s that we at least get some backstory on Operation British and the Battle of Loum (aka Char\'s big moment when he destroyed 5 Magellan Class battleships, and when Mobile Suits where first used in actual combat) but aside from that? Nothing. The story is a complete and total shambles, in fact I\'d be hard pressed to call weapons testing a story when placed in a meta-series that is thick with mythology.Its not that MS IGLOO\'s story is bad; it\'s terrible. An episodic series about weapons testing does not work in a series that has become well known for its large scale mech battles; and to be honest its not like the story would be able to stand on its own two feet as a completely stand-alone series either, the reason? It doesn\'t have its own two feet to stand on, it constantly tries to place itself in the Gundam continuity and fails. Another problem that the series has is its evident lack of character development, even if it is an episodic series, a lack of character development is inexcusable. If I wanted a show where the characters are worse than wafer-thin cardboard cut outs I\'d just go off and re-watch the entirety of the crap half of Tsubasa Chronicle. But I\'ll get onto the characters later.Now the interesting thing about MS IGLOO, is its decision to put the entire series in CG, if done right, this could have worked so well for Sunrise and Gundam in general. I mean, can you imagine? CG Gundam eh? Now THAT sounds like something special, definitely would have put an interesting spin on things. But no, Sunrise managed to completely squander that opportunity as well. The character models in CG look awkward and flat, here\'s an example, they look like a bunch of rejects from Final Fantasy The Spirits Within and even that film had the decency to opt for photo-realism. As for the Mobile Suits? Hah, don\'t make me laugh. Try imagining a bad looking game from the PS2, imagining it? Now think about how bland and flat the textures in that game looked and then compare that to the Mobile Suits in MS IGLOO, done that? That bad looking game from the PS2 era doesn\'t look so bad now does it?I suppose that when they\'re actually in motion they at least look the part, the one benefit about those bland Mobile Suit models is that they at least animate smoothly, the same can\'t be said for the characters though, I mean we have a salute here and there and odd bit of walking now and then, but most of the time they stay in one place at one time, Sunrise can\'t even create the illusion that these CG models look even remotely good. Talk about a wasted opportunity.The voice acting in MS IGLOO is appalling. There is no other word that I can use for it without going into obscenities and its never a good idea to use too many of them in one place. Hideo Ishikawa may have managed to impress people as Itachi Uchiha and Juushirou Ukitake, but in MS IGLOO, he sucks. Voice acting tends to make a character more convincing, of all the characters, Oliver May manages to at least make some sort of impact but that doesn\'t mean he\'s good. However the real cretin of the voice cast is Miki Nagasawa, I\'ve heard bad voices and I\'ve heard annoying voices, very rarely though do I ever see a cross between the two. Nagasawa is unforgivably bad, her Monique being one of the most annoying female characters I\'ve ever had the displeasure of viewing on my computer monitor, I actually felt bad for the poor thing; no not Nagasawa\'s character, the computer monitor, there were a few occasions that I swear it was going to start breaking down on me because of how bad she is.If I was able to say anything about the characters, it would be...they certainly know how to leave an impression, and no that isn\'t a good thing. They are hard to watch, a lot of the time I felt like giving up on MS IGLOO because of how bad it was, and the characters are the main cause for it - at no point do you ever feel a connection with them, they\'re just there, on your screen, wasting your valuable time, I could have accomplished so much in the time it took me to watch an episode of MS IGLOO, something that would have actually been productive rather than wasting goodness knows how many minutes/hours on this travesty that I know I will never get back.At the end of the day, it\'s easy to say that MS IGLOO is one of the worst Gundam side stories available, it fails at being a re-telling from Zeon\'s perspective, it fails at being a stand-alone series, it fails at making you connect with the characters and it fails at showing weapon testing, its original aim.If this was the first Gundam series you watched, I feel sorry for you. You wasted time, and probably got a sour taste in your mouth of what is usually an excellent mecha show, you\'re better off forgetting this disaster and going off watching something that\'s actually good in the Universal Century like 8th MS Team or indeed the original Mobile Suit Gundam. I\'m pretty sure most long time Gundam fans will agree that this is definitely ranking up there as one of the worst Gundam series out there.And to those who have actually watched and enjoyed this series, I have to ask: Are you mental? 8th MS Team showed us how the One Year War was for a group of conventional Mobile Suit pilots and 0080 effectively shows us how the war is for a little child. So when I found out about this series, I couldn\'t pass up the opportunity to hear what the Zeon\'s thought of it.Oh what a bad move that was.If there is one positive from this OVA\'s story, it\'s that we at least get some backstory on Operation British and the Battle of Loum (aka Char\'s big moment when he destroyed 5 Magellan Class battleships, and when Mobile Suits where first used in actual combat) but aside from that? Nothing. The story is a complete and total shambles, in fact I\'d be hard pressed to call weapons testing a story when placed in a meta-series that is thick with mythology.Its not that MS IGLOO\'s story is bad; it\'s terrible. An episodic series about weapons testing does not work in a series that has become well known for its large scale mech battles; and to be honest its not like the story would be able to stand on its own two feet as a completely stand-alone series either, the reason? It doesn\'t have its own two feet to stand on, it constantly tries to place itself in the Gundam continuity and fails. Another problem that the series has is its evident lack of character development, even if it is an episodic series, a lack of character development is inexcusable. If I wanted a show where the characters are worse than wafer-thin cardboard cut outs I\'d just go off and re-watch the entirety of the crap half of Tsubasa Chronicle. But I\'ll get onto the characters later.Now the interesting thing about MS IGLOO, is its decision to put the entire series in CG, if done right, this could have worked so well for Sunrise and Gundam in general.

He is a member of the 603rd Technical Evaluation Unit and stationed on the Jotunheim. Over the course of the three part OVA, Oliver and the rest of the main crew of the Jotunheim are joined by one new character each episode and a new weapon to accompany them. Each weapon is tested and evaluated by the crew of the Jotunheim with often tragic endings.The CG animation is fairly good, but when compared to recent animated features it doesn't...shine as much as it could have. It was released as a part of the Gundam 25th anniversary. The characters look fairly realistic, but this certainly isn't the cream of the crop in regards to CG animation. Overall it is fairly well done.The Opening song is decent, nothing spectacular, but you can hardly judge a show on it's opening song. The rest of the music is produced by an orchestra, and does a decent job of heightening the mood or tension of the moment. Some of the music is repeated over the course of the OVA, but as it is short there is no cause for concern. The voice acting is generally well done with the exception of one character. The only Asian character on the show, his crying scene is painful and he fails to show any emotion realistically.The characters of the show are very nicely fleshed out over the course of the show. Although short, this OVA does a very nice job of developing the characters and nobody comes off as particularly flat. The character models are fairly realistic and their motions are very realistic. No complaints about the characters.I enjoyed this OVA and as the first Gundam that I have completed I was pleasantly surprised by the direction the story took. It was nice to see the story told from Zeon's side and I look forward to the sequel: Apocalypse 0079. As a prequel to the original Gundam it does a nice job of introducing the development of the Mobile Suits, as well as the propaganda, and conflicts that will be featured in the Universal Century storyline. shine as much as it could have.

This was a complete mess. From every standpoint. The CGI doesn't hold up at all. Everything looks like a bad PS2 cutscene. The facial expressions where so exaggerated at times I bursted out laughing.The story is non existent. Because this is supposed to show us the OYW thru Zeon's eyes I thought we would get to know the principalty and it's people better. Nah. Just a couple of battles only from Zeon's POV. The episodes are so boring when it's not being funny by accident because of how incompetent...it is.The only good thing about this is the Mobile Suits in action, they're the only part where the animation is actually pretty cool and ejoyable. Sadly this only happens in the last couple of minutes of every episode. In a brighter side, it's only 3 episodes long, so it won't be too insuferable like the 47 episodes from ZZ. it is.The only good thing about this is the Mobile Suits in action, they're the only part where the animation is actually pretty cool and ejoyable.

Yes, the animation is old ""Butt Ugly Martians"" style, but this is as good as its gonna get for a tv show in 2004. Each episode focuses on a different experimental Zeon weapon that undergoes live combat testing during the event of the One Year War.The suits and battles still hold up, and has one of the best opening songs in Gundam.

Whole things fine. If you really like Gundam, I'd definitely recommend this. If you kind of like Gundam, kinda casual interest, this is a solid pass. It follows some dudes in a ship on the Zeon side and their mission. It is only 3 episodes but like, not only is it just kind of meh, as I stated earlier, the animation is on par with a cutscene from Halo 2. Its all CG, like super bad ultra shit ass CG lol. Kinda cool ig, but it's not that interesting and honestly I don't really recommend it unless...you are already really interested in Gundam. Also if you haven't yet, watch Turn A lol. you are already really interested in Gundam. Also if you haven't yet, watch Turn A lol."", 'I don\'t usually write reviews, but MS IGLOO was such a positive surprise that I couldn\'t help myself.Gundam is a delicate franchise. The original 70\'s tv animation layed out a profile to what Gundam should be which would be followed for many years until the introduction of alternative universes, which would then go their own way and do their own thing (arguably not straying too far away from its origins in the end). Because of that, a show that steers away from the Gundam formula (especially taking place in UC) isn\'t particularly going to please fans, not to mention a fully 3D animated one.Well,...what is Gundam, then? Gundam is massive franchise that, although carries the title of ""first \'real robot\' show"", is essentially a relatively grounded fantasy war story. What mostly set it apart in my opinion wasn\'t the way robots fuctioned, but it\'s depiction of war, its psychological effects on soldiers and civilians and its political implications....with some ""shounen fantasy heroic storytelling meant to sell toys"" sprinkled on top.MS IGLOO is to me the odd\'s one\'s out, but a very sucessful one at that. I don\'t mean to say it\'s the most revolutionary Gundam show ever or a complete 180 degree turn, but it\'s a very refreshing take on Gundam. If what excites you the most about Gundam are little details in the story and the way it\'s presented that make you feel like you\'re a small part of a real war taking place, than I suggest you give MS IGLOO a try.Let\'s get the elephant out of the way. Yes, the show is fully animated in 3D. In 2004. Does it look rough at points? Sure. But it can also look incredible. It clearly didn\'t have the time or budget necessary to make it look as good as it possibly could, but it\'s far from being unfinished or unpolished. The universe in MS IGLOO is filled with subtle movement: a slight head tilt, a small lip frown. It is also filled with big movements: full-on rage fits, contorted faces. While not everything looks great, you can tell that Sunrise didn\'t see this as a port from 2D to 3D; the show is built from the ground up as a fully functional 3D work — and it shows. From the get-go you know this isn\'t your usual Gundam presentation, but at the same time it feels weirdly fitting. Those usual Gundam characters (the captains, the tech guys, the soldiers, the commanders) are all finally alive. It is true the show does have its share of uncanny valley discomforts, but the animation gives body language and history to those people at the forefront of war. The people fighting this war are real people, and this 3D encarnation of Gundam gives us what the 2D animation hinted at.While one can\'t say the human characters look amazing all the time (mostly uncanny valley\'s fault rather than the animation itself, although that has its own hiccups as well), it\'s hard to deny that the robots move and feel like they\'re at the top of their game. The robots in MS IGLOO feel like menacingly heavy yet combat-ready agile gigantic pieces of metal. This is crucial to this story, which is essentially about how Zeon realised the future of war is in mobile suits and other forms of technology fall behind on performance and efficiency.I guess what I\'m trying to say is that the robots are cool. Just straight-up badass stuff. MS IGLOO has some of my favorite mecha action scenes ever. All fights feel so full of meaning and narrative. In every little movement we can tell what kind of pilot is behind the buttons and the context in which an encounter affects the overall state of the One Year War as well as what brought it to life — all of that being told by the animation itself only.All of these new perspectives the new style of animation brings could fall apart if the sound wasn\'t on pair, but oh boy, how it is. Rarely ever do we get to hear the pure violence of the Gundam universe as well as here. Metal war giants clashing with each other while holding a single small fragile pilot inside; the speed of their thrusters shaking the whole structure to the point of pulling pieces off — all of this is perfectly matched with probably the most realistic sound design ever in Gundam. Not only in the big battle scenes, but also in the small movements, as for such the texture of these pilots suits as they move.In general, visual and sound come together to portray the very interesting early stages of technology advancement in the Gundam universe. There\'s a roughness to it that is perfectly found in the presentation. One shot that stood out to me is simple one: a tank-like mobile armor treading through some very rough soil, as the tank\'s camera and pilot\'s cabin shake to the point of allowing an enemy attack to be done in an instant without the pilot noticing, thus proving to us the sort of alarming state these soldiers have to be in at all times.I mentioned previously that this show is not your usual Gundam formula. There is no shounen protagonist here, in fact there\'s barely a protagonist at all. There are only a handful of new mecha being introduced, as most of them are reocurring mechs from the original Gundam show being carefully used in the story.But most of all, there\'s a sensibility to war\'s reality here that is found on the usual Gundam show, but scattered throughout many episodes of silly hero vs. enemy grunt battles.Here we have a pilot defensive about older non-mobile suit weaponry because that\'s what he battled on for so many years and sympathizes with the underdog quality they\'ve acquired, as he himself feels out of place as many younger non experienced pilots pass on the exam to pilot mobile suits — but he is unaible to.We also have a nation spending their precious war budget on propaganda of a new weapon during a time of low morale and loss of hope, even thought the new hot weapon is objectively worse than current in-use ones, showing us that they see troop and civilian morale as an equally important factor as fire power.MS IGLOO feels different, but it does not betray Gundam, no — it feels like a welcoming complement to what Gundam has always been but never showed as clearly as here. It is baffling to me how this obviously expansive and risky show got made. I doubt it upped toy sales or even served as a leading bridge to other Gundam shows. Even so, MS IGLOO is very clearly made for fans (with many winks and cameos that make our hearts jump at the screen). But I warn you — not every fan will be able to enjoy this. I, however, have been positively surprised by a very well directed small addition to the Gundam universe that lacks in polish here and there, but presents an ultimately solid and refreshing view on our beloved never-ending war drama. what is Gundam, then?

Kishin Houkou Demonbane (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1067/Kishin_Houkou_Demonbane_TV,"[""This anime is a bit too complicated for me. I don't know if it's just because I'm slow or what, but it had so many complicated terms and side stories I can barely catch up.I did like the concept behind it. It was interesting, talking about grimoires and sorcery and combat, etc. but as I've said it tends to become complicated. The story is good, the execution, not so much. For one thing, there were way too many characters, and some of them popped up out of nowhere, in the middle of the story, making things more complicated. I ended the series without knowing...what the woman-with-the-big-jugs' name was.The relationship between Kurou and Al was kind of bothersome. I know that Al is probably a 1000 year old person, but she looks so young. If I hadn't known her age I would think that she was around 13-15. I'd guess Kurou would be about 20 (since he went to &quot;college&quot;). It's just weird for me to see them so intimate with each other. Oh well.. I guess anything can happen in anime world.The graphics are great, specially the grimoires. They were all so nicely drawn. The guys weren't bad either, but Kurou's muscle tone kind of bothered me. He doesn't have a large frame, and yet you see muscles bulging out.The music wasn't bad. Most of the music were very upbeat and had high energy, like the opening song. I think it was something about God and machines. The ending song was a bit depressing, but I like it. I seem to like depressing and nostalgic songs, which makes me want to rethink seeing a therapist, but it's a wonderful song.

We\'ll make up some dialogues as fillers and spice them up by throwing in a few old jokes and a crapload of terms from some successful fantasy-universe or something like that to make it look like some intelligent and thoroughly thought through show ... what do you think about this Lovecraft guy?""I guess that\'s what a planning-session for Demonbane could have been like.The battles themselves didn\'t look that bad, but then again: The ridiculous mecha design gets boring and the fights...aren\'t much better in that regard. Most of the time I got the impression they didn\'t even bother thinking about details, but rather made a new 3D model and threw it at the main characters robot including some flashy sfx. Between the fights the viewer has to face a redicilous amount of Lovecraft-references that (apparently) don\'t add anything to the show but pure confusion of the viewer. I can\'t say whether this show may offer something for a person having read all the lovecraft stuff, but my guess would be, that even that is rather unlikely.EDIT (May 2012):It has been almost 4 years since I wrote this review.

Also I ultimately did not end up writing reviews here on this site, but I don\'t just want to \'delete\' this one. I wrote it as my oppinion on the show and by and large it still shows how I think about this show.

So maybe it was just because the stuff I watched before this show was somewhat above-average for it\'s time ... be it in soundtrack or voice acting or sfx.)Enjoyment: 2 --> 3 (2, which for ""overall scores"" is outside the range I decided to use for stuff that I at least managed to watch till the end, gets updated to 3. I did not enjoy it, but I at least managed to watch the end because I expected it to get better after the first four or five episodes and then the end was already close enough to pull through.)Overall: 3 --> 4 (The overall rating gets boosted to a 4, as such acknowledging the possibility that someone who can process the Lovecraft references and likes the style of this show might overall find it enjoyable to a certain extent, though still hard to believe for me.) aren\'t much better in that regard.

It is like  a disgrace and profanity of one of the best Action Visual Novels ever released.Evrything great about the game was wasted in this sorry excuse of an adaptation, flatening the story, cutting...mayor characters, even the jokes and art from the anime are just a clumsy imitation of its original form. (especialy Master Terion and West look awfull in comparision to VN). Only the music thames are cut directly from it making this series a little bit better, still they arent used that skillfull as in the VN where thay perfecty created a mood. It might sound silly - but even animations in VN were better !!Despite all of this it is still ... quite enjoyable to watch...Suprisingly -  but I guess, should I never see a VN before, I would probably enjoy this series without regret, but instead after watching this series I am totally cruished in sorrow, that splendit idea and story was wasted that much.Demonbane had the potencial to become one of the greatest fighting anime ever ... And instead it is a B category show that some ppl bash the story (and they are - in case of the anime at least) for beeing just an excuse to show a bit of Mech fighting.Zan'nen desu !

Now, that aside, this anime is a blatant mockery of Lovecraft and all his work, which angers me greatly, but that\'s not good enough let\'s piece together the thought processes of the people behind this tragic piece of wasted pixels.""you know i hear that HP Lovecraft guy is quite popular now, and so is gundam.....i know!!! let\'s combine the two so we get the audience from both""MORONS!! is all i can say to that.HP Lovecraft wrote most of his work in the late 1800\'s and...early 1900\'s and he was very old fashioned so he used many archaic words in his writing, this show doesn\'t do him any justice what so ever, so let\'s look at it piece by piece.story: 1How they thought this would go down well with Lovecraft\'s fan base is beyond me, because it is shocking how they\'ve butchered his work. In terms of actual story there is one but it mainly comprises of intense mecha battles between the protagonists and the worst depiction of Herbert West i have ever seen. This show throws HP Lovecraft references around like they don\'t actually matter at all which is sad really, because if they\'d actually taken the time to read HP Lovecraft\'s work they\'d find animating it as it is would probably bring in more of an audience than this crap.art: 3the art is about as unique and special as a butter knife, poorly animated and for a show made during the mid 2000\'s it is a shame that they didn\'t put more or any effort into it.sound: 3the music in the show is exactly the kind of music you\'d expect from a mecha anime, so much so that it is uninspiring and lame. big explosion sounds and poor dialogue make for a beyond mediocre attempt at leaving an impression on it\'s audience. An anime who\'s music fits the bill will be remembered but this music and sound just make the anime seem even more disjointed than it already is.character: 1The characters are shameful, particularly Herbert West, who\'s madness is so over-exaggerated that it just seems cheesy and stupid. They attempt to put a love story in there, occurring between the two main characters but it just seems so boring and obligatory that by the end of it they both irritate you so much that you hope they both die tragic deaths in the end that goes with Lovecraftian custom.enjoyment: 1The only possible way you could actually enjoy this as an HP Lovecraft fan is amongst friends mocking it. If you aren\'t an HP Lovecraft fan there is no way you can enjoy this because it uses so much Lovecraftian terminology so flippantly that most who don\'t do their research beforehand would be left thinking ""what the hell is going on?"". Besides why would you bother doing research beforehand just to watch this trash? don\'t bother, go buy some silly string and run around the neighbourhood shouting ""phorgsnarfle!!!""  while you spray it everywhere, because that\'s a far better use of your time than watching this.overall: 2View works, a little advice next time you decide to venture into anime, (although this is the only anime you\'ve made, and I can see why) an anime that insults the work of the person who\'s fan base is your target audience, is definitely not the way you make money in the anime industry.Just sayin. early 1900\'s and he was very old fashioned so he used many archaic words in his writing, this show doesn\'t do him any justice what so ever, so let\'s look at it piece by piece.story: 1How they thought this would go down well with Lovecraft\'s fan base is beyond me, because it is shocking how they\'ve butchered his work.

It was an excellent and intriguing intermingling of the Cthulhu mythos and giant robot action - the timing of my viewing was also probably quite fortunate in that on Sunday I watched the end of Tenpu Ibun Ayakashi Ayashi (which had some interesting material about wearing gods) and then spent yesterday morning reading all extant material on Hellboy and B.P.R.D. (which is also heavily influenced by the Cthulhu mythos). Really Demonbane appealed to the main reason I consume...entertainment media - to acquire fuel and inspiration for my own imagination. Demonbane served excellently in that regard and spawned a lot of interesting ideas and alternate takes on its core precepts. The only possible negative might be in the delivery and design of the mecha. Some people don’t like the recent trend of intermingled 3d and traditional animation, though its handled quite well in the show. And the mecha designs are certainly unique, and while they may not be instantly appealing they do fit the source material well. The particular fansub I watched was also very well done with notes on all of the mythos stuff mentioned in the episode presented after the ending song, which would be of great use to the more casual viewer. entertainment media - to acquire fuel and inspiration for my own imagination.

Proceed with caution.One day I was scouring Crunchyroll for something to watch.  Upon scrolling I randomly stumbled upon Demonbane.  My response was “eh, why the f**k not?”  What could possibly go wrong.  This was a completely blind watch.  The only thing I knew about Demonbane is that its based on an eroge.  Hentai games.  Oh hell yes.  Give me more of that.  Demonbane is a mecha series with elements of magic and fantasy.  Cute girls, harems, magic, and giant mechs.  Basically, books transform into cute girls and help co-pilot giant...mechs called Deus Machina.  It doesn’t get any more anime than that.Oh boy, where to begin with this one?  What a mess.  Demonbane is textbook pretentious.  The series tries to make itself out as being smarter than it really is. Using Cthulhu mythos to hide the fact it’s a generic harem/mecha series.  Sorry but just because you reference literary classic doesn’t mean your anime isn’t grade A trash.  Demonbane follows the story of down on his luck detective Kuro Daijuuji.  He is hired by the Hadou Foundation to track down a Grimoire, a book with untold powers.  While on his mission he has a run in with a girl being chased by a scientist who keeps shredding on his guitar.  The girl is one of the legendary Grimoire he was in search of.  She is Al-Azif.  Al is searching for a new and settles on Kuro.  They form a contract by kissing and take control of titular mech Demonbane and escape peril.  This mech is the Deus Machina the Hadou Foundation had been searching for.  The princess of the organization Ruri Hadou allows Kuro and Al to pilot the Demonbane.  In comes Black Lodge, an evil organization that is evil.  They don’t seem to have any real motivation other than thirst for battle and destruction.  Demonbane changes antagonists every few episodes until everything comes full circle.The characters are incredibly one dimensional.  Kuro is your typical generic harem/shonen protagonist, for some inexplicable reason almost every female wants to bang him.  Al-Azif is the tsundere loli book turned girlfriend.  Ruri is a princess archetype with one hell of a butler.  Almost every named female is part of Kuro’s harem.  His harem includes books, nun, robot, and a princess.  Black Lodge has a collection of some of the most uncompelling antagonists.  They are led by Grandmaster Therion.  He has the power to destroy Kuro in battle but chooses not to satiate his amusement.  Just a generic stoic villain.  Black Lodge is filled to the brim with betrayals.  I swear there’s a betrayal every 3 episodes.  How does this organization function?Demonbane tries really hard to pull at your heart strings and fails spectacularly.  This anime is a fan of the fake out deaths.  Master Therion is betrayed and thought dead until his not so shocking return.  One character is introduced and killed off immediately.  We hardly got to know her, yet we are expected to feel pain for Kuro’s loss.  Spoiler alert; it didn’t work.  They bring her back later in a shocking turn of events.  Now she is trying to kill Kuro for Black Lodge.  Kuro is able to talk her out of it through the power of love.  But then suddenly, Therion, who is presumed dead, explodes out the girl.  I burst out laughing.  It was one of the funniest scenes in any anime.  Gintama wishes it could be that funny.  I had to pause the episode to get my bearings after such a laughing fit.  How could they expect anyone to take that seriously?  Even main characters aren’t immune from the fake out death.Deus Machina is the perfect name for mechas used in Demonbane, as the series is jammed packed with convenient coincides and BS.  Through the power of love, you can accomplish anything, even bring people back from the dead.  Believe in the heart of the cards and all your dreams will come true.A lowest common denominator anime like Demonbane wouldn’t be complete without gratuitous fanservice.  You can’t have gratuitous fanservice without a beach episode.  We interrupt the plot to bring you “plot.”Demonebane came out in 2006 so the animation won’t be up to today’s standards.  But even for 2006, Demonbane is underwhelming.  Looking at anime like Code Geass, Black Lagoon, and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, proving age is not an excuse for lackluster animation.  The art direction is so forgettable.  It followed many of the trends of the early and mid-2000s.  Female characters have absurdly huge eyes and plenty of ridiculous anime hair.  Demonbane incorporates CGI with its 2D animation.  The mediocre CGI reminiscent of many Gonzo series released during this decade, clashed horribly with the art style.  The OP was total garbage, using only scenes from the show and obnoxious music.  Speaking of the music, I can’t remember any of the OST.Demonbane is a waste of time.  The Cthulhu mythos only exists to cover up the cliched harem/mecha schlock.  The plot is an abject disaster filled to the brim with plot holes and Deus ex Machina bullshit.  The attempts to be taken seriously is laughable.  Plenty of unintentional comedy to go around.  There isn’t much reason to watch it.  It isn’t close to the worst anime I’ve seen but commits the graver sin of being forgettable.  If you can’t be the best you might as well be the worst.  At least you’ll be remembered.

It seems that there are negative comments for this anime, but in my view I find it quite fascinating. I do not like the entrance music, but the overall music isn't too bad. Pretty much what happens in this anime is a use of terms in a symbolic way and at the end you can read what each term means. I find it an interesting way to be informed on mythologies that I did not even know about.I would not recommend this...anime to someone who does not have an interest in mythologies, because you will simply write a review as the ones that have already been posted speaking about how this is simply thrown together and just a  bad anime overall.I think it is that they cannot appreciate the interesting way of depicting mythology while at the same time teaching you about the mythology.So as a summation, I must say I quite enjoy it so far and I hope you understand what is so interesting about this anime before you watch it. If you do not like history and mythology then I advise you skip this anime because you will not enjoy it. anime to someone who does not have an interest in mythologies, because you will simply write a review as the ones that have already been posted speaking about how this is simply thrown together and just a  bad anime overall.I think it is that they cannot appreciate the interesting way of depicting mythology while at the same time teaching you about the mythology.So as a summation, I must say I quite enjoy it so far and I hope you understand what is so interesting about this anime before you watch it.

NOVEL.I read the visual novel first then watched this awful horror of an adaptation.Considering the fact that the main route of the visual novel was at least 60 hoursI can see how they would have a hard time fitting things in.HOWEVER! this shit is inexcusable, they even cut out characters.This is one of those cases where you learn what its like to not be a secondary by watching the adaptation of something and instead reading the source material beforehand.A couple of reasons I disliked this adaptation was the animation, I was actually ok with it but it wasn't the best and neither...was the art, they cut out characters but they did at least make a vague appearance at the beginning never to be seen again. Another thing being that the pacing was just awful and a lot of the events were completely inaccurate, they even skipped major parts and minor important plot points. was the art, they cut out characters but they did at least make a vague appearance at the beginning never to be seen again.

Kiss Dum: Engage Planet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2106/Kiss_Dum__Engage_Planet,"['I highly recommend it.Now before I continue, there were only 19 episodes subbed for this series and most of the resulting subs were either sub-par to horrible to acceptable. This was due to having 3 different fansubs from the superb subs from the original fansub group (MENCLAVE) to the infamously ""horrible"" fansub group Mendoan.When I state ""horrible\', I meant the English composition that one will read when watching the series from episodes 8 onwards.Another note: After episode 7, Bandai Visual bought the rights and any viewer of the series will no doubt, notice how inferior the subs got once the announcement was made...by Bandai.Now to the series...One thing that caught my attention was the concept of oversized bug-like creatures who begin to obliterate humankind and they are called the Hadians. The storyline revolves around Aiba Kun who is one his path of revenge against his former boss who betrayed humankind to these creatures. The reason is slowly told in the late episodes.

can get an idea that they didnt put much thought into this anime.The basic concept is simple.A long time ago earth was populated by some good aliens that faught a war with some bad aliens.they all dissappeared and the only thing left behind was a warning and some ancient uber weapons that can only be used by one individual.So you get the basic setup where the main character will aquire the power to kill the bad guys and save the good guys.Not the best background but we've seen it work for many anime.the story begins with the outbreak...of the alien infestation.highly adaptable aliens with no particular advantages or dissanvatages that can take any huge form you can imagine and kill stuff,and lets not forget of the basic alien wasp like bugs.There is where the problems start conserning the whole world setup and concept.These things are unbeatable and they spread all over the earth in a matter of months.Its suprising that the humans never used nukes in the initial invasion something that always happens in these stories.All armies get devastated.And the hero is the only one who can kill these things thanks to his super powers.the aliens dont quite like sunshine but it appears that they forget their weakness as the series progresses.yeah...they just forget about it no questions asked.ok whatever not everything gets explained in anime.Basicly the aliens overkill everyone exept the hero.And the hero whenever hes in the mood he overkills the aliens.No reason no common sense.It is extremely confusing cause the backstory and concept of the whole world is very poor and its not defined in such a way that the person who watches this anime can understand what was happening in the writers head when he wrote the story.basicly the battles are just meaningless overkills where a huge 100m tall alien beast will smash a little guy with a rifle...at least for the first 9 episodes.i really dont get why the aliens bother with humans cause its not like there is any human tech or weapon that can hurt them.Its one of those stories that a person with great imagination wrote but due to his lack of experience and story telling he forgot that the people who are going to watch this are not himself.You see that happening many times in many amateur stories.The writer has a very good understanding of the concept but he fails to communicate it to the viewers.Although i think that the possibility here is 1)either the writer was himself confused and was unable to figure out the basics or 2)it was written by different individuals who didnt share the same image over the story and ended up as this catastrofic epic fail of an anime.So as far as for the story ... it sucks big time.too many wholes.so many gaps to fill in with meaningless side stories,while trying to make up for the fail of the first episodes plus the painfull effort to establish the characters ,that always fails.the art section is not as good as expected.from wallpapers and character and mecha designs you ll think that this is gonna be a visual orgasm,but the anime totally fails in that.ive seen a lot older anime with better direction,better coloring,better animation.Its just good enough to justify that its an anime but not good enough to make you wanna watch it.The editing is horrible.the only good thing this anime has is the mecha aircraft(lol there are just 2 of them,along with the cockpit mobile armor).thats all.they look nice.but they are not enough.sound...well it has a few nice songs and tunes.the sound effects are mediocre and are usually lost behind the characters screams and wasted efforts to make you feel the action.now about the characters.the first episodes are really painfull to watch as you get to meet lots of secondary characters who die just like that.you'll see some of them revived later in the series only so they can get killed again.you get to see some interesting girls but they also die sometimes within 1 episode.As for guys you get the usuall psykos with their confused agendas that die out really fast...that said this animes main focus is the uber super ultra hero and his abilities while everything else fades in the background.if only the hero and his abilities were good enough to keep your interest.Overall it painfully fails to establish the characters ...even the main characters role and personality.i dont know,really, maybe my standards are too high...but it really sucked.the only interesting characters are the heros guides.some kind of deities that are the source of his powers?or some kind of AIs that help him with his battles...whatever,they are the only ones that where fun.And a tsudere girl with a big ap cannon-rifle-whatever that never does any real damage to enemies lol.there is absolutely no enjoyment.im usually really patient with anime that are confusing and fast paced from the start cause they usually end up being masterpieces but this one is terrible.it was so painfull to watch that i actually dropped the series after episode 9.Its the first time i was forced to dump an anime just like that.As a person who grew up watching anime this anime looks to me as a pile of turd.It might be interesting to someone who just entered the world of anime but it wont appeal to people who were lucky enough to watch a few other great anime.overall...it really is a shame that so much money and effort were thrown in this anime.They should have invested the production money to charity.thats how much of a fail this anime is.i really dont care what happens after episode 10.it wont be able to make up for the devastating failure of the first 9 episodes.if an anime isnt able to establish its story and main characters until episode 4 (thats one month) then its a total failure to me.Not only that but it fails to help you enter its world.i found my self in the uncomfortable position of googling in the net to find explanations for the concept of this anime.i really tried to understand it but i realised that there was nothing to understand.everything is about an uber hero killing alien mutand things but the hero and his abilities and weapons arent that good.The only thing that looked interesting are the motives of a human woman who seems to be involved with the aliens and was the former commander of the hero.but ... i dont wanna suffer through the series to find that out.this anime is a fail.dont buy it.dont rent it.avoid loosing your precious everyday free time to watch it.YES THIS IS A HATE REVIEW.i want back the 3 hours i lost from my life watching

I found it worth the watch and I didn't got bored at all.Animation was same as other anime made by soyep and If you are watching anime produced by them then you should already know the type of animation that is in their animes. I personally like anime made by soyep as they are interesting...and story is according to my taste.I admit that the story should've been a little fast but overall it was a good watch. I would really recommend this anime. Every person has their own different taste of anime. Just try it for yourself.I was just disappointed and annoyed by the main character. I have never seen this ungrateful main character. He just disrespects the most powerful emperor betian whose inheritance  he got. Like he was trash and couldn't cultivate but then he got the resources and he was using it like it's his dad's  property and when he was talking to Betian for the first time he was so disrespectful and he just keeps giving betians techniques to everyone like what is his right and if he is doing that he should at least have a sense of gratitude. I was annoyed by seeing this type of character.Enjoyment and overall- 7/10 and 7/10I personally really enjoyed the show and I would really recommend the.

One day while recovering from an injury, Lin Xiao inherits the ancient god's powerful techniques commencing his journey to climb the ladder of cultivation while also...gaining comrades and fighting noble families/fixing internal strife.Story & Characters: 2/10My recap is a dumbed down version of the story; In all actuality the story is very slow and when there is about to be progression, there's a random moment of absurd comedy that breaks that momentum and keeps the plot and character progression stagnant. The side characters feel superficial because they either disappear from the spotlight for long periods of time or are forgotten and there's no sense of real conflict so it feels the episodes are poorly improvised. Obviously we know that's not true because the studio used the novel as a cookie cutter for the donghua and didn't bother to revise the story by removing unnecessary encounters or dialogue. Also, the power scale is so irrelevant, any increase in power doesn't make a difference to Lin Xiao since it seems he somehow magically cultivates to the true yuan realm late stage. Now we're left with a poorly written story, dispensable characters, illogical power scale and terribly absurd comedy.Art & Sound: 5/10Viewers who usually watch Donghua already know that the 3D assets are reused between chinese studio projects and the same can be said for the character rigging skeletons. In this series the art and animation is mediocre, it definitely doesn't reflect an anime of 2021 and is more better suited to an anime of 2017 or earlier.

You might have seen worse, but Kuang Shen Mo Zun looks like a set of (badely written) 3d scripts in a uneventful loop made by a lazy, drunk and desperate artist. But by then, the music, especially the anime introduction is *so* much worse that the animation looks suddenly not that appalling. The best thing that could happen for this anime is for the associated musical band to disband. Preferably permanently.Now, if you\'re stubborn enough...to get past these aforementionned defaults, you might find some unusual (in a chinese anime) qualities hidden in the dialogs. I\'ve found them quite mature, quite funny sometimes (better at least than the random comic aspects of the show). This seems unusual to me, especially in a chinese anime, where you will usually find the dialogs as a mix of clichés sentences and childish heroic punchlines sewed together. To help with that, the characters and their developpement aren\'t all that bad and at the very least, they are *consistent*.Since the story progresses very slowly, I can\'t say much about the scenario. Basically, this feels more like a detective (dee) story than your inevitable ""i-will-rule-them-all"" manhua. to get past these aforementionned defaults, you might find some unusual (in a chinese anime) qualities hidden in the dialogs.

Lostorage Conflated WIXOSS: Missing Link,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36083/Lostorage_Conflated_WIXOSS__Missing_Link,"[""Just as a heads up, the first episode of Lostorage Conflated is actually the same second for second as Missing Link. Just the release dates are different, as this was released as an OVA in Winter 2017 and Conflated is airing right now in Spring 2018. So if you want to just skip this after watching Incited you can!Personally I wasn't a big fan of the writing because I binged Incited and went right into this episode hoping for a change of pace but it was like only a few days had gone by since the finale of Incited. The ending had me excited...because I loved the first two seasons of WIXOSS and I'm excited for the characters to make a return! Over all a solid episode, nothing really stuck out but I can't really majorly complain about anything. because I loved the first two seasons of WIXOSS and I'm excited for the characters to make a return!

Juuni Taisen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35076/Juuni_Taisen,"['I\'m sick and tired of seeing people treat Juuni Taisen like trash because the plot is predictable.It might just be intentionally predictable!I know, how blasphemous!As if its intention was to besmirch the name of our beloved Fate and the tarnish the genre it birthed into existence!Did it really take everyone 12 episodes to realize that the show reveals the order of every characters’ death by the end of the first episode?Would it be so far-fetched to imagine that Juuni Taisen actually wanted to put an original spin on the battle royale genre?Or does every battle royale show have to be like...Fate to be deemed “good”? Instead of trying to stand out with spectacular visuals, Juuni Taisen offers compelling characters and lots of new spins on the genre to keep you engaged.Positives:+Exhilarating Music+Interesting Character Backstories+Tense Action+Solid CGI+Innovations to the Genre+Grimdark AestheticNegatives:-Lacking World Building-Dragon and Snake\'s episodes-Visual Quality Inconsistencies[Story: 6.5/10]In coming up with the score for the story I included both the actual plot and the way that the story is delivered because it is a crucial part of the experience.Juuni Taisen understands how predictable stories in the Battle Royale genre can be, and it plays with this idea of predictability. It’s a show that acknowledges the nature of its genre, all of the opponents in a death game but one will die eventually. It rubs its predictability in your face and forces you not try to figure out who will die next, but to analyze the show’s other aspects. Namely, the characters, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.As for the setting and plot themselves, they are fairly barebones but sturdy enough to hold up the exciting action and character stories. Whenever the show draws attention to the behind the scenes of the zodiac war it feels very apparent that it’s the most undercooked part of the show. Occasionally we see anonymous bidders watching the battle, but there is little reason for these segments other than showing us important people view the game as a form of entertainment. In the backstories side characters offhandedly mentioning how the zodiac war is some myth that is typically referred to as very important, but that doesn’t come across at all during the actual war itself, as it mostly focuses on the characters.The city that the competitors battle in is entirely devoid of life, with little explanation to the why and how. Characters have special powers connected to their zodiacs, although the powers are cool and well implemented into the action they have no explanation for their existence in the real world. Very little of the actual plot is clear, but each character’s backstory is enough to make up for its issues. The backstories worked so well to get me invested that whenever the characters engaged in combat I was on the edge of my seat hoping for the more developed character to survive despite knowing the inevitable would come.The ending will no doubt disappoint some people, but its tameness didn\'t bother me. For me, it concluded the characters\' stories in a satisfying way and it gave me everything I expected from the ending.[Character: 8/10]Most of the entertainment from Juuni Taisen comes from the characters, as you’d expect from a battle royale show with a paper-thin plot.The cutthroat cast of twelve mercenaries/warriors are each represented by one of the twelve zodiac signs. Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar. They all have special abilities related to their sign which are revealed over time, another mystery that adds a layer of tension to the thrilling atmosphere. Even their deaths are directly tied to their zodiac sign. This opens another avenue for analyzing each character, and frankly, it\'s not surprising to see a writer as impressive as Nisio Isin try to innovate the battle royale genre like this. Also, they’re all edgy as hell. All of them, it\'s funny how on point they are to the edgy battle royale genre style the show is aiming for and successfully hitting it. Their personalities are all very distinct and are represented by their character designs. Their designs also have elements that represent their zodiac sign. Whether it be Usagi’s bunny ears and high heels or Niwatori’s chicken style outfit and pitchfork for a weapon. They all look absurd and have the strong personalities and backstories to justify their designs.Their personalities are quite overdone, but once you see the explanation for why they behave the way they do you’ll be more inclined to embrace them. Although a couple of the character backstories didn’t quite do it for me (namely Dragon and Snake) because of their stories, while funny and full of action, blatantly disregarded what made the other character so well developed. Even with all the absurdity, a majority of the challengers evoke empathy from their backstories and make you think, oh now I get why that character is trying so hard to look cool. At first, they’re vicious killing machines, then the show makes you pity them and you\'ll become endeared in their struggle to win, no matter how futile it may be.[Art: 6.5/10]The quality of the art and animation varies, it starts off great but has a noticeable drop-off in quality in the later episodes. While in the actual present-day Zodiac War the visuals are quite good, solid character art, a dark and moody desolate city, and sometimes really great battle animation. During the flashbacks is where the art quality starts to drop. In the early episodes the art and animations look good all around, but as the episodes go by the flashbacks have noticeably less motion and become mostly conversation scenes. Not to say that the conversations aren’t interesting, but the show is at its best during the high stakes action.It’s understandable that the budget isn’t huge considering it’s a new story from a fairly small studio. I can commend Graphinica for subtly swapping the art style to CGI to save funds in the later episodes because of how great it looks. Don\'t expect to see low frames CGI like what we got with Ajin in this show. Graphinica previously worked a fairly good looking CGI movie, Expelled from Paradise, so it’s great to see that they’ve only gotten better through practice. I didn’t struggle to forgive the issues with the visuals while watching the show, but I have to knock it a few points for some distracting quality dips during the middle episodes.The greatest saving grace of the show\'s visuals is its grimdark aesthetic. You might just call this ""edge"" and you\'d be right, but it\'s consistent edge that is totally in keeping with the rest of the show. Scenes are full of shadows, dark colors, and the fact that the war takes place during mostly the nighttime with rain and clouds during the day. Every aspect of the show contributes to this style and the visuals pull plenty of the weight. While the art is far from perfect, I can say it makes up for enough of its flaws with a memorable personality.[Sound: 8.5/10]A nice tense soundtrack that gets the blood pumping during action sequences. It ranges from orchestral music to EDM and I liked all of it. It’s also present during the slower scenes where characters are conversing to add a layer of tension, reminding you that they have to kill each other as soon as they finish talking. There are times it strikes the audience with some more sad songs to hammering home the brevity of some of the show\'s tragic situations. I feel safe saying it\'s one of the best OSTs of the season, as well as having a great alternative rock OP. The ed has a good song that’s more subdued than the show that precedes it.The voice acting is good across all 12 contestants and there\'s a dub as well that\'s not as good as the Japanese voice acting but it\'s nice to have the option.[Enjoyment: 9/10]Despite having exciting action, a majority of the show’s screen time is flashbacks and talking scenes. I liked a lot of the backstories, but as I said earlier not all of them are interesting. Your mileage may vary when it comes to enjoying Juuni Taisen, I really liked it but it may not be for everyone. If you can embrace the edginess regardless of the absurd plot then you’ll probably find it to be an enthralling watch.[Final Score: 7.7/10]When it comes to entertaining action, Juuni Taisen pulls it\'s weight with interesting characters and the lore behind them all. It doesn’t have the luxury of being able to slack off because its visuals aren’t anything to write home about. That\'s why it devotes so much time to its characters and offers up some intriguing hooks. In the end, it’s just a good time. If you go into it expecting the next Fate you’ll be disappointed.

They kill someone off every episode, and to give the characters a little depth before they die the writers shove 15 minutes of exposition down your throat before killing the character said exposition corresponds to with an obsessive level of violence    effectively wasting your time because you just learned the backstory of cannon fodder.Are you worried about your favorite character dying? Well don't be I assure you that every backstory is written in a way to guarantee that the viewer will hate the guts of any character that gets one.Also it has a decent into madness type vibe so there's also that. all but one of them has to die by the end of the anime...

The music in comedy anime where someone does something stupid. Everything was so stupid here that it might\'ve been better to just make it a comedy anime. And even with that my score would\'ve been maybe 5 instead of 4After watching all of the show, I want to say that this anime... Had potential. And a lot of it. But it went downhill really fast.I\'m going to talk about the pattern of the anime, which makes almost every episode the same, the poor ""border story"" and why the anime which is tagged only as ""Action""- doesn\'t do...anything interesting with action. Minor spoilers but I do not specify names.So, when I first saw Juuni Taisen, I got hyped ""Another Fate? Sounds cool!"" and the story is pretty simple. 12 fighters, 1 wish, fight to death, last one standing (probably).Where did it fall off? Basically at the end of the first episode, but you only realize it later.Juuni Taisen repeats a pretty bad pattern for almost every episode.Show flashbacks of character->Show character\'s amazing plan how to win->Character dies a random, quick death. (You sit there afterwards and ask yourself what the hell has happend)->Show next episode\'s title which contains an animal and spoils the next death in the next episode.I have been watching it and hoping- Will the pattern break? And also, we are spoiled the order of the deaths, I do not want to spoil where, but once you see it and realize and doesn\'t break pattern and unlikely to.... You lose 80% of the enjoyment.The border story? None. They fight for a wish, that\'s it. Oh and there\'s some guy who started all this and introduces them in the first episode to that Juuni Taisen, we don\'t know who that guy is (....yet?).I wanna give props to the music (kinda), the OP and ED were top notch. The soundtrack.. Mostly forgettable.But the art on the other hand... Went downhill real fast.In conclusion, my score is 4/10. And if you\'re looking for a Fate alternative, you better watch Kiss X Sis because at least it\'s better than Juuni Taisen. anything interesting with action.

From this year, we had plenty of those. Titles such as Kakegurui, Chaos;Child, and even Vatican Kiseki Chousakan tried to sell its ideas to viewers with mixed results. Then, there’s Juuni Taisen, a show that features a battle royale theme. Based on the signs of the Eastern Zodiac, it’ a character battle for the ultimate grand price of having a wish fulfilled. But honestly, Juuni Taisen is a show that betrayed expectations. It didn’t fulfill my wish of a show that is memorable. Instead, it delivered a half-assed...TV anime that makes headlines for the wrong reasons.Juuni Taisen is interesting to note for its creator, the brainchild behind the Monogatari novels. While that franchise takes on a more narrative approach, Juuni Taisen tried to do something different. It became a show that heavily focused on its characters, ones that I honestly found to have many problems by their standards. That’s another subject by itself though. For this anime to succeed, it had to really get viewers invested into the story and be something unique of itself. Unfortunately, the battle royale theme is hardly original. The popular Fate franchise already had a similar premise while other shows in recent years also took on such an approach. (ex. Btooom, Mirai Nikki) What Juun Taisen failed to really do is not bringing in characters that are worth watching for but instead kills them off like they are some failed experiment. To say the least, that’s just awful to realize.Watching this anime will probably get you to realize what it wants you to like. The bloodthirsty action, tragic drama, and emotional storytelling is what people should really expect from a show like this. Unfortunately, it only capitalizes on a small percent of that. Its straightforward storytelling is very predictable as you’d expect from a battle royale theme show. Every time you see an episode filled with storytelling based on a certain character, almost always expect that character to die sooner or later. As for the storytelling itself, this show took a risk and it didn’t truly pay off. Most of the characters in this anime has some sort of background story, motivation, and apparently goal for themselves. However, it doesn’t really evoke any feelings in the end as it’s hard to get attached to them. With perhaps the exception of the Tiger, almost every episode made me feel less sensitive about the characters. I don’t feel much sympathy for them because there’s really no point to after realizing what their fate awaits them. It’s so predictable that you can almost guess exactly what may from scene to scene for some episodes. The worst offender is the Usagi (Rabbit) because this anime omits any sort of character development for him. He is literally portrayed as a psychotic abomination who tries to make “friends” and enjoys the thrill of killing. It doesn’t also help that the character lacks a personality and is there to fill the bloodthirsty action part of the show. By storytelling context, I do want to say that the show provides reasons for the battle royale itself and that there’s a larger end-goal than just making a wish come true.If you came for a show with graphic content, then this may end up being somewhat of a crowd-pleaser. The body horror, bloodshed, and overall psychology lives up to certain expectations. So really, if you plan to watch Juuni Taisen, you won’t be disappointed for a show that offers its violence. I also have to add that through its battle royale theme, the show sometimes gets creative with how characters uses their approach to kill. While it’s far from being an intelligent anime with strategies and clever psychology, some characters are deceptively cunning. The anime makes it clear that there will be one victor so death is something that you’ll see often. The way these are carried out can occasionally be impressive despite the extreme predictably.Adapted by studio Graphinica, I will admit that the overall visual quality gave me some favorable impressions. From the character introductions to the battle choreography, Juuni Taisen knows how to get viewers pumped up for some of its episodes. As dark and edgy as this show can be, it does live up to some expectations in regards to its technical content with graphic horror. Body parts are shredded, blood is spilled, and mentality is tested through facial character expressions. There isn’t much censorship either. Tragic background stories has a black and white stylish tone that expresses a sense of vulnerability. Most of the animation also remains fluid without questionable raw quality. The character designs are interesting to take notice ranging from Usagi’s man service to some of the sci-fi gimmicky outfits such as those wore by Tsumita siblings. The animal motifs and characteristics are also evident to represent the Chinese Zodiac.When it comes to soundtrack delivery, there are several qualities that makes this barely watchable. First, the battle OST is far too generic. It just seems to be there and isn’t unique by any standards. Second, there are the character voices. Some of them really doesn’t make an impact while others are memorable just by their voice alone. The guiltiest example is Usagi, a character voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto. His voice from this show channels the craziest and ridiculous lines I’ve seen from this show. On the other hand, the theme songs gives a feeling of melancholy and grimmer mood. I mean, it is a very moody anime after all.Should you really watch Juuni Taisen? As a light novel adaptation with 12 episodes, it’s about as predictable as it can get. Expectations were shattered in pieces once you realize what you’re in for. Beyond the predictably, the anime fails to get over most or if any of its character cast. Even when there are characters that you try to feel sympathy for, it ends up being wasted in the end. It’s a show that I tried to accept for what it is but ended up being a dumb action flick that ran dead on its shoes.

The premise of the show is that these 12 ""badass"" mercenary warriors each representing a zodiac animal are pitted against each other to fight to the death for the victory to be granted any wish much like that of the Fate series. The battle that takes place every 12 years (like the zodiac calendar) is supposed to be a war that replaces all other wars in the world to prevent the unnecessary loss of life, but yet the show constantly flashback to each warriors history of years of war experience. This completely contradicts the whole premise.While...the concept seems like it\'d be fun to watch a bunch of people killing each other, the story telling aka plot progression completely ruins any enjoyment. It starts off with a interesting character you think is the protagonist by telling you the backstory and then kills them off. What a twist right? Then the show proceeds to replicate this formula for EVERY single character for the whole show. It\'s so predictable that there\'s no reason to even guess who\'s going to die next. Also these heroes are constantly dying in the dumbest ways to the point that each build up become anti-climactic.I don\'t know how anyone would think this was worth making into an anime. There\'s no character development and there\'s no concept of storytelling. the concept seems like it\'d be fun to watch a bunch of people killing each other, the story telling aka plot progression completely ruins any enjoyment.

There\'s no character development and there\'s no concept of storytelling.', ""Before the start of the fall anime season, Junni Taisen was one of the animes that caught my eye. The reason why is because it had the term Novel on what material it was adapted from. As in it wasn’t a light novel series or a regular novel series, but rather it was one single novel. As in all it needed to do has been done, and all that’s left is to adapt it to animation that has an ending in sight that will leave little to no loose ends. What started as mild intrigue was quickly overtaken with dissatisfaction as the first two episodes...rolled around.Juuni taisen starts out in terms of its premise, as a very simple battle tournament between some of the best “warriors” in the world. The gimmick in this story is that each the the contenders is representative of each of the chinese zodiac. Add on top of that a desolate city where the contenders can do whatever they want, and you have a formula for some fun. It may not be the most smartest of stories, but it has the ability to bring many great fighting scenes which sadly never becomes the case.Backstories and their utilizationOne of the most noticeable aspects of this show, mostly because of how much time it takes from the show, is that it has a lot of backstories. Almost every episode has a backstory for one of the characters which is fine, I mean there are 12 characters and only 12 episodes worth of screen time for them. The problem is that each backstory is too long, and even worse is that it's the only shreds of characterization that we have for almost all the characters. I mean i’m fine with backstories as a way to develop a character and give them more depth, but it should be used as the base not the entirety of the character. It’s because of this that all the characters feel shallow, and it’s difficult to get engaged with them which in turn removes a lot of tension that could have been given to the anime.It’s also because of the overuse of backstory that during my time watching I began to wonder, how are backstories are used in a story? One of the answers i came to is the one i used a paragraph above, as a way to develop a character and give them some depth while serving as a base and point of reference for how far they have or haven’t changed through the course of the story. It could as be used as a way for characters to interact as a way to sympathize or persuade each other, as well as the characters and readers getting a chance to know the characters. Now how are they are inserted into the story? Well as stated above it could be through character interaction, but another way is through characters reminiscing over their past. A majority of Junni Taisen’s implementation of backstory is through reminiscing, which also becomes another of its faults. Reminiscing over your past is better used during the low points in the story when there is not much conflict and characters are allowed time to think about things without interruption. However since Junni taisen is mostly conflict it seems unreasonable for characters to think about their past, since they should be more busy thinking of strategy plans. It’s only used properly twice and that’s because it was before and after the battle royal, which is basically the low point, and it also does backstory via character interaction maybe once. All  other backstories feel hamfisted into the story as a way to give the characters some form of depth. They should have also thrown in a record scratch and a freeze frame before delving into their backstories because at least that would give them some value even if comedic. Even worse is what comes after each backstories that turn the show into a bore which leads to.Character focus and the wheel of predictabilityJunni Taisen doesn’t really have a central that the story focuses on, but insteads puts focus on almost the entire cast, with each given an episode each. It did comes as quite the surprise during the first episode when only one character was given the most focus to, as well as a backstory, to the point that it was made to believe that they were the main character. Of course that thought was dashed away as they died in the very same episode. It was a nice subversion of expectations, but the problem is that it didn't go anywhere with this. It kept on doing the same thing over and over again with each character. If they are the main focus of the episode, and are given a backstory than they are likely to die soon. It may not be in the same episode, but they still die in a certain manner that holding back their death for an episode or 2 didn’t really matter. Another thing to add on top of that is the order that the characters die. All you need to do is look at the chinese zodiac wheel and after the death of the three contenders, it’s easy to see how the show is going to play out.It seems that the people of the show were aware of the predictability of the show, and made heavy hints on how it will play out via the ending title, and the name of each episode. Even so it really adds nothing to the show. The show tells you what it’s going to do and does it, and does nothing else. It’s fine but leaves nothing for the viewers imagination, and removes even more tension from the show. With a predictable story and shallow characters, it’s hard to see the point in the story as it drags on.the fuckery of the junni taisen worldThe world of juuni taisen doesn’t make any fuckin sense. At first there wasn’t much to the world other than a group of assassins wearing costumes corresponding to their zodiac animal meeting in the middle of a desolate city to duke it out in order to have their wishes granted by the host. Gimmicky and simple sure, but it allows for things to be straightforward and brush of things that are never explained such as, how are they able to fight in a city that seemed to be abandoned recently? Well if they are able to gather the best killers in the world than they must be stinkin rich which also could explain how they are able to grant a wish and have people evacuate the city, via money and power. However in the same first episode near the end magic is also introduced through the use of necromancy. So that leaves questions that weren’t questioned now difficult to explain because now the wish and the the abandoned city could have been explained with magic or money, but it seems the writers weren’t bothered now to actually explain it.So now you have a world where there is some sort of magic in the world and the contenders are able to use them, but it seems that one ability is restricted to one character each. It’s never explained why only one ability or how abilities such as theirs play in the world outside of people being assassins. It also leads to a power imbalance as it could be possible for one of the characters to have an op ability that can beat the rest of the contenders.I think the thing that bothered me more was the entire point of junni taisen was that it served as a proxy war so that unknown people can make bets to take counties, and the whole thing is just dumb. There’s been enough flashbacks from the series to show us that there is still war between nations and fighting over land outside the battle royal. Is there going to be a change of government are borders going to be redrawn especially for something that happens every 12 years. Even then it’s not like the citizens will be happy which can lead to civil unrest and rebellion.I was also going to go into the 12 families and the happenstance of the character aesthetics to their respective zodiac, but at this point it’s too much. Basically as more about the juuni taisen world is shown the more convoluted and contradictory it really is. It looks like a bunch of things slapped together with not much thought in the big picture.Production Value and other final thoughtsThe production value during the beginning was fine to say the least. I liked the character designs of the warriors mostly because of how gimmicky they are just so they can be identifiable to their zodiac. Although backstory boars combat outfit looked nice as it had a metal gear look to it. The animation was smooth although it had a rough looked to it which i personally liked even some of the cg animation was good. But that’s just the beginning as the quality in terms of both art and animation go down. Animation starts to look jagged and cg is used even though the characters are standing around which looks ridiculous. In terms of sound there’s nothing to harp about as most of it was forgettable. Characters sound like how they’re supposed to sound, and music play when it’s suppose to, but nothing truly stands out.Going into this show i was at least expecting some action shlock, but it seems that wasn't the case. There were interesting things in the show for sure such as the backstories which themselves could make interesting stories, but they are confined to this one. There was also some “witty” writing when it came to the characters and what they represent, but nothing mind blowing. This is a show that said it will do a thing, did it, and nothing more. rolled around.Juuni taisen starts out in terms of its premise, as a very simple battle tournament between some of the best “warriors” in the world.

If you are the type of person to like nonstop action with a small amount of character development you've come to the right place. Every episode we learn the short backstory of a character then we watch them fight.  The story itself is about 12 people representing the zodiac killing each other to retrieve a poisoned gem from each other bodies and then getting the one inside you...taken out upon victory. Somehow we have pacifists in this competition but that's not important. We don't know exactly why people showed up for this tournament but maybe we will learn. I do like any killing game plot and this is no different but I like character development also so I have a love hate relationship with this show maybe you won't.The art is amazing as shows like this need good art because there is so much going on and people will drop janky and bad art like a sack of rocks. They have nothing to hide behind with this show and I appreciate the effort.The music is also pretty nice and fits everything the show needs well. You know what you're getting just from the music used when it shows up. The voice acting is also pretty good.Like I said before we get a short backstory every episode for each character then we don't learn much more about them. I don't mean that as a bad thing though. So you can't make bonds with everyone except for maybe the pacifists if they live long enough. What I will pick out is the powers. Every character has an ability related to their zodiac even if it may not seem like it. the chicken can control birds, the boar holds ammo like a pig does it's slop with endless reloading so she never has to stop firing her gun as long as she has ammo like a pig never stop eating as long as they have food. The rabbit has necromancy so the people he kills does his bidding for him with their powers intact I don't know how to compare that one. The dog can control poisons I guess because dogs can sniff them out and etc.I like the way they balance this powers out so no one is too overpowered even though all the dog has to do is sit around until everyone else dies since he is immune to poisons.Overall I'm loving this anime and can't wait for a new episode every week especially since we have so many duds this season. I'm somewhat liking everything about this show and hope it keeps it up. They even keep you on your toes by throwing you things you may never expect. taken out upon victory.

The first 2 episodes were totally unpredictable and then it got predictable. The unpredictability once again returns in the last episode. I mean who would've thought that.This anime is not just about action but also has awakening meaning.You get pretty awesome action. Intense strategizing. All 12 characters different in their thinking (except for the Dragon & Snake Brothers). Overall I loved it. I was excited every single episode. the OP is excellent. Art could be better though.

"", ""Sometimes it is easy to grab a club and hit a series as hard as possible with an unconvincing criticism, and we forget that our tastes are not the same as those of the readers.The plot is about a group of assassins (zodiac configuration) who joined a fight to death called Juuni Taisen, that's all.First, let me ask you something. What story do you expect from a fight to the death or deathmatch? All the characters will die, so the story is easy to follow. The substantial part of the spectacle is not in the fight against death itself; it is in the background from...the secondary stories. Besides, all the personality, skills and reasons to be in the battle are explained in the secondary stories. Why should an author focus on the deathmatch, knowing the predictable outcome? The anime gives constant clues about WHO will die later, so pretending to be surprised by the plot is a big mistake. Do not have high hopes for the story, it is predictable but you can enjoy the small stories and the animation instead. Remember, it is not Death Note, Made in the Abyss, etc.Furthermore, ¿what will you expect from these characters? In summary, they all are assassins, murderers, most of them are psychopaths and antisocials so what background do you want to see? A killer lover of all living beings? ¿A killer, that have some morals and will cry at night for all the persons that died? They are not like Monkey, and that character was a killer as well. Please, do not overthink a deathmatch plot and do not try to explain it either with false and bold arguments.The art is normal. The show is predictable.  Moreover,  for an animation studio is hard to invest a significant amount of money and time in some fights when the outcome is evident for the audience. Also, the chapters try to explain the character's perspective, so the animation used is acceptable for this purpose. On the other hand, the sound is typical, it helps with the fights and boosts the events but nothing more. The OP was ok.In conclusion, the show gives the casual enjoyment when you watch any predictable show. For example, you could enjoy the character's short stories, but you already know the outcome, so you will feel a bit disappointed at the end because the show did not fulfill a more significant plot.Overall 6.5 rounded 7.0Finally, the show has some remarkable short stories, but not all them are fascinating. The plot isn't hard to follow, and it is very predictable. However, the outcome fits the adaptation's objective and relinquish some information about the characters using short stories. Sadly, the pacing could be a problem because the time between the short story and the dead of the characters do not allow any further character progression.

A simple enough premise right? Every character is explored and as a result you do feel some connection or sympathy with a character when they die. And as its a Battle Royale, nearly every character... well dies. Written by the same writer of Katanagatari this anime is NOT meant to be a Mystery anime. People come into this show and somehow become upset when a character they like dies - if...you can't stand shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking bad where characters that are built up die because thats the context of the world they are in, this show isn't for you.Putting aside the obvious which apparently needs to be said, this show is moreso like a character study instead of a pure action anime. When put into a situation like this, every soldier/warrior has a different creed/way of thinking that leads them to act the way they do both in everyday life and in this said situation. What makes this show incredibly enjoyable is that we get to see multiple perspectives of how to handle a situation like a Battle Royale with every character receiving a thoughtful depiction. Yes there is gore and yes there is violence, but stripped to its core Juuni Taisen is more like an episodic case study show of how characters would act/behave within the given world of Juuni Taisen.Its a fairly straightforward story -> Characters connive, plan, team up and kill. Art is alright. Only thing to really note is CGI is used for once in an anime fairly seamlessly within the show, which not many shows have been able to manage to pull off. Sound fits the show and helps with characterizations. Again, despite this being an action anime this show shines the most at being a set of individual character studies. Some of the other reviews here dislike the fact that characters they became attached to... well died. If you are willing to accept that fact, this becomes a thoroughly enjoyable show to watch.This show isn't going to have you thinking about large philosophical questions like a Shinseaki Yori, but it does what it sets out to do. Provide a Battle Royale where every character is provided characterization and their methods/ideas are explored and examined. I would sincerely say this is one of the most enjoyable anime of this season. you can't stand shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking bad where characters that are built up die because thats the context of the world they are in, this show isn't for you.Putting aside the obvious which apparently needs to be said, this show is moreso like a character study instead of a pure action anime.

Like, if you really pay attention you can see the order of the deaths by just looking at the ending animation. And on the episode 9 the animation is not that good. But still funny to watch everybody dying in different and unexpected ways.The anime doesn't give you time to enjoy the characters fully, but the flashback on their stories makes us like them a little more, even though they die very easily.I like the way lifes are so volatile and end so quiclky, it gives tension to the work and gives us more expectations. "", 'Juuni Taisen is one of the best examples of a bonafide ""what if"" anime: What if the show was 24 instead of 12 episodes? What if the art and animation were more consistent? What if half the show wasn\'t pure flashbacks? What if the character deaths weren\'t so laughably predictable? I really could go on, and it\'s a shame imagining what could have been an outstanding show.The anime is plagued by a myriad of small problems which by themselves would be insignificant and ignorable, but when you account for so many of them, it becomes detrimental to the viewing experience. On its surface, Juuni...Taisen aspires to be an epic, exhilarating battle royale where 12 warriors representing the signs of the Chinese zodiac volunteer or are chosen to partake in the brawl, with the winner to be granted any one wish.Naturally, comparisons will be made to the Fate/Stay Night series, and while that juxtaposition isn\'t too far-fetched, Juuni Taisen is far more character driven and in that fact lies the show\'s greatest strengths and weaknesses. On principle, most of us can\'t get attached to characters if a said character received little to no screen time, or barely any development or backstory. To meet this principle, the anime dedicates one episode to most of the characters, where we see the conflict from their point of view and learn about their past. The problem here is that their backstory is told through an often intruding and abysmally long flash back that takes up the majority of their episode. I\'m not one of those guys that hates flashbacks, heck I loved the original Naruto, but the difference here is that Naruto had dozens of episodes to tell its story and flesh out all its characters; Juuni Taisen does not have that time or liberty, so to see almost all of a character\'s screen time be dedicated to a flashback feels like a superfluous disservice to them, however effective it might have been to their development.Speaking of disservice, one thing I\'m sure that bothered others besides me was how suddenly the majority of the characters are killed off. About 80% of all the characters perish instantly to a sneak attack or die sacrificing themselves for another character. You can hardly call this an action anime if only 2 or 3 of the characters die fighting, while the others never really even got a chance to shine in the combat they so loved. Again, I\'m not an action enthusiast, but if you\'re going to dump a huge flashback on us only to suddenly kill the character off afterwards, you\'ve wasted any potential for growth that character might have had, as well as what could\'ve been a great fight.And that leads to the other problem: Predicable deaths, very predictable deaths. The anime is very formulaic --- The episode focuses on one character, they get a 15 minute long flashback, and about 2 or 3 minutes after the flashback ends, they die, usually without a fight. While this isn\'t always the case, you can usually guess with surprising accuracy the next character to be killed off by just figuring out which character that previously got no screen time is suddenly getting lots and go from there. In this anime, flashbacks are the death flags, and screen time is the precursor to that.The last bit of bad news if you\'re interested in this anime is the often wonky art and animation. It\'s all over the place to be honest, bouncing between amazing and sluggishly lazy. Honestly, at the times when the animation is downright jaw dropping, it only irks me even more for the lack of action scenes that could have greatly utilized it. Even the CGI is fluid and alive, might even be the best CGI I\'ve seen in anime. But again, it all varies as sometimes the art devolves significantly past the point of saying its the anime\'s art style and just leaves me wondering ""why?"" But of all the negatives, this one is probably the most ignorable.As for strengths, the biggest one is that its very character driven and knows how to make us care for characters in such a short amount of time, but it comes at the cost of the above negatives and due to the nature of the anime, the characters would not live long enough anyway to solidify a deep connection to. More episodes would have been amazing for this show, but we have to consume what we have been served. I can also say with certainty that not one of the problems I listed was enough to affect my overall positive enjoyment of the show, and my lower overall rating of 6 is  mostly due to objective critique. I\'m a firm believer of watching a show for the enjoyment rather that to look to criticize it, so if the synopsis interests you at all, I still recommend you give it a try. Just bear in mind the above qualms and perhaps lower expectations accordingly.In all, Juuni Taisen presents a simple yet effective story with compelling characters, though both of these are mired down by easy predictability and a lack of focus on action where there should be more of it. There was a lot of missed potential here, but at the same time it hit just enough right marks to distinguish itself as something truly unique in its field. Taisen aspires to be an epic, exhilarating battle royale where 12 warriors representing the signs of the Chinese zodiac volunteer or are chosen to partake in the brawl, with the winner to be granted any one wish.Naturally, comparisons will be made to the Fate/Stay Night series, and while that juxtaposition isn\'t too far-fetched, Juuni Taisen is far more character driven and in that fact lies the show\'s greatest strengths and weaknesses. On principle, most of us can\'t get attached to characters if a said character received little to no screen time, or barely any development or backstory.

From the start it's just 12 people, essentially and aesthetically bound by simbolysm ties which alone should haw rang a bell for anyone with more exposure to books rather than mainstream media.Looking at how the story is build around 12 episodes, there is almost no room for more world building or entertainment candy by prolonged character study and stretched EPIC fight visuals. It's bound to realism even with the fanatasy elements in it.  I could...even call it cruel; how all aspects of life are finite in the end - if you are to strong, fights are one sided and quick, deception and technology can fight on equal grounds against the strong, but no matter how strong anybody gets, no one can be a one man army in the end.

Like that the plot is weak, it´s predictable, the fights are boring, the deaths are stupid, and the characters are scumbags with no development. And from the other side that it´s actually quite good, even great. That the characters are fairly interesting, with as much focus on their past, (with some interesting stories) as the actually death game. In my review I will give you my point of view on this, and how I perceived the whole show.I wouldn´t call the plot weak, just narrow. The premises are a death...battle in 24 hours, based on the Twelve Zodiacs Hours. According to Chinese astrology, though not popularly used, a person’s personality and life is more decided by his/her birth hour than year. So instead for each animal sign belonging to a specific sequence of years, it depends on which hour of the day you were born. Which is the case with the narrative of Juuni Tasien. Which explains the otherwise kind of weird age span of the characters, and how that is that dragon and snake can be twins. Knowing that is not a spoiler, whatever you google on it or not can be doe. In my point of view, Juuni Taisen delivered what it promised. You get to know why these battles are hold (whatever you find it interesting or believable is up to you), what the participants and organizers gain from it, and the battle setup. So, to me the plot isn´t weak, just very straight forward and narrow.The show is predictable to some extent, but just as much it isn´t (don´t get fooled by the first 3-episode pattern). Yes, there are a major spoiler for who is going to die next included in the show, but not how and when they die. If you can live with that, this won´t be a problem for you.Since many probably signed up for Juuni Taisen due to the action tag, there is somethings that can be good to know in advance. The fights are short, intense, consume little airtime, and not your typically anime type of fights. You know, the type that can last a half of an episode, with the participants taking an immense amount of punishment, just for them to rise up again and keep fighting because of their “strong determination and will”. You aren’t going to find any of this in Juuni Taisen. The fights, battles and strategies in Juuni Taisen are a bit more “realistic”. Read me right, nothing about JT is quite realistic, but in the manor of how they play out.Let me clarify by Mike Tyson´s famous quote; “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face”. Which much align with how it works in Juuni Taisen. The characters are scheming, plotting, and planning, but as in real life, things seldom unfolds according to plan. There are factors that you forget to take in count, the misreading of a situation or opponent, the overestimation of your own abilities, or the underestimation of the opponent´s. The fights themselves is in my opinion often pretty interesting and nicely executed, I enjoyed them a lot, much due to what I mentioned above. You could clearly make out what of the things I mentioned above, went wrong when a character lost.Which leads me to the deaths. One might call some of them stupid, but I would call them human. The characters are often finding themselves in a situation where they get surprised, overwhelmed or hesitate a second to long, and end up dead because of it. If that isn´t typically human traits, I don´t know what is. Even the strongest, bravest, most experienced man can crack under too much mental pressure, which JT displays well. And the participants are for sure under much mental pressure, they are after all in a time limited death battle with only one winner outcome. If that doesn´t for fill your desire for “cool” deaths, well you may want to watch something else.As for the characters being scumbags, is absolutely partly true. A number of characters are really some of the worst scum the human race can offer, and some are far from it. With that said, I didn´t find any of the characters boring, quite the opposite. I found the depraved characters just as interesting as the rest. It´s a question of balance, and there did JT also delivered, its got the whole span of personalities.About the character development, let me first ask you a question. How much do you develop as a person during 24 hours? I myself, can say, that I probably doesn´t develop significantly much during that span of time. So, don´t expect any revolutionary character developments, this is the type of show that focuses more on how characters will act after their current state in life.Which leads me to how the characters are handle together with the story. The plot can thoroughly be divided into two sets. Set one being the battle occurring in present time, and set two being the backgrounds of the characters, with set one and two mixing together from the start to the end. I liked the concept, which gave information about certain characters along the way, and at the same time pieced together their current place in the battle, or filled out the narrow plot with some good context. That made them feel more like persons then just war-robots. Tiger´s story was especially touching, and when put in with her role in the battle, it actually accounts as development for me. There´s a fair amount of time spent on dialogues and inner monologues, which let´s you get to know the characters and how they think. For the little time 12 characters have in just 12-episodes, I think most of them where quite fleshed out.The opening song ""Rupture"" by Panorama Panama Town, is in my opinion the best OP this season. The song and visuals are capturing the atmosphere of JT really well, and set me in the perfect mode for an episode. The ending song ""Keshin no Kemono"" by Do As Infinity, is equally as good, which round up that episode by showcasing the civil side of the warriors. The VA´s are well matched with their characters, and all preform their role to satisfaction.Overall the art and animation holds a high quality. Nice coloured and detailed backgrounds, fluent and intense action scenes, cool character designs, and fitting light settings. There are some parts where the quality drops (running out of budget?), but those scenes are pretty rare.So, conclusion time. Juuni Tasien surprised me, and drew me in much more then I had expected. I enjoyed every episode, predictable or not. Some of the backstories were more touching than what one might expect for this type of show, and somewhat humanized the warriors a bit. I recommend this show to everyone who can live with the conditions I mentioned in this review, and won´t expect something similar to the Fate-series.

Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don\'t understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.Juuni Taisen or How to Scam the AudienceAs a fan of NisiOisiN it is uncomfortable to write this review. I still can not believe that Juuni Taisen, an anime based on his novel, could be so mediocre.And the worst thing is that at the beginning it looked promising. Everything seemed to point to this anime would be avant-garde to break with the clichés of the formula ""Battle Royale""; however, episode after episode,...Juuni Taisen was transformed into a mess unable to maintain interest.Some characters so one-dimensional that, with some exceptions, it was impossible to connect with them; and a plot that folded to a totally predictable formula, killed any kind of suspense or mystery possible. In case anyone did not notice, the order of the deaths was the inverse of the order of the Chinese zodiac; and if that was very difficult to guess, the ending showed the sequence in all the episodes.In addition, what was initially innovative and unexpected, soon became a heavy and insipid structure. I mean the formula of showing a character\'s background right before he died. I have to admit, that even in the final episode itself I expected a plot twist that would justify everything, but no, that salvation never came.It is supposed that the subject of this type of series is that each death is unexpected and that it is never known who will win until the end; nevertheless, Juuni Taisen decided to remove that suspense from the middle to focus on making a veiled criticism of the war?The problem with that is that without suspense it is difficult to maintain interest. Not to mention that the characters have hardly any development and it is extremely difficult to empathize with them; not only because of its poor construction, but because just at the moment they develop a little they end up dying.And in the midst of that scenario, do you want to teach us that war is bad? Using cheap self-help book philosophy? With this panorama it was inevitable that this series would fail. A pity that a work of a great like NisiOisiN ends up happening without pain or glory.Of course, as in everything, there are exceptions, for example the Ox and the Tigress were two of the rescue characters; unfortunately they did not have more minutes on the screen. The rat could be another prominent character, especially for those last two episodes; however, his absence during more than 75% of the series made him lose all the weight he could potentially have.Finally, the resolution was totally anticlimactic, which did not help at all to improve the series. Only the issue of desire in the final episode was a bit like raising the quality a little; however, in the end even that was handled horribly.For that desire to forget everything had had an impact, it was necessary that the rat had more weight during the 12 episodes; If the audience had suffered their pain while living each path, for example, they would have had more connection with the boy and his predicament.On the technical section. The soundtrack only has the opening to highlight, but it is not to launch rockets; the rest of the music is totally forgettable. The animation started well, but soon it went to the floor, leaving a lot to be desired in the process.On the other hand, the direction was frightening in every minute. There were hardly two or three sequences to remember and it was not because they had been first level, but because everything else gave pity. Character design is the only thing to be highlighted within the technical section; Here I must say that a very good job was done.In short, a series that disappointed with a mediocre execution of a premise with enormous potential. If you have not seen it, do not even come near it. See you in the next review.SUMMARYA series with a huge potential that went to hell for a mediocre execution.Personal rating4/10 Juuni Taisen was transformed into a mess unable to maintain interest.Some characters so one-dimensional that, with some exceptions, it was impossible to connect with them; and a plot that folded to a totally predictable formula, killed any kind of suspense or mystery possible.

I watched until ep 7).

I am writing this because too few people seem to get what this series is about.First of all, I have to say that if you only like action-comedy shounens, this is not a series for you. If you want just a lot of fight scenes and plot twists, watch something else.Now, let me explain why I liked Juuni Taisen.Characters:Well, all the characters die in the expected order, and there aren't any major plot twists. In each episode, we get some backstory, a bit of fighting (I will talk about that later) and usually...a death. However, I can say that the backstories are well written. Not even one of them tries to be too tragic, and the characters vary from pacifists to thieves and psychopaths. However, most of them contain some tragedy, and some of them really touched my heart. I even cried once, which I really didn't expect to happen when I was watching this series.Action:The action isn't really a focal part of this show, but the animation is really well done. However, I was more impressed by a thing you don't really see anywhere else. In general, there are two types of fights: the classic direct power clash and the more indirect fights in which the opponents try to analyze the opponent's unique power ( the activation conditions, limits and weaknesses) and try to find a smart way to win. Juuni Taisen looks at first like it belongs to the second class, but it has a surprising element of realism added to the battles: almost all of the plans DON'T work. And they end up failing for some really simple reasons that the characters just overlooked.For some, it may sound anti-climactic, but I thought it was awesome how this anime showed just how quickly a life can end in battle.Soundtrack:Well, I don't really know much about music, but I enjoyed the op, and the rest of the music was pretty good. Not one of the best, but good.Negative points:I liked this anime from the beginning and around episode 10 I was thinking I might just give it a 10/11 (11 being the masterpieces). However, the last episode was just unsatisfying. Most of the people who are reading this are probably going to ignore my advice, but I am going to say it anyway: DON'T watch the last episode. Just pretend ep 11 is the conclusion. That is going to be much better. Or, at least, stop at the half point and imagine yourself what the winner asked for. I am going to say this again: DON'T watch the last episode till the end. I mean, I get what the point of the last episode was supposed to be, but there is a huge difference between understanding what you were supposed to feel, and actually feeling it.Overall, I give this anime a personal 9/11 and a recommendation to watch it only if you think you will enjoy it in the way that I described it.You can watch it legally for free on Crunchyroll. a death. However, I can say that the backstories are well written. Not even one of them tries to be too tragic, and the characters vary from pacifists to thieves and psychopaths. However, most of them contain some tragedy, and some of them really touched my heart. I even cried once, which I really didn't expect to happen when I was watching this series.Action:The action isn't really a focal part of this show, but the animation is really well done. However, I was more impressed by a thing you don't really see anywhere else. In general, there are two types of fights: the classic direct power clash and the more indirect fights in which the opponents try to analyze the opponent's unique power ( the activation conditions, limits and weaknesses) and try to find a smart way to win. Juuni Taisen looks at first like it belongs to the second class, but it has a surprising element of realism added to the battles: almost all of the plans DON'T work. And they end up failing for some really simple reasons that the characters just overlooked.For some, it may sound anti-climactic, but I thought it was awesome how this anime showed just how quickly a life can end in battle.Soundtrack:Well, I don't really know much about music, but I enjoyed the op, and the rest of the music was pretty good. Not one of the best, but good.Negative points:I liked this anime from the beginning and around episode 10 I was thinking I might just give it a 10/11 (11 being the masterpieces). However, the last episode was just unsatisfying. Most of the people who are reading this are probably going to ignore my advice, but I am going to say it anyway: DON'T watch the last episode. Just pretend ep 11 is the conclusion. That is going to be much better. Or, at least, stop at the half point and imagine yourself what the winner asked for. I am going to say this again: DON'T watch the last episode till the end. I mean, I get what the point of the last episode was supposed to be, but there is a huge difference between understanding what you were supposed to feel, and actually feeling it.Overall, I give this anime a personal 9/11 and a recommendation to watch it only if you think you will enjoy it in the way that I described it.You can watch it legally for free on Crunchyroll."", 'If you were given one wish to have anything you want, what would you choose?This is the question our 12 combatants have over their heads as they try to survive in this battle royale anime where only one can survive. It is the formula that been used in many battle royale anime and so it also applies here. Who will win? Who will lose? But, most importantly, who will get the longest backstory?So sit back, relax and ""Everybody, clap your hands!"" as I present to you the anime review for Juuni Taisen. Lets begin:Story: 6/10...So like I said, the anime is about the Juuni Taisen. A battle royale where 12 combatants compete to kill off each other in order to win the prize of having one wish of their desires; that\'s about it. Honestly you don\'t need to have a complex story for a premise that is this simple. You are given the premise and then you move on to see what happens next. It is the kind of story that develops depending on the actions of the characters and what they do to survive.Now one of the things that Juuni Taisen does that I like is that there is no true protagonist. Almost every character gets the light shine on them for an episode or two and we get to see how they plan to win the Juuni Taisen what actions they are planning to make. We also get to see what actions they took before they entered the Juuni Taisen to get an idea of kind of character they are in backsotries. The problem is that they can be inconsistent in terms of actually being interesting and length. While some are enjoyable to watch, some of them can be kind of boring. It doesn\'t help that sometimes that the backstories can take an entire episode to just tell us the lives of these characters and their morals. This doesn\'t help when you get these long backstories and then they get killed off quickly, leaving the viewer disappointment due to it feeling anticlimactic. This is mainly due to the mistakes that the characters make but more on that later.Juuni Taisen also likes to portray the battle royale as a literal war. The city that the anime is based in is a battlefield with soldiers in it; fighting each other in order to survive. Not to win, but to survive. Because by the end of the anime you get the message that there are no winners in war, only survivors. That is exactly what Juuni Taisen is trying to portray. It\'s not trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it is trying to be Juuni Taisen. But the message can be difficult to understand because the characters aren\'t really grounded in reality when they can do supernatural things that no normal human could, making it difficult to see that message.Characters: 8/10One of the best things Juuni Taisen gets right is that it understands that a battle royale anime needs to have a diverse set of characters and thankfully it does. Juuni Taisen has a large variety in characters all representing an animal in the Chinese Zodiac Line. From the weird dressing but psychotic nature of Rabbit to the calm and collective nature of Ox to the carefree but kindhearted Tiger. These characters are interesting to watch and makes for good entertainment when their personalities clash together.....most of the time. Some characters can be one dimensional and uninteresting to watch, making their expected deaths less shocking. I\'m not going to say who due to spoilers but they can be uninteresting.Now like I said earlier, their deaths are mainly caused by their mistakes because in war, you can\'t make mistakes otherwise you are dead. You make a mistake, you die, simple as that. This is something people tend to gloss over without thinking because it is an important factor. They can die because they were overconfident or they can die because they let their guard down. A couple of mistakes do happen multiple times but mainly they die because of the mistake they specifically made. However I do believe that the characters can still make these mistakes and still put on some good fights. There was only a couple of fights in the anime that were noteworthy as the rest ended very quickly. I think that it is a waste considering what these characters can do. These characters can control birds, levitate for no reason, see into different world lines (get it?) and resurrect the dead. It just feels wasteful and I believe that if the anime is not going to be really using all these abilities to the fullest, then they should have more grounded characters. It would certainly make its message about war more easy to understand.Animation: 6.5/10Now the overall animation can be rather inconsistent. But I must give credit where credit is due though, the fight scenes that are in the anime are well animated, especially in the earlier episodes. There is a lot of smooth action in them, especially since some of them are noticeably animated in 3D, making them an enjoyment to watch. The 3D animation doesn\'t hinder it and won\'t bother many people since its mainly animated in the standard 2D animation anyway.However the character designs, while being unique to represent their animal in the Chinese Zodiac line, are rather poorly animated. Most of the time they look like they\'ve been poorly drawn as there are notable black lines in their designs, making them lack detail and look sloppy. This happens a lot in this anime and you will notice it.Sound: 7.5/10The soundtrack most of the time didn\'t really stand out besides a couple of tracks at specific times. Most of the time it plays to itself to match the atmosphere and tone at that moment.  However I do want to give credit the OP and ED of this show. The opening, ""Rupture"" Panorama Panama Town is quite possibly one of my favourite OP this year. It has a nice calm rhythm and beat that you don\'t normally here in an anime opening. It matches the anime well as it is not really explosive and is trying to be different than other openings. However, its ending song, ""Keshin no Kemono"" by Do As Infinity, is the complete opposite. Its fast and loud which, again, is the complete opposite of what many other anime ED songs matches the anime well because because like the anime, it is trying to be different.I also want to give very quick praise to the dub as I do believe the voice actors do good jobs of capturing the characters personalities well. I specifically like Jerry Jewell as Usagi/Rabbit. While the Japanese voice actor makes Rabbit sound creepy, He makes Rabbit sound quirky and sometimes humorous which I like.Overall: 6.8/10 Recommendation: ""Consider it""Like I said, this show isn\'t trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it\'s trying to be Juuni Taisen. It wants to be its own thing and I respect it for it. This show is trying to portray the message that ""War is hell"" in the wise words of Jim Carry and it wants people to understand that. If you are looking for a show like Fate then you won\'t find it here but if you looking for something different in a battle royale anime then it is worth checking out.

Some of it's good, some of it's bad and what we're left with is a very strange package to unwrap right before Christmas. Well, let me try and tackle this with some structure.The three key things that define Juuni Taisen as a show are it's characters, it's thematic storytelling and it's anti climaxes. And all of them have their ups and downs.So i'll start with characters. It's hard not to be immediately drawn in because all the characters have pretty...stellar designs, both visually and how they're written. None of the 12 participants feel interchangeable and clear work has gone into making them interesting and fun to watch. A lot of the good stuff in Juuni Taisen is just watching these characters interact and deal with one another across the show's runtime. We're given a decent amount of time to learn about most of their backstories, their motives and their goals and they work well with their actions.Unfortunately the strength of these characters is cut short as, since this is a death game, the characters tend to die off very quickly before they can have any actual development in the show. Once you know a character's backstory, for the most part, it's just a countdown to when they'll die, so sometimes it can be hard to get attached to them, especially early characters. There are some exceptions to this, for instance Tiger is easily one of the more standout characters and Rat also have some development, but they're drops in a bucket.Onto the plot, the strength of it is definitely in the themes of the show. Every character having clearly defined goals and methods means their actions and even deaths are particularly fitting. It's nice as well that it's not drawn a huge amount of attention to and there to expand on for the more eagle eyed viewer who spies a cue in a certain backstory or in dialogue.However, the plot itself is very bare bones and basic. It's your standard killing game affair with a rich group betting on it and somehow being able to grant wishes, none of which is given any detail. And on top of that, the plot does get predictable quickly, thanks to the show being based on the story of the Chinese Zodiac, if you're even vaguely aware of the story, you already know who the winner is and who will die in what order, which for a killing game is kind of detrimental.What will surprise about Juuni Taisen is its use of anticlimaxes, something not often seen in anime. These tend to be both good and bad, sometimes they will earnestly catch you off guard for how sudden an action is or how shocking an event was and other times you'll feel somewhat robbed of a potentially interesting payoff.The animation itself can be pretty good when the show actually decides to use it, certain fight scenes later in the show are pretty good but unfortunately a lot of the actual 'animation' is just used on simple talking scenes and it's something of a shame because when fight scenes are present, they tend to be pretty good and make you want more.Overall, while I personally got some enjoyment out of Juuni Taisen, this is definitely not a show for everyone. I'd say give it the three episode rule and if you're enjoying the characters and can get over the predictable nature of the plot, it's a fun but bumpy ride right until the end. If you're just here for action and violent scenes, you'll get some of it, but probably not as much as you're craving.I'm glad I watched Juuni Taisen, but it's only getting a polite round of applause from me. stellar designs, both visually and how they're written.

That's hard to really describe. Basically all more or less important characters have some backstory, to which we could refer. Some of it is also a filler for a screentime, but I believe that, depending on the receiver, you might relate to their cause a little bit more or less.Even though some stories might look futile, I feel like it might have been necessary to ask and answer some questions by itself. Whenever you like it or not, it depends on your personal preferences.I must say, that I enjoyed quite a lot, even though there were some filler scenes that I skipped or just ignored, the show kept my attention for most of the time. I wasn't really curious about who will win, it was more about the war within and confrontation of the contrasts.The further part might contain spoilers, since it refers to the last episodes of the show.Taking on point my personal experience with it, the final lesson given by the winner shows us the situation with no 'good' way out. development going from the point A, to B.Art also doesn't look bad, but neither it does look stunning.It's a little 'edgy', just like some could describe it, gloomy colour palette, 'modernistic' type, with some budget cuts that didn't really interrupt much.Anime contains some 3D animation, don't worry though, I didn't feel like it was overused and I barely noticed it (one episode might overuse it!).Sound is perfectly generic, nothing that would make my ears bleed and also nothing that would make me look for the songs or tunes over the internet.Character, hmm...

The show is about a tournament that is held every 12 years where the participants are mercenaries who are each named after the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac and the winner will have a wish granted. There is also no main character in the show so the one that\'ll win is supposedly up in the air.Knowing this, you\'d probably expect a cool show where we get to see crazy mercenaries skewering each other for 12 episodes, which is what I expected.. Instead I got a show that feels...like it\'s desperate to fill its episode count with as much philosophical monologues as possible, that aren\'t supported by the weight of the anime, as well as pointless character backstories and having the participants stand around and not kill each other for as long as possible.This show does its best to avoid having a main character by just focusing on a different one in each episode and killing them off straight after showing you their backstory. The duration of these backstories range from half an episode to an episode and a half. While the battles usually come down to one hit kills in about 2 minutes. And the ones that last longer than that, are usually due to philosophical monologues the characters have while standing in one location and doing absolutely nothing. Not to mention many battles stop momentum midway for no in series reason and are handled poorly in terms of choreography.Not only are the character backstories an intrusion and constantly breaks whatever immersion you may have in a battle happening in the present, but they\'re also entirely pointless since the characters identities and personalities and how they formed their current personalities have no bearing on how they die in the battle, with the exception of the Ox and Tiger participants where it happened to be relevant for once.Also these backstories are way too long and only inform us about basic traits that we could\'ve picked up on just by seeing their actions in the present - ""this character is a drunk soldier"", ""this character is greedy"", ""this character is a pacifist"" and so on and so forth. So it all feels like a waste of time in hindsight since there\'s not enough content in this story to justify the 12 episode count which feels bloated in the long run.So after all that wasted time and boredom you\'d think the show will at least reward us with a good ending, right? Nope, the winner of the battle turns out to be someone who\'d have to be a complete moron if he\'d lost since he/she had an ability that (trying not to spoil here) gave him/her an overwhelming advantage that had very few chances of losing. Not to mention that this ability was never displayed throughout the series all for the sake of a weak twist ending.Also there\'s a revelation midway about what else is at stake in this tournament that is never mentioned again and the wish that the winner receives only ends up being an excuse to have more philosophical ramblings take up most of the final episode as well, instead of actually delivering on this idea. Which is extremely pathetic if you ask me.Visually this show looks kind of ugly and cheap. while the character designs have cool body proportions and faces that aren\'t generic stocky crap, their accessories and costumes look ridiculous and the color mixes don\'t always match up that well. And though it does manage to pull off some cool looking individual scenes from time to time, the animation is clumsy as a whole and it often takes shortcuts when it comes to more complicated motions. It also suffers more than it should considering characters half the time just stand in one location and don\'t do much. It even has some random CGI models near the end that surprisingly weren\'t that bad looking, but were jarring nonetheless.In terms of soundtrack there\'s some ok techno and rock tunes that don\'t stand out but serve their purpose and the voice acting and sound design is passable even though the former doesn\'t take much effort since most of the dialogue is emotionless monologues anyway.So there you have it, a death game anime that does nearly everything wrong, brings Nisio Isin\'s writing ability in to question (as if it wasn\'t questionable already) and worth watching only for the occasional gore and the half naked women. But even if that\'s all you want, there are countless better titles than this in that respect alone.It\'s a completely skippable show that I regret wasting my time watching, so naturally I wasted even more time reviewing it.. I don\'t know, don\'t judge me. like it\'s desperate to fill its episode count with as much philosophical monologues as possible, that aren\'t supported by the weight of the anime, as well as pointless character backstories and having the participants stand around and not kill each other for as long as possible.This show does its best to avoid having a main character by just focusing on a different one in each episode and killing them off straight after showing you their backstory.

Not to mention that this ability was never displayed throughout the series all for the sake of a weak twist ending.Also there\'s a revelation midway about what else is at stake in this tournament that is never mentioned again and the wish that the winner receives only ends up being an excuse to have more philosophical ramblings take up most of the final episode as well, instead of actually delivering on this idea. Which is extremely pathetic if you ask me.Visually this show looks kind of ugly and cheap. while the character designs have cool body proportions and faces that aren\'t generic stocky crap, their accessories and costumes look ridiculous and the color mixes don\'t always match up that well. And though it does manage to pull off some cool looking individual scenes from time to time, the animation is clumsy as a whole and it often takes shortcuts when it comes to more complicated motions. It also suffers more than it should considering characters half the time just stand in one location and don\'t do much. It even has some random CGI models near the end that surprisingly weren\'t that bad looking, but were jarring nonetheless.In terms of soundtrack there\'s some ok techno and rock tunes that don\'t stand out but serve their purpose and the voice acting and sound design is passable even though the former doesn\'t take much effort since most of the dialogue is emotionless monologues anyway.So there you have it, a death game anime that does nearly everything wrong, brings Nisio Isin\'s writing ability in to question (as if it wasn\'t questionable already) and worth watching only for the occasional gore and the half naked women. But even if that\'s all you want, there are countless better titles than this in that respect alone.It\'s a completely skippable show that I regret wasting my time watching, so naturally I wasted even more time reviewing it.. I don\'t know, don\'t judge me.', 'I went into Juuni Taisen with a skeptical attitude having seen it receive poor reviews. After completing the show I beleive that too many people viewed this anime in the wrong light.First, I would point out that if you are simply looking for a show to take the place of the Fate series then you will be disappointed. Juuni Taisen is very different from its battle royale counterparts, but I would argue it is better than most others, aside from Fate Zero.Next I would address the most common complaint, being that the plot was too predictable. I would agree that at times the...episodes fell into a pattern but the purpose of the show is not necessarily to surprise viewers at every turn. This is not a mindless action show designed to simply excite and surprise.Juuni Taisen is a look at the people who are fighting in the death game and a story about who they are, why they are fighting, and what they want in the end. it is character driven in nature, and excels at attaching you to multiple characters as you learn about what makes them, and they will make of the battle. It is far from flawless with a few of the characters falling flatter than others but for what it is, I enjoyed it more and more with each episode. episodes fell into a pattern but the purpose of the show is not necessarily to surprise viewers at every turn.

Well, look no further than Juuni Taisen, a fighting anime where fights last on average anywhere from 3 to 10 seconds. I'm not exaggerating. There was a lot of fluff to make you *think* fights were longer, but they truly weren't. What do they fill the rest of the episode with, you ask? Flashbacks. Yes, you get to watch roughly 20 minutes of uninteresting backstory and characters moving around the map, only to have them die within literal seconds of encountering another participant. They don't even die in interesting ways. They...just Alt + F4 out of the script. This is one of the most boring anime I've ever seen, and I don't understand why it exists.Outside of episode 1, the art and animation are both subpar. The soundtrack is forgettable. A majority of the characters aren't likable or interesting. The character design is boring for the most part. The anime refuses to answer questions that most viewers would probably be asking. It just fails in almost every conceivable category. Most notably, it fails to deliver on it's choice of genre. The only reason I gave it a 2, was because I thought the dialogue and voice acting were fine. This anime is a complete waste of time and should be avoided, in my opinion. just Alt + F4 out of the script.

The story and more specifically the predictability of who will win.Unlike fate, future diaries, battle royal, (hunger games in a way), and almost every other battle royal. THERE IS NO PLOT ARMOR. We don\'t have a main character that ""Must survive"" or that everything centers around. At first you are like oh yeah Boar is the main character totally a bad ass going to win it all.....SPOILERBut NOPE dies right in the first episode. Watching it...now I feel like I know who wins due to a very obvious story fault, but even so I still feel like they might throw in a curve ball and knock us all away.The downside is so far aside from Snake which their is tons of discussions about, they have all died in the order of the zodiac. This kind of defeats the purpose of not having plot armor, or not knowing who wins if you know the story they based this on. Even so I\'m hoping snake is the exception and throws that idea out the window for the second half of the show.Regardless this show is fantastic, one of the better battle royal series I\'ve watched thus far, would defiantly recommend this to anyone. now I feel like I know who wins due to a very obvious story fault, but even so I still feel like they might throw in a curve ball and knock us all away.The downside is so far aside from Snake which their is tons of discussions about, they have all died in the order of the zodiac.

Juuni Taisen: ""That Was Awesome!""Oh man.. Juuni Taisen. The Zodiac War. Where do I even begin?I guess I\'ll start this off by saying i watched this show weekly with a friend which made it more enjoyable. There was a lot of whiskey and ""Holy Shits!"" on our journey through this show. It was a breath of fresh air that is for sure. Don\'t get me wrong, this isn\'t the greatest anime of all time by any means. I did like it though.The reason this show captured me was because how out of left field it was. A show that shows the back...story for almost an entire episode just to have them almost always be the next to get brutally murdered. If you like a sort of hunger games plot, but one that is actually decent and entertaining, then watch this. All the loops this show throws you through is hilarious. Expect what happens in the first few episodes to happen all through out. This show gives zero fucks. The way me and my friend found that out was in the earlier episodes when the Fighter of The Boar got loads of dialogue. Only to get full nelsoned by a necromancer and get brutally stabbed.That caused me and my pal a giant ""OH...FUCK"" which is what this show always puts you through. This is one of those ""turn your brain off"" anime. Don\'t think too hard about it while watching it you\'ll probably drop it. For example in the back story leading up to the Rat Nezumi\'s victory. The tiger asks him if he wants to drink with her. He replies ""I\'m underaged."" I\'m over here thinking.. You\'re in highschool fighting a death game for a black market gambling system. I don\'t think society gives a fuck if you get intoxicated. Just little things like that are hilarious. You also get 1 wish if you claim victory, so who cares about the law? I don\'t know lol. Solid 7/10 from me. Juuni Taisen was pretty awesome. If you\'re bored of constant slice of life and just want a WTF experience.

Watch this!', ""Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Juni Taisen and while care has been taken to ensure that there are no spoilers within story analysis there may still be spoilers in character analysis. You have been warned.When 12 fierce and powerful warriors that have the names of one of the 12 Chinese constellations are chosen to fight in a contest where the prize is one wish the only result is a fierce struggle to obtain it.Juni Taisen based on a popular light novel of the same name is an action anime that makes use of...an interesting premise that when combined with the genre and theme makes it a potent combination. The traditional contest between fighters and struggles that ensures between them is reinforced by the interesting medium that it uses which is a contest between 12 houses all of which have different ideologies and the attitudes of each of the chosen fighters that take part in it. The first episode made a pretty good impression on me because it addressed one of the main problems that such anime’s have which it’s lack of a good origin story for its fighters which when combined with the actions of the characters adds much more depth to them.Taking place in modern day Japan Juni Taisen focuses on the Juni Taisen a fierce competition that takes place every 12 years and pits the representatives of each of the 12 Zodiac families against each other in a large-scale battle royal that replaces conventional war between nations on the global stage. In a battle that is fierce beyond measure 12 of the best fighters from their houses would fight with everything that they have in battles that are just as contests of strength as it is of strategy and maneuvering. The prize of this battle is the ability to grant one wish and one wish only. While the overall story of the anime is the battle royal itself the series also takes great care in explaining the backstory and origins of each of the main characters a move that I thought was well done as it allowed us the viewers to understand the motivations and desires of each of them and from there invest in the ones that we like.DokatsuDokatsu voiced by veteran voice actor Tomohiro Nishimura is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen representing his house in this large-scale battle royal. A member of the House of Dogs of the 12 Zodiac families Dokatsu is an intelligent, calm and cautious person that believes in the simple belief that they should use every weapon and tactic at their disposal to eliminate their enemies and secure victory.  As a result of this Dokatsu is someone that loves to break the rules and fight his way. While intelligent and fast thinking and possessing of good deduction skills Dokatsu was noted to have a certain element of arrogance about him in that he views his fellow competitors and their respective houses with disdain and venom best shown in his assessment of the other fighters when he was still in the game. His death by his miscalculation that was caused by his arrogance was somewhat ironic as a result.HitsujiiHitsujii voiced by veteran voice actor Cho is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to fight in this years Juni Taisen. A member of the Zodiac’s House of the Ram Hitsujii is a cautious, quiet, patient person that matches well with the traditional attributes that a ram would have. Unlike the rest of the competitors that were chosen to take part in this contest Hitsujii is by far the oldest fighter that was chosen and as a result, is often referred to as the old man of the 12 a term that I thought was appropriate to him as a sign of respect. A veteran fighter Hitsujii can easily be defined as someone that is cautious and cunning in equal nature that when combined with his patience truly makes him a fierce warrior to contend with. While not one that prefers to strike using nefarious tactics like necromancy Hitsujii is no less lethal with his method of using powerful explosives to destroy his opponents with. Hitsujii’s ability to stay both undetected by the rest and his ability to stay one step ahead of any hunters was a great proof of his abilities.While Hitsujii is noted to be an intelligent and patient person it's interesting to note that he also has the semblance of pride as well which often clouds his judgement on things. However, what I really admired about the character of Hitsujii is his backstory that was used to show his motivations for joining the fight and the backstory of what actually made him the man that he was. His reason for joining the fight I felt was also pretty heartwarming as well as his thoughts towards his family.InounoshishiInounoshishi voiced by veteran seiyuu Yoko Hikasa of High School DxD and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to fight in this year’s competition. A member of the House of Boars of the Zodiac families Inounoshishi is an intelligent, fast thinking and cautious person by nature that is reinforced by a fierce tenacity and cunning that matches well with what a boar’s personality will be like. On the surface, Inounoshishi is a capable fighter that seems to be cordial to others and able to think beyond of simple victories and defeats that characterize the Juni Taisen but beneath that, however, it’s another story altogether. While cordial on the surface Inounoshishi is shown to be a cruel and manipulative person that’s also rather cold-hearted and willing to do all that she can to secure victory and fame for herself. Perhaps as a result of this, she also displayed a certain level of arrogance at the other Zodiac houses seeing them as obstacles to her aims.  The backstory for this character I felt did an interesting job of showing the struggles that she went through as she trained to become a fighter and her gradual evolution into cruel, manipulative and intelligent person from the quiet and reluctant girl that she was then. Though by far one of the shortest-lived fighters I felt that her backstory combined with her development from that actually made her a pretty interesting character.NezumiNezumi voiced by veteran voice actor Shun Horie is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen. A member of the House of Rats of the Zodiac families Nezumi is a quiet, calm and composed person that seems to prefer solitude than working together with others. Despite that Nezumi is also shown to be intelligent and cautious in his moves willing to work together with others if their goals and ideologies remain similar to each other. While respectful and cordial towards others it can be seen that Nezumi is someone that trusts slowly and is wary of others particularly if they approached suddenly. While seemingly quiet Nezumi surprisingly can be rather talkative and perceptive at times and his analysis of the fight and its purpose was an interesting one. A prominent trait of Nezumi is his perception and his ability to understand the mood and the feelings that people near him is feeling which is a direct result of his powers. This ability I felt was an interesting one as it not only gives him an edge in combat but also able to tell if someone is trying to lie to you as well. The core ability of Nezumi, however, was by far the most interesting one but one that I felt was revealed rather late in the series. The character of Nezumi is by far the most mysterious of the fighters that took part in this years Juni Taisen.NiwatoriNiwatori voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Dragonar Academy fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s House of Roosters Niwatori on the surface is a shy, quiet and kind young woman that seems out of place on the battlefields in which the Juni Taisen is taking place. Beneath the surface however, it can be seen that the surface personality of a meek young and innocent maiden only serves as a mask for Niwatori and its what lies beneath to this that is actually her true personality. Niwatori’s true personality contrasts greatly with the young innocent maiden look that she wore when around other fighters being someone that was deceptive and adept at using her looks and behavior to secure an advantage over her opponents. This last point is helped greatly by her battle outfit which is rather revealing for someone that fights on the field. While Niwatori retains the positive and cheerful attitude that she used on her mask here it can be seen that she’s not loyal to anyone but herself and see’s others as mere stepping stones in her game of finding fame.  The character of Niwatori I felt was an interesting one that was one of the more developed characters of the series as her personalities contrasted greatly with each other. I felt that her seiyuu Ayane Sakura really did a great job voicing her.ShuryuuShuryuu voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Yamada and the Seven witches and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen. A member of the Zodiac’s house of the monkey Shuryuu is an enigma within the Zodiac families chosen for this contest as unlike the rest of the fighters Shuryuu is a pacifist by nature and works to end conflict and wars across countries rather than start and participate in them as the other houses do something that has earned her no small amount of disdain from the others. A kind, caring and honest person by nature Shuryuu is someone that having seen the worst excesses caused by humanity’s endless lust for war and conflict works tirelessly to promote peace and cooperation between countries which is an admirable concept. Despite knowing that the other Zodiac houses dislike her immensely Shuryuu is someone that cares deeply about ending the threat of conflict in the human world and even when faced by hostility will still try her utmost to help others which is best shown in her attempt to create an alliance between the 12 members at the start of the contest. Though mindful that she’s going to be a target of the other houses due to her actions it can be seen that Shuryuu is someone that’s also intelligent and inquisitive able to deduce someone’s beliefs and intents by interacting with them a fact that’s helped greatly by her ability to sense people’s intents and being sensitive to people’s feelings.  As can be expected of someone that has the attributes of one Shuryuu was noted to be a capable planner that believes in having backup plans something that I felt was really necessary for this contest. The character of Shuryuu I felt was a well-designed one as she had a personality and ideology that contrasted greatly with the other fighters and the determination to help the other fighters despite the fact that they are all trying to kill her was admirable. Saori Hayami I felt did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Shuryuu.ToraTora voiced by veteran seiyuu Hiromi Igarashi of Brave Witches and High School Fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s House of the Tiger Tora is someone that best be described as being carefree, relaxed and joyful and indeed has a very joking personality when met for the first time. Despite seemingly not taking the fight seriously Tora can become surprisingly ferocious and competitive when provoked into becoming serious and in this, we can see just how powerful her real combat skills actually are. The fact that Tora also took care to create a rather revealing outfit and act like a drunken idiot in combat in an effort to lure enemies within range of her claws I felt was an indication of her cunning as a warrior of the Tiger. The Character of Tora I felt was an interesting one, but I felt that it was her backstory and origin story that combined with her future self-was the thing that made her so as it allowed us to see the kind of person that she was like in the past and see how far she had come from her past self.  Her connection with Ox and how that allowed her to find her own path in particular I felt was especially well done.UsagiUsagi voiced by veteran voice actor Nobuhiko Okamoto of Three Gatsu no Lion and Alderamin of the sky fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s House of Rabbits Usagi is a quiet, composed and calm person on the surface and indeed, in the beginning, his nature was such that I thought he will be peaceful like Shuryuu was. However, beneath this mask, it can be seen that Usagi is someone that is intelligent, creative and really cunning and well versed at using deception to gain an advantage over his enemies. Although all of the fighters that have been chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen can be said to be notable in their respective strengths and personalities it can be said that Usagi’s is by far the most interesting and revolting of them all. The most notable trait of Usagi is without a doubt his rather warped sense of what friends are in that he seems to see friends just as he see’s other fighters which are that of mere pieces of a game that is the Juni Taisen that is to be used as shields and swords to beat his opponents with the least effort. While Usagi’s warped sense of what friends are was no doubt one of his prominent traits the other one is no doubt the ability that defines him as a member of the House of Rabbits which when combined with his creative use of tactics really made him a formidable foe on the battlefield for the others.UshiiUshii voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuichirou Umehara of Amanchu and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were selected to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s family House of the Ox Ushii even before the contest began was already well known to the world as a formidable warrior that had the ominous nickname of the Genius of slaughter. On the surface, Ushii is a calm, composed and quiet person that thanks to his vast experience at war is also wise and adept at combat and can be considered the very image of a warrior in that he’s fair and honourable preferring the direct approach. When in combat while still radiating calmness Ushii is someone that becomes serious, ruthless and determined and will fight with all his might showing no mercy and is no doubt this state that earned him such a nickname as his skill with the blade when matched with his speed make him unmatched in close combat. Though a veteran of countless battles an interesting thing about Ushii is that he will rarely make use of strategy of any kind opting to instead go for the frontal route which I felt was odd for someone with his experience. Beneath his serious nature, however, it can be seen that Ushii is someone that treats everyone that he meets with respect and kindness and is, in fact, an honourable person that believes heavily in tradition and in paying back the debts that he owes to people a side of him that was really surprising.  The character of Ushii I felt was an interesting one as though he was regarded as the ultimate warrior by many he had neither the cunning and deceptiveness that was shown by the likes of Usagi or the arrogance of Inounoshishi seemingly preferring to go with calmness and strength of arms instead. The fact that he had a somewhat kinder and more honourable side to him I felt was an interesting contrast that proved that sometimes even the fiercest of warriors can have a more human side to them that no one realises.AMVThe animation for the series I felt was pretty good especially with regards to the combat scenes that show the battles that make up the contest itself. The individual designs for each of the characters I felt were also pretty good as it gave each character a unique look that matched well with what their personality was like. Though the series was set in modern day Tokyo it notably did not feature any of the cities notable landmarks which I felt was something that they could have added in to make the combat scenes more dramatic. Music wise the series I felt had a very catchy opening theme that helped set the tone for the series being a powerful one while the ending theme also did a good job of inducing a sense of peace. Both of these were helped greatly by the visuals that the opening and ending themes make use of. In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall the voice cast did an excellent job in voicing their respective characters. In particular, I feel that Ayane Sakura, Saori Hayami, and Hiromi Igarashi deserve some particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective charactersOverall conclusionIn overall Juni Taisen, I felt was an interesting anime that had as its main strong points an interesting premise, excellent story, well-designed characters, excellent combat scenes and excellent music and voice acting. The premise of Juni Taisen itself isn’t actually anything new to the genre as we have seen the idea of a massive battle royal before such as in Akame Ga Kill and in the Fate Zero series but what makes the premise of Juni Taisen special is the fact that victories in this contest not only secure prestige and riches for the house whose representative won the battle but also affects the real-world borders that the houses control in the world as well. The idea of using such contests to determine the influence that each of the faction has on the world stage was an interesting idea as it replaced the notion of conventional war with a battle royal that pits 12 fighters against each other. The fact that each of the main characters had a well designed and developed backstory that detailed their origins and motivations for joining the Juni Taisen was also something that I enjoyed and appreciated as it added depth to them. The overall story for the series while revolving around each of the battles that were fought between the fighters was also intermingled with memories of the fighters past that was shown in between the battles that were fought between them. These past memories I felt did a really good job at not just establishing the origin stories of each of the fighters but also did well to show their development that led to them developing the personalities that they will take into the Juni Taisen itself.In overall Juni Taisen was a series that I really enjoyed watching as it not only had an intriguing premise, but it combined this with a strong story and interesting characters and well-designed combat scenes. The decision to use the past memories as a means to show the characters development that led to the Juni Taisen was also rather notable and only served to improve their development. As a final score, I would say that Juni Taisen deserves a score of 10/10. an interesting premise that when combined with the genre and theme makes it a potent combination. The traditional contest between fighters and struggles that ensures between them is reinforced by the interesting medium that it uses which is a contest between 12 houses all of which have different ideologies and the attitudes of each of the chosen fighters that take part in it.

The character of Nezumi is by far the most mysterious of the fighters that took part in this years Juni Taisen.NiwatoriNiwatori voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Dragonar Academy fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s House of Roosters Niwatori on the surface is a shy, quiet and kind young woman that seems out of place on the battlefields in which the Juni Taisen is taking place. Beneath the surface however, it can be seen that the surface personality of a meek young and innocent maiden only serves as a mask for Niwatori and its what lies beneath to this that is actually her true personality. Niwatori’s true personality contrasts greatly with the young innocent maiden look that she wore when around other fighters being someone that was deceptive and adept at using her looks and behavior to secure an advantage over her opponents. This last point is helped greatly by her battle outfit which is rather revealing for someone that fights on the field. While Niwatori retains the positive and cheerful attitude that she used on her mask here it can be seen that she’s not loyal to anyone but herself and see’s others as mere stepping stones in her game of finding fame.  The character of Niwatori I felt was an interesting one that was one of the more developed characters of the series as her personalities contrasted greatly with each other. I felt that her seiyuu Ayane Sakura really did a great job voicing her.ShuryuuShuryuu voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Yamada and the Seven witches and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen. A member of the Zodiac’s house of the monkey Shuryuu is an enigma within the Zodiac families chosen for this contest as unlike the rest of the fighters Shuryuu is a pacifist by nature and works to end conflict and wars across countries rather than start and participate in them as the other houses do something that has earned her no small amount of disdain from the others. A kind, caring and honest person by nature Shuryuu is someone that having seen the worst excesses caused by humanity’s endless lust for war and conflict works tirelessly to promote peace and cooperation between countries which is an admirable concept. Despite knowing that the other Zodiac houses dislike her immensely Shuryuu is someone that cares deeply about ending the threat of conflict in the human world and even when faced by hostility will still try her utmost to help others which is best shown in her attempt to create an alliance between the 12 members at the start of the contest. Though mindful that she’s going to be a target of the other houses due to her actions it can be seen that Shuryuu is someone that’s also intelligent and inquisitive able to deduce someone’s beliefs and intents by interacting with them a fact that’s helped greatly by her ability to sense people’s intents and being sensitive to people’s feelings.  As can be expected of someone that has the attributes of one Shuryuu was noted to be a capable planner that believes in having backup plans something that I felt was really necessary for this contest. The character of Shuryuu I felt was a well-designed one as she had a personality and ideology that contrasted greatly with the other fighters and the determination to help the other fighters despite the fact that they are all trying to kill her was admirable. Saori Hayami I felt did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Shuryuu.ToraTora voiced by veteran seiyuu Hiromi Igarashi of Brave Witches and High School Fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s House of the Tiger Tora is someone that best be described as being carefree, relaxed and joyful and indeed has a very joking personality when met for the first time. Despite seemingly not taking the fight seriously Tora can become surprisingly ferocious and competitive when provoked into becoming serious and in this, we can see just how powerful her real combat skills actually are. The fact that Tora also took care to create a rather revealing outfit and act like a drunken idiot in combat in an effort to lure enemies within range of her claws I felt was an indication of her cunning as a warrior of the Tiger. The Character of Tora I felt was an interesting one, but I felt that it was her backstory and origin story that combined with her future self-was the thing that made her so as it allowed us to see the kind of person that she was like in the past and see how far she had come from her past self.  Her connection with Ox and how that allowed her to find her own path in particular I felt was especially well done.UsagiUsagi voiced by veteran voice actor Nobuhiko Okamoto of Three Gatsu no Lion and Alderamin of the sky fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s House of Rabbits Usagi is a quiet, composed and calm person on the surface and indeed, in the beginning, his nature was such that I thought he will be peaceful like Shuryuu was. However, beneath this mask, it can be seen that Usagi is someone that is intelligent, creative and really cunning and well versed at using deception to gain an advantage over his enemies. Although all of the fighters that have been chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen can be said to be notable in their respective strengths and personalities it can be said that Usagi’s is by far the most interesting and revolting of them all. The most notable trait of Usagi is without a doubt his rather warped sense of what friends are in that he seems to see friends just as he see’s other fighters which are that of mere pieces of a game that is the Juni Taisen that is to be used as shields and swords to beat his opponents with the least effort. While Usagi’s warped sense of what friends are was no doubt one of his prominent traits the other one is no doubt the ability that defines him as a member of the House of Rabbits which when combined with his creative use of tactics really made him a formidable foe on the battlefield for the others.UshiiUshii voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuichirou Umehara of Amanchu and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were selected to take part in this year’s contest. A member of the Zodiac’s family House of the Ox Ushii even before the contest began was already well known to the world as a formidable warrior that had the ominous nickname of the Genius of slaughter. On the surface, Ushii is a calm, composed and quiet person that thanks to his vast experience at war is also wise and adept at combat and can be considered the very image of a warrior in that he’s fair and honourable preferring the direct approach. When in combat while still radiating calmness Ushii is someone that becomes serious, ruthless and determined and will fight with all his might showing no mercy and is no doubt this state that earned him such a nickname as his skill with the blade when matched with his speed make him unmatched in close combat. Though a veteran of countless battles an interesting thing about Ushii is that he will rarely make use of strategy of any kind opting to instead go for the frontal route which I felt was odd for someone with his experience. Beneath his serious nature, however, it can be seen that Ushii is someone that treats everyone that he meets with respect and kindness and is, in fact, an honourable person that believes heavily in tradition and in paying back the debts that he owes to people a side of him that was really surprising.  The character of Ushii I felt was an interesting one as though he was regarded as the ultimate warrior by many he had neither the cunning and deceptiveness that was shown by the likes of Usagi or the arrogance of Inounoshishi seemingly preferring to go with calmness and strength of arms instead. The fact that he had a somewhat kinder and more honourable side to him I felt was an interesting contrast that proved that sometimes even the fiercest of warriors can have a more human side to them that no one realises.AMVThe animation for the series I felt was pretty good especially with regards to the combat scenes that show the battles that make up the contest itself. The individual designs for each of the characters I felt were also pretty good as it gave each character a unique look that matched well with what their personality was like. Though the series was set in modern day Tokyo it notably did not feature any of the cities notable landmarks which I felt was something that they could have added in to make the combat scenes more dramatic. Music wise the series I felt had a very catchy opening theme that helped set the tone for the series being a powerful one while the ending theme also did a good job of inducing a sense of peace. Both of these were helped greatly by the visuals that the opening and ending themes make use of. In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall the voice cast did an excellent job in voicing their respective characters. In particular, I feel that Ayane Sakura, Saori Hayami, and Hiromi Igarashi deserve some particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective charactersOverall conclusionIn overall Juni Taisen, I felt was an interesting anime that had as its main strong points an interesting premise, excellent story, well-designed characters, excellent combat scenes and excellent music and voice acting. The premise of Juni Taisen itself isn’t actually anything new to the genre as we have seen the idea of a massive battle royal before such as in Akame Ga Kill and in the Fate Zero series but what makes the premise of Juni Taisen special is the fact that victories in this contest not only secure prestige and riches for the house whose representative won the battle but also affects the real-world borders that the houses control in the world as well. The idea of using such contests to determine the influence that each of the faction has on the world stage was an interesting idea as it replaced the notion of conventional war with a battle royal that pits 12 fighters against each other. The fact that each of the main characters had a well designed and developed backstory that detailed their origins and motivations for joining the Juni Taisen was also something that I enjoyed and appreciated as it added depth to them. The overall story for the series while revolving around each of the battles that were fought between the fighters was also intermingled with memories of the fighters past that was shown in between the battles that were fought between them. These past memories I felt did a really good job at not just establishing the origin stories of each of the fighters but also did well to show their development that led to them developing the personalities that they will take into the Juni Taisen itself.In overall Juni Taisen was a series that I really enjoyed watching as it not only had an intriguing premise, but it combined this with a strong story and interesting characters and well-designed combat scenes. The decision to use the past memories as a means to show the characters development that led to the Juni Taisen was also rather notable and only served to improve their development. As a final score, I would say that Juni Taisen deserves a score of 10/10."", 'Junni Taisen is the definition of ""generically unique."" The story is okay. The art is okay. The sound is okay. The characters are okay. There are some worthy moments, but there are also some terribly-made episodes (like the animation is SUPER bad for one episode).I recommend this for viewers who want something NEW, however. A deathmatch is nothing new, but its the ambiance of Junni Taisen that\'s different. Firstly, the story is told without a main character. The attention latches you in with a mystery aspect concerning many of the characters, but these are held out just as long as they need to be....The characters have pretty unique designs too, but don\'t expect anything too deep.Unlike many shows, Junni Taisen actually ends and everything is answers, which is rare. Was it satisfying, not really, but it was complete.Junni Taisen is for the enjoyment. Do not think too much and consume the fight scenes.

The show itself is first and foremost an action anime. The story is not complex or hard to follow so don’t expect any deep meaning from the plot. The animation is on point and will satisfy those who love slick battle scenes. If you like to just sit back and enjoy an easy to digest action anime then this one might be worth...a peekPersonally I don’t see why so many people gave this a low rating because to me it was a fun watch through and through. The action kept me entertained and the story kept me engaged from start to finish; that said, I think the ending could have been better.A lot of people are calling this show predictable but I really don’t see where they got that from, throughout the whole thing I couldn’t have told you who was going to win. The show doesn’t follow any particular character, instead choosing to focus on a different character each episode. You get to learn about each fighter’s histories, aspirations, and the path that brought them into the tournament. Each character is different and original and they all have their own unique skills and abilities.It doesn’t take the path of good and evil, everyone has blood on their hands and most have redeemable qualities, so it’s up to you to make up your mind on what you think of them.If they did a sequel I’d definitely put it on my plan to watch list. a peekPersonally I don’t see why so many people gave this a low rating because to me it was a fun watch through and through.

As a writer, I tend to be fair and unbiased when it comes to subjects such as what I enjoy and don't, and also tend to not let my personal interests get in the way of what I think is the score of the show. So, after three episodes, I am going to give my own score of what I think of it so far.The art is pretty unique....It has a 3D aspect to it, but sways more with the 2D character style in terms of movement. The environment is interactive with how each of the characters react with different situations, and every character has a specific interest in what type of environment they wish to be a part of. What I like most about the environment is that each character is assigned to what they feel is most comfortable, such as the Monkey and Rat hiding within the sewer to keep themselves safe, while the others scour above to look for their next victim.But the show isn't all about the environment and artwork and how good they are. It also has its downsides. This show, already, goes way too fast. And don't get me wrong, I don't mean timewise—characters that someone seems fond of always gets killed off early, such as the Dog. I loved that character the moment I saw him. I knew he would be strong, but when the anime kills him off so early, it makes me disappointed that I won't get to see someone I enjoy watching prevail instead of some other phony character.That is what I want to talk about next: perspective and the enjoyment of characters. This anime doesn't give us the fulfillment of having one character and being in that perspective. Instead, with every episode, it switches around and causes mass confusion. Of course, it provides us with backstory of everyone, but it never sticks with one character, so we don't get to see how they develop emotionally. I think the closest we got to having a change in emotional view of the battle was the Chicken before she died. But, sadly, that was it. I think it was misleading to start out with Boar and have her killed off, because it made me very confused as to why they would kill a main character.So overall, after talking about what I had previewed in my mind and what I wanted to express, I would give this show just a 6 for now. It's enjoyable, but not very good. It has a 3D aspect to it, but sways more with the 2D character style in terms of movement.

The universe is not well fleshed out and a lot of the plot is pretty predictable. Death flags everywhere.I still enjoyed the show, the fight animations look great and though it\'s not difficult to predict who\'s gonna win, it\'s still fun to guess.What\'s nice is that each character gets their own episode, fleshing out their back story so we can get an idea of what sort of background each of the warriors comes from. Each character is memorable in their own right and none...of them are completely unlikable.There\'s two main criticisms of this anime: the first is that it\'s really predictable. But I would say that the predictable nature was established as a given for the series from episode 1. Ultimately the show isn\'t about who dies, but how they lived and how they died. It\'s about the journey rather than the destination. Not that the show is all that deep, but it\'s not entirely brainless.The second criticism is the ending. A lot of people disagree with the winner\'s choices and while I don\'t want to spoil too much, the show does reach a satisfying conclusion. ""Wtf I wouldn\'t have wished for that"" is not a valid criticism because they haven\'t lived the life of any of these characters. Ultimately, all of the warriors are human, with human desires (well except rabbit) and human weaknesses despite their ridiculous weapons and powers. of them are completely unlikable.There\'s two main criticisms of this anime: the first is that it\'s really predictable.

I suppose reviews are usually like that, so even if you just wanna read reviews if you personally disliked the anime, you might enjoy seeing a different viewpoint.But now let\'s get to the actual review. If you plan to watch it and don\'t want spoilers, don\'t read past this, though. Cause I\'m gonna take this apart a little, and there\'s gonna be some little spoilers.At first, I wasn\'t gonna watch Juuni Taisen. It was in the ""New episode""-section whenever I...went to my streaming site of choice, and I didn\'t really notice it. That was until my friend, a sworn lover of Battle Royale anime texted me some screenshots, telling me to watch it as soon as possible.So me, bored and having wanted to pick up another seasonal anime just said ""ok, sure"" and I went to said steaming site of choice and checked out the first episode. I\'m not a big fan of Battle Royale stuff, usually. It\'s cool in wrestling, but in anime? Eh, I had yet to find something I enjoyed.I definetely enjoyed Juuni Taisen.Story - 7/10A lot of people call this show ""predictable"", and they\'re not wrong. If you know the chinese zodiac, or know the story of ""the Zodiac Race"", you\'ll know who\'ll win the anime. Hell, if you watch the ending or even pay attention, you know who\'ll win. And after two episodes, the old ""Backstory equals Death""-cliche kind of makes it easy to know who\'ll die, too, so if you want to be surprised about who dies... Yeah, this probably isn\'t for you.So why did I still give it  seven points, even though the story was predictable and the deaths were mostly unpredictable? Well, the backstories were interesting, the reason the ""Juuni Taisen"" was held was kinda cool, and it was exciting to wonder about who would kill the victim the of the week, how they\'d die, etc.Towards the end of the show, there\'s even a little plot twist I genuinely didn\'t expect. I can see how the last episode made people get mad, by the way, but I found it bittersweet, and I like the idea of the winner\'s wish having been just that.The reason it\'s still only seven of ten, is the fact that sometimes the flashbacks slowed down the flow, alongside some minor stuff, but it\'s still pretty good in my opinion.Art - 8/10Art and animation are definetely pretty well done. There\'s a lot of CGI, but to my surprise, it wasn\'t bad. Sure, sometimes, it was a bit weird on some characters in particular, but the action scenes definetely were made really dynamic at times because of it. The art style itself is pretty nice, making the characters look colorful and expressive. I also find a lot of the designs very attractive, which is a plus, if you\'re a shipper like me.Backgrounds were fitting too, usually the city the tournament was set in, a lot of battlefields in the flashbacks, sometimes more domestic stuff. The characters fit in them well, and interacted with them a fair bit.The way the ""camera"" moved helped making the shots more interesting too. All in all, the art was good, and I liked it a lot.Sound - 9/10The music, OP and ED included, was honestly really good. Especially the opening is something I listen to on a regular basis now (and the art in it is real good). The OST is all in all enjoyable, not forcing you to pay special attention to it, just setting the mood for the scenes. I can\'t even say a lot about it, it genuinely just was a good soundtrack. But I\'m also known for not knowing music, so this is particularly subjective.The voice actors did a great job as well, having just the right amount of ham for some of the characters. I can\'t really think of any character who didn\'t have a fitting voice, so kudos.Characters - 8/10Gotta admit: The reason I didn\'t rate this higher is because my favorite character didn\'t get any backstory, and I\'m salty about it. But they still were a colorful bunch, and I loved them.The girls, while all sexy and most of them wearing revealing stuff, each had their own personality without being reduced to a single character trait and being only there for the fanservice. The guys were equally fun, having a range of different body types and age ranges. A lot of them were ""edgy"" (especially Usagi), but that made them more enjoyable to me, because it\'s the type of edginess that makes something more fun. I liked the weird outfits everyone was wearing to look more like their zodiac sign (Tiger\'s fake ears, striped bikini and boots and tail-collar thingie, Boar\'s little hair-buns looking like pig ears and her tusk-earrings, Dog\'s dog ears and fur-cloak, Rabbit\'s.. everything), and the overall designs.Their powers also were really cool, even if some of them lacked proper explanations on how the hell that would work. So.. yeah. I liked those characters.Enjoyment - 10/10With all the edginess, the gore and the crazy action, I found myself really enjoying this show. I\'m a bit of a gore-hound already, and Juuni Taisen just really indulged me, giving me rolling hands, impaled torsos and a bulking abomination of reassambled flesh.It wasn\'t a perfect show, but just something you could watch and enjoy the crazy violence and weird plot twists from time to time. I honestly had a lot of fun, even if there\'s shows I like more.It was, what it promised to be, a colorful, crazy gorefest. And I\'m glad I watched it.Overall - 8/10As I said, it\'s not the best show ever. It\'s got its flaws, it\'s predictable (if you don\'t like that) and it was edgy, but it was just really, really fun. I get why people wouldn\'t like it, or why they\'d drop it, but it\'s a fun watch.And this marks the end of my super subjective, really biased and kinda messy review. If anyone who hasn\'t watched this read this until now, and found themselves thinking ""Wow, that sounds kinda fun, I might check it out"", I\'d tell them to give it a try. Maybe they\'d decide to drop it after a few episodes, or get mad at the sorta cop-out at the end, but.. yeah.Juuni Taisen definetely made my autumn a little more fun.

I\'m glad my friend made me watch it.', ""This is one of those shows I loved so much that I started plotting how a Western live-adaptation would go about it.-The story, whilst nothing TOO creative, still adds a nice little spin on the 'Battle Royal' genre by making all the characters resemble the Chinese Zodiac animals. The show usually eliminates one contender per episode which is fine BUT it kinda tells you at the start of the episode who it's going to be by giving you all their backstory (not ALWAYS the case but just have it in mind). This personally doesn't ruin it for me as it's still as much of a...surprise as the start of the episode and the journey of the episode is definitely still interesting enough to watch. The ending also very satisfying and not one of those cop-out shows that are becoming all too familiar these days - the 'winner' is surprising and the 'prize' is also cool.- Art and sound nothing special what you would expect from shows now a days (which is actually pretty high quality).- Each character definitely has their own distinct personality and has an interesting backstory to watch. The show begins with presenting you a supposed protagonist in the 1st episode and then completely pulls the rug out from under you which was a nice surprise and something I hadn't seen before in an anime. You can start to root for one character to win but for me personally I just had characters I didn't want to win. The backstory for the twin characters does drag on for too long (goes over two episodes) and kinda takes you outta the story for a bit but a minor failing.TLDR: Basically an anime Hunger Games with very interesting characters. surprise as the start of the episode and the journey of the episode is definitely still interesting enough to watch.

So what exactly is Juuni Taisen? I\'ll try not to write any Spoilers on this review, but you are warned.The story of this anime goes around 12 War Assassins that are gathered to participate on a ""Battle Royale"" fest, the last man standing will have the power to have a wish. But Juuni Taisen is not exactly what you think it might be, take it...this way: Juuni Taisen is NOT an action anime, at first I thought that Juuni Taisen would succeed if the fights were good despise not having story at all, sadly the fights were just a predictable slaughter fest to get rid of characters in order to have a winner. The true purpose of this anime, the one I found, were found in the very end, the wish. If you are the winner of the Juuni Taisen you get a wish, but what wish will you choose? Wealth?, Safety? World\'s Peace? ""Not even 100 wishes could end a man\'s ambition"" is an interesting quote I found at the end of this anime. Story: 4/10The animation were smooth in the first episode, but each week the animation went downhill to the point of having CGi Models for the last fights, and it didn\'t just look bad, but pretty out of place after that amazing first episode and the animation that were set on it. Still some fights are quite good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Art: 6/10The OP sequence is quite catchy, there were some interesting fighting generic soundtrack included on this Anime as well as the sound effects, nothing really impressive, but it is quite enough. Sound: 5/10This anime consist on the formula of setting death flags each time a character\'s back ground story is told, so there isn\'t a significant development to almost any character on this anime, except for the winner. Gladly I liked how it won and how much it struggled to get its wish. This end up being an interesting way to fill the lack of character development that this anime generated, it was interesting enough to redeem (Just a bit) this anime. Characters: 6/10I won\'t lie, I did like this anime, even if it were predictable, it was enjoyable enough, specially towards the end. Sadly it wasn\'t as good as I thought it would be. It could have been better, specially if it didn\'t have such stupid and pathetic way to kill off characters after showing up their background stories. At the end I discovered the true purpose of this anime, which wasn\'t a Battle Royale, but the wish, which was meant for the viewer to think about it, to elaborate what it is to have a wish to fulfill. What will it be? will it be enough? Is it right? That\'s up to you. Enjoyment 7/10Overall 5,6 (6)/10: So Juuni Taisen isn\'t entirely a bad Anime, but it isn\'t that great either, it has its highs and its lows, This anime could have been a masterpiece if it were polished on a different way rather than being predictable. this way: Juuni Taisen is NOT an action anime, at first I thought that Juuni Taisen would succeed if the fights were good despise not having story at all, sadly the fights were just a predictable slaughter fest to get rid of characters in order to have a winner.

Ok, so in a city of  half a million people somewhere in China (trust me such ghost city does exist) all been removed to give way to the 12th Zodiac Tournament which takes place every 12 years.  Where 12 of the deadliest mercenary warriors (at least that\'s what it says) with the names and attributes of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals are pitted against...each other, the prize, one wish that could change their lives...or at least that\'s the plot..............but....................:Good 7, Story: Killing me softly..........That\'s not the whole case in this anime, good as it is since it was suppose to be a survival of the fittest, for a while it did deliver some sort of excitement of seeing them duke out with each other, that\'s the good part, but when one realizes as to how the characters die one by one, one would get the sense that the winner was already decided from the start. Now don\'t get me wrong , it has a good plot at least in paper, but as it goes on, the fighting and how the character dies becomes less of a priority and the focus was on the backstories of the characters, in a way it does provide some touching moment about some of the characters like Niwa Tori\'s and Kanae Aira\'s backstory, where you\'ll sympathize with them as to the horrors that they have undergone, but all that get\'s wash down as how evil they become. It\'s like giving you something nice only to be shock of the strings attached.Poor 3, Art: Killing by DisgustThere goes them Japaneses\' over-elaborate sense of crime of fashion, the character illustration were everything were just too ill-fitted, so let\'s go over them:Toshiko Inō/Boar- In the start of the tournament we see her dressed for success , so why the heck was she wearing an office attire when she could have wore her outfit when she\'s killing some mrecs at the start of the first episode?Michio Tsukui/Dog- Was he suppose to look like a dog or a werewolf? Cu\'z his outfit was just too shabby to even be a hitman, he basically can pass as an mountain man who would kill anybody who stray in his territory.Ryōka Niwa/Rooster/Chicken- So, as a chicken , what\'s up with that pitch fork that she never get;s to used?????Also, she\'s suppose to look like a chicken and not a club stripper who dresses up like a parrot. Also, the character should have been a man not some chicken shit girl who kills deceptively.Misaki Yūki (Sharyu)/Monkey- Ok, she a mix of someone who is suppose to go hiking because of her backpack, green fatigue jacket  and hiking shoes and someone who is going to an  AKB48  audition  with her zettai ryoki, head phone and bloomers, also her tied down hair and glasses add\'s to her dorkyness.Sumihiko Tsujiie/Ram/Sheep- They should have use the younger version of him, his outfit makes him look like someone who should be in the 1880\'s era in Japan.Yoshimi Sōma/Horse- All that muscle and meat should belong to the Bull.Takeyasu Tsumita/Snake- Well he\'s dressed for the occasion, I give him that, but he should be handling a freeze gun and not a flame thrower.Nagayuki Tsumita/Dragon- All white, seriously?????Also he ought be carry a flame thrower and not Capt Cold\'s freeze gun.Usagi/Rabbit- Face-palm, major crime of fashion, he\'s like a gay stripper with that big puffy tail , rabbit ears and high heels.Kanae Aira/Tiger- Ok, so were there any beaches or a pool party going on around the setting that she has to be in a bikini????? Major face-palm, major not dressed for the occasion............ though she does look hot in it. It would have been better if she opted for her Karate Gi than that bikini.Eiji Kashii/Ox- Long hair, slim body, GAAAAAAYYYYYYYY, also that matador outfit????Sheees, he should be in the Bull Ring duking it with a wild bull, also he should have been the one to have the horse\'s meat and muscle and use his strrups as his killing weapon and not that Calvary saber.Tsugiyoshi Sumino (Nezumi)/Rat- His attire makes him look like a member of the Power Rangers, which is too dorky and his hair was just too disgusting that he needs to see a hair stylist.Duedeculpe- Is there a circus around here, cu\'z that where he should be? Or maybe he\'s pimp, either way he\'s a major crime of fashion.I really don\'t understand why in their back stories them characters were dressed for that occasion and not in this occasion .Good 7, Sound: Killing me with joyThe score was for the opening and closing theme, cu\'s it suited that anime well, and that\'s that.Poor 3, Characters: Killing the chefOk, so, I did mention something about being misplaced, also there is big plot hole as to how they got there special abilities which makes us wonder as how they got it in the first place  , so let\'s discuss each of them:Duedeculpe- The moderator of the Juuni taisen/ Wish granter who has the ability to grant any wish for the victor, so is he a man with influence or a demon? That is the question,given that he can grant such wish like magic and at the same time works like a mafia boss who makes money on the competition.Tsugiyoshi Sumino (Nezumi)/Rat-  He\'s the Killing All or Killing by Swarm or wtf kind of killing method he does, but the fact is he hardly kill anyone at all , the death of Ox was with consent and with his ""Hundred Paths"" shit kinda make him a cheater, which is the only way he won, but in the end the wish he choose was to forget the tournament was just too lame . Also him being the obvious winner serves as one reason for my score.Eiji Kashii/Ox-The Killing Systematically guy, does he do that, cu\'s it doesn\'t look that way, cu\'z he doesn\'t show any interest in joining the monkey\'s peace proposal, also, at the first couple of episode we see him just stab and slash anyone he sees , so where is the systematically there? Looks more like he\'s killing randomly, his killing should have gone to the rabbit cu\'z he is the one who kills systematically.Kanae Aira/Tiger- The Killing in a Drunken Rage kind of a girl, she started as a High School girl who is into martial arts who becomes crazy and drowns her sorrow with allota alcohol, so her being this Killing in a Drunken Rage, is not enough to describe her as a whole, she should have been the Killing Psychotically While in a Drunken Rage one ,cu\'z in her backstory we did see her running amuck while killing were she see herself no longer a human but an animal and that is where the psychotically part belongs.Usagi/Rabbit-The psychotic homo, ok so he\'s the Killing Psychotically guy, but let\'s not forget even psycho kills systematically so he should have been the Killing Systematically guy and not the Ox.Nagayuki Tsumita/Dragon and Takeyasu Tsumita/Snake- They are like oil and water that original creator Nisio Isin tries to mix, ok so they both Kill for Money, but they both have a double standard in fact they are a double standard in everyway , they love money and yet we see them threw it away, they\'re both part of some cult that has different views and worshiped different patron deity  and yet they function as criminal organization. So basically each twin can be any side of the coin, which is why for them to the Killing For Money twins doesn\'t suit them, Killing Deceptively is what they should be since they\'re very deceptive not only to others but to each other as well, as seen when the snake get to be killed by the Rabbit the dragon doesn\'t seem to mind, in fact he even feels relived to see his twin bro dead. also, it was unfair that the snake has to die first, his role should have been utilize further since he has to be the 7th person to die.Yoshimi Sōma/Horse- So the man who is the Killing Silently is a pussy, disappointing that he has already lost his nerve the moment he encounters the Ox. Shit, all that muscle and speed , not to mention all the things he has undergone to have all that ability only went to waste. Killing His Time , is what he should be.Sumihiko Tsujiie/Ram/Sheep- This Killing Deceptively old man, shouldn\'t even be in the tournament , unless the Original Creator uses a younger version of him. His Killing Deceptively doesn\'t quite make him , since he was more if a bomb and trap  guy,  so Killing Silently should have been his title, also his Killing Deceptively isn\'t limited to him, cu\'z even the boar, chicken and them twins also kill deceptively.Misaki Yūki (Sharyu)/Monkey- Ok, she a pacifist and a peace maker who prefers to Kill Peacefully, frankly her character was an oxymoron, cu\'z how can she have such title as Killing Peacefully when she hates to see people dying, also, why would she be a merc when it\'s very obvious that she specializes in negotiations rather than warfare, she prefer to use her kung fu skills than with a weapon such as a gun or a knife.... Frankly the best way to describe her character in general was that she is like a knife in a gunfight or a dove in a flock of raptors, so really she should have the title Killing by Nagging. Also, the part where we see her setting explosive should have been done by the Sheep since he like things that goes BOOM.Ryōka Niwa/Rooster/Chicken- Her Killing by Pecking was just sooooo lame , he should have had the rat\'s Killing All , since she, like them twins, was also as deceptive as them, as seen in her backstory and as we see she does kill all even her own side.Michio Tsukui/Dog- As much as I hate to say it , his Killing by Biting suit him well, since dogs do carry rabies.Toshiko Inō/Boar- For her to be this Killing Bounty fully is an understatement, since she has the ability to convince somebody to kill for her ,so she should have been the Killing by Mongering, since she did used some kind of hypnosis to make her sister kill everyone she knows, then again too bad she\'s the first to die, if we can call it that.Good 7, Enjoyment: Killing by excitementIt was exciting when you haven\'t figure out the order of death, which is good, but as you find out the order, you\'ll be a bit disgusted , since the one you expect to put up a good fight didn\'t happen, the one we expect to win didn\'t happen cu\'z there is reverse order of death, soooooooo....Poor 3, Overall: Everybody Clap Your Hands..........Was poorly executed, too predictable, and a plothole as to how those contestant got such ability were never mentioned.......season 2???????? Maybe. each other, the prize, one wish that could change their lives...or at least that\'s the plot..............but....................:Good 7, Story: Killing me softly..........That\'s not the whole case in this anime, good as it is since it was suppose to be a survival of the fittest, for a while it did deliver some sort of excitement of seeing them duke out with each other, that\'s the good part, but when one realizes as to how the characters die one by one, one would get the sense that the winner was already decided from the start.

The only halfway redeeming quality is the female competitors go around half naked, but it\'s not enough to hold your attention.If you like story, don\'t waste your time. If you like character development, don\'t waste your time. If you like epic, mindless battles, don\'t waste your time.This anime has nothing to offer except to eat some of your life.I\'m supposed to write a longer review, but there is nothing more that can be...said without spoiling some plot.

Also there’s very little world building or explanation. Conversely this show didn’t promise any of that. And it delivered on what it was selling. The characters are unique and diverse, but at the same time characters based on the zodiac (be it Eastern and/or Western) isn’t all that unique or creative. It leaves the whole series feeling rushed, like someone ordered a quick rip off of Akame Ga Kill and they came up with this. I don’t...want to compare it to other ”battle royale deathmatch” anime, but both AgK and MGRP had better stories and characters than this. But it has great action scenes and the stories are entertaining. And, like MGRP it delivers what it promises. It’s worth the watch if you’re the kind of person who craves action, violence, gore and on screen character death.Everybody clap your hands! want to compare it to other ”battle royale deathmatch” anime, but both AgK and MGRP had better stories and characters than this.

So the show is about 12 warriors representing the Chinese Zodiac, in a killing game against each other known as the Juuni Taisen. These warriors have, some subtle, some not so subtle, superpowers of some sort. Whomever wins the Juuni Taisen will be granted one wish of their choosing. Okay, so this anime was initially praised for being truly unpredictable, until you get about 3-4 episodes in then you can see the death order obviously. Although, this is not different from other popular death game shows and doesn't ruin the basis of the...show at all. It definitely lost potential when it showed the order of deaths so abruptly. The art is nothing special, and unfortunately the animation takes a big dip in certain parts of the show, but I don't think that makes it show terrible. I enjoy the character designs, they really play into what the character was meant to represent in the Zodiac. I would recommend this show to somebody who doesn't particularly care about being spoiled about death order, but who wants to see how they would die. I give this show a 7 out of 10. If the order of death would have not been mentioned, then it would have definitely gotten a higher score. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Juuni Taisen. show at all.

This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Juuni Taisen."", ""This anime is loosely based on the Zodiac Race. Is it worth your time? Definitely. Are you looking for a traditional Battle Royal anime? Then this is not for you.Story:The plot is what you will expect from a battle royal anime, but this time the focus is less on who is going to die, and more of a brief study of the aspirations and mindset each participating character has in this event. In that regard, it's also less about the battles themselves and more about the history and hubris of the characters; and in what way would it lead to their fate. If you...are aware of the Zodiac Race, or have seen the first two episodes, then you would know immediately in what order each character will die. Juuni Taisen also heavily utilises tropes of irony and poetry.Animation:The combat scenes are well animated, despite not being the main focus. And the animation on a whole is consistent. There is one particular episode where the quality dipped lower than what's usual for this anime, but it wasn't to the point where the anime suffered. Computer generated animation was used in place of the more common 2D hand-drawn animation in that episode, but it was done in a way that it didn't matter.The art for the characters are well-done as well. Each character has their own distinctive look and are easily recognisable from each other. They also have their own special way of walking and running, which helps sell each of their personalities.

Juuni Taisen also heavily utilises tropes of irony and poetry.Animation:The combat scenes are well animated, despite not being the main focus. And the animation on a whole is consistent. There is one particular episode where the quality dipped lower than what's usual for this anime, but it wasn't to the point where the anime suffered. Computer generated animation was used in place of the more common 2D hand-drawn animation in that episode, but it was done in a way that it didn't matter.The art for the characters are well-done as well. Each character has their own distinctive look and are easily recognisable from each other. They also have their own special way of walking and running, which helps sell each of their personalities.

Even though they usually only span one episode, viewers are left with a well painted picture of each protagonist, which sheds light on both internal and external conflicts we see today.  The pacifist\'s story was especially clever and touches on the idea of empathy being the missing link in modern day politics.  The twin\'s story explains why charity fails to solve the underlying causes of human suffering (our own corrupted values).  And tiger\'s story touches on moral subjectivity...but more importantly, what it means to hold fundamental principles and WHY we hold those beliefs.2) The ending was fantastic.  Rat\'s dilemma really makes us consider what our purpose in life is and what we truly want.  Most people go through life seeking their dreams and aspirations without truly understanding what those aspirations are.  Rat\'s internal conflict and eventual decision, especially pertinent as he is a high schooler, highlights the problems of modern day education (being a ""cog in the social machine""): brilliant.Dislikes:1) Fight\'s could have been longer and better choreographed.  I was oftentimes dissapointed by the overwhelming character buildup and underlwhelming death scene.Overall, Juuni Taisen is able to fit a great deal of content into a 12 episode series.  The story takes a common premise but like the Fate series, is able to incorporate insightful philosophies while keeping the episodes interesting.  The series is easily a 7.BTWI don\'t have a problem with main characters dying.  I\'m a fan of the Game of Thrones style.

I just remember myself looking through the currently airing anime, saw a fairly simple premise, and thought I’d give something a shot I normally wouldn’t. I am glad I did so, actually.Story:If you have any clue as to what a “Battle royale” is, you’ll have a decent grasp of how the story of Juuni Taisen is set up. Twelve warriors, each representing an animal from the Chinese zodiac, battling to the death trying to get a single wish granted. Simple, isn’t it?...In fact, this story is almost too barren at points.Whilst the story manages to keep focused on the war itself, the part we came to see, it then sacrifices world-building. How can this war be arranged? Who set it up? How did they erase an entire city’s worth of citizens? Things like this are basically just left in the air, and whilst I can understand leaving some things unexplained, these questions bugged me throughout the whole anime, and I was constantly hoping to get explanations eventually, only to then get a very minor scene at about midway, and that’s it. You could say they knew what they needed to focus on, but it’s not like the story structure of this anime was even that complicated.Characters:So, you might be wondering, where did they focus on, if not the story? The battles? Well, even that isn’t the case, actually. Instead, Juuni Taisen decided to build on our twelve warriors a bit, by essentially giving everyone a single episode where they were the spotlight, flashbacks and all. Just saying that out loud doesn’t sound that bad, right? At least they treated everyone equally, you may think.Well, it is true that pretty much all of the characters got an equal amount of background, they basically shot themselves in the foot at the same time. If it wasn’t obvious already, I can tell you that a single episode is not enough time to get the viewer to care about any given character. Especially when a lot of the runtime of every episode was just those flashbacks, which weren’t even that creative. So, to sum this up, they developed every character, but then in turn didn’t develop anybody enough. Parallels the phrase “Jack of all trades but master of none” quite well.Animation and sound:It’s unfortunate how much potential Juuni Taisen had, only to then end up rather disappointing in the end. By that I meant that the first episode especially had above average animation-quality, and some great choreography to boot. The animation wasn’t really ever as impressive as back then, and by episode 9 I can only assume the budget got so abysmal that they had to resort to CG animation. I’m not kidding. For just one episode, the scenes in present time were in CG, whilst the flashback-scenes of the episode had just really poor regular animation. It wasn’t as bad afterward, sure, but the score for the animation overall suffered heavily due to that one episode.So, when one comes to watch a battle royale story, it’s understandable that they would like some action, or at least mind-games, correct? Seems like the people creating Juuni Taisen didn’t quite get that memo, however. Yes, ironically enough, this battle royale anime actually has very bare-bones action. And no, this is not a battle royale that isn’t supposed to have action, it’s meant to be a brawl. So it certainly started disappointing me when I saw how short every fight of the show was. That, and only a couple characters got an actual satisfying death, and a select few of the people who didn’t, felt almost rushed or unfinished.In terms of sound, I don’t have much to say. There aren’t any tracks that were that memorable, although I do remember it being passable overall. The opening song, Rapture by Panorama Panama Town, was a delightful surprise that I’m listening to right now as I’m writing this, in fact. The ending was also decent, although definitely not on the same level.Enjoyment:So far, I wouldn’t blame you if you thought the first paragraph was from a completely different review, but maybe it all starts to make sense here. Despite falling short of even good on basically every category, Juuni Taisen pulled through in one aspect; Its concept.Not every anime has to strife to be amazing, and I feel like the author of Juuni Taisen definitely got that. The story was so simplistic that it didn’t need to do anything outstanding or unique. The animation didn’t need to be breathtaking, the characters didn’t need to be developed too much other that giving the viewers an opportunity to differentiate each of them. If anything, the character-designs were so unique already that they didn’t even need to go much beyond that. If you look at Juuni Taisen as what it is instead of what it could’ve been, it isn’t disappointing in the slightest. If anything, it delivered its promise, and its simple premise got me interested, kept me hooked, and ended the story with me having a smile on my face the whole time. A job well done.Conclusion:Fate/Zero was a battle roayle anime that excelled at creating memorable characters with varied ideals and ambitions, and pinned those ideals against each other beautifully. And despite having insufferable main characters, Mirai Nikki succeeded as a battle royale with giving a unique set of powers for each contestant. Juuni Taisen, however, was a good battle royale anime by being just that. It didn’t do anything exceptionally well, if anything it was disappointing in a lot of ways, but Juuni Taisen’s fun-factor and simplicity are the things that made it enjoyable as a watch.If you’re a fan of battle roayles like me, then definitely give Juuni Taisen a shot. If not, then I say it’s up to your own discretion. It’s not something I’d go out of my way to recommend to people, but to those that are curious, I say go right ahead. Take it as what it is and you’ll definitely get your wish granted.Final score: 7 In fact, this story is almost too barren at points.Whilst the story manages to keep focused on the war itself, the part we came to see, it then sacrifices world-building.

Take it as what it is and you’ll definitely get your wish granted.Final score: 7', 'So, Juuni Taisen, eh? It was on my watch-list while I was watching the Summer anime of 2017, and now that I have watched it, what do I think of it? To be straightforward about it, this anime was probably my greatest disappointment in 2017. I’m usually not surprised if an anime is really bad, since I usually read the reviews and check its rating before I watch it. I did the same this time, but somewhere deep inside my heart, I was hoping that there might be at least one decent element to this anime. Perhaps the action scenes, perhaps the opening song, or...perhaps a certain character that stands out? That wasn’t the case at all. I was let down by every aspect of Juuni Taisen.I took an interest in Juuni Taisen because of its creator, Nisio Isin. He was also the author of the much acclaimed Monogatari series. The Monogatari series follows an excellent narrative and is able to indulge it’s viewers in the story, while Juuni Taisen focuses more on its characters. The plot of Juuni Taisen is pretty simple- it’s a battle royal among 12 warriors who have individual fighting styles that define them, and are each designated as one of the zodiac signs from the Chinese zodiac. Sounds familiar? Yes, the it’s similar to the Fate Series.  But, that doesn’t matter as there are several anime with a battle royal theme. No complications until this part, but the problem starts from the first episode. It’s simply too predictable, unlike what a battle royal should be. The story is not compelling enough to persuade you keep watching, but even in case you decide to watch the rest, you’ll realize that it’s predictable for the entire 12 episodes. The plot had a lot of potential but it was poorly executed.If you like blood, gore and psychotic bloodthirsty characters hunting down people all over a city, then maybe this anime is for you. For me though, it just didn’t work. Since I am talking about the predictability of this anime, let me just give you an example of how predictable it is- they pretty much show the order in which the cast dies in the opening video itself. I am a fan of anime openings with subtle clues about the story and plot, and one anime that does this beautifully would be Your Lie In April, but Juuni Taisen is just stupid. I mean there’s a thing called subtlety! You just don’t go ahead and put the order in which the characters die on the opening song! Get it together, guys.As I have mentioned before, the show focuses on its characters, and despite that I could not find myself attached to the characters at all. Every character is provided with a backstory, and whenever the recounting of a particular character’s backstory begins, it means the said character is going to meet an untimely death sooner or later. The only character I felt myself feeling sorry for was Tora (Tiger), and even that was just a marginal emotion. The characters die in the most ridiculous ways. After all the talk of how skilled and experienced they are, they do the stupidest mistakes and poof, they’re gone. The worst character would be Usagi (Rabbit), since he is not even given a backstory like the others. The character of Usagi is just a sorry excuse for a psychotic, bloodthirsty killer they needed for the advancement of the story. For an anime that relies on its characters to make up the story, Juuni Taisen does a poor job at character development.What can I say about the animation? Animated by studio Graphinica, the animation is awful too. The animators are so lazy that none of the battle sequences have been properly animated and this is supposed to be a battle royal. The trifling number of sword exchanges that have been animated are just a bunch of stills that are put together. As for the sound- wait there were sound effects? What? If there were, they were so appalling that I did not even notice them. Both the opening and ending songs fail to make an impact. I felt that they were just monotonous and boring.So, would I recommend watching Juuni Taisen? Well if you’re someone who likes to watch unoriginal, thoughtless action that shows blood and gore and wouldn’t mind the predictability, then go ahead. I was greatly disappointed by this anime, and I hope I never come across something like this again. It’s just a waste of time for me and any person who likes to watch decent content. Sure, it had great potential, but potential in theory doesn’t matter if the creators have already failed to exploit that potential and made a sorry excuse for an anime. perhaps a certain character that stands out?

Unlike the other characters in the series like the Zoldycks, the Phantom Troupe, Chimera Ants or the Chairman, they never showed us any of their skills in battle, their awesomeness or why they even deserved to be Netero's successors. They never lived up to their premise as the strongest hunters and all they did was bicker like children over the Chairman's position.Now imagine someone else had the same idea, took that concept and did a total reimagining...of the characters. With the same style and execution of Hunter X Hunter, with the same kind of deadly power battles and retaining the same cleverness and philosophy that runs concurrent to the series. This, my friends, is what you'd get with Juuni Taisen.Twelve Zodiac warriors, coming together every twelve years in a battle to the death to determine the best of their number. With the reward of having their most desired wish granted, the participants will pull out all stops, to fight, to survive, and win. It's a simple concept and one that Juuni Taisen have executed with style.The battles are wildly entertaining, you never know what's going to happen. Its like whenever think you think everything's gonna be ok, something comes along and unexpected things happen.The enemies are clever. They play mind games. They're over the top and do tons of crazy stuff. It's such a thrill to watch because often, in many animes, especially shounen types, you pretty much know how a fight is going to turn out before it even begins. But this? No way. I've never seen protags gets off'ed in such unexpected ways. lol.The music was superb and very well suited to the show. I especially liked the OP with the badass shadowed frames, almost like a homage to the Madhouse series.As for the characters, they are definitely a varied bunch in this series. Love'em or hate'em but you've got to admit they're unique. They just ooze personality. And I think that's part of the charm. It's such a wild clash of egos and character types. In keeping with the Zodiac theme, it's almost like an experiment of what would happen if you threw a bunch of wild animals like tigers, rabbits, snakes, etc into a room together. Only they're not normal animals but are equipped with machine guns, explosives and super powers!Yet beneath all that chaotic fighting, the story still goes into enough depth of the background of each character that you still find yourself rooting for them as time goes by. Some of their philosophies may be flawed, yet it also shows they're human. With all the contradictions therein. It's a nice touch that speaks to the quality of writing.In conclusion I believe this is one hell of an underrated gem that has flown under the radar. It's so good that I wish they should straight up replace the whole HxH chairman election arc with Juuni Taisen!

Love'em or hate'em but you've got to admit they're unique. They just ooze personality. And I think that's part of the charm. It's such a wild clash of egos and character types. In keeping with the Zodiac theme, it's almost like an experiment of what would happen if you threw a bunch of wild animals like tigers, rabbits, snakes, etc into a room together. Only they're not normal animals but are equipped with machine guns, explosives and super powers!Yet beneath all that chaotic fighting, the story still goes into enough depth of the background of each character that you still find yourself rooting for them as time goes by. Some of their philosophies may be flawed, yet it also shows they're human. With all the contradictions therein. It's a nice touch that speaks to the quality of writing.In conclusion I believe this is one hell of an underrated gem that has flown under the radar. It's so good that I wish they should straight up replace the whole HxH chairman election arc with Juuni Taisen! Then it'll be the perfect series ^^!(BTW don't read too much into negative reviews, like SAO it's just unfairly targeted by hater trolls on this site.)"", ""Well well well, after all of this recent chit chat over the new holy grail of existence (Battle Royales), I looked through the list of anime I missed while hibernating in fall 2017 and the only thing that really stood out to me (besides 3-gatsu, of course but that's another story) was Juuni Taisen, an anime in which 12 furries engage in bloody combat for the grand prize of ONE WEESH!! Yes, my blood is pumping like a jackrabbit on a frick frackin tortoise hare if ya ask me!Seriously though, all of these new battle royale games really aren't that fun. I mean, they...have a good idea, but the execution just isn't there. UNLIKE Juuni Taisen, of course! Seroosly though, the execution in JT is god-like. The pacing is so well balanced and while everyone seems to be complaining about the backstories in almost eery dernd epis0de, I really liked these backstories, and the blending between the backstories and present fights just worked so well. So what if they predict who dies neckst, because it pretty dern fun watchin' dem backstoris rat?!?I'm sure you know the basic plot by know, so let's dive into the furries. 12 people played SO MUCH Animal Jam that they transformed into animal people in real life. Seriously, I see so many similarities between this and Mahou Shoujo Isukei Keikaku (bless jesus if I spelled that right)(also I haven't finished that anime as of writing this so don't spoil my eggs). But these 12 furries are really not as cancerous as real life furries. In the words of Keel Mombasa, 2D girls are better than 3D girls, and boi is he right. Obviously among the 12 humanoids, there will be some you like, some you love, and some you wanna shove their ass down their throat and make them eat their underwear. Personally, my favs were rabbit, chicken, and Scooby doo. Lets be real though, nobody gives a shit about boar. She's just such a BOARing character. And the super scaleo brothers were kinda dull as well. Not to mention they wasted 2 episodes of this 12 episode masterpizza so SCREW THEM.Talkin bout them animashins, howeva, can be a rel dern micks baeg. The animation during the first few episodes is really grrrrrrraet though, but starts to dip as the episodes go on, especially right in the middle. However, it gets back up during the last few episodes and BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF STAIN!!! The animation for Jooney Toisan is Deku, basically. CGI is used for a few fights, but it actually looks pretty good. Its not stiff shit like Ajin (seriously, I need to update my old reviews from my 12 year old self) and while a little unsettling, it actually enhances the dark atmosphere that Edgy Taisedge is tryna give ya.As for the derned moosic, its pretty go0d. The opening is honestly one of the most catchy sausages ever, and the ending is a fun piece from Do As Infinity, and the OST, while not necessarily memorable, is fitting from what I remember. Voice actors all do a grrrrrraet job of making them furries more complex, showing whats really under all that hair.As sexy as Julyey Teisken has made itself, it does have a few minimal flaws. The one majah thang is the lack of screen time with certain characters, mainly HORSEEE. He was really warming up to be my favorite of the serious (I love tank type of characters), and while I did like that his personality was different from the typical tank warrior, I wish we could have seen him do a little more than run around. Rip, I guess thats what horses do best, but with how interesting his backstory is, its a shame. That's honesly the only thing I really majorly dislexically dislike about JT.All I can say is that you should watch Juuni Taisen, no matter what gender, race, or weaboo level you are. Even if you're a typical white football track runner who gives no shits about anime, you shoud still watch it. Its a fun anime that, well, is simply fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you're one of those typical teens who OBSESSES over forknife or something like that, this may be the gateway to anime for you.

About half way in I found myself legitimately invested in several of the characters, and legitimately...looking forward to the next episode; eventually I just binged the last there and, well, that's where it fell apart; specifically the last episode. The whole show builds up to this big wish; any Fate/fans out there know exactly where it's going, except this time someone actually gets to make a wish. However, the wish it's self is the issue, it's disappointing; as if the writer didn't really have a plan, and that is not an accusation I raise lightly. Alternatively, it may be that they thought they were being clever, but unfortunately it wasn't. If you go in knowing that the ending is distinctly disappointing, you may still enjoy the characters and animation, but if you're looking for a gratifying conclusion you'll be sourly disappointed. looking forward to the next episode; eventually I just binged the last there and, well, that's where it fell apart; specifically the last episode.

A group of warriors with special abilities are asked to engage in a battle-royale and the last warrior standing will be granted any one wish that they desire.While it sounds like a Fate/Stay Night rip-off, it\'s not. Not even close. Because while the Fate franchise manages to balance the deeper meanings behind wars, their aftermath and it\'s futility with jaw-dropping action sequences and well developed characters, Juuni Taisen barely manages to deliver a cohesive plot and on more than one occasion falls flat on it\'s face.The standout qualities of the show are...undoubtedly it\'s Art/animation and Soundtrack. The fight sequences (although few) are well animated and the soundtrack does an adequate job of keeping up with both the action and the moments of calm. Another positive quality of the show is that it delivers on the concept of a battle-royale very well. The shifting alliances and inevitable betrayals come with blistering speed, sometimes so quickly that it\'s upsetting.Characterization and Story are of little consequence as at no point in time does the show really make you care about the characters and their respective motivations, although some of them possess curious (if not badass) abilities. Indeed the only \'twists\' that come in the show are the rate at which participants are killed. However, given the long and tedious flashback that is shown immediately before their deaths, one can\'t help but think of some episodes as a monumental waste of time.Conceptually, Juuni Taisen had all the ingredients of a proper and even fun Battle-Royale story, but it took itself too seriously by trying to attach deeper meanings to it\'s plots and characters. The only reason I\'m giving it a score of \'5\' is because despite all it\'s flaws, the show still prompted me to binge watch it in a single sitting. Maybe it was like reading a bad novel.

I enjoy horror/gore and action anime but when it doesn't have a plot then its rather boring to me.The anime as we all know it, is a battle royale between the 12 zodiac warriors. They must all fight to be the last one standing and whoever is left alive wins and gets a wish granted.Characters: We got to sort of meet all of the characters at this point. We know what Boar, Dog, Chicken, Monkey, Horse and Rams lives were like...and what they were trying to do. However, when it came to Chicken and Monkey, their stories or at least their mini character arcs weren't really clear or were rather mediocre. It seemed rushed particularly for chicken with the whole her emotional susceptibility; yet shes a cold hearted liar who can deceive anyone. Seeing as it is a battle royale , chances of having a favorite are slim if any character really appeals to anyone.Art: It's not the greatest but its not the worst either. There are some interesting character design choices...... particularly with Chicken, Monkey, and Tiger. Considering they are going to be in an all out war they are the least dressed for that. Likewise with Rabbit, I'm curious to know why they changed his outfit from the beginning to what he is during the battle.Honestly I just think the story is not catching my attention because it spends an entire episode giving you backstory and trying to get you to feel bad for some of these characters who weren't exactly good people either. To then get 5 minutes of a bit of action and then the inevitable death of said character. I am skeptical as to how this is going to develop further. and what they were trying to do.

There is absolutely nothing plot-twist in this story, there's no big surprise because it's all executed in a fashion that after the first time it happens, you can summarise it'll happen for the next set of episodes.The art was fairly mediocre, nothing interesting about it; The...character designs are fairly bland and generic as well.

I don\'t know about you guys but there was not a single anime that I was unable to predict or at least parts of it, I always think about it while watching it and guessing what\'s gonna...happen which is just like an instict to me, Im not even trying, and Im almost always right. So what if you may guess who is gonna die in the episode? So what if you can guess who is going to win? Is that really that big of a deal? But I really doubt there is a single person who could say HOW the person was going to win. That was not predictable at all, it was greatly made and it all just made sense in the end, not beforehands. So yeah, you may find yourself asking why this one had to die like that, or why does that one win, but the end makes you say, ""ah"", because everything just HAD to happen that way and that makes it wonderful... that there was a really good reason why did everything happen the way it happened. So even if you hate that your favorite chars died, or how they died, in the end, at least in my case, I was like ""oh okay"" and the bitterness fades away, because it just makes sense. And thats one of the reasons why I like this anime so much, because only few anime have that.Even tho Im a fan of Fate/Zero, I don\'t like the others like Fate/Stay night etc, and Juuni Taisen has what I liked about Zero. There\'s action, there\'s blood, there\'s story, there\'s different and likeable characters, there\'s no room for teenagers and their drama - and especially there is a simple ending - one winner, and not just like any other anime that just ends whatsoever.

Sure, everyone has their own opinion, but don\'t be stupid and let the haters ruin the anime for you when you haven\'t even watched it yet, make your own opinion and reasons why you hate or like it.

When you think of battle arenas, do you think of some cool battles, tension and suspense, not knowing who the victor will...be, potentially some really crazy twists that add a big shock to the battle? Well you won\'t find it here. When there is actual fighting in the show, I\'m actually feeling hyped because it seems like the action is going to be really great! But all the fights and non fights were very anticlimactic and the precise word for this is...""stupid."" I will say, the idea that each character had their own unique way of exploiting or finding loopholes in the Juuni Taisen was really great - I actually enjoyed seeing the fighters find ways around the rules and ideas of the competition and kind of dive into their minds with their planning and plotting - such a shame there is not enough of this kind of stuff. I will say this though - one of the characters in particular had a specific loophole that honestly didn\'t really work for me, it threw off the balance of the show and made them OP and boring.No real comment in terms of art and sound, to me it was okay.Character. The thing that stands out most in this show but for negative reasons. Firstly the designs are whack. What the hell are half of these people wearing? Some may make sense, for example, military gear or specific clothing for weaponry and equipment. But some have zero meaning and practicality! (I\'m looking at Rabbit and Tiger here...) I get that it\'s supposed to represent the zodiac creature, but you could\'ve done without....some of the things in this show...So without spoiling too much, the first episode introduces a character and gives their story and then a twist happens. This was okay just for the first episode, the problem is they regurgitated this exact formula for every character and it was very boring and disengaging to watch. Not to mention, they went in full detail for like 3/4\'s of each episode for some of the backstories of the characters - I believe it was supposed to create an empathetic effect that would make the audience interested and captivated. Instead, like many have already said, made it predictable and in fact have the opposite intended effect and I actually didn\'t really care for the characters with these obsessively long and drawn out  sappy back stories.(More detail: I will say, some of the back stories were done okay or pretty well. For example, Dog\'s backstory was actually done well - it was done in a way where it was actually relevant to the Juuni taisen, like the transition into his backstory was done smoothly and his story was short and simple! Because of this, I actually enjoyed his character! Another example I guess would be Rat who also had a short backstory - literally two lines of dialogue, which was actually perfect for his character and made viewers understand him)Continuing on from before, they skip some of actually interesting characters stories which was actually so annoying - why give 15 minutes of screen time to someone I don\'t care about when you could give at least a few minutes to someone quite exciting and who seriously needs context?Please readers, if you ever make a show and want character contexts, under 5 minutes is enough please don\'t go on for 3/4\'s of the episode.Now the ending of the show will either make viewers quite annoyed. Or make some, like me, oddly satisfied. I won\'t say exactly what it is, but it was the only thing (I suppose you could also apply this to the twins? But they have two episodes of backstory so no.) that was actually different in this show, something that made it not a typical and predictable, not some sob story or some sappy thing. Instead it was a realistic depiction of a real persons thoughts that put things into a unique perspective. And I agree with the character\'s choice in that episode. It made a lot of sense and it was real.(TL;DR) So, as you can see the problems with this show lie with character and story and the only good episode was the last. However, if you are looking for a obscure guilty pleasure with weird characters and a bad story then you have found the right show right next to DMMD! If you just treat it like a comedy, the ""fights"" just get so much better. Nice move leaving out two of the more interesting character\'s context/backstories out! If I could wish for anything I wish I could unsee Rabbit\'s character design.Overall, Juuni Taisen is disengaging, inconsistent, annoying, but oddly satisfying right at the last moments. be, potentially some really crazy twists that add a big shock to the battle?

The differentiating factor here from other similar shows that have come before Juuni Taisen is that there is a tie-in with the Chinese zodiac in that each warrior represents a sign.I walked in with the expectation that the action might be decent and the story would be mediocre(as is the case with most anime of this type). What I got was something slightly different from those expectations. The story had a very strong start with it's first episode and set the tone well for the...rest of the series. However even in the first episode, it was easy for me to guess who the winner of the Juuni Taisen might be and this was eventually confirmed be the spoilerish ending song(My suggestion would be to not look at the visuals for the ED if you don't want to know the outcome of how the battle plays out beforehand).Another thing that slightly irked me initially was that the outcome of the fights between the characters felt underwhelming when compared to the expectations I had in my head as the fights lacked the action I was looking for. However upon thinking about it, the fights felt more realistic in that all it takes is for the slightest mistake/miscalculation to occur or even just being unlucky on that particular day for your life to be forfeit. I was able to appreciate what the show was trying to do more after making this realization.I loved the art style of the show and I thought the character designs were interesting in particular. The animation in comparison was average most of the times with 3D animation being utilized for some of the fights scenes. The 3D wasn't horrible and I had no problems with it, it's  just something to make note of.  The soundtrack was barely noticeable but at the same time I can't say it was bad either.I thought that the characters of the show were very likable and entertaining and made my watching experience of Juuni Taisen a very easy one. A negative aspect for me in my opinion is that even though most characters got backstories(try to ignore the death-flags that these stories cause), it still feels like the character development in the show was slightly lacking. Then again, I didn't need that much more character development in a battle royale to begin with.Although the result of the Juuni Taisen became predictable rather quickly, the anime was enjoyable and I was always looking forward to the new episodes as they came out to see how the battle royale would develop.

What originally attracted me to it was it reminded me of the Hunger Games. 12 Zodiac houses send someone to fight for them to keep peace. One person is the winner and they get one wish. If you are looking for a good story and good plot, you won’t find it here. There wasn’t a lot of explanation why these houses are fighting each other. What stood out about this anime was the characters. Each episode we get backstory on most of the competitors. It gave a very human perspective on why each person was...fighting. And depending on the character, it was sad when they died. This is a story about 12 people, for one reason or another, have been entered in the Juni Taisen to fight for something; some for honor, some for glory, to make a difference, and to see a face important to them. fighting.

Quite a lot too. Sure, it was predictable at times, and sure, the quality of the animation took a huge nosedive about halfway through, but I really don’t think it deserves all the hate I’ve been seeing it get lately.First off: the story. It’s true that from about episode 3 you can tell who’s going to die based on how the anime works. But that doesn’t actually take away from the enjoyment. It’s just like having a friend tell you a major spoiler for a series – the surprise might be gone,...but sometimes you enjoy it all the more for that. (The only difference here is that the anime spoilers itself.) I personally didn’t mind knowing who was going to die, it just meant I knew who to focus on when watching an episode.Character development was basically episodic. One episode per character (although there were exceptions). I thought Tiger’s story was great – that was probably my favourite part of the anime. Most of the backstories were interesting (with the exception of Snake and Dragon, or at least that’s my opinion), and the characters were just quirky enough that I enjoyed watching them without getting bored. That’s actually one thing that can be a con for an anime, but in this case was a pro; the amount of time spent on each character was manageable - bite sized pieces, if you will.The ending, whilst not necessarily a brilliant one, was nevertheless a fitting send-off for the show. The anime did take a rather different approach during the last episode – much more philosophical – but it addressed the question raised at the beginning. I thought the way the wish (the overall point to the story) was handled was very thought-provoking, and even though I didn’t necessarily agree with the wish itself, it was very human. That humanity is something that the anime needed after the Taisen bloodbath. It gave the show…closure, you might call it. There were some plot-holes, and some questions that remained unanswered, but in relation to those I don’t think answers were actually needed.There were a lot of fabulous fight scenes (at least in the first half), and some pretty good music too.The anime was faithful to its Battle Royale/Hunger Games trope, and even though there are parts of it that I feel could have been handled better, I respect it for that. Most of the episodes did leave me wanting more, after all. (In regard to parts that could have been handled better…I’d say the Dragon and Snake siblings, and basically everything to do with Rabbit. My main bugbear; there was so much potential…)Nonetheless, if you like the survival horror trope, and like seeing a mix of interesting characters (but don’t mind if there’s not much plot), I’d recommend you check out Juuni Taisen.Enjoy watching!

XD', ""Another killing game anime, right? Wrong, it's another great killing game anime.Ok, so, I figured that I should talk about the story first. It's completely fine. It's kinda fast paced and short which makes it a good watch for people who prefer anime that aren't long running. It's a little predictable when it comes to who wins the Juni Taisen but how it happens makes it a bit more interesting. Also, I like how it covered the backstories of the characters. I recall someone saying that the character development they get is wasted since, you know, it's a death game and these characters die. I...don't agree with this at all. Getting to know these characters is what makes us like them in the first place. Anyway...there's one issue. It doesn't really effect the anime but it would've been nice to know the backstory of Rabbit. I do like how we get to know more about certain characters even after they die though.The art's also nice and the same goes for the animation...most of the time. The CGI (I think) that they used in the opening looks cool as heck. But, in a certain episode, the animation got kinda weird looking at times and the art definitely could've been better. After that, everything was good though.The sound is great. The opening had an interesting feel to it but, in my opinion, the ending song was way better. Whenever they used emotional or dramatic music, everything was good. Nothing felt out of place or oddly timed.The characters were very good. Most of them were developed and had personalities. You could actually like some of these characters and find others interesting.Story: 10Art: 9Sound: 10Character: 9Enjoyment: 10Overall, Juni Taisen was a great watch and I don't regret a second of it.

Each episode you are easily able to predict who will die by who we were introduced to last. This is only the most obvious problem the series suffers from. This list also includes poor world-building (why the fuck is their magic?),  really bad sound design, and shitty battle sequences. What\'s so surreal about these problems though is that this is what battle royal\'s are supposed to be good at. Along with the fact that every character is...as flat at the script leaves you wondering why you should even care about anything that happens. Even if you decide to watch till the end, you are given the most ""Look how deep I am"" ending with the actual wish the winner asks for.All in all, this anime is a major waste. There are better garbage battle royale anime like Mirai Nikki. Or better yet, good battle royale anime like Btooom! Which I would recommend over this trash. as flat at the script leaves you wondering why you should even care about anything that happens.

Just because A series isn't what you like, doesn't mean it's bad. The story for this series in particular is very hit or miss. If you think you could enjoy a show that OBVIOUSLY kills off all but one character in a specific fashion then it's very good. The show accomplishes what it says it will. It's exactly what it says. It was very good for what it was and most of the characters were different and interesting. The ending is, I guess, 'predictable', but only because...the premise itself does not allow for a surprise. This show was not meant to have some deep dark story or massive character development, nor was it trying to bring something in that it could not execute properly. It was entertaining and did occupy me for the 12 episodes. It is a very alternative story for the typical anime, but I was extremely surprised to have enjoyed myself after reading the reviews. I wish people would understand that every anime is different and does not have to conform to everybody's standards on what is 'great'.  Point being, if people are salty in their reviews, don't take their opinion as your major influence when deciding to watch things without a conventional story line.

Juuni Taisen is edginess embodied, a multi-dimensional master of trash taste disaster. The fact that this made it through the entire process of making it and no compromises were made in the interest of making it more popular, even though it is so obvious that it made editorial choices that CLEARLY THEY WOULD KNOW would be unpopular, deserves your respect and admiration. They wanted to make it this way, they made what they wanted to make, and they didn\'t care...what people would think about it - and I like that. Personally, I would have been the guy on this project going ""but if we do that, then..."" and ""maybe we should..."" but I was not on this project. Whoever was never asked or permitted any such notion of any such compromise, caution, or concern for how Juuni Taisen would be received - one question was asked and answered in the writer\'s room and that was all.

Psychotically!!!Brimming with a highly concentrated ""everything is just some bullshit anyways"" fuck you fuck off get fucked everybody and everything sucks nothing is real and we\'ll all soon be dead regardless energy, the kind of energy that Isekai protagonists can only dream of hinting at, Juuni Taisen is a take down of everything you might have wished such a well drawn show could be as a general fan of the medium. What do I mean, you ask? Here\'s the gist - every single aspect of this Anime that could have made it popular and probably even a hit show by just doing what Fate and friends did, or identifying key characters to root for and keeping them alive by the skin of their teeth, or going big picture by pitting the warriors against the organization that put the Juuni Taisen death game/holy grail war together in the first place - was denied for the sake of the integrity of this piece. The integrity of something unloveable, a message and vehicle so angsty and confused and desperate that part of you just wants it to disappear entirely and just fuck off - and in feeling that way the piece hits it\'s mark successfully. Stellar cost-effective production values especially the artwork, the interesting character models and backstories, the storied kung-fu premise of zodiac warriors and existence of some supernatural warrior society that seem to all end up as mercenaries in modern warzones, and the fascinating death game, all wasted. Intentionally, purposefully, carefully, for the sake of nothing. Backstories for the sake of killing, all a flavor of killing, all fated to die in the least interesting possible format no matter how interesting the ways. For nothing, by the way. They also die for nothing. The stakes are nothing.Any typical shounen-ish format show would at some point relinquish it\'s hold on depraved wanton fatalism and serve up some overarching good vs. evil, save the world from the threat revealed in the big twist episode story. Or some kind of a ""redemption"" arc, or changing the order of the backstories or the order of the ED credits display of dead characters to at least keep the mystery there FOR FREE, without adapting anything differently at all from the source materal! They intended to ruin everything you could possibly like, and there was a lot to like, but they also didn\'t really try to make you like it directly. It was an ambivalent effort, procedural, to relate these characters to the audience and to their archetypes and that cavalier attitude really sold these characters. The fact that they were devices so easily disposed of and so criminally flawed made them tragic, pathetic. That could only have helped them sell this show and they must have known it, but they did not waiver from their intent to also treat these pathetic characters pathetically, to render them moot. Also, where is all the fake-ass intellectual 4D chess? Literally every attempt to make a 200IQ move is thwarted by a pathological psychopath necromancer rabbit in high heels, and then finally everybody is blown up in an explosion and we find out that one kid has this absolutely stupid pass/fail mechanic power that made even the overtly predictable, get rekt no one cares that there\'s no suprises, all your waifus are dead fam deal with it plot EVEN LESS IMPORTANT. The events we saw were all pre-ordained by the rat!? Deja-Vu, the fuck kind of foreshadowing is this!? Wow. This show manages to insult your intelligence by being smart, and make fun of your childish desire to see ""good storytelling"" by telling a disgusting nhilistic story competently. Then it robs you of any pay off you might have thought was coming in the final episode by revealing that the ""strongest zodiac warrior"", the MC, our guy... just so happens to be the most pathetic of all these pathetic characters. He goes through 100 possible ways to advance or resolve the plot in a typical fashion that the audience would typically get behind, and he chooses literally the least interesting, most upsetting, and dumbest one. But it was the only one that makes sense given the rest of the show. He chooses to make all that death and destruction and agonizing and effort meaningless, all the backstories and shocking psycho rabbit manwhore moments implicitly pointless, by forgetting all about it and by extension consigning all those characters and all their backstories and all their deaths and by extension their values and everyone who watched and made this show to oblivion on the selfish whim of some loser high school kid. Wow. Fuck you too, show. Insulted and impressed....Would this show not have been amazing with just a hint of typical tropes and storytelling, just a bit of that mainstream formulaic drivel? Put these characters in the hands of anyone else for anything else, these backstories, all this stuff - and it\'s great. But Juuni Taisen manages to take all that potential and just wash it away in self-indulgent, annoying fatalism, nhilism, giving in and giving up. Killing because who cares.

They intended to ruin everything you could possibly like, and there was a lot to like, but they also didn\'t really try to make you like it directly. It was an ambivalent effort, procedural, to relate these characters to the audience and to their archetypes and that cavalier attitude really sold these characters. The fact that they were devices so easily disposed of and so criminally flawed made them tragic, pathetic. That could only have helped them sell this show and they must have known it, but they did not waiver from their intent to also treat these pathetic characters pathetically, to render them moot. Also, where is all the fake-ass intellectual 4D chess? Literally every attempt to make a 200IQ move is thwarted by a pathological psychopath necromancer rabbit in high heels, and then finally everybody is blown up in an explosion and we find out that one kid has this absolutely stupid pass/fail mechanic power that made even the overtly predictable, get rekt no one cares that there\'s no suprises, all your waifus are dead fam deal with it plot EVEN LESS IMPORTANT. The events we saw were all pre-ordained by the rat!? Deja-Vu, the fuck kind of foreshadowing is this!? Wow. This show manages to insult your intelligence by being smart, and make fun of your childish desire to see ""good storytelling"" by telling a disgusting nhilistic story competently. Then it robs you of any pay off you might have thought was coming in the final episode by revealing that the ""strongest zodiac warrior"", the MC, our guy... just so happens to be the most pathetic of all these pathetic characters. He goes through 100 possible ways to advance or resolve the plot in a typical fashion that the audience would typically get behind, and he chooses literally the least interesting, most upsetting, and dumbest one. But it was the only one that makes sense given the rest of the show. He chooses to make all that death and destruction and agonizing and effort meaningless, all the backstories and shocking psycho rabbit manwhore moments implicitly pointless, by forgetting all about it and by extension consigning all those characters and all their backstories and all their deaths and by extension their values and everyone who watched and made this show to oblivion on the selfish whim of some loser high school kid. Wow. Fuck you too, show. Insulted and impressed....Would this show not have been amazing with just a hint of typical tropes and storytelling, just a bit of that mainstream formulaic drivel? Put these characters in the hands of anyone else for anything else, these backstories, all this stuff - and it\'s great. But Juuni Taisen manages to take all that potential and just wash it away in self-indulgent, annoying fatalism, nhilism, giving in and giving up. Killing because who cares. I\'m shocked that this exists and I found it fascinating to an extreme.', ""Juuni TaisenAn absolute example of wasted potential, what a terrible waste.. it hurts.The title of June Taisen had almost everything he needed to be successful, but what happened?The drawing style was individual and fresh. The animations were impressively good. The characters had an attractive design and some average background stories. The fights were well staged. And despite everything, they just didn't make anything of it.There were lots of plot holes and a lot of missing explanations. Instead of tackling these shortcomings and making up for them, they dragged out some trivial scenes and chewed on some background stories until the episode reached the time.-The only...really positive thing here is - you could hardly foresee which of the characters would bless the time. Their departures came too suddenly and mostly in rather unexpected scenes.The Plot... however, there is only disappointment. Practically hardly any explanations, you are thrown into the slaughter and you already have the center and the climax in front of you. As a viewer you ask yourself, what have you been waiting for all the time? The work has no real goal and extends enormously to the end without any real revelation or twist. If it weren't for the secret ability of one of the characters, there would be practically no twists here.Animations were impressively good and appealing. Every fight had that certain something. The fights came really short and fast to the point without wasting time. Not like the backgrounds.The characters are a very split point for me. On the one hand, you saw a background story for almost everyone (except for the 3 most interesting ones,!!!!!!!Spoiler!Rabbit, ox, rat) , they died so quickly that one could hardly get used to them. One can hardly speak of sympathy here, let alone character development.!!!!!!There was hardly any music in the anime, which made most fights a little less dynamic. However, they were also extremely short, so the music would hardly come into play anyway. I have to make a positive note of the intro, I liked the style as well as the music. Also had no spoilers.Personally, the anime has entertained me satisfactorily. But there was so much wrong with this Anime i would be able to talk for a whole Hour about all the Episodes. I cant actually believe it, since the concept was actually so simple.Story 3Art 7Sound 5Character 4Enjoyment 5Overall 3 really positive thing here is - you could hardly foresee which of the characters would bless the time.

But the thing that i felt disappointed was some of the characters doesn't even get their backstories whereas the characters that got the backstories were dead in the next ep so overall the story was pretty good. The outcome tho disappoint some fans I was also disappointed because so much happened in those 12 eps to get...to this outcome was unfair. Overall in my opinion it is 9/10. to this outcome was unfair. Overall in my opinion it is 9/10."", ""I watched Juuni Taisen, also known as Zodiac War. Here are my thoughts:So basically, as you might have guessed, there are 12 warriors, each of whom are vaguely based on a zodiac animal. They all fight each other to the death simultaneously in an abandoned city because of a battle royale-style competition. It was interesting to see how the various warrior abilities competed against each other (and worked together in some cases). I'm a huge sucker for battle royale-style conflicts such as this.The actual battle royale plot is easy to watch and makes for suitable binge-watch material. If you just feel like burning through an...entire season in one day, this show would be an okay candidate for that, despite its flaws. This is kind of a junk-food show and shouldn't be taken seriously.This show would be much better if they just entirely cut out the time-consuming character backstories and kept the screentime exclusively focused on the battle royale plot. Instead, literally entire episodes are wasted on inconsequential exposition for characters nobody cares about. None of these characters are compelling or interesting in any way. They easily could have filled an entire cour with a 12-fighter battle royale conflict; I have no idea why they threw away that opportunity to instead waste half the runtime on generic uncreative character backstories that would be better off in an OVA or auxiliary literature. This really was a terrible decision. By far the most boring part of this anime were all these pointless backstories. They spent way WAY too much screentime on this. Nobody cares about the exposition for some one-dimensional character in a huge cast who gets killed off one episode later. I am not watching this anime for character development (although I usually value it in other shows); this is not the situation for it and this show does not benefit from it at all. I don't care about your cliche tragic backstory or that Grug likes opera and long walks on the beach when he's not crushing skulls. I am just here to watch people with cool abilities plot against each other and fight; stop wasting my time with anything that isn't that. Just as an example to illustrate my point: they waste an ENTIRE EPISODE on the utterly generic boring backstory of a character who was killed off SEVEN EPISODES AGO. Right during what should be the pinnacle of the story they pivot to this nonsense – it was utterly ridiculous and totally stunted the show's momentum.The character designs are overly comical to the point it almost made the show difficult to take seriously. I would have preferred them less pants-on-head retarded. Most characters in this look like they were designed by an edgy 12-year-old boy shortly after he learned about Chinese New Year. This show can be a little over-the-top edgy in general, sometimes to the point of it backfiring and being comical.Overall the visuals are adequate but definitely not a selling point. The character animation employs this effect that blurs the linework, maybe to make it more organic-looking. I think I would have preferred that these blurred linework effects not be present, but it's not a big deal either way. The character animation was consistently adequate, so I probably shouldn't complain. Overall this show is animated competently but it doesn't excel beyond that. There isn't much of an art style, which is a missed opportunity but also not a flaw. CGI is used during some action scenes, FYI. The fight scenes were quite underwhelming and unimpressive overall. The fight scenes are also usually so shortlived that I hesitate to call this an action show at all; this is not necessarily a bad thing – I would prefer it over the tedious drawn-out fight scenes that plague some other anime. If you go into this show excited for fight scenes, you will be disappointed. The strategy aspect of the battle royale competition was far more entertaining, from my perspective at least.The OST is generic and unimpressive, and never enhanced my enjoyment of the show (although I did like the ED song). Voice acting was similarly unremarkable, despite the ample opportunity for unique voices. I guess the VA for the necromancer did an okay job. Also I gotta acknowledge the VA (Yuuichirou Umehara) for the ox fighter – that guy has a great voice and I've enjoyed him in other roles.Often the show plays a character's internal dialogue while they or somebody else is speaking, resulting in the viewer needing to pay attention to both lines of dialogue. I found the frequency of this a little irritating but I suppose it is an effective time-saving technique in terms of getting through dialogue quickly. It's also true that the contrast between what the characters say and think can be quite significant, but maybe it could have been demonstrated better. Having to follow two people speaking at once is cumbersome and I wish this anime didn't force it so often.One very petty criticism I have: the city they fight in supposedly had a population of 500,000; I gotta say, a city with that population would not have infrastructure as dense as what is depicted in the show, not even in Japan. It looks like a city with a population at least double that (I know this is a silly thing to fixate on).Yet another example of this anime's appalling waste of screentime is that the final episode consists mostly of the competition winner deliberating over what their 'wish' (the competition prize) should be. This mental deliberation of course takes place over the backdrop of some very dull screenplay, resulting in a viewing experience that is simply not entertaining. It was a very underwhelming season finale.My overall rating: 4/10My rating for this would be higher if the absurdly excessive and out-of-place pointless character backstories were removed from the show, or at least their duration were reduced enormously. It's mindboggling how much time got wasted on this. I try not to focus on one single issue when critiquing an anime, but it really is that straightforward in this case. When the show actually focused on the battle royale conflict, it was entertaining and easy to watch. Unfortunately, the screentime of this show was utterly squandered and the cool battle royale plot was heavily diluted by very low-quality content.Seriously, just skip the flashback scenes. They aren't necessary to understand the plot of the show, and the anime as a whole would be much more entertaining if they were removed. Ordinarily I would be mortified by the thought of skipping content, but the banality of these character backstories is especially egregious and they add nothing of value to the show at all. This is a junk-food show and should be treated as such.Despite my criticisms, this is still adequate binge-watch material. If you just want something to entertain you for ~5 hours straight, this isn't a terrible choice – you could do worse.Lastly, I want to be very clear so that nobody misinterprets me: character development is usually a good thing and I have praised it in other shows (or criticized its absence). The difference is that a 12-character 12-episode battle royale action show is not at all suited for it – particularly the sheer amount of time that was devoted to it in this case.Vague spoiler: the rat warrior's ability is really cool. It's a shame it didn't get more focus. It would have been interesting to see it deployed more from his perspective. entire season in one day, this show would be an okay candidate for that, despite its flaws.

It can be horoscope, sins, great heroes, mythology and zodiac signs. This one revolves around chinese zodiac participants who are willing to fight and kill each other for just one wish. The first episode is too exciting, too interesting, the you'll never expected that the whole series will be too predictable. Yes, the action on this one is kind of great but still it lacks on it. There are multiple loopholes and things that you'll find disturbing after watching it. First, why there is...a war against zodiacs every twelve years? What happened that time that resulted on this kind of tournament? Second, where is the back story of rabbit? I know that he is a psycho. One who you can't speak normally. But why is he like that? Why did he decide to turn himself into a corpse? He is fighting for his wish to be friends with all of people. Not to kill himself and turn into a monster. Third, the series became too a loop of story and death. Whoever is reminiscing his past will die. So will you really know who's going to survive. Fourth, who are the people betting on them?  Who's the guy in hat? Is he God? And last one, the rat give off a really mysterious aura. Well, he did have a unique skill. But I expected more on him which I shouldn't have.CHARACTER: 8/10They all have a different principle in life. Something they hold onto to keep on living. Something in their past which makes them the person they are in the competition. Truth to be told, the characters are created humanely. They have their bad and good side. They have their strength and weakness. Though I ended up not liking the series, the characters are on different criteria. For me, the characters are great. But still, I expected more in rats' character.ANIMATION AND SOUND: 9/10The animation is great. What will you expect in a new release series, right? The way the things around them breaks and how the series show the expression on the characters face is quite amazing. Most of the time, it is very detailed. The dubbing is also fine.  As well as the opening and ending songs.ENJOYMENT: 7/10While I enjoy in the action brought by this series. It became also predictable which resulted in making it boring. Yes, the action scenes are good, no doubt about that. But overall, the series just take turns from story to death. The most interesting character rabbit is the only one who made me decide to finish the series, I think.ENDING: 5/10The ending is a mess for me. They leave a lot of questions. They leave a lot of unexplainable things in the series. Additionally, the series ended up with a depressing person who has no will to live. No dreams, No wish. Though he did seem happy in the end, I still expected more on him. a war against zodiacs every twelve years? What happened that time that resulted on this kind of tournament?

It is true that there are animes like Kino\'s journey or mushishi that repeat their way to tell their stories but those anime are not style / substance and follow that pattern to continue showing aspects related to the human being instead in the case of shows like Juuni Taisen is necessary keep the listener hooked adding that for the second half we can only see how each person falls one by one in ridiculous ways and ends up killing all the desire to continue.Another important point is the large number of characters that try to manage and in a way it does well because they all have well defined features and have some degree of charisma but do not have enough time or dialogue to note that charisma, another error is that At the time of doing the proper introspections, the series takes on a too serious tone that does not fit with what the series tries to be besides being sincere, none of these is as versatile as they are the Monogatari or Katanagatari and all based on a group of lunatics and grace is lost (Baccano! and Durarara! They also had crazy characters but they had more characteristics than being just crazy)Finally, the productive values \u200b\u200bat the beginning are quite good considering that the study is relatively new but from chapter 6 the kinesics fails, the designs are constantly deformed but that if the funds are ok.The direction is usually regular pulling bad and the soundtrack although it is not bad does not have any subject that is recognizable and ends up being ignored.In conclusion juuni Taisen is a bad show and any other work of nisio deserves more attention than this.-----------------------------------------Versión en español:Juuni taisen es la más reciente adaptación de una novela del famoso NisiOisin (Monogatari Series) y es de lo más decepcionante que he visto de este autor.Sinceramente Juuni taisen es un battle royal como cualquier otro: estúpido, sin contexto, acción tonta y extravagante pero con la diferencia de que desecha las narrativas comunes por una muy poco vista y eso mismo la hace mala y tediosa.Los episodios de Juuni Taisen siguen con unas pautas claras como por ejemplo:>Presentación.>Introspección.>Muerte.Durante los 12 episodios se nos va presentando a cada participante de la misma forma y esto funcionaba al primer episodio porque nos agarra en guardia baja y nos mantiene expectantes pero al ser una constante pierde el ""enganche"" y sólo termina volviendolo tedioso. Es cierto que hay animes como Kino\'s journey o mushishi que repiten su forma para contar sus historias pero esos anime no son estilo/sustancia y siguen ese patrón para seguir mostrando aspectos relacionados al ser humano en cambio en el caso de shows como Juuni Taisen es necesario mantener enganchado al espetador sumandole que para la segunda mitad sólo nos queda ver como cada persona cae uno por uno de formas ridículas y termina matando todas las ganas de querer continuar.Otro punto importante es la gran cantidad de personajes que intenta manejar y en cierto modo lo hace bien pues todos tienen rasgos bien definidos y tienen cierto grado de carisma pero no tienen el tiempo suficiente ni los diálogos para hacer notar ese carisma, otro error es que al momento de hacer las debidas introspecciones la serie adquiere un tono demasiado serio que no encuadra con lo que la serie intenta ser además que siendo sinceros, ninguno de estos es tan versátil como lo son los de Monogatari o Katanagatari y al todos basarse en un grupo de lunáticos ya se pierde la gracia (Baccano! y Durarara!! tambien tenian personajes locos pero tenian más característicasque ser simplemente locos)Por ultimo, los valores productivos al principio estan bastante bien considerando que el estudio es relativamente novato pero a partir del capitulo 6 la kinesica falla, los diseños se deforman constantemente pero eso si, los fondos estan okey.La direccion es en general regular tirando a mala y el soundtrack si bien no es malo no tiene ningun tema que sea reconocible y termina siendo ignorado.En conclusion juuni Taisen es un mal show y cualquier otra obra de nisio merece más atencion que esta. us expectant but being a constant loses the ""hook"" and only ends up making it tedious.

Es cierto que hay animes como Kino\'s journey o mushishi que repiten su forma para contar sus historias pero esos anime no son estilo/sustancia y siguen ese patrón para seguir mostrando aspectos relacionados al ser humano en cambio en el caso de shows como Juuni Taisen es necesario mantener enganchado al espetador sumandole que para la segunda mitad sólo nos queda ver como cada persona cae uno por uno de formas ridículas y termina matando todas las ganas de querer continuar.Otro punto importante es la gran cantidad de personajes que intenta manejar y en cierto modo lo hace bien pues todos tienen rasgos bien definidos y tienen cierto grado de carisma pero no tienen el tiempo suficiente ni los diálogos para hacer notar ese carisma, otro error es que al momento de hacer las debidas introspecciones la serie adquiere un tono demasiado serio que no encuadra con lo que la serie intenta ser además que siendo sinceros, ninguno de estos es tan versátil como lo son los de Monogatari o Katanagatari y al todos basarse en un grupo de lunáticos ya se pierde la gracia (Baccano! y Durarara!! tambien tenian personajes locos pero tenian más característicasque ser simplemente locos)Por ultimo, los valores productivos al principio estan bastante bien considerando que el estudio es relativamente novato pero a partir del capitulo 6 la kinesica falla, los diseños se deforman constantemente pero eso si, los fondos estan okey.La direccion es en general regular tirando a mala y el soundtrack si bien no es malo no tiene ningun tema que sea reconocible y termina siendo ignorado.En conclusion juuni Taisen es un mal show y cualquier otra obra de nisio merece más atencion que esta.', ""SPOILER FREEstory (7/10):the plot wasn't that interesting. it had a few nice plot twist and overall it wasn't really bad but it wasn't good. it had parts that didn't made sense and it wasn't interesting most of the time. the thing I liked the most about it is the twist at the end and nezumi's powers. overall, it wasn't good.characters (5/10):the show took the time to do every character it's development. it didn't do it well in a lot of the times. there were some characters that were fine and nice but nothing really good overall.art (3/10):in the beginning the art looked like it's...going to be fine. nothing too special but nothing bad. and then it became hard to watch.

Supposedly it's pretty high stakes with even countries possibly being on the line. The proxy war is being fought by people who represent the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Think Fruits Basket, but a fighting anime.The way this story is told, we're not really following it from one certain point of view, so there is no real main character. As the viewer you're more so expected to pick a person to root for and hope they win I suppose. As it goes along we see...people get cut down. Death can be pretty sudden! Which is a nice change of pace at times, when you watch a lot of fighting anime you know how people can seem to be able to survive most anything.  Basically this is a story about fighting, for fighting.Taste: The show has a decent taste, but I think it really needed some more seasoning. What I mean by that is that they don't really go off the, at least from my point of view, the obvious path. The winner seemed obvious and there was never a reason for me to doubt it. They had a few ways they could have tried to have thrown me off the scent, but they didn't really seem to try.Another issue is in how the story is presented, and what I mean by that is that we have no real main character to follow. If the person who I wanted to win died off early. I lack much in the way of incentive to keep watching, apart from just the nifty battles. Sadly those also didn't do much for me, we lacked a real tense fight, and even the final confrontation was a bit lack luster. If you're going to give me a show about fighting to the death. Give me some intensity!Still, I did make it to the end, and there were some interesting characters. I suppose I wish that we could have followed one of them, or that one of them pulled out in the end. Instead we got a meh winner, and a meh finale, so it really dragged it down. Taste gets a 5 out of 10Presentation: We had some good animation here. I thought we were lacking in the gore department, but that's just me wanting a bit more spice to the show. The opening to the show was cool and the characters had some neat looks. Man the rabbit, so daring! They didn't have anything that really stood out to me in the art or music area, but they also didn't slack off. 2.5 out of 5 hereOriginality: When I saw this show, I was brought to thinking about the Fate series. Buncha people get to together, and the winner gets any wish they want granted. You don't see this sort of thing all that much in other shows, and how it was presented was also pretty original if you ask me. Some of the people also had some pretty neat abilities that you don't often get to see. I wish they could have shown off more! 3.5 out of 5In conclusion I'd say this is a show to watch if you wanna see some people fighting for no real reason. I'd probably watch it again, but I'd more likely just make silly comments as I do. I think the show starts off really well, but dies off as it loses steam. 11 out of 20! people get cut down.

The art felt really poor at times along with boring pacing that made this short series hard to sit through.STORY:2/10I like how they never explain why some of them have “powers” or whatever? I guess it’s the human world but….not like there’s much story to begin with so it doesn’t really matter. I think this is a take off of Battle Royale or something?

What a wonderful human nature study, sadly I feel people either don\'t get the point of it or just don\'t care. This series based off the light novel by the same name features 12 Zodiac Fighters in a battle royal for their wish to be granted. Let\'s start by saying if you want drawn out fights, this series isn\'t for you. If you want a series that you and your mates can place bets on who will win, this isn\'t for you, If you want a series that ends up being...a revolution ""rah rah fight the power,"" this isn\'t for you.The story actually makes a risky decision of focusing on the characters were watching, and deciding their moves. Instead of showing any long choreographed action. Not to say there isn\'t any action, but some might not appreciate how quick the payoff is with how much buildup there is. Not to mention when they do fight the action is very fast paced and it does that thing where half of it is CGI which at times works in its favor, but for the most part looks really cheap despite the rest of the animation being well done with amazing lighting and camera work. That and the dark murky colors really match the mood of the series and emphasizes on how each characters are feeling. Dark brown the character is upset, Blood red a character is frustrated. The art goes really well with how the characters are feeling and in return how you should be feeling. The music works well too. The intro theme being the perfect mood setter that is amplified by two scores. The first is a soft piano piece typically played as a way to signal that a character is hopeless and it really is effective. A lot like the song ""Say Something"" by A Big World. In fact several times I thought it was what they were playing. The other noticeable piece is the complete opposite. This one sounds like bagpipes mixed with women screaming giving the show a very disturbing feel to it and is very effective.So you may be asking why give it a Nine if its a battle royal with hardly any good battle. Well that\'s the reason I feel it impressed me so much. It\'s not necessarily a dark edgy gorefest like Deadman Wonderland, or Elfin Lied. This is closer to a psychology piece on twelve different Assasin\\Soldier\\Murderers. The show deals most of its run time showing us the different behaviors and thought processes on ten of the warriors through narration. And looking at it this way makes it one of the more fascinating series in a while in my opinion. All of them are so different from one another from Ushii(OX) ""The Genius of Slaughter"" who starts off as a single note stoic murderer before we take a look into his thought process, in wich he transforms into the guy I was rooting for. Such complexity is further shown when each of them except one get flashbacks each episode to go with their narration to further make you attached to each only to kill them off at a later time. Making for its own twisted kind of drama. That is if your watching it with the right mindset.My thoughts are if you haven\'t watched yet go in not expecting amazing fights, or a mystery on whose going to win. If that\'s your kinda thing then I\'d rethink this one. The winner is easily deducible after two or three episodes hell the end credits tell you who wins. Its better to watch it thinking not when each will die but how and its relation to the build up. I didn\'t expect any of these guys to die the way they do, Its the build up to their death where you get your reward.Lastly if your really into philosophy or Chinese literature or just references to anything you will have a blast with this show. Whether its figuring out how each of their choices in outfit is linked to their animals. Or the different references they make in one liner form for example ""Didn\'t you hear about the story of the rabbit that leaped over the moon?"" And many others. So if your looking for complex character studies give it a watch.

It was really anti-climatic, and although it was suprising, it wasn't supriding in a good way. And seeing as the rat was the main character we rarelly see him, which makes us think it's gonna be him to win, it's very predictable... At least they could make an ending that was more surprising, like some people being brought back or him taking some kind of revenge for envolving him in that game or something, but nope, he just wishes to forget he was ever in that place... The character really disapointed me, I mean he's...someone that can do something like that so you would expect him to be more mature than others his age, but nope he's just a brat that even tho he has an amazing power, he just wants to run from it.....Anyway, this story, characters and theme had so much potential to be amazing, but instead it was very disapointing.The only thing that made made continue watching was how great the animation and fights was, because the story really isn't good........ someone that can do something like that so you would expect him to be more mature than others his age, but nope he's just a brat that even tho he has an amazing power, he just wants to run from it.....Anyway, this story, characters and theme had so much potential to be amazing, but instead it was very disapointing.The only thing that made made continue watching was how great the animation and fights was, because the story really isn't good........"", ""While people may prize the unpredictability of a show as something that is pivotal in deciding whether its a hit or miss for them, Juuni Taisen is able to execute its plot decently with the intention of wanting their audience to have full awareness of the way the show will progress, including its ending. Yes, you heard me right, it's ENDING. So what value is there in watching something in which you already know the events that will unfold? While to put it simply, it's HOW these said events happen. Because as cliche as 'it's about the journey, not the destination' sounds, it does apply...to this show to a certain extent. At the end of it all, the ending itself isn't anything mindblowing (which is what I initially had my hopes for), but the route that the show takes us through is what that really matters.That being said, this show is far from being deemed as a masterpiece. It had a very strong start (one of the most shocking endings of a first episode might I add), and just when I was about to coin it the anime of the season, things went downhill with the plunge in animation, pacing and storytelling in general. The animation in the later episodes of 6-9 was such an eyesore, not because its the worst art I've seen in the entirety of my anime watching experience, but because in comparison to the astonishingly detailed and smooth action sequences in episodes 1 and 2, the distinct difference in quality was extremely apparent. But, to give the show its benefit of the doubt, I assume my enjoyment would be raised higher should the show have sufficient budget to pull of what it intended to.And while it's one thing to want the audience to be able to predict what happens next, it's another to be highly formulaic in the execution, leaving us only with the empty shell of what Juuni Taisen aimed to be — a series that was no short of some extremely mediocre episodes. I'm talking about ones that were so badly structured, with flashbacks thrown in abruptly with no sense of direction.However, when I think back to certain moments that left me shell-shocked and so desperately wanting more when the ending credits kicked in, I'm able to barely close an eye and pretend that such episodes were merely a deja-vu that are not actually in the show.Personally, I acknowledge that many might find this show to be garbage (as reflected in its poor ratings), but despite the holes in its narrative and subpar animation quality, it did resonate with me emotionally and has made me ponder on certain philosophical things that I'd never given any attention to prior to watching Juuni Taisen.

From very early on you could figure out the order the battle royale was going for, and even if you couldn’t there were plenty of other hints to let you know who would die and who would be the winner. However, I just couldn’t bring myself to hate it. What saved the show from going below 5/10 were the characters. I, like many others, love a good villain, and a show that has such a variety of messed up individuals was able to slightly make up for the...lacklustre action and deaths.For any show to work, it needs interesting characters. For all that Juuni Taisen did poorly, the characters it created were pretty great. Each one is a warrior, doing jobs that no one else could with the lost lives of thousands in their resumes. Of course, not everyone goes about this the same way, and it creates a cast that you want to get invested in even though they'll probably die. You get a deceitful Robin Hood that causes both the rich and poor to suffer, a beast-like soldier that drowns their PTSD in alcohol and blood, and a master manipulator with some special eyes in the sky, just to name a few. Almost every character felt unique in the way they act upon and view their surroundings, making it quite a grim experience as you watch all their planning go to ruin. Even some of the abilities were able to capture my curiosity as I watched them either raise an army of the dead, create poisons and bombs as their weapons or just simply rip people to shreds in a variety of different ways.Unfortunately, for as much as I enjoyed the characters, the rest of the show just didn't quite hit the mark. For an action show, the fights were so lacklustre. You rarely got to see them battle it out and when they did it felt pretty messy with it either jumping from scene to scene way too much or using off looking CG animation for the characters. To be perfectly honest, the backstories of each character showing them outside of the Juuni Taisen was much more fun to watch than the actual show. They were a perfect representation of how fucked up war is and how it affects people differently, even the ones that you’d think are used to the everyday slaughter. Grief, joy, trauma, ecstasy, and a plethora of other emotions can be found across the cast as they continued their awful ways of living. The only characters that I wasn't too fond of in terms of personality and backstory were Dog (an assassin who specialises in poison) and Horse, (a science experiment soldier afraid of losing) as they felt a bit shallow compared to the rest of our cast, but ignoring them the show really nailed its flashbacks.So, you’re probably asking how exactly does a show about killing each other work if there isn’t much action, and sadly it just doesn’t. Most of the deaths are too quick and lack impact, with only a few occasional ones that are given enough time to give a little more depth to the characters in their final moments. I get that the show is trying to say that if these people make even just one simple mistake, they could die on the battlefield as quickly as snapping your fingers, but watching such nice characters get such swift ends is just not as enjoyable as it could have been.I really wanted Juuni Taisen to be amazing, but it just couldn’t reach the expectations I had for it. It was still an enjoyable show, but it could have been so much better if it hadn’t been a battle royale. Give me a spin-off series where it’s just the characters on the battlefield instead of the arena where we watch them do what they do best, and I’ll fall in love.

For what I have right now… I’m a little disappointed knowing that recommending it to others will probably just add to the number of people that hate it."", 'It\'s been a long time since an anime pissed me off so much with ending. Let\'s get non-spoiler part of review out first:It\'s not worth it, there\'s some cool animations and fight scenes, sure, but there\'s even more poorly written ""character background"" which I recommend to just skip with 5 second intervals and I\'m pretty sure you\'ll get everything you needed. Tbh you should just skip the whole show and look up gifs and videos/amvs from this, there\'s nothing else valuable here, just super-badly-written-overly-edgy-fate/taisen.Now, SPOILER part:Ok, it started out pretty well with that Boar lady, and backstory was one of the better ones,...so I could easily get into the show, and visuals/fights surely made it worthwhile, but after first episode it was all downhill. It\'s not like I hated everything, where else can you see ""mostly-naked-necromancer-bunny-on-heels vs monkey with a THICC ass"" fight?! Ox stabbing chicken in the face was so well made scene as well. And episode 11? Brilliant. I had high hopes for the last episodes after that! Just to be backstabed by show like the rest of the cast.Normally, I\'d rate Enjoyment part of the show a lot higher in a case like this, but story was so badly written and some of the characters so bad, it sucked most of it out. Character backstory just before they die - I\'m sick of this already god damn it, is this so hard to learn that it doesn\'t work that way? Character isn\'t more likeable because it has more lore, it doesn\'t give their death any weight at all either. One of the most likeable characters in this show imo was that Bunny dude, and look at how much backstory he has - none. Does he need? No. Did others need? Some - maybe, but only if 12th episode doesn\'t fuck up and just throws everything under water. Show gave us 0 conclusions, and it\'s a pure form of frustration of finally getting to the good part - just to be denied. It\'s the laziest and most pretentious of all writings to just act like it was a wise thing to do when it in fact was a very poorly put dot on a story writer had not skill to pull of in the first place.....wait I just looked it up and the author is Nisio Isin? Wait wha... Jesus. Please don\'t let this man get near to anything other than monogatari stuff. I love monogatari too much to go on shit-talk about him more, so I\'m just gonna assume he put himself in a corner where he had no good way to finish story and just ended it as quickly as he could. so I could easily get into the show, and visuals/fights surely made it worthwhile, but after first episode it was all downhill.

I seen the word edgy been thrown around a lot especially in regards to this anime.What makes this anime different than other death game type animes like Mirai Nikki is that there is a reason for all of the dark content, this anime has a lot of things to say for just 12 episodes. All of the characters back stories are really deep and thought provoking.There are themes of war and morality that are presented beautifully in this anime. I found that each episode kept on getting better and...better. I think this anime can draw a very strong emotional response from the viewer. The only thing is that this anime is predictable. This anime has a formula for the way it progresses and you will be able to pick up on that which is a little disappointing. Also I found the ending to not be as good as the rest of the show.Anyways I think this is a very deep anime and I highly enjoyed it.(Story: 8)  (Art: 7)  (Sound: 8)  (Character: 9)  (Enjoyment: 9)  (Overall: 8) better.

It has good moments in it, and the occasional character I liked, but it is not a good show. Yet for the entire 12 episodes, I was never forcing myself to keep watching it.Let\'s start with how it\'s not a good show. At first, it kinda sets itself up as a battle royale with no main character and as such is just a ""pin your hopes and see who survives"" sort of ordeal. However, if you know about the Chinese Zodiac, watch the end credits, or have basic pattern recognition, you will know the order of deaths...and who will die. Okay, then maybe it\'s the sort of show where the appeal is not what will happen, but how it will happen. Except that for the most part, for a battle royale show, the battles aren\'t really that interesting. There\'s a few moments, but generally this show doesn\'t go for big climactic moments, but more understated deaths, usually to its detriment. Then maybe the characters pull it through?Actually, that\'s probably the closest answer. The characters aren\'t great, but seeing how and why each of them is in this is actually kinda interesting. There are some characters I grew to like or find their motives interesting enough to keep watching, but the basic pattern recognition mentioned above comes in here, as the death order is the order in which characters give their backstory. Consistently.So why did I keep coming back? Well, I can unreservedly say I found the last few episodes actually legitimately good, partially due to developing a character that I found really engaging and partially due to some of the twists, but what kept me going through most of the series was actually the how. Just seeing what the characters had planned even if we knew they wouldn\'t be around to execute it was kinda cool honestly. But even then, this is the sort of set-up I want someone to take and just do it better. A battle royale with no clear protagonist is cool, but it\'s undermined by a different way of predicting deaths. Some of the characters have interesting motives, but it\'s cut short by the fact that by the time we hear them, they\'re close to death. I want someone to try this again and learn from what this show did wrong and make it better.Overall, Juuni Taisen gets a critical score of 4/10 with an enjoyment of 6/10. Technically, it\'s not a good show, but I had a decent bit of fun with it, and did want to see what happened. If it sounds interesting and you\'re willing to put up with many flaws, it might be worth your time, but there\'s much better shows out there and nothing here you have to check out by any stretch of the imagination. and who will die.

As a reviewer, I actually had to rewatch to get a better grasp of how I felt about it.Like a true Battle Royale, the scene is set with an emptied out city, just for this tournament. Representatives from the different Zodiac families with special killing abilities somewhat related to their animal are pitted against each other till a lone victor remains.It starts with the point of view of a character who is about to take part in the deadly contest. Flashbacks of their backstory is shown and embedded into the...audience. Viewers are invested and maybe even rooting for this person until the battle starts and all hell breaks loose.Many may claim that the order of deaths is predictable. That was my honest initial reaction and that the end was nonsense. However, upon watching the anime again, the fact that some gemstones in its story telling were easy to overlook became apparent.The build-up of each character’s background was superb. With a few forgivable plot holes, it was not difficult to understand and therefore empathize with their respective stories. A myriad of personalities (psychotic, narcissistic, avoidant, depressive, etc.) clash with contrasting ideologies (peace-loving, survival of the fittest, true righteousness, etc.) and what emerges is a mirror of present-day reality.At first glance, it seems as if all the growth in the plot was trashed. During the competition, the eventual winner was continuously doubted and questioned. When in truth, s/he was the one who was most aware and with the most relevant or important experience. Once the champion emerged after all those deaths, it seemed to have ended for naught. When in real life, as with the show, given all these viable philosophies, endless possibilities, and crazy realities, the choice made was one not far from what one would choose today. It was a reflection or satire of this very day and how everything from the past ends up in the hands of such.There were indeed some elements in the show that were irrelevant (i.e. voting/betting on the winner), but the development of backstories and eventual great reflection on reality is what pulled this up. It would have been more appreciated if the show delved more into the plot, rather than rush everything in just 12 episodes. audience.

It might even be the best the entire season.Story 7/10Sure the story isn't the best but it was really decent being a battle Royale anime.

Lets have some amazing fights........or lets just go looking at 12 backstories of some random guys just so you can see them dying 5 minutes later.Story: This is one of the main reason why its mediocre at best. More than half of story is flashback for every character which also mean that this character will die very soon. In these flashbacks it always is about some pseudo-philosofical teory why somebody fight or what is and isnt good or another bullshit. This is not reason...i started to watch these series. I want to see good fight, i want to see intrique, betrayal, suprise atacks, guessing who will die first. None of this is here. Every fight with one exeption end one minute after it begins many times with some deus ex machina move. First time is really suprising and refreshing after many shonens which can have 5 minute of fight have in 3 episodes. but after third episode it gets boring and predictable. Another problem is that it is not suprising who will die next. There is way to know it and you dont even have to give it much thinking. I knew who will die in episode 9 after i saw just 3 episodes. So you have series who wants you to guess who will die next but also it will just tell you before it even begins. 3/10Characters: I must say characters are little bit interesting. Every character have his way of killing which could be interesting to see. Every character have some reason to go to this deathmach some of them even know they wont probably survive but they still go there. Some of them have even some kind of special power which can make fight even more interesting......but there is one who is reason why it isnt nearly as good as it could be. There is little bit of spoiler. One of the character is necromant(it was shown in first episode so not much of spoiler). So instead of seeing some interesting fights with clash of ideals or protecting someone. we have fight agaist corpse. which can move even without head. How can be this interesting? Also this whole ability have some really big asspulls. Some of the charactercs can be little bit interesting but thats about it. 5/10Sound: Unfortunately i never give much attetion to music so cant say if its good or bad because without opening/ending i dont remember any of music. I must say that i quite liked them so i dont see any problem here. 6/10Art: It started good. nothing exeptional but not bad either. But with every episode it gets worse to the point you can see bad links without even trying. It may be because lack of funds or more probably lack of time. But still its not good. 4/10Enjoyment: Like i said it started really good after first 2 episodes it would be clearly 9/10 but then it started to go down really quickly. Seeing flashback every episode with it taking it at least half of episode gets boring. And because i already know winner and even order of dying it takes away every little suprise. And the bigges problem its anime about fighing almost without fighting. How can this be any good? 4/10(and gets lower)Summary: It had really good potetial being first true battle royal without clear winner from begining. Unfortunately it got lost in endless backstories with actual fight taking less than 5 minutes in every episode. Overall 5/10 with one point taking it for having potetial. i started to watch these series. I want to see good fight, i want to see intrique, betrayal, suprise atacks, guessing who will die first.

There's a lot of backstories, even the first episode is mostly just world building and backstory.Honestly, the only reason I'm writing this, is because someone had to tell me this exists.  For those that call this story predictable... it is.  Because it's the retelling of something.  In the 10th episode, one character makes a reference to a specific something.  I cannot give spoilers here,...but if you pm me I can explain if you would like.  The reference, is what Juuni Taisen is a retelling of, just in a different setting.My only real problem, is I told myself midway if I did not like the winner, I would not like the show.  Not because of wah I want X to win, but whether I just like the winner's personality, and no, the character was boring.  While I liked a few other contestants, he and the 12th episode just leave a sour taste of finishing the story.  I hope I've made sense. but if you pm me I can explain if you would like.

I\'ve seen a lot of fans get angry when people say it\'s predictable, so I just wanted to get that out there. Pleased? Okay, moving on.Juuni Taisen is a trainwreck. It started out so promising, but slowly sank into the ranks of meh. It\'s probably the most underwhelming anime I\'ve ever seen. That said, there were good things about it. Sadly the bad things were just too glaring and I just got very bored. The only reason...I finished it was because I wanted to see if it managed to redeem itself, but sadly it never happened.As I said, there are some good things about this anime. The artstyle looks pretty good. A lot of dark shadows and cool costumes helped set a certain atmosphere. There were also some decent characters among all the bland ones, especially Monkey. The OP and ED were also pretty good. The best thing about the anime though is the potential. Since there was no main character I thought that would mean that anyone could die at any moment and that made me feel hyped. Finally, a battle royal without a set winner! And then I realized the set order of deaths (this isn\'t a spoiler, it\'s very obvious).Sadly all the potential this anime had got quickly flushed away when I noticed the set deaths and the way every episode was structured. If the anime wanted to be predictable on purpose for some effect, it failed.This anime has a lot of talking and inner thoughts. Too much actually. There are so few silent moments it gave me a headache. Everything in this anime is explained and repeated to the smallest detail. Every observation is either said out loud or we hear the thoughts of someone explaining it. This anime does not trust its viewers to see or figure out anything by themselves, which made me feel like the anime thought I was a toddler. That is especially insulting when the anime seems to want to be mysterious.As everyone has mentioned before me, the animation quality very quickly dropped. A lot of repeated scenes, scenes where everyone stands still and even when they try to up it with something cool it only lasts for a second. Especially the action. I\'ve seen people say that the action is ""non-stop and blood-pumping"", which I don\'t really understand since the action in each action-scene lasts for maybe a few seconds with a lot of long talks or thoughts in between. And every death happens way too quickly. Was this to save on the animation budget or on purpose? I don\'t know, but it was very disappointing nonetheless.Though some of the character backgrounds were a little interesting, many of them were also pretty standard. It was also hard to focus on them since every time we saw a flashback it was like the anime was raising a death flag for the character, which made it very hard to care.If I was to find one word to describe this anime it would be underwhelming. Almost every aspect was lacking in one way or the other. It\'s so disappointing since I truly wanted the anime to be good! Sadly, all the way until the end, it was boring and lacking. Still, I can see why some people like it. For me though, the bad outweighed the good by too much.+Artstyle/costume design+Some of the characters were interesting+Potential+Good OP and ED-Animation drop-Predictable-Repeating episode structure-Too much explaining-Actionscenes were too short-Many standard character backgrounds-Disappointing-Wasted potentialDespite all that I\'ve said, this anime is not terrible.

Each individual is viewed as honorable masters of war and were chosen by their countries to compete in this battle. Each represents an animal and each has different strengths. The winner of this battle is granted any one wish.The advantage that this anime has over other competition-based anime is that many real-life morals are presented for the audience to feast upon. Consequently, you will have a favorite character either because...of their fighting style or the morals that they represent and their backgrounds. Each character is given at least one episode worth to provide a sustainable background for, and you will likely favor one person's strife over another's.You will never suspect when one character will die. It will happen suddenly and without warning.Ratings time:Story - 8 - The battle for survival is the clear purpose. Not much beyond the battlefield. It is simple in nature, complex in technicalities, and entertaining to watch.Graphics - 9 - Modern graphics. Nothing insanely crazy, though well done.Soundtrack - 9 - Geared for battle. Cool to listen to.Characters - 10 - I appreciate how each character was given a proper backstory, or at least enough to understand why they are within this war and their feelings.Overall - 7 - Because my own personal bias comes into this now. It was an awesome and entertaining watch, though was not given enough episodes, I believe, to further the fulfillment of the plot.Recommended - I think if you want to add an interesting and eccentric anime to your list without expecting too much then this would be a good one. of their fighting style or the morals that they represent and their backgrounds.

It is simple in nature, complex in technicalities, and entertaining to watch.Graphics - 9 - Modern graphics. Nothing insanely crazy, though well done.Soundtrack - 9 - Geared for battle. Cool to listen to.Characters - 10 - I appreciate how each character was given a proper backstory, or at least enough to understand why they are within this war and their feelings.Overall - 7 - Because my own personal bias comes into this now. It was an awesome and entertaining watch, though was not given enough episodes, I believe, to further the fulfillment of the plot.Recommended - I think if you want to add an interesting and eccentric anime to your list without expecting too much then this would be a good one."", 'Juuni Taisen: The NOT Battle Royale Battle Royale.For LA, Juuni Taisen was one of the more surprising anime at the start of Fall 2017, LA had huge expectations and by the end of it...........those expectations weren\'t met.But that\'s still ok.Juuni Taisen is a battle royale anime about the Chinese Zodiacs personified fighting to be granted one wish. Typical Battle Royale scthick and all.But with numerous deaths coming from a mile away, from the ending theme to the deaths going in reverse Chinese zodiac order...hey it\'s not a spoiler if it\'s given away in the first 2 episodes!.So why is LA saying all this?...well it\'s the...characters as small of a screentime they develop that are the central focus of this anime.....as well as the brutal action scenes.Character-wise, LA is the Year of the Chicken...so LA should like Niwatori voiced by Ayane Sakura, but LA sees Shuryuu (Monkey) voiced by Saori Hayami and Tora (Tiger) voiced by Hiromi Igarashi having the best character backstory and probably the most likable characters out of the cast. LA hated Usagi voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto and the Tatsumi Brothers voiced by Takuya Eguchi and Kousuke Toriumi as one of them is a homicidal maniac but is one of the most threatening forces in the anime besides Ushii while the other just had the most boring uninteresting character backstory out of the entire cast. OK so character wise it just really depends who you like or hate in this anime and it goes accordingly even if your favourite character dies or not will have an impact which would happen whether your disagree with LA or not with this one.Animation wise by Studio Graphinica, the animation for the most part is done decently from the rather uhhh exotically made character designs to some of the set battle scenes are choreographed quite well. The thing is for LA, LA saw many of later episodes to have dipped in quality to seeing blatant CGI and the choreography flatlined too. So Graphinica long story short, started off well but fell and fell down HARD.Voice acting was decent all round and hell, LA even heard of the Funimation Dub as well. So let\'s start with the Japanese cast. The Japanese cast was VERY good, from Ayane Sakura, Saori Hayami, Yoko Hikasa, Hiromi Igarashi and Nobuhiko Okamoto was great in this anime. Yeeeahhh Nobuhiko voicing Usagi and doing his tranquil crazy scthick was done very well even if LA didn\'t like Usagi as a character. LA\'s favourite voice actor in the Japanese department would be Hiromi Igarashi for LA, if only because of Hiromi\'s consistently drunken accenting and keeping it up for like 90% of the anime was stellar oddly enough, with Saori Hayami being LA\'s second favourite because..Saori Hayami duh. Moving over to the Funimation Dub and sorry but Jerry Jewel is a great voice actor and all but he hammed it up too much for LA to take him seriously in comparison to Nobuhiko\'s voice acting. This voice cast was still great, from Collen Clinkenbeard as Tora, Caitlin Glass as Shuryuu and Monica Rial as Niwatori but the MVP this voice cast easily goes to Stephanie Young as  Inounoshishi because damn does she do that mature femme fatale almost similar to Yoko Hikasa!. All in all, the voice cast in both versions is AMAZING and LA would have suggested either versions to anyone who\'s gonna watch Junni Taisen.So you kinda guessed that this anime disappointed LA at the start of this anime review and you are right, as it went into an anti climax and because this is the Chinese Zodiac and all, references and homages to the Chinese Zodiacs. For what the ending tried to do, LA ""gets"" it and everything and but even then LA\'s expectations of Junni Taisen dipped as soon as the Tatsumi Brothers backstory was put into focus (but then got it back once the focus was put onto Tora), so what the ending did, LA gets it. Ohh and spoilers...kinda. Isin Nisio tried to put the battle royale like as per usual, but it\'s what\'s the WISH that becomes important by the end of it. We know from previous wish granting battle royale animes that the protagonist in question, that we know what they will wish for or if the wish granting is gonna be an ass and do the opposite and the wish becomes meaningless. (see Fate/Zero and/or Mirai Nikki). In Juuni Taisen we don\'t get to find out who the ""main character"" is, let alone the wish is until the finale.....and it\'s an anticlimax sure but Nisio put focus onto the wish and oddly does not make it meaningless...anticlimactic sure, but meaningless...NOPE.Juuni Taisen is LA\'s most disappointing anime for Fall 2017, no doubt, but that\'s ok. characters as small of a screentime they develop that are the central focus of this anime.....as well as the brutal action scenes.Character-wise, LA is the Year of the Chicken...so LA should like Niwatori voiced by Ayane Sakura, but LA sees Shuryuu (Monkey) voiced by Saori Hayami and Tora (Tiger) voiced by Hiromi Igarashi having the best character backstory and probably the most likable characters out of the cast.

I know this is the exact antithesis of what it's advertised to be, but taken at face value it has major issues holding it back, chief among them being a majority of screen-time being taken up by past events, plot holes galore, very obvious death-flags, not enough actual battle to even fill a kiddie pool, very off-putting...transitions between 2D and 3D animation, and a terrible ending with zero payoff.

They do contain spoilers.So, what were the good parts of Juuni Taisen? The art was honestly pretty nice, in my opinion. Occasionally there was some distracting 3DCG used, but otherwise there was this nice sketchy style throughout the series that was nice to look at and matched the tone. The character designs were also good, matched the characters themselves, and easy to tell apart - well, except for the Tatsumi brothers, whose voices, appearances and personalities are stupidly similar. This wasn't even...for any real reason and was flat-out confusing. Fortunately other than the flashback, there are... other ways to tell them apart, so it wasn't too much of a problem. Sound is also fine, nice OP and ED, decent enough soundtrack. The deaths, although predictable, were entertaining to watch, and the fight choreography was good, and there's plenty of blood.So what did it get wrong? Well, the character deaths are predictable as hell. It follows an episodic pattern, as well as another pattern that becomes obvious after a few episodes. The characters are somewhat bland with very basic motivations, and it would've definitely been nicer to go more into depth into the stories of some of them, but there's only so much that can be done in twelve episodes. The characters' powers are ridiculously unbalanced as well. The last few episodes are particularly egregious with this, where certain characters have a stupidly long amount of time to get out of bad situations. The powers themselves are also somewhat nebulous in their rules - why can this character use their power to do this thing, but then suddenly they can't do that thing later on? To what extent do their powers work? There are a lot of moments when you're just shouting at the screen because of missed opportunities.This is more of a personal grievance than anything, but also, Usagi doesn't get a flashback. He was an interesting character (also my own Zodiac animal) and I looked forward to seeing his motivations and deeper personality, but the closest he gets are a couple short lines detailing his wish.Overall, the series was... good. A decent 7/10. I didn't regret watching it or anything. Again, there were so many things that could've been done better, and so many missed opportunities. Waiting for the twists that never came. The final ending is also idiotic so don't expect anything great.

Otherwise, skip it.Juuni Taisen (JT) is a battle royale anime in which 12 participants, each representing one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac calendar, battle it out for the sake of having one wish granted. JT tries to do away some of the ‘fluff’ that other battle royale anime (such as Fate Zero, for example) have and the entirety of JT, except for flashbacks, takes place over the course of one night. That being said, while JT does provide some novelty, parts of...it are mired in bad writing, abysmally inconsistent visual quality, and pacing that is all over the place. Some of these aspects are somewhat tempered by a redeeming final episode. I’m not going to compare it with anime like Fate Zero because JT is an entirely different beast.Let\'s focus first on the few things this anime does well: This anime is good at initially subverting expectations. In other words, it initially goes against the viewers\' expectations about what will happen, which makes for a few entertaining ""did they really just do that"" moments. It also captures the battle royale aspect better than other related anime, there is no clear protagonist until the end. Almost no character has plot armor, and the times plot armor is used, it is justified in the story. The final episode is also a surprisingly good conclusion to this story and adds many of the elements that were missing up to that point. The final episode is decent enough for me to increase JT’s rating from a 4 to a 5.Now moving on to what it does badly: Everything else. Lets start from the worst. The anime sucks at foreshadowing. It makes everything too obvious. The moderately savvy anime viewer can figure out the big ‘plot twist’ from the very start. Most anime viewers can very easily figure out the order of the deaths very early on, and also figure out who has the plot armor. Sure, this was intended, but that doesn’t make it any better.While the anime is good at initially subverting viewer expectations, this gimmick becomes old quite fast. Not only can you expect JT to try to surprise you, after the first few episodes you can also guess with reasonable accuracy as to how it will try to surprise you.Regarding the pacing, JT gives almost each character a backstory in the form of flashbacks. The flashbacks are not enough to flesh out a lot of the characters, which I don’t actually mind, since considering the 12 episode length, it is unreasonable to expect JT to fully develop each of the 12 characters. The flashbacks are a problem because they really mess with the pacing of the show. Some flashbacks are very short. Some take up whole episodes. Like many anime with a cast of characters this large, some characters receive decent characterization and some receive very little. Most of the characters in JT fall in the latter category, and even when some characters do receive characterization, it isn’t always very good.The pacing and narrative suffer from issues that are independent of the flashbacks as well. A built up final confrontation is ended through a contrivance, leading to a very anti-climatic end to the tournament. It also has several plot holes regarding that confrontation, and inconsistencies regarding a very crucial character\'s powers.JT also has issues with world building, it isn’t able to decide on how it wants to incorporate supernatural elements in its narrative and in its characters. In this tournament you have characters with shitty powers like not needing to reload a gun, characters with no powers, characters with useful powers like being able to fly, and characters with stupidly overpowered abilities. This destroys any semblance of the battle royale feel that JT is going for, because some characters have almost no chance of winning.And then you have the production quality. The anime starts off fine, but the production quality really, really dips after the middle. Clearly the issues of pacing showed in the budget as well. The visual quality is all over the place after the initial half.However, despite all these issues, JT does have one of the more interesting finales I have seen so far. I don’t feel like I wasted my time watching JT, although it is far from the best, and if I could go back in time, I wouldn\'t watch it. If you like the destination rather than the journey, watch JT, otherwise skip it, ‘cause the journey ain’t that pretty. Hell, one of the reasons I like the finale is because what came before it was bad. It\'s like being glad that you\'ve reached some horrible war-torn place because your plane ride was so bad. it are mired in bad writing, abysmally inconsistent visual quality, and pacing that is all over the place.

Nothing else to add, simply a battle fest with a straightforward plot-device and goal, but feels it\'s just absolutely pointless. Anyhow, the story aspect is simply dull and disappointing.✦Art & Sound✦Art and animation is probably the best part about this Anime. It had some cool action and odd designs....Music on the other hand, can\'t remember anything memorable. Fair enough.✦Character✦All sorts of character with their own past and reasons of being in the whole ""battle royale game"". All have their own skill sets and surprisingly enough dumb ""progression and finale"" for the most of them. I just couldn\'t care less about characters for the most part. And somehow, my first guess who would ""win the game"" after first one fell in it. Was spot on. And that characters ability was as well rather easy to guess and just dull usage in this Anime.Variety of stereotypes and backstories were nice. Aside that it was rather boring.✦Enjoyment & Overall✦I remember seeing trailer before this Anime got released. It seemed edgy and fun. Something right up my alley. But now that I watched and saw it being simply a ""battle royale"" ... with rather disappointing combat, characters and the whole ending and how it ended. I simply feel I got scammed. It wasn\'t anything about being hyped or not. It simply felt dull as I were watching.In another words.. it wasn\'t my cup of tea and almost everything in there felt so pointless by the end of it.

Upbeat OP and ED theme3. Characters backstories told4. Well used CGCons:1. Backstories pretty much similar...2. Predictable outcomes3. Boring characters, except two who I\'ll be mentioning below<LONG REVIEW>""Juuni Taisen"" or ""Zodiac Wars"" is a double edged sword for me. I don\'t know if I like it or dislike it, mainly because there are episodes where the anime stood out and there are also episodes which, to me, are boring AF.Now let me clarify first that I like Battle Royale anime. You can see it from my rating of the last Battle Royale-esque anime last year ""Magical Girl Raising Project"". I love that series. When I found out about Juuni Taisen I was seriously hyped for it.After watching the first three episodes, it didn\'t impress me a single bit. It\'s just characters boasting about how powerful they are and getting killed off easily. To me, I hate that kind of development. I hate seeing characters who seemed strong getting killed off in one shot. I\'d consider that lazy writing.However, after episode 3, I started to enjoy this series more. It didn\'t go down the route of killing one character per episode and I thank the series for that. But that doesn\'t change the fact that the character backstories told were pretty much the same and boring. I like MGRP because every character has a tragedic backstory to make me sympathize with them. However in this series, characters backstory often show how strong the particular character is, and I don\'t like it that much. What\'s the point of showing the power level of a character if he is going to die sooner or later. The only episode that stood out to me was episode 10, when the backstory of Tiger and Ox was shown, that is how this anime should be like, THAT IS HOW YOU WRITE A GOOD BATTLE ROYALE anime! Cannot believe I need to sit through 10 episodes of mediocrity to see one which actually impressed me.The characters are also pretty one dimensional. I don\'t feel any depth in them. Although their backstory were told and I totally appreciate it, but the fact still remained the same in which every character are who they are at first glance, except the two I mentioned earlier. It made me feel nothing about their death and that is sad because a battle royale anime needs to be impactful.Well I don\'t blame this anime for being predictable. After all this is based off of the Chinese Zodiac race. So I just want to be more invested in the characters. But each character had almost the same backstory making me feel a bit bored while watching it, especially the story about the dragon and the snake. But I still appreciate that the show actually told us who the character are to let us learn more about them.The art and animation is pretty consistent. I like the use of CG in this series. The action scenes were well animated and I love it. If only this anime had more of those scenes other than characters talking non-stop about their tactics and telling you how strong they are, then I would love this series more.The music is upbeat. I love it. I love the OP theme and the ED theme. Background musics, although didn\'t stood out to me, but were still well placed making the action scenes more impactful.Overall, as a fan of Battle Royale anime myself, I won\'t give this anime a shit rating, it\'s a fair enough/above average anime. I do find myself enjoying this. But whether or not to recommend this, I\'d say watch it if you like battle royale anime like Fate. If you hate it, then skip this. It\'s not for you. That\'s it. 6/10 Thanks for reading. 2. Predictable outcomes3. Boring characters, except two who I\'ll be mentioning below<LONG REVIEW>""Juuni Taisen"" or ""Zodiac Wars"" is a double edged sword for me. I don\'t know if I like it or dislike it, mainly because there are episodes where the anime stood out and there are also episodes which, to me, are boring AF.Now let me clarify first that I like Battle Royale anime. You can see it from my rating of the last Battle Royale-esque anime last year ""Magical Girl Raising Project"". I love that series. When I found out about Juuni Taisen I was seriously hyped for it.After watching the first three episodes, it didn\'t impress me a single bit. It\'s just characters boasting about how powerful they are and getting killed off easily. To me, I hate that kind of development. I hate seeing characters who seemed strong getting killed off in one shot. I\'d consider that lazy writing.However, after episode 3, I started to enjoy this series more. It didn\'t go down the route of killing one character per episode and I thank the series for that. But that doesn\'t change the fact that the character backstories told were pretty much the same and boring. I like MGRP because every character has a tragedic backstory to make me sympathize with them. However in this series, characters backstory often show how strong the particular character is, and I don\'t like it that much. What\'s the point of showing the power level of a character if he is going to die sooner or later. The only episode that stood out to me was episode 10, when the backstory of Tiger and Ox was shown, that is how this anime should be like, THAT IS HOW YOU WRITE A GOOD BATTLE ROYALE anime! Cannot believe I need to sit through 10 episodes of mediocrity to see one which actually impressed me.The characters are also pretty one dimensional. I don\'t feel any depth in them. Although their backstory were told and I totally appreciate it, but the fact still remained the same in which every character are who they are at first glance, except the two I mentioned earlier. It made me feel nothing about their death and that is sad because a battle royale anime needs to be impactful.Well I don\'t blame this anime for being predictable. After all this is based off of the Chinese Zodiac race. So I just want to be more invested in the characters. But each character had almost the same backstory making me feel a bit bored while watching it, especially the story about the dragon and the snake. But I still appreciate that the show actually told us who the character are to let us learn more about them.The art and animation is pretty consistent. I like the use of CG in this series. The action scenes were well animated and I love it. If only this anime had more of those scenes other than characters talking non-stop about their tactics and telling you how strong they are, then I would love this series more.The music is upbeat. I love it. I love the OP theme and the ED theme. Background musics, although didn\'t stood out to me, but were still well placed making the action scenes more impactful.Overall, as a fan of Battle Royale anime myself, I won\'t give this anime a shit rating, it\'s a fair enough/above average anime. I do find myself enjoying this. But whether or not to recommend this, I\'d say watch it if you like battle royale anime like Fate. If you hate it, then skip this. It\'s not for you. That\'s it. 6/10 Thanks for reading.', ""Juuni Taisen's premise is straightforward and unsurprising: twelve warriors, each carrying the name and various traits of one of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, engage in a brutal free-for-all battle royale. Why? All for the sake of having any one wish of their choosing granted. If it sounds familiar, it is because it very much is, the premise being a near-exact imitation of the Fate series'. So the question remains: does Juuni Taisen do enough to set itself apart in this bloody free-for-all, wish-granting niche? Or does it fall flat on its face, and accept forgettable mediocrity, achieving little besides its initial zodiac gimmick...to forge a new identity for itself?If someone were to stop watching Juuni Taisen after only a couple of episodes, they would probably remain under the impression that the show's strong suit is of a visual nature. In these opening episodes, animation is fluid and crisp, making early bouts of violence and action a genuine pleasure to watch.If they were to keep watching, however, they would no doubt have to eat their words. As the show progresses, the animation absolutely falls apart, making it increasingly difficult to understand characters' movements, and just downright painful to experience. In fact, the 8th episode is probably one of the worst, visually, that I have seen all year, due to shockingly low-quality animation, and background + character art that is so poorly done that it is, at times, a struggle to even understand what you are looking at anymore.Visually, it does pick up a bit after the horrendous 8th episode, but it never again meets the high standard the show establishes in its introductory episodes, which is quite a shame.The artwork is overall okay, maintaining a dark, somber palette throughout, which does complement the show's overall tone and themes appropriately. Most of the character designs are well-done too, going hand-in-hand with each character's associated Zodiac, but some feel a bit over-the-top, especially Usagi's, considering the otherwise serious tone throughout.Juuni Taisen's narrative effort is an uphill battle, especially considering how similarly it sets itself up to other, much more beloved anime. Unfortunately, it doesn't really do much to distinguish itself from these other works, and what little it does attempt to do, ultimately falls short and ends up not worth investing over 4 hours to get to.A major fault on Juuni Taisen's part is that it decides to spend each of its 12 episodes focusing on one of the Zodiac warriors, revealing their backstories and unfolding the events of the war through their eyes, all in one shot. The problem with this is that no character ends up fleshed-out enough nor memorable enough to garner any audience interest in their ultimate fate. Without a central character arc, the show has to rely mainly on shock twists (i.e. unexpected deaths) to keep viewers watching, which, while not the best way to tell a good story, would be a decent idea. Yet, we are still subject to flashback after flashback, with way too much of the show's airtime wasted on failed attempts to flesh out characters who, ultimately, have little impact on both overarching narrative and audience.Aside from this significant weakness, a few of the characters' backstories are somewhat intriguing, especially in their relation to the respective warrior's present-day situation.In the grand scheme of things, it is the Zodiac war, not the flashbacks, that are most intriguing to watch. Fake alliances, rivalries, tricks, bonds being formed, and all of the other various political aspects of the war are cool to watch in action, and benefit quite well from the show's shifting perspective structure, as we are privy to how different characters feel about and approach similar situations.One thing that I found odd was that the final episode occurs post-war and focuses on one particular character and a dilemma that they are currently facing. The details around their ability and the nature of this dilemma are introduced way too late to have any significant impact on the viewer, and the whole thing just seems kind of jarring and inconsequential, especially considering the climax had already passed.The cast is a mixed bag for the most part. Approximately half of the warriors are forgettable and are of little importance in the grand scheme of things, while others stand out as power players. Sharyuu's pacifistic personality works well as a contrast to the situation she is placed in, and, ironically, is one of the most exciting to follow for this reason alone. Ushii is also likable and is given standout moments here and there, but is for the most part, appealing for his coolness factor as opposed to multi-dimensional, nuanced character writing. In fact, the majority of the cast is characterized in a rushed, stereotypical nature, but the show doesn't seem to want to be more than a standard action entry anyway.As a villain, Usagi is satisfactory if only for his unsettling personality alone. Crazed and bloodthirsty, he functions as the main driving force behind the series' bloodshed and does feel like a real threat for the most part. On the other hand, he is also very one-note and is in no way more complex or nuanced than he appears at first glance, which is a bit of a let-down.If you're looking for a dumb, enjoyable time, Juuni Taisen is not that bad of a choice. Of course, there are other anime that share its battle-royale flair while, in addition, managing to juggle profound themes and intriguing character writing with their action quite well. A prime example of this is Fate/Zero, which should 100% be watched before even considering a show like this. Nonetheless, once you have finished with the brainier shows and find yourself looking for something similar, Juuni Taisen is a watered-down yet still acceptable variation to try out.Fans of pure action anime may enjoy the series' commitment to violence and bloodshed, but potentially also find themselves let down by the show's selection of fight scenes. Though intense, visceral and competently-choreographed, a large part of Juuni Taisen's fights don't end up lasting very long, which could certainly turn off viewers who have just waded through the endless flashbacks hoping to finally experience some actual action.At the end of the day, Juuni Taisen does manage to offer its viewers an opportunity to experience some mindless, action-packed fun. On top of that, the typical viewer will likely find at least one character to root for, one fight to take their breath away, and one backstory to find themselves sympathizing with.Beyond these few positives, the show has too many glaring flaws to merit being considered anything more than mediocre. Flashbacks stunt the flow of the narrative and offer little in the way of satisfaction and enjoyment, characterization is too tropey and simplistic, fights are cut way too short, and the visual presentation makes viewing a painful and confusing experience in later episodes. to forge a new identity for itself?If someone were to stop watching Juuni Taisen after only a couple of episodes, they would probably remain under the impression that the show's strong suit is of a visual nature.

I mean, a battle royale theme? Different and distinct characters? Survival? Sign me up!However, I got caught up in life and forgot all about it until last weekend but when I checked its page, I found many negative reviews and 3/10 ratings here and there and all over the place.Naturally, I started it with mixed feelings. I will be lying if I said I didn\'t think it was crap from the first two episodes.However, once I finished the third and fourth episode, I started to re-evaluate my opinion....Was that opinion in the beginning really mine? I couldn\'t judge just yet.As the series went on, I realized that my thoughts on the beginning were affected by the reviews I have read and a sudden realization hit me: ""Hey! This anime isn\'t bad at all!""My overall rating of it is 6, which is above the average.I tried to understand why people have been quick to bash it, and I came to a few conclusions:1- The very short fight scenes:If you go on wishing for very long, epic, fight scenes, you will just be disappointed. This is not Dragon Ball or One Piece, where the fights stretch off for weeks. In Juuni Taisen, a fight will end within 3 seconds. But I grew to love this aspect because it took me off guard and the creators just found a different \'killing\' way each time that I wasn\'t expecting.2-The \'flashbacks\':Sixty (sometimes forty) percent of the episodes are background stories of the characters. I loved them because it made me feel sympathy for them and get to know them. If there wasn\'t any background story, how would we know of them? We would end up just watching twelve strangers fight.Juuni Taisen was a very entertaining show. It mixed elements of thriller, paranormal, survival, drama and in my opinion succeeded in giving a fun anime to enjoy.I loved the introductions of each character before each fight. I loved their individuality.What lowered my rating would have to be the story. If there was more of a plot explored in depth, my rating would have been a solid eight. The concept of twelve countries fighting against each other, each one with a warrior that represented it, seemed to lack a lot. What is the cause of this conflict? Who are the people that bet on the winner? Why? What happens to the countries that lost their warriors?All in all, this was a decent show that I enjoyed very much. I would definitely recommend it for a change of pace in the survival genre. Oh! I LOVED THE OP! Was that opinion in the beginning really mine?

I would definitely recommend it for a change of pace in the survival genre. Oh! I LOVED THE OP!', 'Ah, Juuni Taisen, one of the series I enjoyed the most last year. It took me a while to finally write this review, but here it is.First, I see way too many people complaining that the story was ""predictable"" because the ending theme shows who was gonna die in order. But honestly, if this is the reason why you\'re mad at this anime, you totally missed its point. This was obvious from the beginning.- Story 8/10This is the original 12 Zodiac Animals story told as a battle royale. The story follows the order of the original myth - The last one to arrive at...God\'s party (or Heavenly Gate, or the Emperor\'s party, depending on which version you know) is the first one to die; The first one to arrive is the winner.You see characters representing each one of the animals killing each other until there\'s only one left - A typical battle royale, so if you\'re in the mood for some free violence with fun characters, jump on it!The story is, as I said, predictable, but that is if you know the right order of the 12 Zodiac Animals. If you don\'t, you have the option of simply not watching the ending and everything will be a surprise to you. If you want an unpredictable show this is the only tip I can give you.Obviously nobody would know this when the anime started airing, but now it\'s a possible option.- Characters 8/10This is where this show shines. All characters have their own personalities and all of them have a unique character design, mostly with traits of their respective zodiac animals. It\'s almost impossible to not find one that you\'re gonna like, even if it\'s one that die early. Since some of them do die very early, they have little time to make themselves likeable. The character design is the first thing to call your attention, to make you curious, and them you have at least a basic explanation of the characters\' personalities and backstory, this way you can decide your favorite. Sadly the chance of you getting attached to someone who won\'t last long is very high. Some of them were a lot of wasted potential so it could fit the order of the original myth, and this is the only reason why I don\'t give them the highest score.- Sound 9/10I\'m absolutely in love with the opening theme, even a year later, and also love the ending theme a lot. The soundtrack was decent, to be quite honest I don\'t remember much of it, but I assume it suited the anime pretty well since it didn\'t leave me with any negative impression.- Art & Animation 8/10The art is much better than the manga\'s, and less cutesy than the novel\'s, it was well adaptated in the anime. Sorry, Hikaru Nakamura, I love you, but your original design made the characters too cute for this show, Chikashi Kadekaru\'s style was better.The animation was good. Not exceptional but decent, at least most of the time. Although I admit the quality dropped in a few later parts. The dark atmosphere suited the story well, the use of CGI was well done. I don\'t really have many complains here.- Overall 9/10I loved this show. Everything about it was interesting to me, the characters were attractive enough for me to want to learn more about them, the battle itself made me curious to know how it would be developed, how the deaths would happen, and I was really curious to know everyone\'s wishes, specially the winner\'s. This was a show that held my attention because it kept me interested in what was gonna happen next, even if the ending was predictable, the story was still good enough for me to want to now the means to the end.Juuni Taisen is a good anime for those who are into action shows, I would definitely recommend it.

It takes very, very few risks, and brings very, very little to the ""battle royale"" genre as a result.STORY: Juuni Taisen is your traditional ""battle royale"" anime story-wise (12 people compete for the chance to win one wish of their choosing granted, modern day setting and technology, whoop-de-doo) save for one thing- the perspective the story is being told from varies from episode to episode. It\'s nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it creates a small sense of suspense in that we have no ""favorite""- there\'s no Saber, no Katniss- there is no explicit...hero/heroine, so the viewer can choose who they\'re rooting for from a near unbiased standpoint. Certain twists interested me, not going to lie, but many of the character\'s backstories bored me.ART: Gory. Completely inoffensive. It\'s not awful, and the character designs are interesting, but I kind of expected more from a ""battle royale"" anime visually. The battles we see are lacking in quality animation, especially in later episodes.SOUND: Again, inoffensive. Does nothing of praise, but doesn\'t deserve criticism. There are no interesting musical pieces present, and the sound effects in battle are just kind of ""there"". Voice acting was just ok, as well.CHARACTER: This is where this anime shines (if it really shines anywhere), and I can\'t say too much without spoiling deaths and such so I will leave it at an admittedly vague statement of ""I was pleasantly surprised"". The characters are much more complex then they appear at first, and their interactions are one of the few things that save this show from truly scraping the depths of mediocrity. Many characters interacted in ways I didn\'t expect, and positively affected my perception of the show overall.  Although some characters had muddy motivations, those who got a full episode explaining their backstory were quite well developed with decently clear (albeit not the most original/interesting) motives.ENJOYMENT: I enjoyed Juuni Taisen a fair bit, being intrigued at points but absolutely disinterested at others. I found it absolutely average, unquestionably so, starting around episode 5, but it rebounded back a little bit towards its last couple episodes.OVERALL: Juuni Taisen is just ok, and nothing else. It\'s not of the quality I would\'ve expected from Nisio Isin, seeing his other works (namely the Monogatari Series) adapted and written far better. There are, indisputably better anime, especially ""battle royale"" anime, out there, so watch those first, even if you\'re a Nisio Isin fan.5/10. hero/heroine, so the viewer can choose who they\'re rooting for from a near unbiased standpoint.

I like how they make the characters have this special powers and some of them have this connection like in the old story (ex Rat-Ox / Tiger-Sheep etc) One thing I regret is I expected more of the fighting scenes instead of several uninteresting backstory. I got so bored around Sheep's Ox's and Tiger's backstory. Overall it's good if you just need to spend some times without watching something hard but thrilling, and less thinking.Art : 8/10The design is amazing. I can easily recognized each characters from the very start. The animation is beautiful too especially the fighting and effect...(damn that fire). Pleasant for my eyes.Sound : 9-9.5/10The sound effect, backsound, everything is very supporting with the story. I jumped several times because of the sound effect (like when the monkey popped out from the rabbit's body etc) Also love the OP and ED.

Can't say anything.Enjoyment : 9/10Absolutely enjoy it from the first episode until the last. Except the lack amount of fighting scenes I wish they have more of that.Overall it is a good one.

Let's start.Story (1): 12 warriors must fight for the last one to win a wish like in Fate. The premise would not be bad if it were not because it is too predictable.

The fight choreography was spot-on, the animation had its own distinct look, characters, and it even had one of the best anime scenes i\'ve probably ever witnessed. (At the end of the first episode, you\'ll know it when you see it.)But after that everything is a train wreck. To...say this anime is predictable is an understatement. You will know when a character will die, always. And there is no suspense because of this. To put this in perspective, it follows the 12 Chinese Zodiacs in order, it shows the entire characters backstory right before they die, and even in the very opening of the show it shows you in reverse order who will die. And that\'s probably the biggest flaw of the show.Ignoring other plot points that never really got addressed at the end of the show, my other biggest complaint was the animation. The animation fluctuates CONSTANTLY. In the first episode, it\'s wonderfully and smoothly animated. Later on, characters lack details like faces , their hands and limbs look like doodles, and at one point for some reason Ox was missing a horn and in the next scene it was back in place. Then, it gets even more inconsistent with the introduction of heavy 3D CGI. Even while characters were standing in place, only moving their mouths, their entire body has been replaced with CG models. I have no reason why this decision was made, but it was a poor one.At the end of it all, to all of those who died in the show, they all died terribly unsatisfying. Right when you think there will be an epic battle, somebody just gets stabbed and they die. This applies to every single character. They pop in, say their introductions to eachother, then they just die and plop to the ground. It\'s not a long drawn out battle or even a seat clincher. For a show in the genre of and based around action, there\'s a significant lack of attention to it.I can really only recommend this show if you\'re bored and just need something to fill that gap. But if you are looking for something with substance or even mindless action, you\'re gonna have to look elsewhere. say this anime is predictable is an understatement.

It is a character drama about the twelve participating warriors, with each episode dedicated to flashbacks for the warrior of the week, and you should temper your expectations accordingly. There is some action in each episode, but overall you will see warriors' showcase their powers in fights against soldiers/gangsters/etc. and not so much against each otherThe Good:Juuni Taisen's definitely bucks convention in how it presents its story, which can be refreshing to people who are tired of the standard (some might argue stale)...way of storytelling in anime; a few of the characters are interesting, with well defined origins, motivations, and growth in their characters; the opening and ending themes are great.The Bad:Despite bucking storytelling convention, Juuni Taisen over-uses the exact same formula for every episode, which makes it extremely predictable; this formula also makes all of the characters are largely disposable, so you're unlikely to become invested in most of them; animation and art quality suffers immediately after the first episode and takes until episode 10 to improve again (they introduce CGI for a few fight scenes, it's not terrible though, but you will notice it).The Ugly:Juuni Taisen doesn't try to be an action anime, it doesn't even try to be unpredictable (seriously, ending credits spoils the order of the episodes and who ultimately wins), so it can only be judged by the strength of its cast of characters... but it's an incredibly inconsistent cast, with a third being very interesting, a third being serviceable, and the remaining third being incredibly shallow and forgettable; it's a story that abandons everything to do one thing very well, but fails as much as it succeeds.It's not bad, but it's not particularly good either.

For a very very little amount of time.[Story: 6/10]So the story surrounds a group of 12 warriors, representing 12 families, who\'re called by the names of the 12 zodiac signs and they each have powers related to the creature that their sign is. They participate in a battle royal, held once every 12 years called the, ""Juuni Taisen,"" and whoever wins, gets a wish of his or her\'s granted. Now, if someone enjoys shounen and...has watched a couple of famous shows, they\'ve come across this kind of plot, specifically because of the Fate Series and let\'s be honest here, the Fate Series isn\'t always always good but it\'s pretty enjoyable. Juuni Taisen tries to be the edgier cousin of Fate but it fails. As the story progresses, we learn more and more about each character and delve into their background, we also learn about their individual powers. However, the series mostly follows the \'show and kill formula,\' where they show us the past of the character they intend to kill off in that very episode, or in the next episode, this makes the show very predictable as we know who\'s going to die, for the most part. The answer to who\'s going to be the final winner is fairly obvious if one pays enough attention as, being the clichèd show it is, the show tries to put less attention on the important character and hence because we know we have the least amount of information about the Rat, we figure out that he is going to win very early on.[Art: 6/10]There\'s not much to share about the art to be honest, it\'s not bad but it\'s not good either. They do use a little bit of CGI here and there but it\'s so minimal that it isn\'t bothersome. The character designs aren\'t groundbreaking but they do help you remember who\'s who and what their powers are. The hand to hand combat scenes are well choreographed for the most part, especially in the first couple of episodes.[Sound: 6/10]The sound track tries to make the atmosphere tense and it does succeed in some cases but overall, it doesn\'t draw a lot of attention to itself. The OP is an electric guitar laden song, not exactly the type that hypes you up, it has more of a melancholic feel to it.[Characters: 6/10]Shows like Juuni Taisen rely heavily on their characters because with such a big and diverse cast that demands equal attention, there\'s really no way to make an overarching and complex narrative that relies solely on the story itself and not the characters. Juuni Taisen throws at us 12 people with varied motives that aren\'t explained. Simply put, we slowly figure out why these people are fighting but we don\'t know what they are fighting for. We don\'t know what they want, sure we do find out in the case of Nezumi but, for the most part we don\'t know and I refuse to believe that everyone is like Nezumi and they never thought about what they wanted. In the case of Sheep however, we are aware that he is fighting in the place of his grandchild and so we can assume that he doesn\'t have an ulterior motive.Since almost every character is explored within the confines of an episode, it\'s very difficult to figure out wether we like them or not. The actions of these characters have had a profound effect on the battlefields of the world and yet it feels like they\'re inconsequential. Simply put, Juuni Taisen fails to make us care for these characters.By far, the most interesting characters on this show are The Rabbit, The Ox and The Monkey. The Monkey makes the interesting character list because of her understanding of the way that peace works, her non violence beliefs should disqualify her as a warrior but she still is one, a rather good one at that. The Ox makes the cut because he is the most level headed out of all of them and he is different because he doesn\'t have a special power but he has experience and technique. The Rabbit is just bat shit crazy and a crazy factor is needed in shows like these. Nezumi would\'ve made the cut had they put more attention on him and his very interesting but overpowered ability.[Enjoyment: 5/10]Juuni Taisen is pretty enjoyable in parts but these parts are few and far between. Being predictable isn\'t necessarily a bad thing but in this case, it makes the show uninteresting. The fight choreography can be enthralling and do give us moments of joy but that\'s about it. One isn\'t really attracted to the OP not the ED.[FINAL SCORE: 6/10]I won\'t call Juuni Taisen a massive waste of time or anything but I would suggest that you only watch it if you\'re hard pressed to find anime that you actually want to watch. If you enjoy a predictable plot that has some moments of good action then sure, give this a go. has watched a couple of famous shows, they\'ve come across this kind of plot, specifically because of the Fate Series and let\'s be honest here, the Fate Series isn\'t always always good but it\'s pretty enjoyable.

Yes it was a pretty plain show but for the most part it was enjoyable and kept me interested. I had complaints here and there but the show did it\'s job of making me want to see it through. But god was that ending just absolute and utter trash. Not only does a warrior have a complete mental break down despite their ability that you think would have made them immune to something like that, but they had a very clear and simple wish. They even straight up said that they...wanted someone else\'s wish to come true but that they never figured it out.... THAT RIGHT THERE IS YOUR WISH THEN IDIOT. It\'s simple...if they can make any wish come true and you want ""BLANKS"" wish to come true than just say ""I wish blanks wish came true"" done. Instead you get the piece of crap wish and ending they give you. Should have known though. From the start it was basically like an anime made straight out of george r.r. martins notes. Lets introduce you to ned stark, you\'ll find this character super interesting. Ha jk we are just gonna kill him instantly and everyone else you start to enjoy in this show. Shit hopefully game of thrones actually has an ending that closes it well.So pretty much just watch episodes 1-11. DO NOT watch 12. Just use your imagination on what you think they wish for because honestly, absolutely anything would have been better. wanted someone else\'s wish to come true but that they never figured it out....

It starts out very strong, but then the battle royale scenario gets drowned out by long back stories and a lackluster plot. . The back stories were the heart of this show and really took away from anything else Juuni Taisen could have brought to the table.  Nothing else about the show really stood out or kept me entertained past episode 1. As a battle royale in general it was bad. None of the characters really utilized much of a plan or the environment. They all seemed to leave the starting spot and go about...100 feet in the same general direction before squaring off.  The outcome of the whole show, and each episodes battles were very predictable. I picked my winner in episode 1 and got it right on the money.  I guess when 4-5 of the 6 hours are used for back stories, you don’t have time to do much with the actual battle or present day plot.  Oh well...After one episode I was all in. The art was decent, the music was exciting, and there were unique and exciting camera angles that really caught my eye. The story seemed like it was going to have a good pace, and the characters seemed unique and mysterious. After the first episode I could not wait to continue the series.  The remaining episodes in my opinion both hit the brakes hard, and took the show in a direction that just didn’t interest me. The music stayed at a high quality, but there were points that the animation seemed to take a big drop in quality.  The camera angle and slow motion scene from the first episode was never topped or equaled by any other scene in the show.  The characters were extremely forgettable, and I really didn’t feel invested in the contest at all. I just wanted it to end....This is my little blurb after reading the top review for this show.  I think it is only natural to compare shows that are in the same generic bubble, such as Juuni Taisen and Fate. Comparisons like this are only natural, just like comparing French fries from 2 fast food restaurants. Can you like both? Yes. Can you hate one and like the other?  Sure! Is the statement, “this is much worse than Fate” valid? 100%. I would hope that statement would be backed up with some solid logic, but I think that comparing 2 like shows is totally ok, especially as you probably get a lot of fans of something like fate checking out reviews to see if this is worth a watch.I guess that wasn’t too short Sorry! 100 feet in the same general direction before squaring off.

This is a very well made but mediocre piece. Its easy to get hooked into, relate to a lot of the characters, get invested in them and... Ultimately feel IMMENSELY disappointed.The art is pretty good. The censorship is light, which i always appreciate even if i'm not a fan of gore. The music is decent... But the story. There IS NO STORY. Its a battle royale between people with different powers, backgrounds and lives, who all come out of some kind of clans and HAVE to participate, with the promise that one wish will be granted...to the winner.So, while there is no story, the characters are pretty much all rather well made, and that's where the tragedy is - you understand most if not all are destined to die, and yet you still hope for some kind of resolution, satisfying conclusion, or maybe the most likable one to live or think of a way to sort this out? Nope. Instead it ends with probably the least likable and least interesting of the bunch doing the least meaningful and interesting choice that essentially looked like the person writing this story got tired/frustrated of writing it and just wanted to end it, transferring his frustration and inability to make a meaningful conclusion onto said last character... He asks to forget all of this ever happened.So all in all is it worth watching? Yes, but barely. Until about the mid point its even very enjoyable, then the drama really amps up though so its harder to watch... But still worth it. The ending though, as in the final episode, and maybe the second part of episode 11 is... Well, honestly dreadful, i'd definitely take the gamble to speculate that its most of the reason this show lost a lot of points from its score - the ending is pretty much the least satisfying and anticlimactic, not to mention the most lazy you can get outside of simply leaving an open end or unfinished end like a lot of anime (especially the short ones) do. to the winner.So, while there is no story, the characters are pretty much all rather well made, and that's where the tragedy is - you understand most if not all are destined to die, and yet you still hope for some kind of resolution, satisfying conclusion, or maybe the most likable one to live or think of a way to sort this out?

Many people dropped it or were annoyed with the progression of the battle royal which, yes, is predictable. However, I always thought that was intentional and really not the point of the show especially after seeing the first episode. It matters more who is fighting than who the winner is.StoryStory is heavily linked with character because most of the story is about who the participants in the royal are. Thus most of the story is told through flashbacks which can break tension...because it is the past. By and large the flashbacks are well timed and don't break the flow, and you can learn a lot about the warriors.CharactersThe characters are all solid. The story kinda lives and dies with the strength of the characters because it spends so much time in their pasts. They can be a lot when you initially meet them but once you get to learn more about them it tends to make more sense. They're all very distinctive because of that and their designs.SoundSolid music and sound design. The use of the music to build and create tension is great. I especially enjoy the visual meaning(s) of the op and ed. The music's lyrics also seem to be a good match. Really the op is a great entrance into the episode, feels like a song to prepare for battle. The sound design is on point. The The VAs for both dub and sub, I can jump between the two and there isn't any whiplash. *I don't usually have much of an opinion on VAs.General feelThe show has an odd feel. Best way I can describe it is determined but melancholy. The show's energy somewhat reflects that. It does have a decent amount of dialogue so the energy level can feel like it's bottoming out between action scenes.Positives:- Music (op and ed are solid and work well in the show)- Art and CG are solid- Solid characters especially the backstories- Twist on the battle royal genreNegatives:- Not a typical battle royal- Occasionally hard to visually follow (too much action or too fast)- Battles can have varying satisfaction because it is the past.

This is the totally the anime for you."", ""The worst anime I have seen this season. (There may be some  spoilers in here.)-Story-An action fantasy battle royal, with the action being small and or nonexistent with the fantasy being wasted or introduced through interesting abilities. The idea was for twelve combatants, one bearing the title of a specific zodiac, to fight to the death so they could be giving a wish at the end. It basically ended up being a poor man's Fate series.-Art-Was fine to star and I gave some leeway as many 12 season series don't always have the best art. Though maybe I can be too giving in this...area.-Sound-The OST was actually pretty good itself, by itself I mean. The music didn't fit in so many scenes, either too emotional for what was happening or just wasn't proper. Like I said the music itself was good but was just implemented poorly. Very poorly.-Characters-Uninteresting. They were just one directional, too easily changed or just nonexistent in most cases. Which was weird seeing as the show was basically a full episode about each character. I watched everything feeling so detached and bored. Not to mention the ability overload of some characters.Some of them had skills that were just obscenely strong if really actually use and ended up just being wasted. I'm specifically referring to the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th deaths and even though you know who was going to die it didn't justify how or they died.Real quick, an issue most people have is that the deaths are in reverse zodiac order. While I personally have no issues with the order system the deaths could have been implemented better, the characters are given more interesting background or moments and could have been less predictable. Just because you know someone will die doesn't mean how they die doesn't matter.There plenty more I could say about this but I'll pass it for now.-Enjoyment-I enjoyed this show only because I watched it with a friend and we'd rant and make fun of the show. It's a show I enjoyed making fun of more than I generally actually enjoyed.-Overall-It felt poorly done, lackluster, thrown together on a whim and all in all disappointing. I would be willing to give the show another try if it was remade to be long and more fleshed out because I don't mind the idea of the battle royal, character abilities, backstories, where and how the fight takes place and so on. It's just the way it was done was poor at best and left MUCH to be desired.Would not recommend to any who want a serious show, but would offer it as a good show to watch for joke value. area.-Sound-The OST was actually pretty good itself, by itself I mean.

ANIMATION: It start not that bad but...from the chapter 4-5 must I say the animation became just... inadmissible. It just hurt by watching.

The original light novel was written by Nisio Isin who created Monogatari which we all probably know and which I really enjoyed watching 2.The synopsis was just like Fate/Stay Night but with more competitors and no masters and Fate is another of my favorite anime 3. I usually enjoy these battle royal anime and I was expecting some twists from this because Isin is known for creativity....Ya needless to say this show did not live up to the hype or my expectations.Story 5/10:So what I wanted to see was an all out battle between any number of the competitors because that`s what a battle royal should be about, the battles. Instead the show is created so that around 80% of the time the characters are monologuing about something or you are watching a flashback. Now I admit some of the flashbacks were interesting like Ox and Tigers. However the majority of them are pretty forgettable. Also it is kind of pointless since usually the character in the flashback would meet their demise after it ends. Even when the characters were fighting it would usually end quickly and most of the fights never gave me that epic feeling that I wanted to experience from this show. The flashbacks also ruin the plot twists I wanted to see. Except for the first episode where you did not expect the person in the flashback to get killed after it was over it became painfully obvious after the first one on what you should expect.Art 5/10:Can`t really say much about the animation it does not leave much of an impression. It was not that good and not terrible either. It suited the flashbacks well but to me did not really feel like the best animation for fight scenes.Sound 4/10:The music in this anime never stood out to me. During the many flashbacks I understand having loud and action themed music would not work when the characters were not fighting. It might have helped to have decent music playing during those scenes though to make them less boring but instead it was usually either quiet or ambient. Even during the fight scenes the music played just felt like your generic tracks that could be found in any battle anime. The opening sounded really whiny and the visuals in it were just shots of the characters doing cool poses so it does not add much. I have some things to say about the ending though. The ending music actually sounds really good and livens up the show. I feel that if it was played during the opening it might have been better. The main thing about the ending is that it basically spoils the show. If you payed literally any attention to it you see that the order shown in it is the order the characters are killed so ya the show pretty much spoils the winner for you on its own.Characters 6/10:The characters were average. Some were just forgettable because they never really did anything of note and the only thing you knew about them was what you saw in their respective flashback. The only characters that stood out to me were Rat, Ox , Tiger, Monkey and Rabbit. In the start of the show when you see Rabbit it leaves an impression on you. You think this guy would just be some kind of insane killer and you`d be right but really he just wanted some friends and his power lets him have friends, in a way. He was a cool character with his playboy outfit and dual machetes and when I first saw him I did not think he would get as far in the contest as he did and be as strong as he was. Monkey was one of those typical characters you would always see in battle royal anime who doesn`t want to fight and wants peace for the world as a whole. I would have liked to have seen more of her and see what her plan may have been to accomplish that goal but you can probably tell what happens to her. Ox was another decent character. His fight scenes were probably the best part of the show but there weren`t that many of them. He was the character that always fights fair and does not hold back on anybody. Tiger was the character I did not expect much of. Most of the show she was not present but when she does show up you see her as some kind of drunken martial arts master. The thing I liked about her was why she became and drunk and her connection with Ox. Their joint flashback was pretty touching and you feel bittersweet when she dies. Rat was the enigma of the show. You don`t see his power until the very end and it is a creative one but Rat himself did not live up to his buildup. Especially the last episode makes you feel like in the end the whole show was a waste of time you could have spent watching something better.Enjoyment 4/10:This just was not the show for me. If you can find enjoyment from watching a lot of flashbacks be my guest but it didn`t do it for me. If the flashbacks were so long the fight scenes should have at least been an epic climax but that was not the case. I guess it was more realistic than having long drawn out fight scenes but still that would have been more entertaining.Overall 5/10:As I have explained the show wasn`t what I expected it to be. It was predictable most of the time expect for the first episode. The fights and music were mediocre at the best of times and the conclusion was not worth watching the other 11 episodes. If you want a good battle royal anime this isn`t for you. Unless you are a really dedicated Nisio Isin fan you`re better off not watching this and watching some other battle royal anime instead. If you like flashbacks than this is the anime for you.

I remember watching the trailer earlier this year and never went back to watch it. This anime was definitely different. It wasn't horrid like everyone said. I def liked it. If anyone is wondering my Chinese Zodiac it's the rabbit & I'm sad I didn't get one that matched a character I liked 😂 My favorite characters ended up being the Boar, Ox, Tiger, Rat, Horse & Monkey. Everyone was upset they revealed who died in each episode but I liked how the show was together. So far it's been...different from other anime's I've seen. I don't recommend for certain people if you have issues with fan service (the Rabbit is a man who is RIPPED, wears cut-off shorts & heels. Like nothing wrong with it just some are not ok with fanservice) and the gore aspect. THIS IS NOT WHY I DIDN'T LIKE THE RABBIT! Watch the show & you'll understand. I actually did like his power. different from other anime's I've seen.

I actually did like his power."", 'Story 6/10I\'m usually drawn towards series with premises that I haven\'t heard of before and I\'ve been looking for a new battle royale anime to watch. In this aspect it partially succeeded - it was a battle royale but it doesn\'t really seem to focus too much on that. Any given episode mostly focuses on interpersonal problems within the characters, which is interesting but I would prefer some more info on the battle itself considering the audience is just told ""we hold a battle royale every year for some reason"" and not much else is mentioned about it. This results in a confusing story that...focuses too much on sob-stories instead of getting to the details the audience really wants to know.Art 2/10Noticeable drops in animation quality. VERY noticeable. The line thickness changes on a frame by frame basis, proportions are completely out the window, sometimes they use CGI (which seems to be the best quality so far) and other times characters just don\'t move during very important scenes. The backgrounds have been fine but the characters themselves are stiff, not proportioned right and honestly funny looking. I\'ve seen 3 minute animations done by amateur students that are better than the entire ""professional"" studio working on a half hour show. Overall, very inconsistent.Sound 5/10The opening is really good, probably the best part about the series. It\'s FILLED with spoilers but only to those who can read symbolism very well. The voice acting is less than great but I imagine some of the sound effects would make more sense if the animation would catch up a bit. For example, if I character growls or scoffs at someone, the face doesn\'t move with them making that noise, so it seems very odd sounding/looking. I think most of the sound problems can be blamed on the animation because there are many examples like that where you watch it, hear it and think ""why...did they make that noise? that sounded so weird..."" but in reality, they\'re probably just reading the script they\'re given and they can\'t really do much about it.Character 4/10Some of the writing for the characters is really reaching for the audience to pity them. Some backstories went on for over two episodes and at some point I was like ""who cares anymore!? Just move on!"". Its unreasonable for the producers to write 12 sob-story character backgrounds and expect all of them to land. Each character should be different and in a weird way they\'re all the same. ""I was sad as a child, I started training to be part of the juuni taisen, I started doing bad things, I\'m sad (or happy) that I did so many bad things"" and then they die. The design of the characters is also pretty rough. Monkey, Tiger and Rabbit in particular have outfits that don\'t make a lot of sense. Monkey has like 3 coats on, thigh high socks and combat boots and no pants, Tiger just has a bikini and a leather jacket, and Rabbit is supposed to be like...playboy bunny I guess?? All of the girls outfits are pretty skimpy except for Boar and everyone else is dressed pretty randomly, though not necessarily badly. It\'s just easy to get visually distracted when watching any given episode because of the colour clashing, seasonal wear differences, and outfits that just don\'t make sense for an anime about survival. If they\'re supposed to be fighting for their lives, maybe a bikini isn\'t the best protective gear? all in all, costume design and writing needed to be refined quite a bit.Enjoyment 5/10My enjoyment would be higher if not for how long the series can drag something out for. The series honestly wastes so much time on ONE thing that it frustrates the audience into thinking about how much they could\'ve covered if they would\'ve just let the sob-story die about 10 minutes in instead of using it for the full 30 minutes. For example, one episode was dedicated entirely to Sheep thinking of a plan on how to survive, except his plans involved characters that had already died and didn\'t really make sense. He repeats himself several times in the episode and at the very end decides to generally scrap the plan and move on to something else. Lots of wasted time that I didn\'t enjoy on things that could\'ve been enjoyable.Overall 5/10Poor animation, poor design and poor writing. At this point I\'m watching the series to find out how it ends. The concept is good and the opening is good but its hard to think of a character I like or anything in particular that stood out as ""good"". Its not particularly extraordinary but if it were maybe rebooted in the future with better animation I may be a little more generous. focuses too much on sob-stories instead of getting to the details the audience really wants to know.Art 2/10Noticeable drops in animation quality.

The Boars death caught me off guard, but that was the highest point of the series. The next few episodes were ok as we learn more about the juuni taisen. The last few episodes were repetitive and Nezumi's final wish made little sense. In fact, I think the majority of the plot made little sense. How can so many professional mercenaries let their guard down every single time?? even with Nezumi's ability I find that the mercenaries should not be making those mistakes...The art and music were pretty...good, but that is all the anime had going for. good, but that is all the anime had going for."", ""I think people expect too much from animes like this one.

And Junni Taisen is applying this formula in the world of japanimation at the end of this year. But the ""war of the zodiac"", which is the starting point for anime, is actually quite secondary. It is a work about the impact of war on those who practice it, which puts action aside and prefers to propose strategy and flashbacks in quantity.Juuni Taisen is the War of the Zodiac. A confrontation between twelve warriors, each representing an animal from the Chinese zodiac, who must kill each other until there is only...one left who will be able to grant the wish of his choice. Twelve elite soldiers who will betray, manipulate, confront and die in a city made completely deserted for the occasion. Zodiac War is good because it\'s not all action as one might expect. Fighting is often expeditious, and most of the deaths do not occur in the context of direct confrontation. Each character gets a flashback of how they got there, and they are interesting because they show different aspects of the war. It\'s even a bit odd that in each episode there are 5-6 minutes of the Zodiac War and a quarter of an hour of flashback. The characters, we get to know them by digging into their past. It\'s really interesting, without really being transcendent or upsetting.Visually, Juuni Taisen offers a nice gift: CGI that is well used and looks good. Far from the Ajin and Berserk disasters, outstanding examples of a disgusting CGI. Afterwards, it\'s nice, but on several episodes, it\'s not very qualitative. The flashback episode of the twins is, on several occasions, a lover of wobbly shots, of rough-finished chara-design and a very slow general animation.Zodiac War is an interesting anime, which makes the royal battle quite original and tells things while avoiding the pitfalls of pure action.

Juuni taisen is a battle royal survival action anime similar to mirrai nikki , where each participant is based on a sign from the chinese zoodiac , each one of them has a weird sometimes debatable design , but i term of personality there were quite weak , i liked only 3 or 4 of them . What makes this show is it umpredictability and hyped fights which in the...majority of cases were quite disapointing for me . As for the production some scenes were oustanding in term of animation and direction , others were below average , cg was used in some fight , but it wasnt atrocious .

The bunny that they seemed to blow most of their budget on has no back story at all, so why should I care. Show kills off characters quickly because they had no idea how to use their time given for each episode wisely, i.e. Tiger sacrificing herself for Ox after a 2min flash back of how they met which wasn't anything memorable, they just needed to hurry up and kill people off.  I knew Rat was gonna win, but they show his power the last episode which is...way OP and just ties into the Zodiac story Rat wins the race. Don't watch it unless you like to suffer. way OP and just ties into the Zodiac story Rat wins the race. Don't watch it unless you like to suffer."", 'Its predictable to a fault. But I didn\'t care, I felt it still delivered story beats well enough to make you care for the characters even if you knew they were going to die.In the 10th episode its very apparent that they ran out of budget as the cg is everywhere, and that was annoying but I accepted it. I get that cg can be used to animate energetic fights for cheaper than 2d which I\'m fine with. It confuses me when its used for characters just standing still, its not really a bad thing its just confusing.The final 3/4 episodes are VERY dialogue...heavy, I was ok with it as I loved Tiger and Ox\'s chemistry. I can handle dialogue heavy shows, and its a light novel adaptation, of course there\'s going to be a lot of talking.The ending. I can barely contain myself in how much I loathe this ending. I want to swear so badly but I don\'t know MAL\'s rules on profanity. But this ending. It enrages me. I cannot express how much I hate Rat and his archetype in coherent language. I hate the non-motivated, misanthropic, angsty, bored, non-committal, undriven slog of a ""person"" he is. I hate it so much, he\'s a teenager alright, he\'s the superiority complex, fedora wearing, atheist type. It drags every score down significantly, aside from sound obviously.I wanted so badly to give this 4 or 5 stars, I would\'ve if it ended with everyone dying and it ending halfway through episode 11. If Old Timer killed Rat too it could\'ve really driven in the futility of war and that war has no victors. Thinking about it now that could\'ve been such a stronger ending and the way it did end angers me even more. It was so close, yet so far. heavy, I was ok with it as I loved Tiger and Ox\'s chemistry.

This high-schooler with the chance to make 1 or even 100 wishes with which he could do literally anything on top of the fact that he has a pretty decent ability, wishes for.... lets play the guessing game. Was it perhaps to get 100 more of the wishes that could grant anything? Nah....That wouldn\'t satisfy a human. 100 wishes pfft. So maybe it was to find love? Nah then it would feel fake. Oh I know it was to have the same power as the guy who could grant said wishes? Nah too big brain for that move. Ok ok then it must be to stop the Juuni Taisen from ever happening again or bringing back any of the decent characters? Nope nope nope!!!! That wouldn\'t be fair! Does a person have the right to be brought back just because they are good people? Perhaps not. (Dragon Balls eat your heart out) . Wow this kid must be a philosopher. Sp what does Mr. Wise do with this wish then? Oh lord almighty. He wishes simply to forget. Doesn\'t even say what he wants to forget either tbh. Just starts crying like a little bitch in front of God (I guess) and asks to forget... something. The fact that he has a wish to make? The Juuni Taisen? Well for me it would be to forget this shit anime. Then the girls comment at the end hammered it in even harder. ""He looks like he doesn\'t have a care in the world"". Blow me. This ending was just as bad as prison school\'s manga ending. Ugh. What utter garbage. Please avoid if you have brain cells left. I do not.

This anime was like an amateur chef trying to work out a dish by adding everything available to him in the supermarket. This could have been something good but why it was hurried without any plot development or any character development. I just don't know. Maybe it's my perspective but a story needs time and a flow.

The story itself is good with many main characters that you get lost with, each one of them dying in each episode, a lot of bloody scenes with organs, and fantastic fight scenes, the story is overall good along with a good matching soundtrack. At first, you think that the blond female is the main character of the story until she dies in the second episode, I like the rabbit a lot which is something even I didn't expect, all the other characters are good except the chicken which Irritates me. The...ending is something you don't expect at all, with the rat winning magically using the sheep's bomb and with the ox's sacrifice, the rat getting lost in his thoughts with his ability and thinking about what wish should he ask for was a good thing to watch.

Poor execution. Weak justification/clue of plot twist and the supporting scenes for the stand. The story stand was only introduced weak in the middle and just show near the end. Read all to know why did I give score of 9 though.I\'ve been through this kind of writing and feels like we are similar in taste bud. And bad things I\'ve done the this anime done too is, thinking background story alone makes the right time to kill a character (because I love tragedy like Akame Ga Kill that you will cry for the character haha)....Gosh. I\'ve done that but revised my story before I realized in this anime that, background story is still nothing if you don\'t introduce the character well and it\'s so lame if you just cut it in the story that quickly after you put the background. And some of the back stories are not intresting though, just like the boar then the anime killed him quickly haha.There\'s also tooo many monologues. Since it was adapted from novel, it should be ADAPTED as anime too. Too much monologues in anime when IT\'S THE VISUAL JOB to represent the scene and emotion. So you shouldn\'t do the same approach the novel did if it was adapted to visuals.And there\'s still so much to say about the negatives.HENCE, THE REASON I STILL GAVE SCORE OF 9 is:THE STAND/PHILOSOPHY OF THE STORY IN THE ENDING. It justified what happened though, but not in the eyes of me as a writer, but just as a reader. It satisfied me though and I can relate the irony of the philosophy ""The more you wish for satisfactory, the more you won\'t be contented.

People die when they are killed, greed overpowers all, fighting never gets us anywhere, yada yada yada.  At some point in our lives, we\'ve all heard a spiel kinda like this, and repeated doses of the phrase demotes the saying to an irritating platitude that means absolutely nothing.  So, if you want to decide the fate of the world, what do you do?  Pit 12 people against each other of course.  What other way would there be?Story:Every 12 years, twelve warriors are gathered together in order to participate in the Juuni Taisen, a battle royale...in which the twelve warriors, each representing one of the animals in the chinese zodiac, fight to the death in order to get one selfish wish granted and determine the fate of the world.  On the eve of the twelve Juuni Taisen, the 12 warriors gather up, and the event to see which animal will come out on top commences.On the surface, Juuni Taisen appears to be a nonsensical gorefest as the twelve warriors duke it out in an abandoned city, each equipped with their own method of killing representative of their respective animal.  Its main problem as a series stems from how little the show is willing to stay as a simple concept.  With each episode, we\'re introduced to one of the twelve warriors\' backgrounds, introduced to a world plagued with war that eventually molds them into the person (or animal...) that they become by the start of the Juuni Taisen.  This in and of itself poses a problem for the viewer because once you figure out the pattern, the experience becomes all the more lackluster cause the place order and by extension the winner is easy to figure out.The result of this eventually muddies the content of the show greatly, spending an abhorrent amount of time on so much backstory and world building information on each of the twelve warriors that what you end up getting is less battle and more ""listen to my edgy and sad backstory"".  This ultimately breaks the flow of the show as in the middle of a battle, we\'re forced to listen to up to an episode\'s worth of information before we\'re thrust back into the action as if we\'re supposed to care for the respective warrior whose backstory we just finished watching.Eventually, this problem comes full circle when the show gets so stuck up and drunk off of the philosophies of its various zodiac members that it becomes confusing what the hell they\'re even talking about.  Everything from \'righteousness\' to \'right and wrong\', all the way to \'what is my selfish desire\' intoxicates the show\'s runtime to the point that the show\'s battle royale feels like almost a secondary thought.  While admittedly it is kind of refreshing to see a show spend so much time focused on character development of its main cast, the way they went about was so instrumental to the show ultimate downfall that I acts more as a detriment to what is otherwise a horse-betting competition.The ending also gives the experience a very bittersweet flavor, but not a nice kind.  Frankly speaking, it\'s pretty much a culmination of everything the show is or tries to be, all wrapped up in a pretentious bow cause it feels like the show feels smug about what it\'s done with just how much information is jam packed in the episode and how it ended.  Newsflash, it ain\'t a good end.  An understandable conclusion, but given all the information we were given about the world and the people living in it, I\'d expect something a little more than \'Ignorance is Bliss\'.  Which I guess you could say is poetic in a way, but I\'m not willing to give the show any slack for how piss poor this show was structured.Overview:+ Fun?  (I mean...it was kinda fun to watch.)-  Breaks from the action way too often-  Many unanswered questions-  Can be predictable once you figure the show out-  Too much philosophy and attempt to be edgy/thought-provokingCharacters:No one else matters except for the Juuni Taisen.  If anything, the supplementary characters are part of the \'world building\' and \'character development\' attempts that the show made.The warriors are unique style-wise, I\'ll give the show that much credit.  Aside from that, they all, every one of them, leaves something to be desired (except I guess Tiger).  Case in point, they all want something.  Coming from prestigious warrior families or are renowned warriors themselves, the twelve participants enter the ring each with a story to tell: How they rose in power, the way they live their lives, the philosophies they embody, etc.  My main issue stems from how the backstory is relatively simple, but each progressive character we\'re shown breeds more and more complexity with their stories, to the point that philosophy IS their story.  It\'s the kind of gradual spoonfeeding that doesn\'t sit right with me because in a sense, that shows favoritism, and in a battle royale, immediate narrative favoritism reveals who\'s staying till the end.Another aspect of the warriors is their powers.  For some reason, they all have some kind of special ability that makes each of the warriors superhuman to an extent which makes absolutely no sense to me because a) How and why do they get these powers?  and b) Does everyone in the world have these powers?  Or is it just specific to \'warriors\'?  My theory is that this is just the show\'s excuse to have more edge and battle potential which, while true, poses those questions that loom over the show\'s entire runtime cause still confused as to how a human being is physically capable of producing a multitude of poisons in his own body or create zombies by killing them.  Seriously, they don\'t explain this at all and it frustrates me to no end.Overview:+ Interesting cast-  Powers make no goddamn sense-  Again, drowned in philosophy (and pattern makes things kinda easy to figure out.)Art:Produced by Graphinica, a small studio with almost nothing major under their belt (they helped animate Hellsing Ultimate, so I guess that\'s part of their resume), Juuni Taisen\'s quality wavers greatly.On one hand, the art isn\'t terrible.  Sure most of its is stills due to the amount of downtime the show seems to have with how often the warrior are willing to sit down and have a chat for some reason, but there aren\'t many real issues popping up during these moments.  That being said, it\'s not fantastic either.  Action scenes are kind of choppy as expected of a low budget show, but the real kicker is how the ending fights seem to crank up in intensity and end up relying on CGI in order to showcase these battles.  It\'s a noticeable change that I\'m just vaguely annoyed about after seeing it for the first time.Overview:+/-  It\'s decent, but not great.Sound:""Rupture"" by Panorama Panama Town poses a peculiar standard for the show\'s soundtrack.  Honestly, I thought that the show would have a more high-energy and intense rock track rather than the smoother and less energetic rock that we got.  Like seriously, I thought we were gonna get some super hype battle music or something, but instead we get...this.  Don\'t get me wrong, it ain\'t bad, just not what I expected.  Which I suppose is an upside really all things considering.  I will say that hearing the artist roll their \'r\'s\' like they are is...weird.  Excessive if you ask me.Likewise, the show\'s ED, ""Kenshin no Kemono"", is an equally smooth rock track that I didn\'t expect from a show as battle-filled as this.  Personally, this one is less memorable to its OP counterpart, but it is by no means a bad song.  Honestly, I\'d say that the sound is the best part of the show, and whenever that happens, I\'m always scared.  I also want to bring special attention to the fact that they managed to get Hayami Saori and Sakura Ayane, some pretty well-known seiyuu to voice in this rather underground show.  Iunno, that\'s just a detail that vaguely amuses me.Overview:+/-  Good, but average soundtrackPersonal Enjoyment:I really just took a swing at Juuni Taisen to see what I would end up getting by watching this show.  To my surprise, the series actually showed some promise at the start.  Sure I haven\'t seen many battle royales, but I was at least intrigued to see where it was going.  Turns out, it went badly.  Oh so badly.  The story suffers from being overtly complex, the characters suffer the same way, the art quality wavers greatly, and the sound is more or less average.  Are there any upsides to this show?  Critically speaking...no.  But by not thinking about things too hard like I\'ve done with certain aspects of the show, your mileage will probably increase with this show.  But probably not that much considering the show tries so hard to impress you that you end up hating yourself for falling into the show\'s trap and think along its lines.Did I like this show?Kind of?

I am sorry, but that character is just downright unsettling, and not in the good way.  It\'s like they sat down and said ""Alright, we need an OP character who\'s batshit crazy"", threw all of the board\'s ideas in a hat, then just used everything in the hat anyway to create this monstrosity.

The dialogue is neither funny nor interesting, except for a single dialogue between the ox and the tiger.I finished the show only because I was interested to see the way everyone fights (which we mostly don't) and to see to who ends up winning.The winner makes a wish...that ends up making the entire plot kind of irrelevant.The music is nothing special, in fact I can't remember a single piece after JUST having finished the show.The animation starts of good enough, but the quality really dips in the last few episodes.I did enjoy the character designs.I don't think this show is trash by any means, but it's something I'll never rewatch and I'll probably forget that this even exists.About a 5-6/10 - unremarkable. that ends up making the entire plot kind of irrelevant.The music is nothing special, in fact I can't remember a single piece after JUST having finished the show.The animation starts of good enough, but the quality really dips in the last few episodes.I did enjoy the character designs.I don't think this show is trash by any means, but it's something I'll never rewatch and I'll probably forget that this even exists.About a 5-6/10 - unremarkable."", ""A nice, strong start to a battle royale involving participants that represent an animal in the chinese zodiac. Everyone having their own weapon of choice plus some cool powers sprinkled in. Good visuals also, but that is all I can say. Because the series falls off once you notice a pattern.In nearly all the epsiodes we get a long backstory of a character and then they die. Episode 1, 2, 3, 4, ect. They show backstory, they're gonna die. Fight scenes are hardly worth even watching. I only remember the last fight involving Bunny because of the weird zombie power he has. In addition to...these two massive weak points, the ending is garbage. You would expect a battle royale based anime have a focus on fights and extended action. The things it is suppose to deliver completely failed. Waste of time for fights, super predictable episode set-up, and awful ending. these two massive weak points, the ending is garbage.

And the culmination of which is to have no main character, but instead having twelve differently developed characters with a different amount of focus.Basically the anime resolves around a twelve-person battle royale with the winner having granted a wish with no limitations. Furthermore the whole ordeal is being treated as a proxy for wars all around the world. At the core of the fight are the twelve warriors from specific clans representing a part from the Chinese zodiac each.The true problem of the series starts right with the first episode as the viewer is introduced...to the ruleset of the battle royale and the first character with a full backstory to boot. Everything is instantly undercut by the fact that the supposed main character is killed off in the first episode, leaving a hard bitter aftertaste of wasted time in the air. As the second episode has a similar structure a stark pattern emerges. Whoever receives their backstory will die next. While this pattern is broken sometimes, it still holds true for most of the runtime. A few characters, who even last until the end, receive no back story at all, and they would qualify as main characters the most.This structure within the anime has a hefty price attached: there is barely any story, only background lore. For a battle royale with super powers, this anime has almost no combats or choreographies. Except a handful of fights, all skirmishes are resolved in a single hit. This has the consequence that the characters, whose backstory we just got, get no proper send off. Regardless of how interesting the backstory or the character itself was, it just creates an unsatisfying feeling within a viewer. This is especially prominent when the viewer realizes the pattern at hand. Further backstories are mostly thrown away as the anticipation of that characters demise already looms heavily in the air.Something that is also striking for this anime is the, ironically, underutilization of most of its characters. As mentioned earlier, all characters have a very narrow set of super powers. There are some basic things like short-range teleportation, iron skin or super reflexes or more specialized abilities like tremor-sense, bird command or transmutation. Most of these abilities are barely used, only off screen or in a flashback. And while the main ""villain"" can utilize those abilities in his own way, the characters themselves only scratch their potential. The excessive use of the background stories doesn\'t help that either.Juuni Taisen is a weird anime that doesn\'t really know what it wants to do. It mainly uses its time to familiarize us with its cast, only to rip those away moments later.

Massugu ni Ikou. 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3182/Massugu_ni_Ikou_2nd_Season,"[""Massagu ni Ikou is a heart warming 5 episode anime about the life of a dog in Japan. Mametaro is a crossbreed dog living with her master his whole life. The show is pretty much a slice of life anime and for what it's worth its a pretty fun anime.Story (Good) --- Character (Good)For anyone who has owned a dog or love dogs they will love this show. All 5 episodes have pretty common instances about life as a dog. Pure breeding, cross breeding, dog lifestyles, etc. Being a dog owner I easily related to most of the stuff they were talking about. Plus...Mametaro looked kind of like my golden retriever. Of course this anime is geared to children so each episode has a &quot;moral&quot; for every episode. Although its common knowledge to most, it's good information if you're planning on getting a dog. My only grip is the drama is a bit much.Art (Fair) --- Sound (Fair)The artwork is pretty standard fare. But you can tell most of the money was spent on the dog art and animation. The humans all look like bishonen rejects man and woman alike. But the dogs are detailed right down the little 'x' on their butt holes (they could have done without that honestly) but you can see all theri pads and nails on their feet, the collars have their buckles and tags and such. Their comedy faces are also hilarious as well. The music is pretty good. The op song starts off pretty happy and upbeat to set you in the mood to watch. The seiyus are all play their part great, especially the dogs. And the background music is usually a light hearted song.Overall this is required viewing for all dog viewers alike.

Monster Musume no Oishasan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40708/Monster_Musume_no_Oishasan,"['Your immediate impression may be that this is a shameless rip off of Monster Musume (2017). I wouldn’t blame you for thinking so - there’s a blonde busty centaur, bombshell Lamia, femme fatale spider girl, adorable cyclops and a lucky/unlucky teenage boy at the center of their attention. But there are several  differences that set Monster Doctor apart from predecessors and make it stand on its own as an entry to the monster girl genre.For one, Monster Doctor is explicitly about...you guessed it...a traveling doctor who specializes in monster health conditions. The episodes are dedicated to a medical case concerning a unique species...that he cures through inventive means. There is almost always a specific goal that an episode will work towards, in contrast to OG Monster Musume that spiraled into random directions because the predominant focus was fanservice.Another difference, and probably the most significant, is that Monster Doctor is bereft of nudity and does not compare to the degeneracy levels of its ancestor. You are more inclined to be invested in the health dilemmas of the monster girls - such as a centaur who is struggling to compete in arena exhibitions b/c of a hoof injury or a land mermaid who has respiratory issues related to her lack of water intake, than you are their “assets”.  In examining his patients, Dr. Glenn does do so thoroughly (this is where the fanservice comes in), but these scenes are very brief in comparison to the rest of the episodes content and aren\'t so out of line for what a doctor would have to do in order to diagnose his patient.I enjoy slice of life/romance narratives with a lead who is a professional in an industry. Dr. Glenn is a teenage prodigy who goes out of his way to diagnose and cure the ailments of monster girls who are otherwise neglected by their environment. His intentions are genuine and his knowledge is undeniable. You know precisely why the girls fall in love with him - less obvious in other romance anime where the reason is just “you’re such a nice guy”.  Dr. Glenn is nice. And rich. And brilliant. His wife would be hitting the jackpot and all of his admirers know that. To me at least, he\'s the best part of this show and what makes everything work. Even if his personality is rather dry.Monster Doctor isn\'t the best ""waifu ensemble"" harem. Which is to say, a harem that features a lineup of diverse best girls whom the audience will gravitate towards for any number of lewd reasons. The girls in this show are cute, but they aren\'t made the object of fanservice enough to be rule 34\'d into oblivion and used as fetish fuel. You more so enjoy the girls in this show because they are extremely likable people and there\'s some catharsis in seeing likable people have their lives improved for the better when a nagging injury, illness is cured. I, for one, love the mermaid character Lulala and was so happy to see her specific crisis be resolved. The smile on her face was priceless.Of course, this isn’t a perfect anime by any means and there are issues of varying degrees of importance. The animation is not particularly good, very little movement in general. Tons of static/panning shots that admire the character designs and environments. There isn’t much character depth beyond what you see in the introduction - they are more so types than individuals, though very endearing types they are. If any of these were improved upon it would take Monster Doctor from solid to very good-great.  But as is the charm of this show getting to know so many different cute monster girl species and their predicaments. Following a MC who is NOT a buffoon that genuinely cares for their well being and gradually earns their trust.It doesn’t surprise me that MAL has received this anime so poorly - there is fanservice (a no no for large sections of holier than thou MAL community), the concept appears merely regurgitated in a lesser form, and for the super lewd degenerate crowd it doesn’t push the envelope for enough to watch this with your pants off. But, for the audience that can see through these surface level criticisms you have a worthwhile monster girl anime that proves itself to be more than derivative of past successes. that he cures through inventive means.

Or like it. As if some walked into this show and expecting the same kind of deal, and to not see that, they might be disappointed as a result. But honestly, I can say that this show is quite enjoyable. You should honestly watch it, and here is why!The story is pretty simple to understand. We have a human doctor that treats monster girls. Pretty easy to get, which in itself is quite a good concept. With it's characters too, and how they react...to one another, and their designs are all top notch. Very likeable characters for their personalities, looks, and how they push the plot along. Considering I've liked all the characters they've put forward already for who they are, and how they act, you know it's a good going show.Much like I mentioned with how the characters look, the art is very nice. It really fits into the themes, depending the point of the show. If it's morning, it's bright and pretty. When it's dark, it's fittingly solid in terms of how night should look like. Very well done there. The sound is what you would expect out of a Musume show, with how characters react, but they also do well within the moment with their sound. The OP is pretty good also.I'd honestly say give it a shot. It's a nice show so far! I can see it getting even better as it goes along. to one another, and their designs are all top notch.

Damn,...I wish I would have majored in that at college! As his true name suggests, Glenn gets all of the monster chicks to fall for him thanks to that big, sexy brain of his that has infinite knowledge of the workings of all sorts of  female bodies...what an absolute chad.The plot can be summed up as ""Dr. Glenn goes around finding monster girls with medical problems and he solves them in sexually suggestive ways that usually include the monster girls moaning in ecstacy for some reason.""

Isekai may be one of the most popular trend but there’s still room for monster girls. It’s Summer 2020 and Monster Girl Doctor steps up to the plate to show itself that it has room to be a fun, and perhaps even educational show, about monster girls.Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past few years, then you’ll realize that monster girls is still a trend in the anime medium despite not reaching peak popularity. One of the most well-known shows in the...past debuted in July 2015 known as “Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou”. Recently, we also had a show called “Peter Grill and the Philsopher’s Time” airing in the same season. Is Monster Girl Doctor any special in its own way?Look, I’ll be honest here. These type of shows are often advertised more as ‘want to see more? Buy the light novel!” Indeed, Monster Girl Doctor is based on the light novel of the same name. From start, we meet Glenn Litbeit, a man working in the town of Lindworm. Compared to everyone else, he’s an ordinary guy with skills involving medicine. And of course, his clients are mainly monster girls. He even has a trustworthy assistant, a lamia named Sephentite Nelkes who helps him with his daily work. In a world after a war from long ago, it’s quite pleasing to see two different species work together under the same wing. What’s also special about Glenn is about how calculating he is when working. Being that the clients he treat are monsters, it adds a level of complexity to his job. This ranges from treating simple injuries to complex surgeries. As you can imagine, it’s not easy stepping into the shoes of Glenn Litbeit. Thanks to his personality, Glenn is also a very convincing man, willing to do whatever it takes to treat his patients. This earns the affections from the female cast.As Glenn’s childhood friend, Sephentite serves as an important character by Glenn’s side. Whenever the two work together, it’s shown that they take their work seriously even though they may not always think alike. A part of the show adapts their character chemistry and how a human interacts with a monster. Glenn’s interaction with the others also remains important with cases such as Tisalia, Lulala, Arahnia, Skadi, Llly, among others. It’s shown through his selfless personality that he is willing to go to great lengths to help them. Some of these girls develop feelings for him such as the case of the mermaid, Lulala. Don’t get me wrong though, this show isn’t about romance. It’s more about a fictional storyteller of the way humans and monsters co-exist in the present world. With each episode, it shows that different monsters behave different ways since the post-war environment.Watching Glenn working convinced me that he is not only selfless but also seeks to improve the relationship between humans and monsters. Many of the girls that develops feelings for him sees him as someone to trust in, not just for his intellectual skills. From day one, you can see how much Glenn cares about his job and what he wants to do for his clients. Sephentite also knows this and perhaps a bit jealous whenever other female monsters get close to him. Beyond that, don’t expect much relationship development in the show. To my understanding, the anime itself isn’t really a faithful adaptation of the light novel and hence, this anime serves loosely as a story to focus on Glenn and his everyday life. Like I said before, if you want to see more, go read the light novel.For a show about monster girls, this anime has its windows of fan service. In fact, whenever you hear Glenn treats them, it sounds more like sexual arousal with their moans and reactions. To further amplify the effect, we see how monster anatomy works for different species during treatments. It’s a glorified way for the anime to show fan service without any sex. And if you’re a fan of that, then there’s going to plenty of entertaining that awaits you. Indeed, the monster girls are also designed with sexual allusions such as mermaid’s body, arachnoids’ legs, and even lamia’s long slimy tail. Archnia is one of the more evident examples for using her silk to capture prey. Get it, capture? Glenn himself isn’t even safe when she has a plan in mind. Overall though, the animation quality by studio Arvo Animation is consistent for making every monster girl look unique.This isn’t the first and surely won’t be the last monster girl theme show you’ll see this generation. Japan has a lot of nutty ideas for animation and Monster Girl Doctor is no exception. For a simple anime like this, it’s popcorn entertainment at best or an attempt at cash grab at worst. Somewhere in the middle, it’s watchable and I can even say it’s somewhat recommendable for anyone looking to watch some experimental fun. past debuted in July 2015 known as “Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou”.

As any good doctor would, I make sure to remove all of her clothes prior to beginning my examinations as I wouldn't want to miss a key detail in the examination and clothes hinder the palpation process.My older sister, however, has the curves required for me to truly use the techniques detailed in this highly informative documentary to the best of my abilities. Palpating the chest can be difficult with her since there is so much of it and it is hard to get hold while she fiercely resists, but I have been practising for 2 hours every day and I have slowly been improving my technique.My one criticism of the show is that my examinations on my sisters leave them unable to walk for 30 minutes after every session and it would be nice if there was a way to avoid this hassle. As a man of medicine I know that this is not always possible which is why I still give this documentary a 10/10 since I can't be too harsh about something out of the instructive videos' control. but as a 28-year old I need to make sure I use the correct techniques on her so as not to set a bad example.

Another monster girl show which relentless pounds you from behind with cliches, fan service and a bland lead."", is what you might think. However, i can happily say that all is not as it appears at first glance.Why did i watch this show? I usually trawl for anime compilation clips online in search of something that would catch my interest. After another one of my sessions of trawling and adding to my list of shows that look interesting but that i probably won\'t get around to watching because said list keeps expanding; i found this gem in the rough. What drew me in...was the clip where he falls in between a giant\'s boobs. It looked like another generic monster girl fan service show, but something about the main character\'s attitude was intriguing.I will start with characters, as a harem show with trash characters is a trash show. Don\'t @ me. First you have the main character, Glenn. He is a doctor that specializes in treating monsters (not just female ones either). He is supported by his fellow doctor Saphentite (a snakey girl). Together they go around healing the sick and performing miracles (examinations) of monsters across the land. Their relationship and its origins are explored well enough in one of the earlier episodes. It explains why Glenn decided to become a doctor for the monsters and also why the two share a strong bond. The centaur, Tisalia is a knightess type character with an ""ojousama"" laugh which i personally find endlessly amusing. She too like Saphentite, falls for the doctor after being enamored by his calm, gentle yet firm and driven nature. She is not however as arrogant as she appears, as she consistently displays a strong sense of duty and self sacrifice even to her own attendants. The other characters are not developed as much but are by no means bland.Story. Throughout the show, the doctor performs exams and subsequently treats various monsters. This is where the fan service is centered around. I personally love fan service as i am a fan and enjoy being serviced. Sue me. That being said, apart from the moans and blushing as per usual, it always occurs during the exams where doctors even in real life may have to examine parts of the body that may be sensitive or too shameful. As a person who has had their butt examined for hemorrhoids i can assure you that it is just as shameful. That being said, i did not moan but instead buried my head in the pillow. Despite this, Glenn always maintains a professional attitude. He is not like the usual protagonist who stumbles and stutters and looks away. That kind of doctor in real life would be a garbage doctor. When he has a job to do, he does it; always keeping his patients\' concerns and well-being in mind. As the show progresses and he gets approached romantically, he maintains his stoic demeanor but not to the extent which you would assume he reproduces asexually. The way he handles patients in contrast to his mentor and his fellow doctor Saphentite, is what sets him apart. Whether it is their differing philosophies regarding the right to die, honoring the patient\'s wishes (as opposed to repeatedly trying to convince them of an alternative), or approaching treatment from a psychological aspect instead of purely medicinal, Glenn\'s methods are always refreshing to look at.The setting is as is described in the summary and is not explored as in depth or as fast as you would expect. Then again, this show is not about the larger society, but instead the tale of a traveling doctor in a post war land. Art and sound are good but nothing to write home about. I personally loved the character designs, be it their physiques or their clothes.All in all a refreshing take on the monster girl genre.

It's about a human man living in a world full of monster people who makes his living by treating their various illnesses.Unfortunately, the premise of the show is much better than its actual execution. If you're looking for an overarching plot, you're out of luck until the last four or five episodes. Before that, each one is more or less standalone, focusing on one type of monster girl in each episode.Yes, monster GIRL. Although I'm certain the monster guys get sick/injured just as often as the monster...girls do, it seems that this particular doctor specializes in females, because...reasons.Interestingly, the monster girls are quite human in appearance, with a few monster traits, such as gills, animal ears, snake tails, etc, while the men are much more monster-looking.Let's not mince words, here; this show is all about the fanservice. Within two minutes of the first episode, the main character (don't worry about his name. None of their names are really important, and quite a few are difficult to remember on top of that) is shown fondling a minotaur girl's breasts. There's at least one ecchi scene in every episode, complete with the girls blushing and moaning or making other very erotic noises.There's also gratuitous amounts of CG, which are often quite jarring when they appear, since it's difficult to merge CG and traditionally drawn art, and this show is not the best representation of particularly good CG.The characters are rather forgettable, so I won't go into much detail about them. The main character is your typical bland male protagonist. If you've seen one, you've seen them all.The only female of any note is his assistant, the lamia Saphentite. She's supposed to be a nurse, but most of her personality is getting jealous when her boss so much as LOOKS at another female. Which might sound a bit strange, considering he exclusively treats girls... Don't worry about that too much, though.The art is decent; nothing groundbreaking, but not extremely bland, either, and I will admit that the designs of some of the monster girls are quite creative.All in all, it's okay to watch if you're looking for a way to waste time, but I guarantee you, there are better things out there. girls do, it seems that this particular doctor specializes in females, because...reasons.Interestingly, the monster girls are quite human in appearance, with a few monster traits, such as gills, animal ears, snake tails, etc, while the men are much more monster-looking.Let's not mince words, here; this show is all about the fanservice.

In fact the anime even starts out with it, letting you know what you'e gonna get. The moaning is ehhh alright but it is juxtaposed with a doctor seriously examining his patient. This will be a recurrent theme and is mostly used as ammunition for the audience to laugh. If it ain't funny for you, you might not want to watch this.The waifus, basically the whole point of watching this show. eh ok. Pretty generic. Characters are paper thin except for a few characters, but the pacing really made their character development felt rushed. So not really the greatest....Lamia is ok tho.Sound is great. Moaning is ok. Won't get me off tho, but fits well with the humour aspect.Pretty enjoyable show if you just want to chill Lamia is ok tho.Sound is great. Moaning is ok.

I went in with low expectations expecting yet another half hearted ecchi with a story tacked on simply to allow more harem characters to be thrown at the MC.

It gives us monster girls/people in a non-action setting but doesn\'t really delve into anything interesting about them further than anything blatantly obvious.

It plays the theme of a monster girl doctor surprisingly straight, being relatively light on humour and not going overboard with the fanservice... At least when it goes to the screentime it occupies. You'll get a minute or two of degeneracy every episode, but most of the content is slice-of-life, episodic storytelling focused on medical cases the protagonist faces. There's some borderline-decent worldbuilding, exploring various fantasy races and lore, and even minor plot twists, all kept in an overall lighthearted and relaxing tone.What's maybe most unexpected though is that the heroines,...for the most part, are actual characters with a decent amount of agency and significance to the show's world, not just defined by their relation to the protagonist. While harem tropes are very much present, the show does not overfixate on them and lets the heroines just interact with each other in meaningful ways and occassionally stay in the spotlight without the doctor being around. Even the protag himself is less a clueless moron and more just dedicated to his work to the point he mostly ignores or plays off as a joke the affection he gets.The production quality here is pretty mediocre and I wouldn't call the writing very witty or creative, but the overall enjoyment factor was way above what I expected from something like this. If you're looking for a fantasy anime to kill some time without dying from cringe or getting iritated by stupid drama, I think I can unironically recommend checking with one out. for the most part, are actual characters with a decent amount of agency and significance to the show's world, not just defined by their relation to the protagonist.

Monster Musume no Oishasan does have a story beyond Glenn and Saphee that concerning Skadi Dragonfelt voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki and the state of her city of Lindworm that she governs and employs the help from Glenn to help take care of the monsters getting injured as well as her ailing self as well.In terms of the harem aspect of Monster Musume no Oishasan, the harem themselves do have stuff outside of Glenn himself even though most all by for Glenn one way or another, from Tisalia Scythia voiced by Sarah Emi Bridcutt a centaur wanting another heir to her company thus sees Glenn as a potential candidate, as well her assistants of Kay Arte voiced by Ai Fairouz and Rona Arte voiced by M.A.O pushing this, to Lulala Heine voiced by Yukiyo Fujii a mermaid who\'s more of an aloof harem member and more or less she just likes Glenn but not so romantically as the rest of the harem, to which Illy voiced by Sayumi Suzushiro a harpy who is more tsundere about Glenn to Arahnia Arachnida voiced by Yuu Shimamura who\'s the trickster type who wants to push Glenn and Saphee but also in order to do so, she makes herself into the equation, Kunai Zenou voiced by Maki Kawase a zombie doll who\'s the MOST tsundere and bodyguard for Skadi and finally Meme Redon voiced by Miho Okasaki a cyclops who\'s a blacksmith who latter helps Glenn with some tools while trying to get over her shyness,. So yeah the harem reflecting from Monster Musume does have the same species invovled in the harem and again the harem aspect isn\'t that bad, the biggest competitors to Glenn\'s harem easily becomes Tisalia and Saphee due to their screentime while the rest of her harem does tend to other things whilst also being in the harem or pushing other members to Glenn. Aside from Tisalia and Saphee, Arahnia gets some development in terms of characterization and probably being the third wheel to the harem.Now the other story element involving Skadi does make the anime\'s tone different as it involving discrimination as the city of Lindworm having both humans and monsters living together, well some people don\'t like that and that comes into play with Skadi herself latter becoming a huge focus, Monster Musume no Oishasan because of this does veer away from the comedy slapstick nature of Monster Musume in a new direction which LA doesn\'t mind one bit.However Monster Musume no Oishasan, does have a fanservicey element to it, mainly the ""check ups"" as well as the suggestive nature of the some of the situations Glenn gets into. more or less it\'s either innuendos or things that ""remind you of something else"" fanservice element to it.The animation done by Arvo Animation was done decently from the decent background work and the obvious exotic character designs. LA really didn\'t see many derps if at all from Arvo Aniamtion with Monster Musume no Oishasan and the quality of the aniamtion was consistent more or less.The voice cast was actually pretty good from Saori Oonishi as Saphee, Sarah Emi Bridcutt as Tisalia and Yuu Shimamura as Arahnia. With the bit parts Lulala, Meme and Illy play however, Yukiyo Fujii, Miho Okasaki and Sayumi Suzushiro didn\'t really get to shine in this anime but nonetheless Saori Oonshi, Sarah Emi Bridcut and Yuu Shimamura did a pretty good job in this anime with the MVP being Saori Oonishi for obvious reasons. Overall this anime\'s voice cast was pretty good.Monster Musume no Oishasan if by comparison towards it\'s predecessor of Monster Musume, it\'s a lot more serious take on the Monster Musume universe with the same elements of Monster Musume at the same time (it\'s harem and romance elements), but the ""Monster Doc"" elements is what makes it interesting and adding to the fact that they do make the illness compatible with the species of that Glenn faces gives it that detail it needed to more or less keep itself grounded while being silly at times when it needed. Monster Musume was fanservicey harem fun, whilst Monster Musume no Oishasan is harem romance with a tinge of surgical seriousness, but seeing another side to the Monster Musume world wasn\'t that bad either.

With the bit parts Lulala, Meme and Illy play however, Yukiyo Fujii, Miho Okasaki and Sayumi Suzushiro didn\'t really get to shine in this anime but nonetheless Saori Oonshi, Sarah Emi Bridcut and Yuu Shimamura did a pretty good job in this anime with the MVP being Saori Oonishi for obvious reasons. Overall this anime\'s voice cast was pretty good.Monster Musume no Oishasan if by comparison towards it\'s predecessor of Monster Musume, it\'s a lot more serious take on the Monster Musume universe with the same elements of Monster Musume at the same time (it\'s harem and romance elements), but the ""Monster Doc"" elements is what makes it interesting and adding to the fact that they do make the illness compatible with the species of that Glenn faces gives it that detail it needed to more or less keep itself grounded while being silly at times when it needed. Monster Musume was fanservicey harem fun, whilst Monster Musume no Oishasan is harem romance with a tinge of surgical seriousness, but seeing another side to the Monster Musume world wasn\'t that bad either. Overall, Monster Musume no Oishasan was a decent watch and back into the monster musume harem anime world that\'s a bit more grounded than it\'s predecessor for better or worse.', ""I start this saying that Monster Musume No Oisha its more than ecchi and the typical cliche monster girl stories, gives a good and simple plot without needing to be deep or waving in philosophical issues, no, it is a typical slice of life style fantasy story, and analyzing it based on to the elements of the series, because everything works, both saphee's and glenn's relationships work, it is nice to see and it is simply built from childhood, the rest of the girls, it is not the same because this anime is the beginning of the whole work, you can't ask to get everything...here xd, so they give a base, from centoria, meme, illy, skady, kunai, lorna, kay, lulla and arahnia, from what I can say it works, If you come in plan, to masturbate, well I recommend you look for an H and that's it, because here the ecchi is moderate and not over-exploited, which I like, since we see other facets of the life of a monster girl without the need for be an H half of each chapter it has, which I also like, I would recommend it without problems here xd, so they give a base, from centoria, meme, illy, skady, kunai, lorna, kay, lulla and arahnia, from what I can say it works, If you come in plan, to masturbate, well I recommend you look for an H and that's it, because here the ecchi is moderate and not over-exploited, which I like, since we see other facets of the life of a monster girl without the need for be an H half of each chapter it has, which I also like, I would recommend it without problems"", ""Honestly I don't watch as many animes as I used to in the past.

The catch being every patient is half animal so that introduces biological issues in which our human doctor must figure out how to deal with. Think a cheery version of House with animal people and that is pretty much the medical half of the show. The second half is that all the patients are girls who are going to fall in love with...our protagonist doctor slowly forming a harem because that seems to be the standard for monster girl series. The one noticeable different monster girl series is that it generally avoids more ecchi elements and scenes which is refreshing. Sure there are a few ""Oops I accidentally turned you on"" moments but they are generally tame and kept to a minimumART: 8/10The art of this show is gorgeous. Each characters are uniquely designed and the way the town in which they live is beautifully designed and drawn that got me thinking ""Yeah if there was a city that had harpies and mermaids it would probably have/need something like that"" There are a few scenes were if you look closely you might think is something is off, but generally those are kept to the background and you may not notice them.SOUND: 8/10The voices were all clear and distinct with no issues matching to character mouth movements. The EP and OP were alright and sound alright they just are not really my cup of tea.CHARACTERS: 8/10The characters fit the needed tropes for a monster girl series. You have the generally bland dark haired 17 year old fit for self insert boy as main character, your jealous  lamia main love interest, your proud warrior centaur, your spider-girl who looks and act dangerous but is really a good person, etc. etc. What makes the character of this series stand out is their interaction with one another. Most monster girls shows have their girl interact with each other when in the presence of the male lead with the explicit purpose of trying to one up each other to get into said male lead pants. In this show the girls interact with each other and share their thoughts about the male lead and tell more of their personalities and lives outside of our lead, which gives better development and better characters.ENJOYMENT: 9/10I\'m generally a fan of other world/RPG inspired monster shows. What made me enjoy this one was the unique approaches our doctor protagonist had to take since each patient is different almost making it like a puzzle or riddle to figure out.

And a slime that one episode. Something about this seems familiar, but I can’t really put my finger on this very, very specific sounding setup.Story:Glenn Litbeit is a special kind of doctor in this ten year old town of Lindworm. Instead of just being practiced in treating his own race of humans, he’s also blessed with the knowledge of knowing how to treat and cure other fantasy species such as minotaurs and reanimated corpses. Because of this, he’s gained a...kind of infamy in the town, and over the course of the series, showcases his abilities as a Monster Girl Doctor.The way I’d describe Oisha-san is…inoffensive. Starting off with one-off cases with some of the title girls that’s shown in the opening or any promo art with the series, the show gradually transitions to longer arcs that feature more major cases, but keep the form of the series intact by treating the various maladies that plague these specific individuals that Glenn comes in contact with. Due to the show’s arcic setup, there’s not really much to talk about in the show since what we get in the story is basically what’s on the tin. And because of the show’s constant rinse and repeat, the tone and everything that gets established with Oisha-san gets kind of samey.I call the show inoffensive because there’s not really a lot of good things to note nor are there a lot of bad things to take into consideration as unfortunate downsides of the show. There are certainly a few…surprise elements that pop up every now and then, but they’re not particularly detrimental to the show as a whole, and none of it really impacts the plot in such a way that I would have to point it out here. The whole tone that the show ends up having is just sort of ‘meh’. I didn’t really have that many reactions or emotions while watching the show because the show honest to god set out what it wanted to do, and considering Glenn’s track record, the results of any of the various patients that he comes into contact with didn’t really surprise me in the slightest. Made even more so by the fact that the cast is filled with monster girls, which is something that’s as of late, has become quite popular. So hurting them is really a no no.As a result, the show ends up becoming kind of aimless without much to propel the story forward aside from the choppy arcs that come and go one after the other. The most intrigue I can give the show is with some of the worldbuilding that comes with the setting of Lindworm, which unfortunately isn’t explored all that much. But even that much didn’t hold my attention for very long, and the story just kind of ends up as being something that’s servicable, but nothing all that outstanding.Characters:Glenn Litbeit is our unfortunate doctor and not harem harem protagonist that’s just really good at his profession. His character is extremely competent and level headed, always one to think a situation through for the good of his patients more so than anything else, and is aware of the things that go on around him even though it seems like at first he’s clueless. He’s also very aware at what some of the women of the life think of him, which is a pretty rare trait for a non-pervert character. Unfortunately, despite having a lot of positive traits, he’s not really all that interesting as a character. His existence as a really, really good doctor is such a mainstay of his personality that there’s not a lot else to talk about, made even more explicit when all of his lines basically pertain to his job and he basically does all of his procedures perfectly. None of this is a disservice to his character, but because he’s kind of written to be the perfect answer to all of these girls’ problems, it leaves no room for him to have any kind of flaws or even a hobby outside of his profession. He’s pretty bland and I think he only adds to the ‘inoffensive’ problem because his character leads for no tension to be had in a series that’s already set up to never fail.His patients (harem) on the other hand pretty much exist as hosts of biological oddities that provide interesting biology lessons about various fantasy species. Sure they have names, like Lulala, Illy, and Tisalia, but the most important contribution they have to the series is being the sample of their species that Glenn treats in order to give the series its intrigue because Glenn is working with something that has fundamentals that work differently to what the human body functions with. They’re interesting for sure, but as individual characters, they’re all pretty one note, though their interactions with one another can be kind of fun to watch since it’s basically a giant catfight with girls capable of even scarier biological feats.Saphentite is the only outlier, being Glenn’s lamia assistant and childhood friend who vies for his attention in hopes that one day he’ll take her. (What is with all of the similarities, seriously.) While she’s also one note, the difference with her is that she’s basically glued to the doctor and shows up in every episode alongside him, even going so far as to have a backstory with him, which is nice if only for the fact that it fleshes the characters out a little more so there’s more to them than just the nurse thirsting over the doctor at the clinic. Though not a lot would really change without the backstory, if I may be honest.Side characters are pretty much filler for the world, and only have bearing on the arcs that they’re involved with, so there’s not really much to say here, although they do serve a more important purpose that I’ll get to next.Aesthetics:Arvo animation, a studio who’s so small the only show they’ve really done is “We can’t Study”, (oh god, they did “We Can’t Study”…), the art for the series is pretty standard and I can’t really say much good or bad about it. Design-wise, there’s an obvious ‘generic fantasy’ feel that the series has for it. Made only slightly unique because of the cultural coding that various races are given, like the centaur’s draped in armor, the spider women wearing asian robes, and the harpies wearing stereotypical Native American clothing. Which…not sure if the coding was a good idea, but it makes everyone distinct at least.What interests me though is the show’s filler or side characters, as, while the sexual dimorphism of the various species are definitely biased in making the women look more human, there was a clear effort in the show’s character design at trying to make the other species look different, and have a slurry of different species in one place. Sure a lot of other fantasy series’ do that, but it’s a nice effort regardless that I appreciated. Now if only they didn’t have to put in the useless fanservice. If making him a doctor was an excuse to make some of those scenes come to light, that’s cheap, creators.Conversely though, the show uses various 3-D models in place of hand drawing things, and aspects of the show like Saphy’s tail in some scenes, as well as the fairies that help in the clinic pop out as being animated or even made differently. Which, cost-wise is effective, but definitely shows how cheap they were being because of how glaring some of these parts of the show end up looking.“Campanella Hibiku Sora de” by ARCANA project is, in one word, generic. There’s really not a lot that can be said positively about this song because it’s both serviceable but doesn’t have anything that stands out about it. I kind of expected this to be the case when I first read the show’s synopsis, so I’m not that bothered that the show ended up getting a standard J-pop song as its opening song. Likewise, “Yasashisa no Namae” by Aina Suzuki is yet another J-pop song that doesn’t have a lot going for it. It’s a lot less energetic than its OP sister, but that doesn’t save itself from being also not that memorable in long run. In summary, decent tracks, but there’s not a lot about it that makes me feel like it’s all that memorable even for a spare listen to.Final Thoughts:The amount of similarities to the cast of girls that Oisha-san has to “Daily life of Monster Girls” is not really something I expected or wanted. The fact that the main lineup of girls is practically the same, save for a Suu comparison (and Lala, I guess), is a weird coincidence if I’ve ever seen one. Tinfoil hats aside, I honestly didn’t really care much for this show, and at times lost interest in the middle of watching episodes.The show really just doesn’t have a lot going for it. Sure there’re some stakes every now and then that add tension, but the end result of it makes it barely anything of note, and this same set of events happening every couple of episodes creates an inoffensive show that does what it promises to show, but doesn’t wow the audience with anything beyond what the title says it’s about. I find it a bit of a shame too because you easily could have gone into in-depth biology lessons about the various species. But instead we have all of the doctor’s examinations end up becoming intimate touching sessions where it seems like every part of a monster girl’s body is an erogenous zone, and every girl he finishes an initial examination on is on their knees breathing heavily like they just came out of one intense session. It’s a small blemish on the show since it really didn’t need to be there, but hey, I guess anything to keep the audience’s attention.So the verdict on Monster Girl Doctor ends it up as a show that ends up being season filler instead of something that’s worth the time to watch. I personally had hardly any emotions while watching the show because I found it boring without a lot of varying substance. Sure it has like maybe 3-4 standout moments, but in a twelve episode series, having barely an episode’s worth of surprising or interesting storytelling/characters through all of that isn’t enough to hold my attention. And sometimes, being a forgettable show is worse than being a show that’s actively hated on. Again, it’s a very inoffensive show; it just also doesn’t have a lot to offer. kind of infamy in the town, and over the course of the series, showcases his abilities as a Monster Girl Doctor.The way I’d describe Oisha-san is…inoffensive.

While she’s also one note, the difference with her is that she’s basically glued to the doctor and shows up in every episode alongside him, even going so far as to have a backstory with him, which is nice if only for the fact that it fleshes the characters out a little more so there’s more to them than just the nurse thirsting over the doctor at the clinic. Though not a lot would really change without the backstory, if I may be honest.Side characters are pretty much filler for the world, and only have bearing on the arcs that they’re involved with, so there’s not really much to say here, although they do serve a more important purpose that I’ll get to next.Aesthetics:Arvo animation, a studio who’s so small the only show they’ve really done is “We can’t Study”, (oh god, they did “We Can’t Study”…), the art for the series is pretty standard and I can’t really say much good or bad about it. Design-wise, there’s an obvious ‘generic fantasy’ feel that the series has for it. Made only slightly unique because of the cultural coding that various races are given, like the centaur’s draped in armor, the spider women wearing asian robes, and the harpies wearing stereotypical Native American clothing. Which…not sure if the coding was a good idea, but it makes everyone distinct at least.What interests me though is the show’s filler or side characters, as, while the sexual dimorphism of the various species are definitely biased in making the women look more human, there was a clear effort in the show’s character design at trying to make the other species look different, and have a slurry of different species in one place. Sure a lot of other fantasy series’ do that, but it’s a nice effort regardless that I appreciated. Now if only they didn’t have to put in the useless fanservice. If making him a doctor was an excuse to make some of those scenes come to light, that’s cheap, creators.Conversely though, the show uses various 3-D models in place of hand drawing things, and aspects of the show like Saphy’s tail in some scenes, as well as the fairies that help in the clinic pop out as being animated or even made differently. Which, cost-wise is effective, but definitely shows how cheap they were being because of how glaring some of these parts of the show end up looking.“Campanella Hibiku Sora de” by ARCANA project is, in one word, generic. There’s really not a lot that can be said positively about this song because it’s both serviceable but doesn’t have anything that stands out about it. I kind of expected this to be the case when I first read the show’s synopsis, so I’m not that bothered that the show ended up getting a standard J-pop song as its opening song. Likewise, “Yasashisa no Namae” by Aina Suzuki is yet another J-pop song that doesn’t have a lot going for it. It’s a lot less energetic than its OP sister, but that doesn’t save itself from being also not that memorable in long run. In summary, decent tracks, but there’s not a lot about it that makes me feel like it’s all that memorable even for a spare listen to.Final Thoughts:The amount of similarities to the cast of girls that Oisha-san has to “Daily life of Monster Girls” is not really something I expected or wanted. The fact that the main lineup of girls is practically the same, save for a Suu comparison (and Lala, I guess), is a weird coincidence if I’ve ever seen one. Tinfoil hats aside, I honestly didn’t really care much for this show, and at times lost interest in the middle of watching episodes.The show really just doesn’t have a lot going for it. Sure there’re some stakes every now and then that add tension, but the end result of it makes it barely anything of note, and this same set of events happening every couple of episodes creates an inoffensive show that does what it promises to show, but doesn’t wow the audience with anything beyond what the title says it’s about. I find it a bit of a shame too because you easily could have gone into in-depth biology lessons about the various species. But instead we have all of the doctor’s examinations end up becoming intimate touching sessions where it seems like every part of a monster girl’s body is an erogenous zone, and every girl he finishes an initial examination on is on their knees breathing heavily like they just came out of one intense session. It’s a small blemish on the show since it really didn’t need to be there, but hey, I guess anything to keep the audience’s attention.So the verdict on Monster Girl Doctor ends it up as a show that ends up being season filler instead of something that’s worth the time to watch. I personally had hardly any emotions while watching the show because I found it boring without a lot of varying substance. Sure it has like maybe 3-4 standout moments, but in a twelve episode series, having barely an episode’s worth of surprising or interesting storytelling/characters through all of that isn’t enough to hold my attention. And sometimes, being a forgettable show is worse than being a show that’s actively hated on. Again, it’s a very inoffensive show; it just also doesn’t have a lot to offer.', 'As many other reviewers pointed out, ""Monster Musume no Oisha-san"" isn\'t in any way related to better-known ""Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou"" - apart from, well, monster girls starring in both. And the whole female harem trope as well, though this just isn\'t how Oisha-san was really intended to be. Reading the manga, you see a pulsating city teeming with humans and monsters living together, where Glenn, a young, brilliant and earnest (if a bit clumsy) doctor for monsters is practicing with the help of his beautiful and possessive lamia assistant, Saphentite - a mature yet insecure character torn between her desire to help Glenn...and the fear he\'ll grow distant from her. As they help a number of different monster girls, comedy and dramatic moments are mixed with a few, very light (when compared with MonMusu) ecchi scenes. It\'s a serious story - a good mix of fantasy, monster girls, love comedy, and some weird cryptid anatomy lessons.The anime takes these elements, grinds them together, and bakes the whole thing into the most cheesy, plain, boring show since Tenchi Muyo. Production must have thought of capitalizing on the success of MonMusu, turning the story into a light comedy meant to appeal to monster girl fans by emphasizing its harem side and ecchi elements. Glenn, Saphentite and all the girls have become so dull and one-dimensional that it\'s impossible to grow attached to them. As many other reviewers pointed out, the show is just plain boring. It\'s hard to describe the feeling of outright disappointment I had at the end of the first episode - Monster Musume no Oisha-san deserved so much better! Not only is it horrible character-wise; budget limits are obvious in animation level, which luckily rises from \'abysmal\' (check out the battle between Tisalia and the lizardwoman at the end of the first episode!) to just \'poor\' as the series goes on.Not everything is bad, to be completely honest. Art is faithful enough to the manga and, music-wise, there\'s a captivating, nice middle-east-like theme that goes quite well with the colorful and crowded atmosphere of Lindworm.Have a look at it if you\'re a serious monster girl fan and don\'t mind low quality and dull characters; but if you want to do yourself a favor, just read the manga. and the fear he\'ll grow distant from her.

It’s essentially just about the protagonist Glenn, a doctor dealing with various patients, though the twist is that despite Glenn being a human he’s a doctor that specializes in dealing with monsters. This is relatively fast paced with most of the patients he deals with only having a single episode dedicated to them, though a lot of them continue appearing after their arc as side characters that help Glenn in dealing with other patients. It should also be noted that although it is a medical drama,...it’s an incredibly light hearted and chill one, wherein there’s never really much of a feeling of risk or suspense and there’s nothing like things going terribly wrong or encountering a disease that Glenn can’t treat. Glenn himself is also an incredibly laid back guy so the atmosphere itself also seems pretty laid back regardless of what’s happening. Thus, it has a very strong slice of life feel to it, just with the life being focused on being a doctor for monsters.As one would expect based on the title, the vast majority of the patients he deals with, and all of the ones that get stories focused on them, are monster girls. Each of these monster girls usually get some simplistic and quick character development that’s connected to being treated for whatever ails them. This is never all that deep, but there’s a good variety to the types of monster girls and their personalities, so just fleshing them out somewhat is enough to give them pretty well defined characters. At that point, just showing them all interacting in various situations and the various dynamics between them makes them pretty interesting and results in lots of really amusing situations. As a result I don’t think that there’s any specific character that’s particularly likable, but the cast overall felt pretty likable and one that I’d like to see more of.A lot of the monster girls also seem to fall in love with him to varying degrees as a result of Glenn treating them. Glenn isn’t the type of protagonist too dense to notice, but his stance is that he’s too busy being a doctor to deal with things like romance, so he just tries to brush things off in his laid back manner of his, though that doesn’t change the fact that various characters are trying to get him to fall for them. This leads to a lot of romantic fluff like situations, but it feels it’s more centered around being comedic and amusing than actually romantic and overall I thought it did quite well in that regard. The only exception to that is with what is clearly the main heroine, Saphentite, who is Glenn’s assistant so she ends up getting the most screen time and is usually at the center of any actually serious relationship development.The production values to the art animation felt a bit cheap and there was a lot of use of CGI. Still, overall it wasn’t all that jarring and I think worked out okay. The designs overall were pretty good which is a must for series centered around monster girls. The soundtrack was fine but not particularly memorable.

However, it doesn't mean that this one is horrible. It may seem a rip-off, but it's fairly good.

It focuses more with the mc's interaction with the monster girls and less random ecchi scenes. It may not be as good as the former, but it certainly is a good anime and I'm happy that a monster musume got a spin-off, that's for sure.

But if you don\'t like to read then,TL;DR:It\'s just a better Monster Musume, better characters, better character designs, and an actual story. No wonder the writer of Musume hired the writer of this series to do their light novel adaptation. Just a fun, lighthearted, watch.

While there are a lot of male monsters shown, as you would expect most of the focus is on the girls, no complaints from me. The story is solid. If you want a monster girl show this is probably one of the better actual stories out there. It\'s a feel good story with not a ton of depth, which is pretty standard.Art 5:It\'s weak, simple as that. The character designs are really quite good but the budget was clearly lacking, but overall it\'s passable.Sound 6:Not noticeably bad but nothing special.Characters 8:Honestly every character in here is a just better written version of the same monster in Monster Musume, except maybe Arachne VS Rachnera. VAs are well cast too. Less frustrating to watch compared to many of the other stereotypical characters you get in these shows.Enjoyment 8:It\'s a very pleasant watch. Don\'t think of it as some deep series, don\'t think of it as soft core p*rn like Interspecies Reviewers, or what Monster Musume can be at times, though there are some scenes here and there that go in that direction (but they generally stop well short of anything too scandalous).

As well as what a doctor would expect if they had to treat them. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t go very far and ends up being a pretty okay ecchi harem anime.The main character, Glenn, isn\'t a terrible protag by any means it\'s just he\'s a bit dull and not very rememberable. Although a redeeming quality he has is that he\'s extremely smart and dedicated to his work as a doctor. I feel like this works in the show\'s favor as it allows us to be in...certain situations without it being weird or gross. If Glenn was a clumsy pervert it would painfully average anime to watch, even by ecchi standards.My biggest problem with this show is the fact that it\'s ecchi as this hindered its story. Not to the point where if every frame is eye candy but you can clearly tell they wanted to fill some archetypes. For instance, Skadi is soft-spoken, a bit mysterious, and didn\'t show any strong emotion throughout the show. However, by the last episode, her personality did a complete 180. This is somewhat okay as given the circumstances of what happens in Ep 11 she ""gains a new outlook on life"", but they made her fall into a certain category to fit a niche. This caught me off guard, which not only ruined the character for me but left a bad taste in my mouth on the overall show. Just could have been handled better. I understand that I shouldn\'t be expecting a great story from the ecchi genre but that doesn\'t mean they shouldn\'t produce the best story they can. certain situations without it being weird or gross.

But this time unlike Monster Musume, for me, they targeted the heart and did well.The story is based on Glenn, a human doctor who specializes in monsters, and his assistant Saphentite, a lamia who is also a doctor. Together they attend to different waifus for all tastes: harpies, a cyclops, centaurs, a Frankenstein-type golem, even a dragon and a giant!The opening and ending are nice, plus the ending because Saphe is there and it is always a pleasure to see her, she is very cute.The story, apart from the fact that they are monsters, would not change if it...were in a school, in the future or in some other place, because what refers to the doctor's work we see it two seconds per chapter, except in some, but I will not spoil .If you like monster girls and you want to have a little fun check it out.

If you enjoy that genre, just give it a watch. As a fan of monster girls, I enjoyed watching this series. That said, it was pretty slow and suffers from typical harem problems.The main character, Glenn, is... well, a pretty bland guy. He's rich and skilled at his profession, I admit, and he's a nice guy in the sense that he actually does genuinely care for the well-being of others without having ulterior motives. But... that's all. He has no cool hobbies or other special skills, no particular convictions that get...him into trouble or any noticeable character flaws.Putting the MC aside for a moment, the direction of each episode is very to the point. A monster girl gets introduced and.... she has a medical problem. Who would have guessed? The doctor and the girl meet, and he cures her. Tada! Now she's in love with him. Pretty straightforward, but at least you know what to expect from each episode. Unfortunately, each of the girls is just barely more than a cardboard cut-out of a personality type. I'm not a fan of the fan service that happens during medical examinations either. It's comical at best. In any case, I can't say it's particularly exciting or titillating.The visual design is alright, but nothing special. Same for the sound design. The voice acting was pretty decent, if somewhat over-the-top at times.In the end I did watch all of the episodes, and I did enjoy myself. But Monster Girl Doctor really isn't that great of a series.

However, this program is not only concerned with giving the situations of easy and forced perversions that make the adaptation live purely from it, but is more a resource within the plot for certain situations so it does not become extremely ""heavy ""for someone who\'s already pretty tired of the same genre for a while.Much of this is linked to the plot, because we have a protagonist who is a doctor (well vet xD) and is not the simple stereotype ""hormonal pajin"", but he cares a lot about his work and the show has very interesting things about see how it cares for the different species, diagnoses and ends up curing them. Obviously this is lost with the passage of the chapters more and more, and he worries about giving rise to the cast of his Harem and everything begins to become more ordinary, but even so I always kept expectant to it, so I am satisfied--------------------------- En Español --------------------------------------------General: 6,5 / 10La realidad es que me agrado mucho esta adaptación y aunque me caiga el ""hate"" me atrevo a decir que es de los que mas satisfecho me dejo en esta temporada (exceptuando las secuelas) siendo así ""simple pero conciso"" sin mas, y pasare a mi explicar mi postura.Primero que nada esta a la vista que el espectáculo esta dirigido al harem / echhi que es un tópico bastante reutilizado y que es relativamente difícil traer algo ""diferente"" a la mesa, e inclusive mas si consideras que hace años aparecía una serie titulada muy similar como ""Monster Musume no Iru nichojou"" y que en gran parte el elenco de personajes parece una copia en todo sentido al solo ver el diseño de la protagonista. Sin embargo este programa no se preocupa solo por dar las situaciones de perversiones fáciles y forzadas que hacen que la adaptación viva puramente de la misma, sino que es mas un recurso dentro de la trama para determinadas situaciones por lo que no se vuelve extremadamente ""pesado ""para alguien que ya está bastante cansado del mismo genero durante un tiempo.Gran parte de esto va unido a la trama, por que tenemos un protagonista que es doctor (bueno veterinario xD) y no es el simple estereotipo ""pajin hormonal"", sino que se preocupa bastante por su trabajo y tiene cosas muy interesante el show sobre ver como atiende a las distintas especies, diagnósticos y acaba curándolos. Obviamente esto se va perdiendo con el pasar de los capítulos cada vez más, y se preocupa ya por dar lugar al elenco de su Harem y todo comienza a volverse mas ordinario, pero aun así siempre me mantuve expectante al mismo, por lo que quedo satisfecho . similar appeared. as ""Monster Musume no Iru nichojou"" and that in large part the cast of characters seems a copy in every sense when only seeing the design of the protagonist.

Kanojo mo Kanojo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43969/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo,"[""This anime is a sole reminder to not take harem seriously.When I first saw GF GF reception, and how everyone thought it was cringe or some bs takes up space for no reason, I instantly knew that this was something for me to watch. For some reason, anything with an illogical nature or dumb premise (or just a low mean score) seems to be frowned upon just because it is dumb and cringe and bluepilled. But some anime are dumb on purpose, so I don't understand why stupid anime are taken so seriously, because that isn't the way they are meant to be judged upon,...GF GF is a good example of this.This anime is ridiculous, follows wacky and over-the-top character behaviour with some chemistry going up and down like some kind of deranged trigonometric polynomial function, the story just does whatever the hell it wants, and I really have a feeling it will get even more ridiculous down the line. But it is all this nonsense that makes GF GF so fun to watch. Alongside the production behind this, which seems to have a higher budget and better seiyuus than any harem I can remember. Well, maybe not as good looking as Oresuki was tho. GF GF is genuinely something I look forward to, all in all, it's alright to like stupid stuff.In any case, this anime is something you want to watch in this dry season, the same season with some Otome bs I dropped 65 years ago, some fanfic spin-off of ReLife and Sakurasou, and WEP 2.0. I have said what I have needed to say. Hopefully, this preview has convinced you to watch GF GF not as something along the lines of <name of very deep anime is very deep> but as something to sit down and have a laugh at.10/10 because I laughed. A lot.No. This is not a satire.No. I am not trolling.No. I am not joking.

That\'s my exact experience with Kanojo mo Kanojo. ""Like"" is an understatement though, because I found myself laughing my ass off watching pretty much every episode of the show. In a season which has suffered from the ""lack of good shit"" syndrome, Kanojo mo Kanojo has legitimately been my favorite anime to watch. Yes, legitimately.First, let\'s get the bad things out of the way. If you don\'t enjoy ""dumb"", ""illogical"" anime and dislike the seemingly awkward two-timing concept of KmK, chances are that you won\'t like the show either....This is very clearly a hit-or-miss series; you are either going to love it or hate it. Even someone like me, who absolutely adores the show now, had a rough time sitting through the first episode. It wasn\'t because of the ""dumb always equals bad"" mentality that most people seem to have, but because of how awkward I found the circumstances to be. There\'s another major reason behind my initial dislike for the show, but I will get to that in a bit.So what makes KmK good compared to other dumb, ""low-effort"" harem romcoms out there? For example, what\'s different about it compared to something like Osamake? It\'s hard to explain. Maybe it\'s the fact that KmK actually feels like a genuine parody of harem—as opposed to a series that only claims to be a parody while unironically being the exact thing that it attempts to make fun of (Osamake, for instance). The scenarios in KmK are also far more outlandish, with each scenario constantly one-upping the earlier one in terms of ridiculousness. Everything about the show feels like the most cliched trope you could ever imagine—just amplified to an unthinkable extent.Then there\'s the fact that the characters are actually likeable and entertaining, which is one of the biggest differences between KmK and most other harem romcoms.The characters are by far the best part of KmK, and they are basically what make the show\'s awkward premise somehow work. Yes, most of them are unbelievably stupid, illogical, and embarrassingly straightforward, but they are still entertaining. Their apparent lack of braincells doesn\'t make them the least bit intolerable; instead, they are more enjoyable because of it. Another noteworthy side is that there aren\'t many characters in the cast; the series only focuses on a select few individuals and doesn\'t dabble in any unnecessary subplot. This is rather uncommon in harem romcoms, most of which have a tendency to stray away from the original storyline by introducing redundant side-characters and the like.However, if you had asked me about my outlook on KmK two months ago, I probably would have given a much different answer, and that\'s mostly because of just one guy: Naoya, the protagonist.Naoya is a very difficult character to like, and I completely understand why. He is as stupid and clueless as a brick, seemingly very selfish and self-centred, and above all, like Rika describes, he is a ""two-timing bastard"" and the root cause of this fucked up situation. But man, is he honest and straightforward. I would have had no qualms repeatedly punching his face if it had been a few weeks ago, but as the story progressed, I kind of started liking the guy to be honest. Not in any conventional way, though. Let me explain.Naoya doesn\'t have any depressing backstory or even a compelling trait that will make you like him, but what he does have is his overly frank and persistent personality and his commitment to keep both of his girlfriends happy, which is admirable in its own way. Naoya will go out of his way to make sure that Saki and Nagisa are treated equally, leading to some questionable yet nonetheless hilarious scenarios. All this collectively made it difficult for me to dislike him, albeit I totally hated him at the beginning of the story. In the end, you could say that he is essentially what makes this show, and say what you want, but I don\'t think you would find a better replacement.Enough about Naoya, though. Let\'s talk about the girls now.For starters, Saki is the best girl of the show. The other three are also very likeable (although Shino gets focus for like only 2 episodes), but Saki\'s surprisingly sympathetic persona and unpredictable behaviour makes her the most memorable out of all. But again, all the other girls also deserve credit. They all love Naoya for their own reasons and come up with various plans to protect and express their love, which kinda makes your root for all the three at the same time—no matter how disastrous the result eventually turns out to be. As the story is now though, Saki and Nagisa seem like the only potential winners, but given the kind of series we are talking about here, honestly anything could happen.In terms of production values, the animation of KmK clearly isn\'t top-tier, but it isn\'t really bad either. There are a lot of awkward faces and stiff movements from time to time (that weren\'t intentional), but the overall quality of the animation is fine. I like the vibrant color scheme of the show as well, and most importantly, all the girls look very attractive (although their faces can become quite deformed sometimes—either for comedic purpose or unintentionally).Regarding the soundtrack, I thought it was surprisingly good. Some of the tracks that played on the background were very memorable and caught me off guard to be honest. Along with the decent soundtrack, KmK also has one of the best opening and ending themes of this season. The opening song ""Fuzaketenaize"" is very catchy, and the ending song ""Pinky Hook"" is especially good with its outstanding pre-chorus, which gets me hooked (pun intended) every time I hear it.Kanojo mo Kanojo is easily one of the most enjoyable harems I have ever watched, and there honestly isn\'t any sense of irony when I say that. Whether or not the show has good writing may be debatable, but one thing is for sure—it knows how to have fun, it knows how to embrace its stupidity. This type of unassuming and ""not giving a fuck"" attitude makes the show a rare find and, in my opinion, a legitimately great anime to watch. You wouldn\'t find anything remotely meaningful here even with the most rose-tinted glasses, but that doesn\'t stop it from being any less enjoyable.After all, not all anime need to be profound or even rational to be considered genuinely entertaining, and Kanojo mo Kanojo just might be the best example of that. This is very clearly a hit-or-miss series; you are either going to love it or hate it. Even someone like me, who absolutely adores the show now, had a rough time sitting through the first episode.

The main character, Naoya, is so cultured that instead of pulling the usual harem trope of choosing best girl at the end of the show (or not at all), he gets TWO girlfriends in the FIRST episode.Every year, there is an anime that comes out that is so absolutely rediculous in its plot that it seems like it came straight out of a hentai. Because of this, there will always be a large number of people who do not enjoy these types of shows. However, for people who like...trash like I do, these shows are our ""guilty pleasure"" shows. Kanojo mo Kanojo does not have a complex story or deep meaning, and isn\'t something that will make you question life (or maybe it will, but not in a good way), but is just a show that will enteratain and make you laugh once a week.If you enjoyed the trashiness of Domestic na Kanojo or Kanojo, Okarishimasu, this is the Summer 2021 show for you. trash like I do, these shows are our ""guilty pleasure"" shows.

What is the reason why we watch anime, and on a larger spectrum, consume all varieties of media? Is it so we can critically dissect all of the aspects of a show and nitpick on all of its faults? While I\'m sure this can be...fun?...for some (and a headache for others haha), I don\'t think so. It\'s because of entertainment. We crave excitement, something that can function as a brief escape from our realities and act as a stimulus...for our minds. That to me is the key component of all media, regardless of genre. While there are a variety of factors that can contribute to a work of fiction being a success, to me it ultimately boils down to two things: Does it keep me interested and do I enjoy watching it? And let me tell you, Kanojo mo Kanojo is easily one of the most entertaining anime that I\'ve seen in years!The premise is stupid. The execution of the story is stupid. The characters and their actions are stupid. And I absolutely love it. Contrary to popular belief, an anime does not in fact have to be on a scale of epic proportions or contain beautifully written symbolism to be good. Besides, that would limit creativity and expressionism if everybody tried to write similarly. We gotta expand our horizons and get a little more diversity! To me, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a success because I was able to enjoy the heck out of it despite its simplistic, limited, and in ALL cases, silly content.So the show pretty much revolves around the premise of the main dude two timing, and the biggest plot development involves another girl trying to get him to be a three timer. Oh boy! This is one of those weird ideas that I doubt you would see any other country bar Japan dare attempt to implement in their works because of all of the potential controversies. Japan doesn\'t give a crap of course because Japanese people are seemingly just too badass to care. But hey, this anime doesn\'t attempt to glorify polygamy like other certain anime seemingly try to paint other negative practices like slavery in a positive light, so I don\'t really care what the ideas used are as long as they\'re utilized appropriately in the narrative. And to me, it works because of the absurd way that the cast deals with it.The characters do not act like normal people. Naoya is beyond dense and loves to shout everything he thinks out loud. He also tries WAAAAY too hard at everything. The man has no stop button or shame, but it\'s great. He stands out because of how ridiculous he is, and this dude\'s antics never failed to crack me up. Whether it\'s *Gasp*...HAND HOLDING...with two girls out in public while screaming about his love for them or forgoing his pants so he can make a point, Naoya\'s over the top nature really makes him memorable, and his amazing voice acting certainly helps.Saki is Naoya\'s initial girlfriend, and my personal favorite character in the show. As her good friend Shino puts it, Saki is stupid. And you know what? That\'s ok!!! I absolutely love the chemistry between Saki and Naoya, their moments had me burst out laughing on various occasions. I\'m glad that she at least tried to fight the whole two timing thing for awhile, but eventually caved in because her, Naoya, and Nagisa were simply made to be in a love triangle...no really, that\'s how the author wrote it. But truth be told, it\'s primarily because she\'s a baka. And she\'s also big pushover who was easily won over by Nagisa. I was honestly surprised at how lewd Saki was and especially the way her horniness (Wait, is this a real word?) was portrayed. I\'m used to anime girls being like ""Oho! I\'m going to get him to look at my slightly exposed cleavage! How perverted!!!"" But Saki over here is just like ""I want sex and can\'t stop thinking about it"" while still being fidgety and nervous about it all because she has no experience. Which I weirdly respect and, I dunno, somehow find more realistic and endearing? Yeah, maybe I\'m just a baka myself. This anime seems to push the ecchi levels further than most with things like this, and that little extra nudge helps make it stand out to me. Saki\'s various comedic expressions and reactions to the insanity that is this anime are great. Plus the absolutely phenomenal voice acting for her really helped to elevate Saki\'s character even more. Seriously though, why are the seiyuu in this anime so darn good!?The other characters are fun too. Nagisa is the reason why the whole plot THICCens in the first place by confessing to Naoya. As you can imagine, everything about her is turned up to 11, such as the fact that she has to put in thousands of hours of effort into things just to try and be average at them. I can only imagine that this is because, like the rest of this anime, Nagisa is stupid. But hey, she\'s an excellent cook, so there\'s that!!! Milika is a girl who appears in order to move the plot along, which makes sense since she has, uh, a, b, c, d, e, f...G-reat PLOT, if ya know what I mean~ Her dedication to getting Naoya to fall for her is admirable, if not borderline insane. I was worried that her antics might start to lesson my enjoyment of the show, but the reverse happened. She has plenty of funny moments and I\'ll be rooting for her to turn this two way anime into a THREE way anime!!! The last girl to mention is Saki\'s elegant friend Shino, who is anything but elegant in her one big scene. She hasn\'t appeared much, but if her short yet amazingly anime-esque confrontation with Naoya is anything to go by, she has a lot of potential...just not in her chest. Gah, I tried to hold back, but I couldn\'t, I\'m sorry. But anyway, here\'s hoping Studio Tezuka Productions will get on that second season!!!If there\'s anything you can take away from my review, it\'s this. Please, don\'t take this show seriously. You\'ll only hurt yourself if you try to, trust me. Logic simply doesn\'t exist in this series, just like how boing boing doesn\'t exist on Saki\'s flat chest and how opinions don\'t exist in the minds of ignorant people.....ok, I couldn\'t decide which comparison to use since the first one makes me seem perverted and the second one makes me come across as rude. So naturally, I decided to use both of them. Why?Because I\'m stupid. Just like this anime. So in the end, maybe that\'s why I feel such a connection to it... for our minds. That to me is the key component of all media, regardless of genre. While there are a variety of factors that can contribute to a work of fiction being a success, to me it ultimately boils down to two things: Does it keep me interested and do I enjoy watching it? And let me tell you, Kanojo mo Kanojo is easily one of the most entertaining anime that I\'ve seen in years!The premise is stupid. The execution of the story is stupid. The characters and their actions are stupid. And I absolutely love it. Contrary to popular belief, an anime does not in fact have to be on a scale of epic proportions or contain beautifully written symbolism to be good. Besides, that would limit creativity and expressionism if everybody tried to write similarly. We gotta expand our horizons and get a little more diversity!

So in the end, maybe that\'s why I feel such a connection to it...', ""This review contains minor spoilers.Kanojo mo Kanojo: It would be a great h-anime plot. Is it a good rom-com? – no . Do I watch rom-coms? -no, but still that is some next level tragic. Is there something that I like in the anime? – no, except the opening. Would I recommend it to anyone? – no.  Why? … :Art: 6/10The art is nothing special, but it really fits the genre. The animation is sometimes poorly made, but that’s because the anime is ‘comedy’, so they put these ‘really funny’ awkward animations (which I  genuinely hate). Everything is bright and colorful like every...modern rom-com. I won’t add the art score to the overall one, because I don’t think that the art can hide the pathetic characters and story.Sound: 6/10The opening is the only thing that I like in this anime. Its not really good or something, its okay and it fits the genre too. It shows everything we need to know about the anime. The music in the anime is sometimes not in the right place. For example  when Saki left Naoya’s house the music was really sad like someone died or something  and I don’t think that that was ironic. But overall the anime has mediocre background music which for the most part fits the situations in which the characters are. I don’t like the ending song, but it shows that Naoya likes every girl body except Saki’s, but at the end of the day he likes Saki too. I wonder how much effort it took for the creator’s mind to create such a complicated plot.Character: 1/10Although I haven’t seen all of the characters, I am still rating them 1. Naoya is autistic, but somehow is good in school. Saki makes really funny mistakes and jokes that get me dying on the floor every single time. Its really sad how the only source of comedy is Saki and its not even funny. Nagisa just exist as a cute anime girl with a personality of a – cute anime girl, so : easily predictable character. But I know, that’s a rom-com there mustn't be any complicated characters, all of them must be dumb as a rock and have 2 feelings – happy and embarrassed. All of the characters that I have seen are pathetic and forgettable.Enjoyment: 2/10Some of the people that have watched these 4 episodes find it “so bad, that it is actually good”, it’s not. It is so bad that it is actually bad. I find it boring, because of the poorly made characters and a plot, that only relies on characters. So what happens when an anime relies on only ONE thing that is pretty bad, well, it fails to be an interesting series  for some viewers. But I can understand people that actually like this thing. If you like cute anime girls and cringy anime moments, this sh*t is for you.BUUUT, if you are someone like me, you know that this is just tragic. modern rom-com.

Kevin McCallister spends his Winter holiday evenings watching the noir movie ""Angels with Filthy Souls."" The fake film and its fake sequel are really funny mafia parodies; despite not originating from an actual movie, ""Merry Christmas, ya\' filthy animal"" is still an incredibly iconic movie line. Both of these sketches are short and sweet, with each sitting at under 2 minutes. I call them fake stories because they\'re clearly not meant to hold any narrative importance. The same goes for a sappy romance manga titled ""Go Sweet"" that Shirogane and...the gang read in ""Love is War."" All we know about the manga is that it resembles a bunch of common shoujo plotlines, but to our characters it\'s a bestselling series that made them tear up despite its generic tropes. It\'s just a fake story that allows the real story to create some hilarious parodies, like when the author reimagined ""Love is War"" as a melodramatic shoujo ai. Much like our world, it makes sense that fictional characters also have their own in-universe version of television and books. These are usually jokes built on generalizations of the genre being made fun of, be it grimy crime dramas or sappy YA romance. I\'m fond of fake stories, but mostly because they\'re fake. They aren\'t meant to be taken seriously, nor do they overstay their welcome.""Kanojo no Kanojo"" is what happens when one of these shitposts gets dragged out for a miserable 12 episodes.This piece is spoiler-free, Tl;Dr below.Naoya gets the girl. Equal parts daft and earnest, he\'s been pursuing his childhood friend Saki for years. In the first year of high school she accepts his feelings, and the two start out on their adorkable relationship. He\'s still as infatuated with his longtime crush as he\'s ever been, she\'s smitten by his sheer earnestness. The pair share a funny chemistry, thanks to comic misunderstandings and exaggerated declarations of love for one another. It\'d be fun to see a story of these getting worked-up over every tiny thing in their blossoming relationship.Kanokano is not that story. Heck, just calling it a story at all would be a stretch.Out of the blue, a blue-haired first-year decides to ask MC out, in typical anime fashion. A girl whom this guy has no prior knowledge of just shoots her shot. Sure, she worked up the courage to confess for several months, but what would he know. He\'s content and attached to his first and only love.Naturally, he says yes.What follows is an absolute trainwreck. Rather than find himself having to choose between one girl and the other, MC decides to date both in a two-timing relationship. And as proof of his ""TRuE l0Ve,"" he tells an enraged Saki of his horny intentions to start a high-school harem. That\'s right, he cucks both of his girlfriends openly. Now, there\'s nothing wrong with adults consenting to an open courtship with more than two people, but nothing about this weak-willed excuse of a MC screams ""loyal"" or ""mature,"" given how quickly he fell head-over-heels over a stranger he just met. And to top it all off, the threesome moves into MC\'s home to live happily ever after, unsupervised and underage. Kanokano is all about the resultant polygamy, and the sheer idiocy that allowed it to occur.Before discussing this abominable harem, we must direct our attention to our Harem Lord. In the past I\'ve been harsh towards male protagonists with zero personality, but I\'d prefer any number of them over this mess of a character. Naoya Mukai is quite easily the worst lead character in all of fiction; or, at the very least, the worst protagonist I\'ve had the displeasure of coming across thus far. I really wish I was merely drumming up exaggerated anger for the sake of publishing a heated review, but he is genuinely revolting. At first glance, Naoya appears to be a perpetual loser who demonstrates his undying love with big romantic gestures. But really, the guy is a toxic manipulator who constantly gaslights those around him in order to fulfill his horny desires. He comically misunderstands the babes surrounding him and twists their words, with an idiocy so unfiltered that girls end up second-guessing themselves. Naoya is what happens when you cross the Machiavellian tendencies of a Gen-Z Light Yagami with the selfish, pathetic guise of ToG\'s Rachel. Self-deprecation is often seen as a weakness or an undesirable flaw, yet Naoya leans into his worthlessness so hard that it miraculously becomes a strength. He shamelessly proclaims he\'s a two-timing scum, but only because he loves his girls both equally and endlessly. Suddenly, his unfaithfulness is seen as a prized rarity, and every female above the age of consent would throw themselves at him to be the sole recipient of such undying love. But surely sharing a chode amongst so many impressionable teenage girls is a ""hard"" task, in more ways than one! Getting into Naoya\'s bandwagon (and pants) becomes more difficult as the series progresses, because he needs to ""stay faithful"" to the girls already attached to him. However, MC playing hard-to-get just ends up being an excuse for entertaining the humiliating advances of the chicks around him. Forget any notion of this series navigating a taboo polygamous relationship in Japan; Kanokano is a show about a cult - one where a serial manipulator unabashedly tricks the world into falling in love with him.The cult of Kanokano is repulsive, but it\'s hard to feel sorry for the victims dumb enough to fall for MC\'s schemes. As an abridged mockery of the harem trope, each girl is defined primarily by their obsessive desires to win MC\'s heart. Character traits barely distinguish one empty husk of a character from the next; these idiots may as well be interchangeable target practice for Cupid\'s arrows. No one here is really in love with Naoya; rather, they crave only the idea of being the only one loved by him. Each girl steps outside of their comfort zones to ""out-love"" everyone else by catering to MC\'s fetishes. The end result? A clown fiesta of antics and grand gestures that rapidly decline in shock value. Forgoing sleep to profess love, camping in the cold outdoors as a pick-up strategy, bribing lovers with ""gacha"" rolls, getting aroused from NTR, putting on roleplay clothes in order to sleep with MC, and stripping down said clothes in order to sleep with MC - you get the perverted picture. It\'s the kind of immature bullshittery that\'ll make any reasonable soul call for a parent, if not for the fact that these parents are just as irredeemably shit as their insane offspring. Kanokano paints a nightmarish dystopia where society has regressed to the age of Neanderthals. Fathers and mothers don\'t just allow their little girls to play House with MC - they encourage it, praying that their respective child will be the one to claim Naoya\'s heart. This is a sick world so primitive that down-bad daughters attempt to make Sir Nice Guy shoot babies into them, while their irresponsible parents cheer their underage children on.With a fervor not seen since Thanos\' quest to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet, the nice guy Naoya hunts for babes to add to his trash waifu depository, with each new insipid addition more helplessly inept than the next. Redhead tsun tiddies. Loli-bait homemaker tiddies. Gyaru e-girl streamer tiddies. The list may as well stretch on and on, in turn tearing the fabric of realism as we know it. But let\'s not worry about fiction not being believable, that\'s not even the worst of our problems. The biggest issue with Kanokano is that it obliterates the very idea of love. This harem gives up dignity in exchange for dick, throwing themselves at a love as commonplace as it is disingenuous. Naoya could love anyone, which is why love loses all meaning. The goal of sharing an inseparable bond with a significant other gets utterly destroyed with the addition of countless ""others."" Love disappears, because love means nothing when it\'s freely handed out to every girl and my left foot. Romance is dead, and Kanokano has dealt the finishing blow.This rancid experience does come with its bright spots. Production-wise, Kanokano benefits from a rather pleasant job. It\'s baffling that such a travesty would follow an otherwise successful streak for Tezuka Productions, a studio fresh off works such as ""Dororo"" and 2020\'s phenomenal ""Adachi to Shimamura."" The latter show\'s chief director and head director bring the same quirky visual identity to Kanokano, with a comic-book aesthetic and pastel colors. The series is also capable of nailing comedic timing and visual jokes that embrace the absurdity on-screen. Voice actors are the liferaft for the sinking \'ship(s) of Kanokano. Lines are delivered (and often shouted) with the crazy conviction the script requires. These VAs absolutely sell their lines and do their utmost to elevate some incomprehensibly crap material. For all the garbage persistent throughout the series, Kanokano at least executes its ideas relatively well. But if you ask me, it\'s a bit like polishing a turd.If you made it this far, you may be wondering what my deal is. Kanokano is clearly a show that isn\'t meant to be taken seriously, so penning a roast about this steaming dumpster fire must be pointless. Well, if you\'re looking for an exercise in futility, look no further than Kanokano itself. The show is doing a parody, by taking the tropes associated with the harem formula and expanding on them, arriving in uncharted territory in the process. Kanokano is technically innovating here, but perhaps there is a good reason for why writers don\'t take things this ridiculously far. By pushing the harem trope to its extreme limits, Kanokano sacrifices all storytelling potential. It\'s nigh-impossible to see the show as anything other than an overly-long joke, because the show is so deliberately designed to be just that. Kanokano is not capable of grasping its own exercise in futility, because it\'s got its hands full groping its countless breasts instead. Let\'s not kid ourselves, no one here is watching Kanokano because of a well-developed cast or cohesive narrative. No, we watch Kanokano to laugh at how stupid it is. And honestly, that\'s really sad. Kanokano just isn\'t the kind of parody worth a full 5-hour runtime. All this colossal waste of space can offer are mind-numbing shenanigans. All this tasteless travesty can achieve is to rinse-and-repeat its toxic cycle of gaslighting and self-victimising. All this horrible harem can do is drown the audience out with noisy, over-the-top declarations of love that are as grand as they are empty. All this stupid series can muster is the vandalization of human romance, by stripping the concept of all importance. Much like the ""love"" the Kanokano cult share, all this story can amount to can be summed up in one word: ""Fake.""Stories and entertainment have always been things that I enjoy. I\'ve appreciated some really complex, profound works that have stuck with me. But I\'m not gonna sit here and pretend that I don\'t also treasure my fair share of simple pleasures, comedies and shitposts from time to time. Across all these pieces of media, I\'ve always felt that these things have added to my life in some way, be it big or small. But Kanokano is the first time I\'ve encountered a show that takes away. It\'s a show so dumb that I almost feel dumber just by sitting through it. If you\'re genuinely excited by any of the topics I\'ve discussed so far, I won\'t hinder you from welcoming this chronic brain rot with open arms. Comedy is as subjective as genres get, and what failed for me might work wonders for you. My goal is simply to stay true to my personal experience and serve as a cautionary tale for those tempted to give Kanokano a fair shot. I find that the first episode kinda tells you everything you need to know, with its stupid humor and absurd execution. Feel free to try out that episode out of morbid curiosity. Who knows, Kanokano could fall squarely into ""So Bad It\'s Good"" territory.***BEST GIRL: Nope.***Thanks for reaching the end with me. This one was particularly fun to put together, as if to numb the pain from sitting through this harrowing experience. ""I survived Kanokano."" Now there\'s a neat idea for a shirt.

Forgoing sleep to profess love, camping in the cold outdoors as a pick-up strategy, bribing lovers with ""gacha"" rolls, getting aroused from NTR, putting on roleplay clothes in order to sleep with MC, and stripping down said clothes in order to sleep with MC - you get the perverted picture. It\'s the kind of immature bullshittery that\'ll make any reasonable soul call for a parent, if not for the fact that these parents are just as irredeemably shit as their insane offspring. Kanokano paints a nightmarish dystopia where society has regressed to the age of Neanderthals. Fathers and mothers don\'t just allow their little girls to play House with MC - they encourage it, praying that their respective child will be the one to claim Naoya\'s heart. This is a sick world so primitive that down-bad daughters attempt to make Sir Nice Guy shoot babies into them, while their irresponsible parents cheer their underage children on.With a fervor not seen since Thanos\' quest to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet, the nice guy Naoya hunts for babes to add to his trash waifu depository, with each new insipid addition more helplessly inept than the next. Redhead tsun tiddies. Loli-bait homemaker tiddies. Gyaru e-girl streamer tiddies. The list may as well stretch on and on, in turn tearing the fabric of realism as we know it. But let\'s not worry about fiction not being believable, that\'s not even the worst of our problems. The biggest issue with Kanokano is that it obliterates the very idea of love. This harem gives up dignity in exchange for dick, throwing themselves at a love as commonplace as it is disingenuous. Naoya could love anyone, which is why love loses all meaning. The goal of sharing an inseparable bond with a significant other gets utterly destroyed with the addition of countless ""others."" Love disappears, because love means nothing when it\'s freely handed out to every girl and my left foot. Romance is dead, and Kanokano has dealt the finishing blow.This rancid experience does come with its bright spots. Production-wise, Kanokano benefits from a rather pleasant job. It\'s baffling that such a travesty would follow an otherwise successful streak for Tezuka Productions, a studio fresh off works such as ""Dororo"" and 2020\'s phenomenal ""Adachi to Shimamura."" The latter show\'s chief director and head director bring the same quirky visual identity to Kanokano, with a comic-book aesthetic and pastel colors. The series is also capable of nailing comedic timing and visual jokes that embrace the absurdity on-screen. Voice actors are the liferaft for the sinking \'ship(s) of Kanokano. Lines are delivered (and often shouted) with the crazy conviction the script requires. These VAs absolutely sell their lines and do their utmost to elevate some incomprehensibly crap material. For all the garbage persistent throughout the series, Kanokano at least executes its ideas relatively well. But if you ask me, it\'s a bit like polishing a turd.If you made it this far, you may be wondering what my deal is. Kanokano is clearly a show that isn\'t meant to be taken seriously, so penning a roast about this steaming dumpster fire must be pointless. Well, if you\'re looking for an exercise in futility, look no further than Kanokano itself. The show is doing a parody, by taking the tropes associated with the harem formula and expanding on them, arriving in uncharted territory in the process. Kanokano is technically innovating here, but perhaps there is a good reason for why writers don\'t take things this ridiculously far. By pushing the harem trope to its extreme limits, Kanokano sacrifices all storytelling potential. It\'s nigh-impossible to see the show as anything other than an overly-long joke, because the show is so deliberately designed to be just that. Kanokano is not capable of grasping its own exercise in futility, because it\'s got its hands full groping its countless breasts instead. Let\'s not kid ourselves, no one here is watching Kanokano because of a well-developed cast or cohesive narrative. No, we watch Kanokano to laugh at how stupid it is. And honestly, that\'s really sad. Kanokano just isn\'t the kind of parody worth a full 5-hour runtime. All this colossal waste of space can offer are mind-numbing shenanigans. All this tasteless travesty can achieve is to rinse-and-repeat its toxic cycle of gaslighting and self-victimising. All this horrible harem can do is drown the audience out with noisy, over-the-top declarations of love that are as grand as they are empty. All this stupid series can muster is the vandalization of human romance, by stripping the concept of all importance. Much like the ""love"" the Kanokano cult share, all this story can amount to can be summed up in one word: ""Fake.""Stories and entertainment have always been things that I enjoy. I\'ve appreciated some really complex, profound works that have stuck with me. But I\'m not gonna sit here and pretend that I don\'t also treasure my fair share of simple pleasures, comedies and shitposts from time to time. Across all these pieces of media, I\'ve always felt that these things have added to my life in some way, be it big or small. But Kanokano is the first time I\'ve encountered a show that takes away. It\'s a show so dumb that I almost feel dumber just by sitting through it. If you\'re genuinely excited by any of the topics I\'ve discussed so far, I won\'t hinder you from welcoming this chronic brain rot with open arms. Comedy is as subjective as genres get, and what failed for me might work wonders for you. My goal is simply to stay true to my personal experience and serve as a cautionary tale for those tempted to give Kanokano a fair shot. I find that the first episode kinda tells you everything you need to know, with its stupid humor and absurd execution. Feel free to try out that episode out of morbid curiosity. Who knows, Kanokano could fall squarely into ""So Bad It\'s Good"" territory.***BEST GIRL: Nope.***Thanks for reaching the end with me. This one was particularly fun to put together, as if to numb the pain from sitting through this harrowing experience. ""I survived Kanokano."" Now there\'s a neat idea for a shirt. If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews for seasons past and present, peace~', 'Polygamy is a difficult subject. Animes prove this. Harem shows try to treat their romances with increasingly repetitive approaches and at the same time don\'t know what to do often when it comes to finishing a show. Authors and storyboard creators have the difficult task of concluding the story and convincing the audience at the same time. Kanojo mo Kanojo arrived bringing a very different form of love that exceeds a couple, putting on a relationship that, while seeming innovative and different, demonstrates how lostand desperate romance animes are these days.For those who don\'t know, ""polygamy"" is an emotional relationship in a group with...more than 2 people. This kind of thing is still a controversial debate, because it not only involves the group of people involved, but also the entire external society that expresses this relationship in a negative way most of the times. Usually, acceptance comes with difficulty, which is fair enough. In the show, after receiving a girl\'s confession, Naoya proposes to Nagisa a relationship between 3 people. Naoya had from the beginning of the story a fling with Sakisaki, while Nagisa would be his second girlfriend. Sakisaki, like every person who has a normal functioning head, refuses at first sight the awkward and uncomfortable situation. Hearing this proposal from her own boyfriend is like receiving a betrayal, even if it doesn\'t seem like it. Having to share a closed relationship with another person in this way is something that really needs patience and understanding. Even with this, Sakisaki accepts living with Naoya and Nagisa in this way.So far, the show looks cool, it\'s an idea that if it\'s put to good use, can cause interesting moments and messages, even with this distortion within what is meant by a harmonious relationship. The problem of Kanojo mo Kanojo is actually not this, but the progression of the show added to the difficult to follow coexistences during the episodes. At first, the anime tries to turn this perception into a difficult state until it is something the audience accepts as normal. But the show chose not to do that competently.In fact, much of what the show has done is leave in hyperbolic drama moments that are just absurd and wouldn\'t cause that much amazement (remember, this is a show that wants to try to make a relationship between three people natural). You don\'t need to see much of the anime to identify this. From a hug request to the involvement of a fourth person in the story (in this case, Mirika), the direction of the anime puts the most frivolous and the most absurd moments into pure bliss, as if they were something similar. The way the show approaches this causes outrage with those watching. Imagine you see Naoya hugging Nagisa in front of Sakisaki while she feels a euphoria because she thinks she is developing a fetish, or imagine being surprised by a girl dressed as a rabbit or a maid in front of you. These things are really seen as odd, but they have turned this kind of attempt to relate the characters in a way that hurts the show itself. Honestly, putting a background with green and purple colors to cause a character\'s astonishment is not amusing, but pathetic. More than pathetic, it is a laziness of the show to innovate. What was supposed to cause humor by what you are seeing, causes laughter by the absurd way the studio decided to do some scenes.And on the subject of innovation, Kanojo mo Kanojo is actually not a revolutionary anime, but an increasingly common cliché in manga, light novels and harem shows. One can see the increasingly bad trend of stories being poorly reworked and often concluded with contempt from the creator of the project himself. Without quoting spoilers of the endings of these manga, but ""Gotoubun no Hanayome"", ""Domestic na Kanojo"" and ""Bokuben"" were recent examples of adaptations that even having a conclusion did not please and in most cases caused a bad reception about the genre. When making a show of this kind, I imagine that the author needs to have the ability to conclude his work in a way that sparks interest in consuming other projects by him or the magazine he distributes, but unfortunately this does not happen. Kanojo mo Kanojo is not guilty of this trend, perhaps it was even the original idea of the show to be like this. But that doesn\'t take away from the responsibility to change the parameters of this demographic that is declining year after year.It\'s not like the whole show is flawed, particularly some episodes and scenes are cool to follow, but they can\'t sustain everything else. These isolated cases are like gold found in a desert. You will feel accomplished, but all you will notice around you is misery. The misery of this show is the limitations of a better contact with the viewer. For many times I realized that the anime, instead of trying to be more casual or even slice of life, it uncontrollably tries to use already repeated, banal and unnecessary subjects to extend and perhaps create more time with this awkward involvement. Whenever it has some drama regarding a character\'s insecurity, their breasts are one of the first factors to be told, or the girl being pretty, or even the relationship of it being a story where more than 2 people have a love involvement.Finally, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a disappointment, but a planned disappointment. You wouldn\'t expect anything good in a show that once again has ""Kanojo"" in its title (need I mention that this is getting more and more worrisome?), but at least I thought the humor and charm of the anime would be enough to withstand 12 episodes. Well, that\'s not what occurred. It\'s a show that has damaged itself and gone from ""innovative"" to just ""weird"". more than 2 people.

Just barely better than staring at a blank wall."", 'KanoKano is the definitive fulfilment of the harem romcom idea. For years I’ve waited for a romcom series with an MC who’s not afraid of women, embraces their advances and takes risks. Finally, after all this time I have one.While the above may seem hyperbolic, I can’t emphasise enough how much I love KanoKano. From episode one I was hooked. The waifus, humour, lack of traditional harem cliches and genuinely hilarious comedy made it one of the most enjoyable anime I’ve seen in a long time. For the entire season this has been the show I look towards the most weekly. It’s not for everyone....If you want character development, quality writing and all that other jazz, you won’t find it here. If you’re able to turn your brain off and realise not everything has to be Shakespearean, then you’ll love this.The cast is small, but very intimate. They don’t get fleshed out too much, but the character interactions are awesome. The chemistry between the main girls and the MC was an absolute joy to watch. It’s rare to have anime be actually funny. A lot of Japanese jokes tend to be cringe to me, but this show is one of the few that pulls it off. I think if you enjoyed the humour of Oresuki you’ll like this one.As I briefly touched on before, the main selling point for me is the fact that the MC actually embraces his role as a harem protag. So often in these types of shows you have guys like Issei from DxD who talk about how horny they are, yet run from girls or are afraid to touch them, kiss, etc. Naoya in this is the complete opposite. Remains extremely stoic and composed through pretty much everything, straight up asks his girlfriend if he can date another girl, etc. It was just a massive breath of fresh air and I really wish we would get more of these types of series. For some reason, many mangaka think boys are afraid of women as teenagers.The art is really nice in this show. I love the bright colour palette as well as the character designs. One of my favourites of the year both artistically and overall.KanoKano will probably end with a mediocre score on MAL, but that’s to be expected given people tend to think everything has to be extremely deep and that everything needs character development. Regardless, it’s an extremely enjoyable harem with loveable characters and great humour. Can’t recommend it enough.KanoKano gets 10 Metubers out of 10.

These anime can become successes and get praised by fans. Or they can become punching bags—a joke to the whole community. It would be easy to write off KanoKano as cringe, degenerate, and trash, as so many already have, but don’t be so hasty.Accusing Girlfriend, Girlfriend of being cringe is like saying Gintama isn’t historically accurate. You haven’t figured out something that isn’t obvious. Of course, it is cringy, degenerate, and trashy—harem...anime usually are. Most of them are testosterone-induced fantasies written by men. But they cover this fact with melodrama and superficial depth. KanoKano does not pretend—it digs deep into the recesses of your desires and pulls primal emotions kicking and screaming to the surface of your subconscious. It is like witnessing a violent car crash. You can’t help but gawk at it with morbid curiosity. Though it panders to harem fans with excessive fanservice, it works to bait unsuspecting viewers. To call KanoKano a “deconstruction” would be cliche. More accurately, it is a perversion of the harem genre that will appeal to those willing to read between the lines.Girlfriend, Girlfriend fully commits to being idiotic and humiliating to watch. It leans into the cringe, and that’s why it works. It’s easy to write it off as another crappy harem anime. The characters are archetypal, seemingly generic, and they make illogical decisions that conflict with their interests. Naoya wants to protect his girlfriend and give her unconditional love, yet he refuses to reject another girl and becomes a ‘two-timer’. Saki wants Naoya to herself and fears he might cheat on her, yet she allows him to date another girl as soon as he begs. Nagisa wants to advance her relationship with Naoya, but she insists on giving Saki a head start. This circle of painfully obvious miscommunication fuels both the plot and our frustrations with the characters.While I could pick apart the anime’s many flaws, like cinema sins, then pat myself on the back for being so above the latest trashy harem, that’d be doing it a disservice. I’m guilty of judging this anime before watching it—I called it garbage based on the trailer. Before avoiding it, you should take a look at every other harem anime and male-power-fantasy then ask yourself, isn't this the same tripe you’re used to, except amplified? I’m asking you to peek under the hood of this dumpster fire with me. There’s a method to the madness.One bold harem author asks, what would happen if everyone wins? Saki’s plight is all due to his intervention. She is the heroine in a seemingly average romantic comedy. All of a sudden, her ideal boyfriend proposes an idea—what if they date another girl? Though she detests the idea of competing for her boyfriend, she is fascinated. Saki expresses attraction for Nagisa in a way that insinuates she is bisexual. Doubtlessly, this explains why she finds an odd excitement in watching Naoya and Nagisa be romantic. These netorare moments are more self-aware than the banal cuckoldry in Domestic Girlfriend. Either girl has an objective; to seduce Naoya, but their fatal flaws prevent them from achieving their goals. Saki’s envy for Nagisa’s curvy body, bodacious breasts, and attentiveness stifles her self-confidence. She feels an innate sense that Naoya is rightfully hers. After all, Nagisa is a plus one who they may eject at any moment. Nagisa understands why Saki is defensive of Naoya. That’s why she supports her. Like a sister-wife! Saki finds herself in these precarious situations because of her naivety. She could easily dump both of them and date a woman instead. In her daily life, she presents as a confident, upstanding student. Behind closed doors, where she lives with boyfriend and girlfriend, her id manifests itself. Watching her personality unravel as the straight man to Naoya’s dense behavior never got tiring. Every joke increases in severity. All manner of sexual desire and insecurities crawl to the surface—creating some truly cringe-worthy moments. I loved every second of it.Nagisa is perhaps the most disturbing of the five characters. She has no backstory, no family, no friends, no aspirations aside from her boyfriend, and very little character depth. She is horny all the time, unconditionally in love with Naoya, masochistic and satisfied with being his side hoe. Her only ‘development (if you can call it that) involves coming to terms with her stupidity and reliance on Naoya for a purpose. If you imagine a cardboard cutout of the idealized anime waifu, you would see her face. She unconditionally loves you. She is willing to go along with anything you say. All harem anime present this fantasy—she is the final form. The author neither glorifies nor condemns it. He simply presents her unabashedly.Naoya, however, is attracted to these... qualities.Naoya grapples with being a societal pariah and maintaining his polyamorous relationship. His character arc isn’t about growing to love his girlfriends more because he already loves Saki and Nagisa unconditionally by the time they become a thruple. His growth is about overcoming shame. This shame is an intentional jab at fans of the harem genre—the humiliation of how society views his love of multiple people as deplorable behavior. People judge him with words like “Cheater” and “Two-timer”. We love the fantasy of having numerous people fall in love with us because it’s satisfying. In reality, it could never happen. You would be ripped apart by society if your fantasies were actualized. Naoya goes to incredible lengths to protect the secrecy of his scandalous relationship; he nearly pays a million yen to keep the truth hidden. At school, he and Saki pretend to be in a monogamous relationship while poor Nagisa sits alone. She sacrifices having a normal love life to be with Naoya: she avoids the shame potentially brought upon her partners if the truth came out through being stealthy. One of the primary sources of shame is Milika.Oh, how I loathed Milikia from the beginning. Although she shames Naoya for two-timing, everyone can tell she envies his girlfriends. She forces herself into the middle of Naoya, Saki, and Nagisa’s complex thruple. Even though they plead with her to just leave them alone, she refuses. It gets to the point where she literally camps outside of their home, waiting for Naoya to fall in love with her. No one in their right mind would think this is an ordinary way to win someone’s affection, but Milika is certainly not in her right mind. She is a fantasy version of a harem heroine cranked up to insanity. Her love for Naoya is obsessive to the point she stalks him. The truth is, this is the kind of girl who exists in harem anime. She inexplicably falls madly in love with a generic male protagonist; to any average person, this seems insane. In reality, the fantasy waifu who will chase after your heart could never exist healthily. The most comparable character I can think of is Yuno Gasai from Future Diary.Milika is a textbook narcissist. Her attempts to make Naoya fall for her are humiliating to observe. She’s so tragically unaware that not everyone is in love with her. She has a youtube channel entirely based around showing off her busty cleavage for her audience. And when asked what her favorite thing is, she says: “Myself!” Her vanity is one-dimensional, undeniably sexist, and hammered into the audience. The author intended for her to be cringeworthy. For me, it was a hilarious sight to behold.Last but not least is Shino, Saki’s best friend and the audience’s avatar. For the first ten episodes, she is a background character who is fooled by the thruple’s monogamous charade. She becomes curious about Saki’s taboo love life, hiding her true intentions with the thin veil of ‘concern for her friend’. Truthfully, she is just like us, a passive observer who peers at the car crash from the rearview mirror. Instead of driving away, she becomes swept into the tornado of lies and humiliation. Shino’s concern for Saki quickly becomes an obsession; she wants to know if the scandalous rumor is true: Is her friend truly perverse? Or has she been manipulated by her depraved boyfriend? Her concern quickly turns to obsession, even stalking. Watching her struggle to understand Naoya, Saki, and Nagisa’s love triangle is exciting because I see my old self in her: Bewildered but morbidly curious enough to prod further.I will admit, this anime kind of looks terrible. The best storyboards are ripped straight from the manga: such as the creatively framed cuckolding shots and innumerable over-the-top reaction faces. It’s a shame this subversive masterpiece got treated like dime-a-dozen harem trash. Girlfriend, Girlfriend is a genuinely ridiculous anime. But to me, it is fascinating as well. It appeals to the cynic within me. Though it does not have a deep story, it never failed to engage me. I was always able to laugh with it or at it. Still, it accomplishes something so subversive that it makes me wonder if the writers, artists, and actors were all in on the joke. anime usually are. Most of them are testosterone-induced fantasies written by men. But they cover this fact with melodrama and superficial depth.

Her only ‘development (if you can call it that) involves coming to terms with her stupidity and reliance on Naoya for a purpose. If you imagine a cardboard cutout of the idealized anime waifu, you would see her face. She unconditionally loves you. She is willing to go along with anything you say. All harem anime present this fantasy—she is the final form. The author neither glorifies nor condemns it. He simply presents her unabashedly.Naoya, however, is attracted to these... qualities.Naoya grapples with being a societal pariah and maintaining his polyamorous relationship. His character arc isn’t about growing to love his girlfriends more because he already loves Saki and Nagisa unconditionally by the time they become a thruple. His growth is about overcoming shame. This shame is an intentional jab at fans of the harem genre—the humiliation of how society views his love of multiple people as deplorable behavior. People judge him with words like “Cheater” and “Two-timer”. We love the fantasy of having numerous people fall in love with us because it’s satisfying. In reality, it could never happen. You would be ripped apart by society if your fantasies were actualized. Naoya goes to incredible lengths to protect the secrecy of his scandalous relationship; he nearly pays a million yen to keep the truth hidden. At school, he and Saki pretend to be in a monogamous relationship while poor Nagisa sits alone. She sacrifices having a normal love life to be with Naoya: she avoids the shame potentially brought upon her partners if the truth came out through being stealthy. One of the primary sources of shame is Milika.Oh, how I loathed Milikia from the beginning. Although she shames Naoya for two-timing, everyone can tell she envies his girlfriends. She forces herself into the middle of Naoya, Saki, and Nagisa’s complex thruple. Even though they plead with her to just leave them alone, she refuses. It gets to the point where she literally camps outside of their home, waiting for Naoya to fall in love with her. No one in their right mind would think this is an ordinary way to win someone’s affection, but Milika is certainly not in her right mind. She is a fantasy version of a harem heroine cranked up to insanity. Her love for Naoya is obsessive to the point she stalks him. The truth is, this is the kind of girl who exists in harem anime. She inexplicably falls madly in love with a generic male protagonist; to any average person, this seems insane. In reality, the fantasy waifu who will chase after your heart could never exist healthily. The most comparable character I can think of is Yuno Gasai from Future Diary.Milika is a textbook narcissist. Her attempts to make Naoya fall for her are humiliating to observe. She’s so tragically unaware that not everyone is in love with her. She has a youtube channel entirely based around showing off her busty cleavage for her audience. And when asked what her favorite thing is, she says: “Myself!” Her vanity is one-dimensional, undeniably sexist, and hammered into the audience. The author intended for her to be cringeworthy. For me, it was a hilarious sight to behold.Last but not least is Shino, Saki’s best friend and the audience’s avatar. For the first ten episodes, she is a background character who is fooled by the thruple’s monogamous charade. She becomes curious about Saki’s taboo love life, hiding her true intentions with the thin veil of ‘concern for her friend’. Truthfully, she is just like us, a passive observer who peers at the car crash from the rearview mirror. Instead of driving away, she becomes swept into the tornado of lies and humiliation. Shino’s concern for Saki quickly becomes an obsession; she wants to know if the scandalous rumor is true: Is her friend truly perverse? Or has she been manipulated by her depraved boyfriend? Her concern quickly turns to obsession, even stalking. Watching her struggle to understand Naoya, Saki, and Nagisa’s love triangle is exciting because I see my old self in her: Bewildered but morbidly curious enough to prod further.I will admit, this anime kind of looks terrible. The best storyboards are ripped straight from the manga: such as the creatively framed cuckolding shots and innumerable over-the-top reaction faces. It’s a shame this subversive masterpiece got treated like dime-a-dozen harem trash. Girlfriend, Girlfriend is a genuinely ridiculous anime. But to me, it is fascinating as well. It appeals to the cynic within me. Though it does not have a deep story, it never failed to engage me. I was always able to laugh with it or at it. Still, it accomplishes something so subversive that it makes me wonder if the writers, artists, and actors were all in on the joke."", ""GIRLFRIEND GIRLFRIEND (GFGF) DESERVES MORE LOVE.

What exactly is ""bad"" and what isn\'t is entirely up to you to decide by yourself. So why do most people think Kanojo mo Kanojo is bad? It\'s because of pretty much everything it has to offer. They don\'t like the characters and how over the top and stupid they are. They don\'t like how cringe the show becomes at times and how hard it could become to watch. It\'s exactly these...traits that make this anime so great in my opinion. It seems that there are a surprising amount of people that are not aware that this is a gag anime. Gag anime aren\'t really meant to be taken seriously they are meant to make you laugh. So is it really fair to rate a gag anime the same way you would rate a normal anime? That\'s why most of the criticism this anime gets actually ends up being some of its biggest strengths. The over the top characters and cringe moments only contribute to what this show is at heart: a gag anime.Art:10For a show to have good ""art"" it doesn\'t only need to actually look good it also needs to be unique and rememberable. It doesn\'t matter how good an anime looks if I feel like I have already seen it 10 times before I won\'t like it. Kanojo mo Kanojo definitely doesn\'t do that. Its art is rather simple but extremely unique. It\'s very colorful and never makes me bored at looking at the screen. Not only does the art looks good it also fits very well with the wacky nature of the anime. You can give Kyo-ani levels of art in this anime but I still think I would end up preferring this one.Sound:10Kanojo mo Kanojo\'s soundtrack is amazing. Much of it is very vibrant and fun and fits very well in the show. One particular track I liked was the one that played at the beginning of most of the episodes telling a quick recap of the last. It always got me ready for the craziness that is Kanojo mo Kanojo. Both the op and ed are phenomenal and some of my top picks for the best opening and ending of the summer season. One of the best parts of it all though is the voice acting. It helps exaggerate the jokes even more than even its parent manga never could. Overall this anime has all I could ever ask for in the sound department.Characters:10Now onto my favorite part and the favorite of many: The Characters. This anime has one of the best casts I have ever seen. Now I\'m not really a fan of harem anime in general and one key reason why is the protagonist. Most harem protagonists are devoid of any sort of personality and are too scared to actually take any action. Naoya the protagonist of this anime is anything but that. Naoya is an extremely straightforward and stupid person and will almost always say what\'s on his mind regardless of the situation. Most of the time this straightforward personality of his leads to rather comical scenarios involving him and his girlfriends. He is also honest to a fault and almost always tells the truth even if it would destroy his reputation. But on top of all, he deeply cares about his two girlfriends and isn\'t embarrassed at all to admit it. Unlike your average harem protagonist who is too embarrassed to even think about the thought of love. Naoya is probably the most unique harem protagonist I have ever seen and I\'m all for it. Besides the protagonist, there are four heroines. Saki is Naoya\'s childhood friend and first girlfriend. Saki is generally a very energetic and cheerful girl. She can also be kind of violent at times and usually punches Naoya when he is being stupid. In most anime, a girl assaulting the male lead would come off as annoying but not in this anime with its more comical tone. Also to be fair most of the time Naoya kind of deserves it. She is also pretty stupid herself and extremely forgetful at times. This personality of hers honestly makes many scenes of the anime a lot funnier and it wouldn\'t be the same with someone different. Saki honestly is the perfect character for this type of anime and my personal favorite one. Next is Nagisa Naoya\'s other girlfriend. Nagisa is generally a timid and kind girl. She also seems to have a talent for blackmailing people. Just like Naoya and Saki, she is very stupid. I am normally not a fan of characters like Nagisa because of their repetitiveness and lack of action. Nagisa however isn\'t afraid to take action to help win over Naoya and is generally pretty different from your average dandere. Next is up is Rika or ""Mirika"" as she is commonly referred to in the anime. An easy way I can describe her is you know ""Nino"" from ""The Quintessential Quintuplets"". Mirika is pretty much an improved version of her. Just like Nino, Mirika is a tsundere who isn\'t afraid to take action to win over affection. Both are very refreshing takes on a tsundere and pretty great characters in their own right. One thing people criticize Nino for in her own anime is that she is rather ""annoying"". Now Mirika isn\'t really any different but what is different is her setting. The Quintessential Quintuplets is a harem anime at heart and Kanojo mo Kanojo is a gag anime at heart. Mirika annoying antics at the end of the day only help the anime even more rather then dragging it down. Last but not least we have Shino. Now in all honestly I don\'t have too much to say about Shino as she has by far gotten the least screen time out of all the characters. But from what I have seen she is a pretty amazing character. Shino is the best friend of Saki and begins to follow Naoya around once she suspects that he is two-timing Saki. She is a very serious character which is honestly a nice contrast to how wacky this anime is. Overall I really really love these characters.Enjoyment: 11Anime\'s main purpose is for you to enjoy. I feel like most people have forgotten that the more anime they watch. Things like art and characters are only factors to our overall enjoyment at the end of the day. So did I enjoy this anime? Yeah. Out of the 27 different anime I watched this season this is the one that I enjoyed the most. This anime is also really funny like a gag anime is supposed to be if that wasn’t obvious yet. I\'m sure most people have also realized this by now but this anime really isn\'t meant to be taken seriously. You just have to relax and have fun. If you try and search this show for its flaws I’m sure you will find plenty. But I could honestly care less about them. All I know is that I really enjoyed this show and I\'m sad it\'s over.Overall 10/10I laughed a lot.I had lots of fun.Season 2 pls. traits that make this anime so great in my opinion.

When you read this description, how do you think this movie performed? Surely a box-office bomb, with horrible ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, reviews shitting on it left, right and center, and the producers wondering what could possibly have gone wrong right?Well, Sharknado proved everyone wrong. It racked up millions of views over the weeks following its initial screening, developed a cut following, and even garnered a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus stating “Proudly, shamelessly, and gloriously...brainless, Sharknado redefines \'so bad it\'s good\' for a new generation.""Why might I be bringing up Sharknado you ask? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Sharknado of anime and manga. Kanojo mo Kanojo. A series so over-the-top and shameless, that it truly redefines “so bad it’s good” for the anime community.

The one true god you should worship is Kanojo mo Kanojo.Unlike the previous shows I mentioned, Kanojo mo Kanojo goes all out in being as bad as it can be. I refuse to believe that this story was written with anything but shameless comedy and spoofing in mind, evident by the first episode. The ridiculous story and characters, excessive transitions, sound effects, corny responses, typical rom-com ecchi gag parodies, shocked expressions with vividly animated backgrounds, parodies of the entire Louvre collection on rom-com OSTs (I think we went through maybe 20 or so distinct OSTs/background tracks in every episode), and to top it all off with a cherry on top, voice acting that’s brimming with gusto, is all a testament to how this show sees itself. Considering all intents and purposes, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a certified masterpiece in that aspect: it holds nothing back in its journey to exceed the expectations you’d have of a degenerate spoof series.And it only gets worse (or I should say better) as the series rolls on. We’ve seen beta males, alpha males, sigma males, but none can match up to the oxymoron Naoya who is both a beta simp and giga chad existing in the same mortal body. This four-time champion does it all. The ridiculous designs and sheer stupidity of the four girls deciding to enter a polygamous relationship is also a daunting feature to stomach as an average anime viewer. Saki, Nagisa, Rika, Shino. Etch those names into your heart for they will be remembered for years to come. The animation, while popping and vibrant, is inconsistent in quality especially during wider-angle shots; however, this is but a small blemish on a masterpiece of a show.The sheer power and volume of comedy in this anime is so strong, that it rivals the laughs and tears I’ve gotten out of Grand Blue and Asobi Asobase (although more often than not out of stupidity than authentic comedy). Hell, I’m confident that even if you went into this show with a serious attempt at critiquing it or trying to enjoy it, that mentality would instantly be shattered and you would come to realise Kanojo mo Kanojo for what it truly is: the pariah of bad anime, the Domestic Girlfriend of Domestic Girlfriends, the messiah we pleb weebs have been awaiting to save us from isekai purgatory and show us the true potential of anime.This will definitely be one of the hottest takes this season, and I’m fully ready to accept whatever comes my way. But I will stay strong in my beliefs.

The first episode is somewhat funny, but the joke gets old really fast. It ain\'t great.Do I seriously need to write more to publish this? It\'s just another mediocre romcom, can\'t say much about it. I would like it more if it really tried to show polyamorous relationships in a more serious light, focusing on what it is, and what problems people in them are facing. I don\'t really hate it, but it\'s just another harem anime, filled with fanservice of underage girls.That whole two-timing is just a poor excuse to make unfunny jokes,...and of course, bring every character under the same roof.

If you\'ve ever watched or read Aho Girl some years back and thought that it was obscenely weird, this show at least matches the comedy levels of Mangaka-san to Assistant-san, but better in every way imaginable. BTW, those works I\'ve mentioned are all from the same author that is Hiroyuki, best known for the creation of many Doujinshi based on the Type-Moon visual novels Tsukihime and Fate/stay night. This man of culture is simply a genius at knowing...how to create works worth simping for, and Kanojo mo Kanojo may be the best peak trash work he\'s ever done. Sanity check? Nah, why the hell not?Kanojo mo Kanojo a.k.a Girlfriend, Girlfriend is a ""so bad it\'s good"" of a trash rom-com harem manga, but I\'d not think to see that with the anime, it basically levelled up the cringe by a substantial amount, and that IMO, it actually made the anime adaptation the superior version of the manga. Talk about some good ol\' wine brewing of gag comedy that\'s just waiting to elevate its taste to cater to us, the trash-loving audience who appreciates that anime can not be taken seriously and just serviced to have a good time. Also, don\'t try to douse the serious watcher with ""anime logic"", if you\'re thinking of that while watching this show, then it\'s clearly not geared towards your taste. Anime can be made intentionally dumb, and Kanojo mo Kanojo is one of the better AniManga ""guilty pleasure"" work that dumbs down on that dumbness to give everyone laughs, one that\'s not of joking levels of satire nor trolling.That said though, I\'m seriously and genuinely thankful that in such a dry and paltry season as Summer 2021 can be, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a breath of fresh air just for the one thing that is missing: some dank comedy for potential memes. Otome Game being the same but less funny, Uramichi Oniisan being a hit-and-miss dark comedy, while this show just puts a tongue-in-cheek smile on my face with each passing episode that raises its rediculousness to levels of insanity from a simple concept such as a boy-and-girl relationship. Because if 2019\'s Domestic na Kanojo (a.k.a Domestic Grlfriend) hasn\'t made the point that two-timing in a relationship can be done, and 2020\'s Kanojo, Okarishimasu. (a.k.a Rent-A-Girlfriend) bringing the point about girls chasing after the MC while he chases after the main girl, Kanojo mo Kanojo will indefnitely strap you on the chair to make sure of the fact that the immoral combination of these 2 shows into one concept is a reality that you cannot unsee. And that your pair of eyes are tainted forever to be trained to watch more wack, trashy shows.SO... *clap* some teaching time! You need to distinguish what\'s the difference between polygamy and polyamory. Polygamy is the marriage of multiple partners, while polyamory is the relationship version of that, and that easily sums up the MC of this series: Naoya Mukai. Him and his childhood friend Saki Saki get together in the usual, typical relationship process, but another girl by the name of Nagisa Minase seeks him out to confess to him, and lo and behold, the chad does the impossible: to have a two-timing relationship of a love triangle between him, Saki and Nagisa. On that account, there are 2 more girls that will eventually come after Naoya\'s ass (Rika Hoshizaki who goes by her MeTuber alias ""Milika"", and Sakisaki\'s best friend Shino Kiryu), but at this point, Naoya is hell bent on just being comfortable with the current love triangle, while both girls Saki and Nagisa often compromising for each other so that they get what they wished for. All the hijinks and shenanigans that you\'ve ever come across when watching harems and rom-coms are presented here, and the best part is that Naoya is being shameless and proud AF like a boy who\'s down for the horny aspect, but at least has a heart that\'s for the pure dedication of the polyamoric status just for the two-timing situation. Also, he likes bananas, just like Aho Girl\'s Akuru ""A-kun"" Akutsu.That\'s not to say that the 4 centre girls had nothing going for them though. Not counting for the LOLS that all 5 of them could make an inherent reference being Super (Hentai) Sentai characters (like in Dokyuu Hentai HxEros a.k.a Super HxEros), it\'s be best to categorize all 4 girls as such: Saki is the red-ribboned, most stupid, gullible and easily NTR\'ed if cheated on; Nagisa is the blue-ribboned sweet and charming classmate that has some degree of boobs that a tad bigger than Saki\'s; Rika is purely the yellow-ribboned vlogger and stalker who can\'t for the life of all, give up the ""love of her life"" from being shown the light like Naoya\'s her Jesus-kun; and Shino the purple-ribboned, confused AF looking girl whom is a lot hard-headed about what a typiccal relationship is, and questioning Naoya about Saki being potentially cheated on. A bit of a spoiler alert that all 4 of them would fall for Naoya a few heads in the manga where the anime ended thereafter, and this only makes the equation more fulfilling for more blushes and comedic banter of a polyamory relationship that\'s filled with idiocies across the board. And that\'s all you need to grasp of this ""Love is War"" rhethoric that\'s different from Kaguya-sama.On the production side, Tezuka Productions has seen better days, and it\'s a small comeback for real. Let\'s be real here: last season\'s co-produced Isekai Maou sequel was a return on the action side of things, and that felt like it was a haphazard move on delivering a somewhat lower quality show that the studio just couldn\'t get right. So, what to do? In-house director Satoshi Kuwahara takes what is good about that and dumps that into here, which I feel that the execution is much more palatable and better suited overall to provide better gag comedic sequences. Together with another in-house series composer Keiichirou Oochi, the studio itself is in good hands delivering slice-of-life and light-hearted shows at its best. It\'s no wonder Gotoubun no Hanayome a.k.a The Quintessential Quintuplets and Adachi to Shimamura have somewhat similar vibes to deliver a softer palette to squeeze every bit of eye-catching visuals that looking aesthetically pleasing.Also, the OST for this show is quite the catchy one. I\'m a sucker for peppy songs that sound like they have a resounding beat to it overall, and both the OP and ED delivered on that promise to add to an already guilty pleasure of a show. Can I just say that for the OP, the visuals represent a lot of triangles, but even hint at the Fibonacci ""Golden Ratio"", which is the most beautiful number in the universe. This gives the fact that no matter how Naoya may be stressed up at picking which girl (or girls in this case) to date, there is not just one single catch that these 4 girls are unique of, and each of them are worth dating in that right. The ED itself is no different from illustrating the childish frustrations and fanservice of the 4 girls towards Naoya in the classic rom-com style, and I like these kind of creative touches. So good.When all is said and done, Kanojo mo Kanojo raises the bar for the unspoken ""whack, trash perception"" genre of anime by a hair, and it\'s very indicative of a show where it just presents you with never-ending amounts of silliness and jokes it like to repeat, and it never once gets stale. Thank you Hiroyuki for creating this manga and Tezuka Productions for translating the adaptation onto the small screen, my life is so much happier now that we can fulfill our wet dreams of being like chad Naoya to attain that polyamory relationship with a strong will. So joke away and be shameless about having lots of mistresses like something out of a Hentai plot, because one day you might end up like Naoya for wish fulfillment reasons. Definitely reommended if you want to experience something fictional that you can almost never experience in real life. how to create works worth simping for, and Kanojo mo Kanojo may be the best peak trash work he\'s ever done.

'Average Japanese school boy getting a harem' - doesn't sound too inspiring, but as it turned out you don't need to make insanely original premise for a work of fiction to be enjoyable.So, this anime turned out to be really well made and this is why:1) Humor is on point as it's not too trashy and not too boring - perfect balance. It's a bit on a 'weeby' side with its fan service and Japanese culture. But it still should be pretty watchable for normie people.2) This anime is easy to...watch. It's 'believable' and characters feel alive. It's not some obscure stuff which could be hard to follow.3) Art and sound - all good, no eye piercing CGI. Picture has unique art style and nice color palette.4) Pacing of the story feels good. The episodes don't feel rushed or slow.Conclusion:If you want to watch something nice then this is the choice of the season. 10/10 anime, its only problem is that we will never see its characters become adults, as I have a feeling it would have transformed from romcom to drama *real quick* watch.

I went into this show without knowing anything about it and enjoyed it immensely. This is a hilarious anime about a man that does his best to make the girls he cares about happy.If I was to describe what really make this show great it would be the characters. The ridiculous premise definitely helps, but really it's the characters that do a fantastic job of taking that premise and maximizing the comedy. The characters all look great, are very well voice acted, and have great interactions with each other. Even the main male character added a lot to the show by...being a very atypical protagonist for this type of show. He's a man that knows what's important to him and fights to protect it regardless of conventional morals and without concern about how other people would view it.Throughout this entire show I was never bored and often could not completely predict what was going to happen next. There is so much creativity and hilarity in this show that I was thoroughly entertained and laughing the whole time. Kanojo mo Kanojo is my favorite show of the season and I hope more people give the show a chance. being a very atypical protagonist for this type of show.

BUT I ACTUALLY LOVED THIS SHOW!The show is given a bad rep becuz of the fact that it is cringe. I think that this show's main appeal is that it's cringe and it is fine to be cringe. I bet tons of people treat this show as a typical romcom or a story focused anime, but in fact I would recommend this show to watch as a purely comedic show, emphasizing on the comedy and ignore all the other details.I get that this show is by no means a masterpiece of a series, but in my heart all the things that...I've experienced so far, it is just PURE gold. Story is 10 if you don't think about it too much, art is impeccable to say the least, the op and ed slaps HARD.My character rating might be controversial because it is.

I will not lose another to the void. I will not have him saying to me, “hey [redacted]? I watched Domestic Girlfriend.” If that happens I think it’s just time to put him down.

Not at allFollowing in the footsteps of the new trash kanojo / girlfriend series (Domestic Girlfriend and Rent a Girlfriend), Girlfriend Girlfriend is here to refill the box of trash shows that are stupidly funny and enjoyable. At first, it sounds dumb; “Why would I watch a show where a dude gets 2 girls and actively two times them?” but once you turn on this, you won’t be disappointed (unless you are expecting a good anime).Plot is simple. Saki Saki a childhood friend of Naoya...because his girlfriend after 10 years. They are the most lovey dovey couple ever,  expressing their love in the public. Though, a classmate called Nagisa Minase has skipped school for months to perfect herself to confess to Naoya. One afternoon she calls Naoya up until the rooftop, and confess her love, and Naoya cannot refuse it. So he goes full insane strats and accepts the confession on the terms that she’ll have Saki Saki still be Naoya’s Girlfriend. She accepts, and the wacky romcom starts. There are some genuine funny and stupid moments in this show, it’s amazing. 9/10I especially like the art style in this show, it’s quite basic but it does everything what it provides without any issues, exactly what a Slice of Life show should be like that isn’t made by KyoAni should be. The characters look cute, and it does a pretty good job of expressing the emotions felt by the characters, because without it the show wouldn’t feel right. 8/10This show would be not the same without the chaotic nature of the characters. You have Saki Saki (which reminds me of Tsukasa from Tonikawa) with a cheerful yet tsundere-tropey character, which makes the sillier scenes much more chaotic, which only adds to the fun. Then you have Minase Nagisa, a quiet yet bubbly character who will help out Naoya or even Saki at no matter what cost. Then Naoya is a straightforward person who will just speak whatever he has on his head, which creates most of the problems of the plot, which is both silly yet enjoyable. The balance of characters in this show help it be the stupid funny show this is. 9/10The OST fits, but like with many seasonals, it falls under the forgettable side. I personally do like the OP and especially the ED with pinky hook (one of my most played anime songs), as they both fit the chaotic and the energetic nature of the anime. 8/10There is so much enjoyment to this show, even outside of the anime itself. The amount of times I have to looks at my surroundings just incase someone is disgustedly watching this from the shadows is more times then I would admit, but honestly it just adds to the fun. But back to the anime, this is just a pleasure to watch something so outlandish and creative yet silly. This is by far the best out of the trilogy of Kanojo (Rent a GF was great tho was far from the stupidity of this, and Domestic GF was just so spicy for me at times), so if you like any of the other two, I highly recommend it. 9/10. because his girlfriend after 10 years.

The characters look cute, and it does a pretty good job of expressing the emotions felt by the characters, because without it the show wouldn’t feel right. 8/10This show would be not the same without the chaotic nature of the characters. You have Saki Saki (which reminds me of Tsukasa from Tonikawa) with a cheerful yet tsundere-tropey character, which makes the sillier scenes much more chaotic, which only adds to the fun. Then you have Minase Nagisa, a quiet yet bubbly character who will help out Naoya or even Saki at no matter what cost. Then Naoya is a straightforward person who will just speak whatever he has on his head, which creates most of the problems of the plot, which is both silly yet enjoyable. The balance of characters in this show help it be the stupid funny show this is. 9/10The OST fits, but like with many seasonals, it falls under the forgettable side. I personally do like the OP and especially the ED with pinky hook (one of my most played anime songs), as they both fit the chaotic and the energetic nature of the anime. 8/10There is so much enjoyment to this show, even outside of the anime itself. The amount of times I have to looks at my surroundings just incase someone is disgustedly watching this from the shadows is more times then I would admit, but honestly it just adds to the fun. But back to the anime, this is just a pleasure to watch something so outlandish and creative yet silly. This is by far the best out of the trilogy of Kanojo (Rent a GF was great tho was far from the stupidity of this, and Domestic GF was just so spicy for me at times), so if you like any of the other two, I highly recommend it. 9/10.', 'After reading some of the reviews for this show, I had a general impression on what it’s basic concept was. And basic is all I thought it to be, however I decided to give it a chance since I can appreciate even the most standard of plots (easy to please). Girlfriend Girlfriend ended up being everything I thought it would be and everything I didn’t. Honestly though, I can\'t believe some of the other reviewers on this site had a bad impression, since, for me, this show is fantastic. It’s difficult to put into words but I’ll try. Girlfriend Girlfriend, I’ll just call it Gf...Gf, surprised me with their approach to “Harem”. I’ve seen plenty shows like what I thought this show to be, raunchy and absurd with plenty of fan service. But what jumped out at me most was the surprising lack of raunchy and absurd, and the little to no fan service. To make things better, I laughed harder at this show and the situations the characters found themselves in, then I have any other shows in awhile. Needless to say, Gf Gf has a unique take on an unoriginal idea.The idea of the show is the main character is dating someone he’s been friends with since childhood and finally gets the guts to ask her out. Soon after they start dating another very dedicated girl decides to confess her feelings to him and thus he has not one but two girlfriends, hi-jinx ensue. Now, I’ve had my eye on this show but thought it worth waiting until the dub released. Am I glad I didn’t wait though. I believe the Japanese voice acting really sends the comedy and scenarios home to comedy heaven. English doesn’t quite give off the same aggressive tone that this type of show requires and I doubt it would be as funny if dubbed. It’s rare I say this since I usually prefer dub, but I\'m not exclusive to it.I foresaw a generic ""harem"" comedy/drama with a name like Gf Gf, but instead got an intriguing comedy with unique characters and completely reasonable dilemmas. There are some short comings but needless to say, this show is entertaining and is definitely worth watching if you can get past its unrealistic concept. I had a blast with each episode and honestly love all the characters involved. The central boyfriend Naoya is what creates this abundance of humor in my opinion, but both girlfriends keep up with him and his ridiculousness in their own unique and individual way. I honestly was so surprised at how well this show handled what I thought to be a mundane and boring concept.The characters by far make this show, not the setting. Although it’s premise is what gives the show its name, it’s the unique qualities of each character that make the show worth watching. And again, the voice acting is top notch here. The protagonist and both girlfriends are all funny and endearing, and equally so. I usually dislike all characters involved in this genre, and just watch for the premise, so to have a show come along and flip that on its head is a welcome deviation.The show probably would have lost me had Naoya been a womanizer, a smug jerk, or a lucky idiot. Though he is lucky and an idiot, he still is very considerate and is clearly grateful for the wonderful situation he\'s in. It\'s that reason other women enter the picture at all. It\'s not his luck, but his caring personality that allows for the other women in the show to trust him or be fond of him. He\'s special in his own way, and definitely makes for good humor, but it\'s his red headed girlfriend, Saki Saki, that hits it out of the park.What I appreciate most about Saki is that she tends to be the only other character to match the boyfriends energy. It\'s almost like she is so dedicated to the relationship that she responds to every ridiculous thing Naoya throws at her and takes it in stride, relatively speaking...there are a few breakdown moments I suppose. Even with the introduction of the blue haired girlfriend, Nagisa, Saki takes it much better than most women would. I believe half is due to her similarities to the boyfriend, he couldn\'t tell Nagisa no and neither can she. More importantly, the other half is her taking this on as a challenge or attempting to hit it head on...though this is all just my perception of events. Seeing Saki\'s direct response to everything really made the show for me. One scene in particular is in the beginning of the first episode, Naoya ends up overthinking Saki\'s reasoning for going home alone. He consistently speaks very loudly and direct, almost aggressive but non-threatening (this is just a staple of his personality). He begins to think she worries about him cheating on her, and though she obviously doesn\'t, still insists on confessing loudly how she is the only girl for him. Embarrassed and taken aback, Saki ends up responding with passion and energy, similar to his, to show her love and trust back. I\'m not sure why, but I found this whole scene hilarious and endearing. It\'s almost like she is proud to be able to respond to such ridiculousness without getting embarrassed, which I agree is a feat considering how Naoya is.Saki isn\'t the only unique character though. Nagisa is very sweet and entertaining to watch navigate this new world she\'s in. Though she\'s not as funny, she\'s able to bring comfort and meaning to most scenes that would\'ve otherwise felt erratic or disconnected. It\'s her existence in general that allows this show to exist so she is also a welcomed member of the trio. Other characters are great for moving the plot forward or adding a different flavor to an episode, but it\'s the trio that really push it over the line to ""good show"".One thought I always have with shows or movies like this is “This could never happen in real life.” And this thought process holds true for Gf Gf as well, yet somehow it feels believable. I’m not sure what that golden essence is that drives the semi-real factor. It’s definitely not the the shows premise, since having two girlfriends with both of them knowing about one another is up there in the most unreal of situations men could find themselves in. One girlfriend is difficult enough in my opinion. I suppose the conversations they have amongst each other are what define the show best. I’ve not personally dated and lived with two girls at once, but I imagine it would play out similar to how it does in the show.As for the content itself, I can easily say that all of the episodes have been fun and hilarious. To me, it’s not just cheap laughs. The characters personalities are so fun and unique. Each individual in their own way. I can safely say I would hang out with these guys if they were real. Likeable, selfless, and unique... that\'s generally the type of person I appreciate.As I mentioned before, I had thought of Gf Gf differently before seeing it. I figured it would be full of fan service, lack any direction, and be your everyday harem where the main character was loved by all. After all, that’s how life works right? One completely unappealing guy ends up being the object of every girl’s desire...of course not! Most harem scenarios are completely unrealistic and don’t mirror real life in anyway. That’s where gf gf veers from the norm, so much so I hesitate even calling it a harem. The protagonist finds himself in a seemingly real situation where he likes two girls and can’t decide who is better, I’ve even been in this situation. Where it ends up departing from the norm however is when he is able to convince both girls to date him AND live with him immediately. As unrealistic as that is, this show is still able to grab your attention and warrant reasonability from the viewer, though I’m not sure how.I can’t praise this show enough and can easily say that I enjoyed the entire season thoroughly...well, I suppose the finale could have been better maybe. Either way, it goes to show you that unrealistic scenarios can be made to feel real, and fan service doesn’t always make the show better or more appealing...though I still can appreciate it most of the time. I strongly recommend giving this show a shot, don\'t take everyone else\'s word for it, decide for yourself. Gf, surprised me with their approach to “Harem”. I’ve seen plenty shows like what I thought this show to be, raunchy and absurd with plenty of fan service.

There are moments that are so outright braindead that you just have to laugh. I don't really want to restate the other reviews because they are pretty good so I'll provide a list of pros and cons after I review the characters. The plot is simple and it's on the front page so I need not provide my thoughts on it except its satire (obviously). In any case, I enjoyed Minase and Sakisaki, and they were both quite enjoyable to watch as...the main love interests for the first season. It was downright confusing why Minase is going so far until the last two episodes which was kinda annoying because I had no idea why is so, so obssesed but in a satire anime I decided that plot holes were simply for the sake of convenience and should be disregarded. The show was really funny early on and functioned mostly as a comedy, which is where it's strength really is. However, in the last 2-3 episodes, it starts to delve more into the romance element, which I didn't really like. Because ultimately, you just feel bad for the girls as they are all losing. No matter if naoya two times, three times, four times, or whatever; in reality, they are all losers. Anybody with a brain knows that you really can't find TRUE love in a polygamous relationship which is why it was frustrating to see a show that was supposed to be a joke try and take on a more serious tone. By the looks of the end of season one and skimming over the manga, it seems like that is going to be a trend heading into season two. I'll watch season two because I like the comedy and think it's fun regardless. Anyways, if you are looking for pure, cute, wholesome romance, steer far clear. But if you are willing to try a trashy but unique romcom without getting hung up over the pure stupidity of the show, give it a chance. 7/10 the main love interests for the first season.

The characters are teenagers if you couldn't guess it by now they know what is right and wrong but they most often do not know WHY(this prolly why your little critter is a rebel).it is only experiences that teach them why what is wrong is that way , so yeah they will understand eventually why two timing is not gonna cut it and at that time(at least i hope so ) we will get proper character development and the “romance” genre in this title will be justified.IF you want to dive in, go for the comedy part in this anime. It surely does not disappoint by all means , the characters being as quirky as they are and the beautiful voice acting of saki (personal opinion) will have you hooked . and ofc I won't need address my harem brethren( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) yes the harem is good and you don't need to worry about your girl losing (absolute win). The first episode was very strong and funny with the following being relatively good as well .as for the part of morality i agree two timing is bad but if you ask the same to a middle east guy he may not strongly agree , you are watching a japanese show with a western ideology then you are at loss and most likely will not be able to adapt to your ”dream tour to tokyo ” dues to cultural differencesTurn off your moral compass and logic sensor and you are sure to enjoy this if you can't give at least the first episode a shot and see if this is tolerable enough for you. straight , so kindly do not force your logic upon them .kanojomokanojo is just a fun parody of harem in my opinion in which all the girls win and that basically means the MC will always lose xD.

With that we have: Kanojo mo Kanojo …Story.The series follows Naoya Mukai, who had recently begun a relationship with his childhood friend Saki Saki. Nagisa Minase, his classmate of her, decides...to confess her feelings of her to him as well where he accepts. Naoya decides that he will have both Saki and Nagisa as girlfriends at the SAME TIME. As Naoya currently lives ALONE, Saki and Nagisa decide to LIVE WITH HIM. The series follows as Naoya, Saki, and Nagisa experience difficulties and challenges in maintaining their love triangle relationship ...Yes, adult movie premise. From there draw your own conclusions.Characters.Saki: She is the only one with a bit of common sense in a world of crazy people and making jokes about the affairs of the situations. Oh right and she is a little pervert: Besto Waifu.Nagisa: A woman with VERY low self-esteem who is madly in love with the protagonist.Rika: Fanservice with legs. If you want to see how the OTAKUS imagine as a woman, supposedly, chase a man,  just look at her ... Laughter assured.Shino: He has no personality or appearances or anything .We only know that she is saki\'s best friend, best Waifu too?Naoya: Oh God, this man! I had never seen anything like him in an anime ""Romantic Comedy Harem"". This man knows that 3 beautiful women love him to death and, as said in the series, just by asking they will do whatever hi want (Yes, that\'s right), but he doesn\'t alter. When they MOVE in with him ALONE in his house and even sleep next to each other he does not alter ... But is this guy a high school student or buddha himself?Art.Fairly average, with scenes and shots that simply highlight the little budget and time that the series had.Entertainment.There are basically 2 jokes:1- The typical sexual misunderstandings, which can make you laugh at the first 3 times ... but when it\'s the whole series... maybe not ...2- OH GOD, WHY DID YOU DO THAT? WHAT\'S HAPPENING TO YOU, DO NOT FOOL ME !!!!. DON\'T YELL WHAT HAPPENS ON THE SCREEN, BAKA. !!!! TRY NOT TO THINK OUT LOUD !!! STOP SAYING WE ARE A COUPLE, DAISKI !!!So in  the series, a good part of this script seemed to be composed of capital letters and exclamation marks.Conclusion.It is an anime that can be used to pass the time. It does not formulate anything new, jokes wear out fast and little or no character development.I would recommend it only for the designs of the characters and the opening.

Solo sabemos que es la mejor amiga de Saki ¿besto Waifu también?Naoya: ¡Oh Dios, este hombre! Nunca había visto algo parecido en un anime “Comedia-Romantica Harem”. Este hombre sabe que 3 hermosas mujeres lo aman hasta la muerte y, dicho en la serie, solo con pedirlo ellas harán lo que ""sea"" -si, se malpensado- , pero él ni se inmuta. Cuando  se ""mudan"" con él  estando ""solo"" y, incluso, duermen al lado del otro ""ni se inmuta""… Pero ¡¿esté tipo es un estudiante de secundaria o el mismísimo Buda?!Arte.Bastante promedio, con escenas y planos que simplemente ponen a relucir el poco presupuesto y tiempo que tuvo la serie.Entretenimiento.Básicamente hay 2 chistes:1- Los típicos malentendidos sexuales, que pueden hacer reír las primeras 3 veces… pero cuando es toda la serie quizás no…2- ""OH DIOS, ¿POR QUE HICISTE ESO? ¡¡¡¡QUE TE PASA NO ME ENGAÑES!!!!. ¡¡¡¡NO GRITES LO QUE SUCEDE EN PANTALLA, BAKA.!!!! ¡¡¡¡INTENTA NO PENSAR EN VOZ ALTA!!!  ¡¡¡DEJA DE DECIR QUE SOMOS PAREJA, DAISKI!!! ""Así toda la serie, buena parte de este  guion  parecía estar compuesto  por letras mayúsculas y signos de exclamación.Conclusión.Es un anime que puede servir para pasar el rato.

Nada más.Espero te haya servido.', ""Remember when harem anime used to be memorable? Anime like High School DxD and The Familiar of Zero established a fanbase and continues to this day. In recent years, we had an onslaught of underwhelming harem shows. I legit can't remember the last time I found a harem anime that can even be remotely recommendable. That is...until I ran into Kanojo no Kanojo.Make no mistake. This anime is exactly what it sounds like from the premise and it doesn't shy to exmplify that. Meet Naoya Mukai, the high school student who somehow got involved with not one but two girls in a dramatic love triangle....This sounds like every healthy high school male student's fantasy. For Naoya, his brutal honesty doesn't hold him back to express such feelings and attraction. In fact, the show sells his personality at best when he dives right into his interactions with the female cast. Yes, this anime is a harem and he's living the dream.Now, you may wonder what kind of anime dedicates itself for a romance between a guy and multiple girls. After all, infidelity can be a sensitive topic and spark some controversy. In this show, Naoya plants the idea that he can date two girls at the same time. In this case, they are Saki and Nagisa. After certain circumstances, he decided to be their boyfriend. With his brutal honesty, he tries to be assertive about his intentions but of course, this often sets off red flags and ends up embarassing everyone involved. Watching Naoya's behavior in this show feels like a romance sit-com. With every episode, we see how much Naoya wants to please his girlfriends. Whenever he comes up with an insane logic, we know that Naoya is truthful about his intentions. He's a lover.Yes, it's a harem. There's going to be drama and endless amount of misunderstandings, romance tropes, and story segments that is aimed to adhere to male fantasies. Like most harems, the show has character rivalries although in this anime, Saki and Nagisa's is much lighthearted and friendly. That's a different story when we meet Rika, a girl who goes to extreme lengths to be close to Naoya. With an ego as high as Mount Everest, her tsundere personality follows her wherever she goes. Unfortunately, this also brings her trouble and drama into Naoya's life with his girlfriends. At the peak of the show, we see just how far Rika goes to get Naoya's attention and resorting to any means necessary. However, I don't want to downplay the Saki and Nagisa either. Both girls may not be as forceful as Rika but they have their own personal feelings. In fact, you could say that Saki herself is a massive pervert and almost mirrors some of Naoya's fantasies. Meanwhile, Nagisa grows out of her shell and puts on daring outfits to please Noaya. From this viewpoint, it's clear the show wants to appeal to all the main cast as much as possible without leaving anyone behind. Well, then there's Shino.Compared to the other girls, Shino is much more serious and follows a set of morals. And in her mind, Naoya's lecherous deeds and intentions are immoral. She represents the anti-thesis of the main girls. In essence, she objects the very idea of Naoya being involved in multiple relationships. However, this season only vaguely explore her character as much of the screentime is dedicated to Saki, Nagisa, and Rika. Her presence is overshadowed for the majority of the show although when she does appear, Shino has an alluring presence. Bear in mind that the anime adaptation is based off of an ongoing manga and her arc takes place in later chapters. It's one of the drawbacks of adapting this show so early on. Yet, it's clear the anime wants us to see how all the main girls behave with Naoya.Artistically, harem anime often lacks visual quality except for showcasing fan service at every chance it gets. The same can be applied in some cases for this show. After all, we do get a load of fan service ranging from onsen episodes to the classy stuck in the gym together segments. However, it's clear from day one that the directors wanted to draw an appeal to the female cast. Every female character is characterized with alluring tones whether it's their curvy bodies or well-endowed boobs. Let me just say that while the anime doesn't fully rely on that to sell itself, it's clear they wanted the girls to look sexy. Saki is the guiltest example as she even goes as far to use her body to get Naoya's attention in bed in one episode. At the same time, the anime stylishly decorates its theme song with social media visuals. It's contagiously catchy and fits with the modern norm. Finally, let's not forget about the overexaggerated character reactions of the cast. Saki and Naoya carries this show when you see how much they react in the most insane way possible in a harem anime.I'm not an expert or professor on harem anime. Watching Kanojo no Kanojo is about as simple as it gets with a guy getting involved with multiple girls. It's a show that flirts endlessly with itself and every episode builds more and more into its premise. Can we just say that no matter who you root for, Naoya is pretty much the biggest winner? No matter what impresses or displease you about the show, you have to admit that Kanojo no Kanojo does justice for a harem. This sounds like every healthy high school male student's fantasy. For Naoya, his brutal honesty doesn't hold him back to express such feelings and attraction.

No matter what impresses or displease you about the show, you have to admit that Kanojo no Kanojo does justice for a harem."", ""Kanojo mo Kanojo truly embraces it's stupidity and because of that it's one of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen to date.Story: While many other similar comedies go the route of random gags (Aho Girl, Sabage-bu!), Kanojo goes in a different direction. It decides to go for continuity with a story and actual progress. This is what I believe elevates it versus it's peers. The story is simple and the pacing is quite good. Where it really shines is it's unpredictability. Is it perfect or some big brain plot? No. But for a comedy like this it's welcomed. 7/10.Art: Easily the weakest part of Kanojo....A lot of the animation was outsourced and it's very noticeable. While there are some very good scenes and detailed artwork, the animation lags behind. Inconsistent artwork, static frames, and constantly cutting corners. That being said I really love the artstyle, character designs, and colors. 6/10.Sound: Another strength is the sound. The seiyuu's absolutely kill their role, Ayane Sakura delivers one of the best performances as Saki. The music was on point, it elevated the scenes a lot and matched how over the top things are. A tad repetitive but still great. I found both OP and ED very good as well. 9/10.Characters: This is where Kanojo mo Kanojo's success comes from. Across the board the characters are hilarious and I didn't think a single one was noticeably poor or unlikable. Whether you will enjoy the anime or not depends on how you feel about the characters. Some will easily be irritated while others will bask in their stupidity. Every character has growth which is surprising for a comedy like this, coming into it you would think they would be static. That being said they are quite 1 dimensional. One of the best casts in a comedy I've seen. 10/10.Enjoyment: I love stupid comedies so I loved every second of Kanojo. From the characters to the comedy, I thought it was perfect. 10/10.Overall: Kanojo mo Kanojo raises the bar for dumb comedies. With it's only noticeable blemish being the animation, it excels in every other category. 9/10. A lot of the animation was outsourced and it's very noticeable.

But me being a degenerate and like to watch stupid anime, I added it to my list immediately. When the show started to get published on youtube, I fell in love with it since episode 1. It's such a ridiculous and absurd relationship that I can't help but laugh and stop thinking about...anything else, we are just behind the screen watching these 3 screwing around trying to enjoy their life and solve all the troubles they encounter on the way. It's nothing too complicated to understand, just a simple two-timing relationshipPeople might rate this show a 1 or a 5, but for me, despite being garbage, my enjoyment was off the charts whenever I watch it. I can't help but be excited when every episode is premiered because I know this show will help relieve all the stress I have by the sheer amount of running gags it contain. You don't usually watch harem for the plot, it's simply a nice and entertaining way to kill time and enjoy yourselfThere's absolutely no plot in this show, just a funny two-timing relationship and the troubles that our 3 MCs went through in the animeThe characters are also pretty generic, we got the tsundere waifu, the childhood friend as gf,...etcThis show really isn't amazing, and it wasn't intended to. I can honestly tell while watching that the author had A LOT of fun writing this cringy and stupid story, props to them for creating such a stress-free and enjoyable anime. It feels like they were just writing this as a hobby or something because this show is honestly fucking amazing when you don't use your brain to watch itOverall, this anime was a joy ride and just a journey to watch through out 2 months and I enjoyed the fuck out of it. It's trash but if you want to entertain yourself with some stupid and ridiculous harem story while not wanting to use your brain cells to analyze the story, this anime is just for you10/10 enjoyment anything else, we are just behind the screen watching these 3 screwing around trying to enjoy their life and solve all the troubles they encounter on the way.

By allowing MC Naoya to officially date not just one, but two high school girls, the show will be heralded for years after as the harbinger of polyamory in modern romcom anime. Absolutely nothing can go wrong with this premise!Enter Saki, the OG (Original Girlfriend)....VA Ayane Sakura does an incredible job of portraying this high school girl whose feisty character is enough to hide the fact that she is the epitome of an easily peer-pressured pushover. In true high school fashion, she is guilt-tripped time after time again into accepting things in her relationship that no self-respecting person would tolerate. Her running gag is being heavily physically violent, and honestly, who wouldn\'t be in this situation?Enter Nagisa, the New Girlfriend. Even when played out for laughs, the concept of a girl so codependent on a boy she isn\'t even dating yet, and for which she would be willing to be so self-sacrificing for, is beyond alarming. For some reason, the author believes that making her character traits ""astoundingly terrible at certain things and alarmingly dedicated to others"" is still considered moe by 2021 romcom standards (or even worse, the author thinks this is a funny gag).  In a groundbreaking development of the nice moe cooking girlfriend, we learn that her insecurities lie deep enough to inspire her to break into her boyfriend\'s and sister wife\'s phones.And finally enter, Naoya, the Boyfriend. Some may say he is a Chad who isn\'t afraid to ask for what he wants. Unfortunately, it is hardly Chad behavior to repeatedly grovel before your committed girlfriend and beg for forgiveness after every social transgression you purposely crossed, and it is hardly good comedy for this to be the slapstick punchline three times per episode.Perhaps I\'m just old and jaded, perhaps it\'s because high school romcom anime were never supposed to be psycho-analyzed; but the rampant toxicity of this polyamorous relationship is incredibly exhausting and any viewer who believes the behavior of these characters is acceptable, even for laughs, needs to re-evaluate their idea of social norms. While the initial concept and erratic logic processes of the characters lead to an ""it\'s so bad it\'s good"" start to the show, by episode 4, the comedy is already overdone and you\'re left feeling annoyed at why all these women are written so catty. The only real saving grace in this show - and its comedy - is VA Ayane Sakura\'s natural tsukkomi deliveries.The art and designs are fine for a manga adaptation of this type, but the production quality and animation noticeably start deteriorating a few episodes in.Overall, given the plethora of recent rage-inducing romance anime featuring an unhealthy relationship (Nagatoro, Rent-a-Girlfriend, Sing Yesterday for Me), this one really takes the cake. Because now there\'s two unhealthy relationships at the same time.2/10, this show is terrible but at least I got some enjoyment being angry at this show.

I like the comedy and the romance elements have their moments that aren\'t ruined by an attempt at being funny all the time. Kanojo mo kanojo knows its boundaries and sticks to them. 10/10.If you want a rom-com which balances perfectly and has a interesting plotline with likable characters this is for you. Or maybe not everyone is different. But definitely give the first few episodes a try, but note that some how a 10/10 gets better in season 2.The story is and isn\'t predictable at the same time. There are points where the characters are in a certain situation...and you can see where it\'s going but even then you don\'t know what that entails. An example of this is at the start when the ""two-timing"" starts. You know it\'s going to happen but you don\'t know how the characters, especially the female characters, are going to react or feel about it. They\'re ""fine"" with it, but what are the reservations? Do the girls like each other? Is it a competitive relationship now? This is all shown but at appropriate times and in a way that it\'s not just reading and overly specific synopsis.If you like smart characters don\'t watch this. I saw a review of the manga from someone who didn\'t like the fact that the characters are overly stupid. But that feeds into the comedy, it\'s very slapstick.Don\'t watch with your parents. It\'s an anime for Christ\'s sake. It\'s nothing lewd but there are moments where your parents would question you.

A plot so magnificent,so distinctive so unique That unbelievably aggregates far morecomplicity than your miniature brain could possibly imagine.I present to you ladies and gentlemen Kanojo ma kanojo.the story basically is about a brutally honest highschool boywho is dating his childhood friend and living his normal life.and one day he gets a confusion from a girl that she loves him and wants to date himbut he tells her he already...has a girlfriend, so she gets sad and he feels so sorry for her and because he is such a nice, gracious guy so he goes to his gf and introduces her to the girl and tells her that he...here comes the punch line""I want to date both of you"" yes he actually asked his own gf to let him date another girl while also dating her. not only that he asked, no sir.He begged her to agree, and weirdly enough after 1min of arguing with him and shouting no she agrees, why you may ask? well simplybecause the other girl was too ""kawaii"", and they decide for some reasonto move out all three and live together.it\'s been three episodes now and since episode one came out i couldn\'t bear to endure the absolute stupidity so I instantly dropped the show.But after a not-so-long consideration, I decided to go back and try to watch the new episodes in hope of seeing any sign of logicalness or any sort of normal human being behavior, and boy I was wrong, they just kept on going with it smooth as butter.like those two girls actually started going out with one guy at the same time with them acknowledging that fact, and the farce goes on and on.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is what anime in 2021 is.You\'re out of ideas my friend, don’t know what to do, have no worries.follow these steps:1-get a bunch of cute, naive girls and make them blindly in love with a guy to the point where their brain is unable to function2-make up something that is so absurd and far more than what human imagination could possibly ever accept and boom you got yourself an anime in 2021 standards. has a girlfriend, so she gets sad and he feels so sorry for her and because he is such a nice, gracious guy so he goes to his gf and introduces her to the girl and tells her that he...here comes the punch line""I want to date both of you"" yes he actually asked his own gf to let him date another girl while also dating her. not only that he asked, no sir.He begged her to agree, and weirdly enough after 1min of arguing with him and shouting no she agrees, why you may ask? well simplybecause the other girl was too ""kawaii"", and they decide for some reasonto move out all three and live together.it\'s been three episodes now and since episode one came out i couldn\'t bear to endure the absolute stupidity so I instantly dropped the show.But after a not-so-long consideration, I decided to go back and try to watch the new episodes in hope of seeing any sign of logicalness or any sort of normal human being behavior, and boy I was wrong, they just kept on going with it smooth as butter.like those two girls actually started going out with one guy at the same time with them acknowledging that fact, and the farce goes on and on.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is what anime in 2021 is.You\'re out of ideas my friend, don’t know what to do, have no worries.follow these steps:1-get a bunch of cute, naive girls and make them blindly in love with a guy to the point where their brain is unable to function2-make up something that is so absurd and far more than what human imagination could possibly ever accept and boom you got yourself an anime in 2021 standards.', 'If you expect a serious anime with an excellent story and deep character development or some novelty, then Kanojo mo Kanojo is definitely not for you. Kanojo mo Kanojo is not entertaining at all when you think about the characters and the plot. A guy who finally becomes a couple with the girl whom he confessed continuously ever since they were in grade school (and he is finally accepted in high school) accepts the confession of a girl whom he has met just a few moments ago, then tries to pursue his childhood love to be part of a two-time relationship is the main character...after all, and all this happens in the very first episode. The show goes even less sensical with each episode. What I absolutely suggest is to turn your brain off. Except Kiryuu Shino, who is not explored throughout the anime much but has her own arc in the manga, not a single character in the whole show thinks with their brains. At the first episodes, I did the mistake of trying to reason the characters, which honestly does not work. On the other hand, if you shut down your reasoning, you can easily enjoy Kanojo mo Kanojo. The total absurdity and lack of common sense makes it a highly enjoyable show.The characters are pretty shallow: two tsunderes, one love-struck housewife-ish girl and, as I wrote earlier, a not yet explored girl with common sense all around the most honest and the most stupid boy. There is no character development (even if there is, it\'s neglible).There is also not much of a story. The show is mostly about the everyday life of the characters. Apart from the introduction of characters, there is no sense of progression.The art and music are pretty nice. Well, I\'m not the person to evaluate those aspects, but at least I can say that they were not boring or irritating.If this was a normal anime, those problems would make it maybe a 2 or 3 out of 10. However, this is not the case since the show is greatly enjoyable and I would put enjoyability in front of any other metric. So overall I would give an 8 since Kanojo mo Kanojo does its job perfectly, but my recommendation is mixed since most people (like ones here) just bash the show just because it\'s ""literarily"" bad.

I thought that a lot of  things that were happening were unnecessary and that the MC could've just been a bit more wise. But as time went on, I kept forcing myself to watch the anime and I was learning how hilarious this anime actually could be, and most of that being thanks to how there weren't no set borders on how crazy the story...could get. The story isn't realistic nor anything very well written, but that's not what the show is trying to accomplish, and it's more about having fun with the story. If the story wouldn't have been able to get as stupid as it did, the show wouldn't be nearly as entertaining, at least not in the same way. The art and sound quality are pretty good, nothing too exceptional. The characters are unique and funny, and though I at first thought the main character was stupid, he's really consistent with what he does and how he doesn't give up, which shows how great his determination and confidence really is. I enjoyed this anime a lot when I learned to not be blind to what it actually stands for. Overall, I put an 8 out of 10 since that's how the show made me feel overall. It really succeeds in entertaining and is actually quite well put together for what it is. These types of relationships aren't normal and this one being so unique makes it dumb for me to act like I have something to compare it to. could get.

You won't be able to do this in the real world, but you can do it in the anime world. Imagine you have 1 girlfriend, but in this anime, you can have 4 girlfriends. This is something that every man wants but is unlikely to happen.That's why you have to watch this anime to feel it. The feeling of having 4 girlfriends and being able to be with them all day. The story is trash! Stop, don't judge the cover of the anime but look at the contents because this is truly a...masterpiece of trash.Honestly, the comedy peak of this anime is really predictable, because 90% of all episodes are comedy and I can guarantee that. And don't just look at the comedy, but look at 10% of each episode has a moment where that moment should not be skipped.The MC here is someone who is quite good at handling situations. He can change any situation according to his tenacity and his unyieldingness that amazes me. He is actually not a lecherous MC but he is a true gentleman.Maybe after seeing the harem genre you think that the MC here only wants to play with women's feelings. But the fact is the opposite, the MC here wants to keep women's feelings and the MC always wants to make them happy.He is not an ordinary man but he is a true chad who should be a role model for every man. This story also has a lot to do with today's life and is very related to us.The animation in my opinion is quite good, but some scenes show a very stiff visual and make me a bit bored to see it. However, the ugliness of these scenes can be corrected with a comedy that is truly cultured.The music is also good and very modern. In terms of character, each character has its own characteristics but in my opinion, their characteristics are quite ordinary but meeting expectations and seeing them will not bore you.Honestly, when this anime first aired, I thought it was just an endless harem. But after seeing that it was done, I could feel that the harem this time was quite moral and competitive because each of them wanted to be number 1 for the MC. And seeing these things made me determined to watch the sequel to the end. masterpiece of trash.Honestly, the comedy peak of this anime is really predictable, because 90% of all episodes are comedy and I can guarantee that.

But the fact is the opposite, the MC here wants to keep women's feelings and the MC always wants to make them happy.He is not an ordinary man but he is a true chad who should be a role model for every man. This story also has a lot to do with today's life and is very related to us.The animation in my opinion is quite good, but some scenes show a very stiff visual and make me a bit bored to see it. However, the ugliness of these scenes can be corrected with a comedy that is truly cultured.The music is also good and very modern. In terms of character, each character has its own characteristics but in my opinion, their characteristics are quite ordinary but meeting expectations and seeing them will not bore you.Honestly, when this anime first aired, I thought it was just an endless harem. But after seeing that it was done, I could feel that the harem this time was quite moral and competitive because each of them wanted to be number 1 for the MC. And seeing these things made me determined to watch the sequel to the end."", 'With a sheer abundance of harem anime, the genre has reached a peak of mediocrity in the anime world. In recent years, no harem anime has done anything to change their formula or adapt an unique selling point to their shows. Kanojo mo Kanojo, is the same as every harem anime that came before it, and it wears its cape of simplicity proudly.It’s a show that shouldn’t be taken seriously. It’s definitely no Quentin Tarantino levels of storytelling, nor is it something made by an obese man, going through a mid-life crisis in his mother’s basement. The story is the same as every harem anime...there is. One boy, surrounded by hot girls, in various explicit yet comedic situations. It’s extremely lackluster and straightforward. The story sets itself apart from its predecessors in the fact that it resides on various fetishes in order to not make the plot super generic. Our mc has a GF, but is approached by another girl who’s too hot for him to resist, so he decides to double date them as more girls enter the scene. This is the only selling point for this show that may peak the curiosity of a couple people. It’s a funny story yes, but besides this one uniqueness it’s super simple and the same as any harem before it.The characters also seem pretty run off the mill. Different girls, different hair colors, different personalities. Each has their own part to do, whether it be romance, comedic relief or just fan service, the show doesn’t convolute itself by adding weird norms to their characters. Its super generic, and the shows well aware of this generic ass characters, but instead of adding bullshit, they embrace their simple characters proudly, and gives us a pretty straightforward breakthrough of the cast, which I can respect.The MC is not as bland as most harem mcs are. He’s not revolutionary in any ways. He embraces the tropes of harem mcs of being loud, annoying and cringy, but at the same time he is empathetic towards the girls and is there when he needs to be. In certain parts he does get pretty robotic, but mostly you can feel his presence in the show, even if you don’t want to. It’s honestly a breath of fresh air, seeing a mc with somewhat of a personality rather than a living, breathing corpse who’s more dense than Kirito.The shows strongest point is in its art. Its vibrant, effervescent, vivacious, flamboyant, yes I am using complicated words to sound smart shut up. But honestly the art is pretty decent. It helps to get your mind off the simplicity of the story and characters. You’ll find yourself appreciating the art in this show more times than anything else. The animation is subpar. It’s often not really consistent and flaws out at certain times. Certain scenes feel rocky and rough, weird facial features takes you out of the show. Not bad enough to go bleach your eyes, but enough to make you re think every life choices you ever made.The sound in this show is…meh. There’s an opening that’s pretty plain at first but gets kind of annoying later on. Super generic voice acting, it’s not bad in any ways, but not really an attention grabbing aspect of the show. OST’s, pretty generic, enough to make you realize it’s there, then again, sound in harems have never been out of this world so the sound quality of the show’s acceptable.This is honestly a show that shouldn’t be taken seriously. I see people giving this like a 1 or 2 and I feel that it’s a bit harsh. It accepts its simplicity of a plot, recognizes its overtly generic characters, and embraces all the tropes of a classic harem anime without shame. I’ve seen some hot garbage harems in my life, and it’s not as bad as them by a margin. The show puts efforts in the parts that are more essential for a harem, which is the art, rather than thinking of ground breaking characters or a well formulated, mind breaking plot. It doesn’t attempt to climb out of its pit of mediocrity by doing something risky, rather stays there and acts upon its lackluster yet amusing show, which is something I can honestly commend them for. Good job, slight pat on the back for you.I finished the show cause I put too much time into it, but I honestly don’t regret watching it. I would choose watching something else over this most of the times, but the time I had with the show was honestly pleasant to say the least. there is.

I was excited about it\'s release since there haven\'t been any new romcoms lately other than higehiro ig(wasn\'t even a romcom to begin with).And now with this anime, i think I\'ve found a new anime to look up to. I am writing this review as of ep 4 and i have not read the manga so I\'ll be writing based on what I\'ve seen so far.Naoya, our good looking mc, not bad at first look. Was actually even surprised that my boi had already gotten a gf as of ep...1, sakisaki.Looking at the situation, If you already have a girlfriend and another girl confessed to you, how would u react? Turn her down politely? Break up with your current girlfriend? Or maybe cheat on her? Ah yes, this are some quite common things we would actually do. But have you seen a lad that\'s brave enough to ask her current girlfriend to gain permission on two-timing? I\'ve never seen such a more honest yet guilty move.Cmon, just look at Nagisa, who wouldn\'t want to date her. And to be honest this is what makes this anime unique. I\'ve never come across a romcom show that the mc asks directly to her girlfriend to date another girl.Now, another girl, Mirika made an appearance,ngl she\'s hot asl. Now Naoya\'s on the verge of dating another girl. And even though this show seems pretty ridiculous, I don\'t see why we should not watch it. As I said it before it\'s so bad that it\'s actually pretty good. Additionally I\'ve never laughed so much in a single ep since this came out. I laughed so much that the pain of me being single fades away. A guy who has the balls to date this much girls at a single time is more than enough to convince me that he is hella based and deserve my full respects.So, if you\'re interested in a romcom show that is very different from others, this is a show that you should give a shot at. Maybe the feeling of guilty pleasure might satisfy ur wants. Life is something that we can\'t take back once it ends, so we gotta live our lives to the fullest like our chad Naoya here. 1, sakisaki.Looking at the situation, If you already have a girlfriend and another girl confessed to you, how would u react?

In particular, Ayana Taketatsu as Saki...Saki was SOOO god damn funny and entertaining. I think her performance and the OP and ED song choices kept me coming back every Friday to lose brain cells. Seriously Girlfriend, Girlfriend has potential OP of the year. The background music as well is super catchy and sets the mood well for the show. You can tell everyone had fun with this production and through it you may have fun as well.Now that we got the sound out of the way Imma talk about the character and story. The characters of the show really drive and sell you on it. If you find them entertaining from the first episode, you will probably enjoy the show. If you don\'t, I would recommend a drop by episode 2 or 3. Nobody really develops but the comedy bits and the chemistry of the characters are what really sells it. There are ""arcs"" here but don\'t\' expect any big emotional pay out, its a hang out a show. Just a dude and his two girlfriends. I mean the set up for the show is literally some girl confesses to the MC and the MC goes ""oh yeah, it\'s big brain time"" and instead of either, denying the girl or breaking up with his current GF. Big brain Naoya decides to ask his current GF and childhood crush/friend to allow him to two time them. This show is dumb, but its fun!!The Art is art. Idk how I feel about the eyes for the characters. I like them some times, but other wise they look to 00\'s You know what I\'m talking about, when anime went through that phase where everyone looked like bug eyed alien people with hugenormous tits. It works and then sometimes it doesn\'t. idk, it\'s works. I wish I could judge more on the animation here than the art, because sometimes the animation is stupidly good, and then there are big finales where people are supposed to be running but it\'s just still images where they move the camera. epic stuff guys, blew the budget early on some boob animation earlier in the season. it\'s fine i get it, priorities need to focused in on.In the end I don\'t recommend the show to everyone because I don\'t think it has that wide of an appeal. I came in expecting dumb, and every week it delivered. I don\'t blame or hate anyone who says they don\'t like this show because it\'s dumb.If you just need a show to watch and laugh with or at I think the Summer Seasons 2021 dumpster fire Girlfriend, Girlfriend will be able to hit that sugary spot.

The show is fully aware that it's not meant to be serious, and does not even attempt to be so, as opposed to other recent anime of the same genre such as Osamake. Without the need to carry a suspension of disbelief,...the enjoyment derived from it magnifies tenfold and allows me to enjoy myself throughout its runtime. The ludicrous dialogues blast through the boundaries of realism without a care in the world, and yet, prove to be so hysterically comical at the same time. This can be attributed to the cast of wacky monkeys that fit the pictorial definition of stupid. Every interaction between the characters that I watch melts my already charred brain into a contented agglomeration of gloop by the end of the episode. While It cannot be denied that Kanojo mo Kanojo relies heavily on existing tropes that have been and are still prominent in shows of this genre, these scenarios tie in perfectly with the overarching plot and its cast because everything is already ridiculous as they are. There is no need to make sense of whatever might be unfolding in front of me, nor do I have to care. Me watch, me like. Simple as that.The voice acting is second to none and was indisputably the highlight of this series. The sheer emotion and passion that was invested into the performances from a stacked cast only served to strengthen my attachment with the main characters. The colors are vibrant and the aesthetics fit the show's aim in portraying comedic moments. The art and animation are mostly sufficient and aren't particularly outstanding in a general sense, but I would like to comment that the utilization of curves in certain scenes is exceptional, if you know what I mean. It has satisfied my seasonal craving for geometric perfection. The OP and ED are what you'd normally expect them to be; average, catchy tunes that do not stray from the orthodox. The only big downside to this anime, in my humble and personal opinion, is the disturbing lack of Shino screentime. But no matter, onwards to the manga to get my fix!That aside, I would've liked to write more about how this show had surprisingly exceeded my expectations as someone who doesn't typically enjoy harem romcoms, but this show has already pilfered 99% of what little intelligence I possessed before watching this, so there is nothing further to add. Loosen up, cast aside all logic and reasoning, and enjoy this worthy, wild ride. the enjoyment derived from it magnifies tenfold and allows me to enjoy myself throughout its runtime.

I\'d say it\'s first and foremost just good comedy around a three-way relationship.This show is very VERY good. Great, in fact. Doesn\'t deserve nearly as much hate as it gets. But then again, most people have a bad taste.This is basically a harem story with the little twist being around the fact that two of the girls are actually the official girlfriends of the MC. The situations the characters get themselves into are extremely funny, and the writing is great! The story flows in a very natural and believable way.As for all the unnecessary hate, you...should just go watch the show for what it is - comedy. It is by no means an endorsement or disapproval of any type of relationship, and it is stated over the show multiple times that the characters themselves don\'t even know if it\'s right or wrong, but they just go with what feels right and just to them.Just make yourself some popcorn or open an ice cream tub and enjoy it for what it is. Don\'t go in all righteous and judgmental towards the characters, or you\'ll just suffer the whole time. should just go watch the show for what it is - comedy.

Now, the cause of that is mostly NOT because of the intended comedy in the show, it\'s more because of the bizarre premise and how serious it\'s trying to be at times, even though it is extremely silly. Almost everything is awful in this show and that makes it absolute gold.Story?Absolute trash and I love it.Favorite character?I believe in Saki Saki supremacy....Animation?I actually kinda like it.Music?The opening slaps ngl.

But secret of enjoying this anime is not taking it too seriously. Its not the usual ""its too bad its good"" stuff. There is a charm to this anime only us cultured men will understand; the waifu\'s.The story revolves around Naoya and about his goal to two time his girlfriend Saki and Nagisa. In a normal work, this wouldn\'t work. But since common sense doesn\'t exist in anime, it somehow work for the three of them.Now about the waifu\'s, they\'re top tier. Saki Saki is your energetic wholesome gf material....Nagisa is your loving and caring sweetheart who will do everything for you. Later in the anime, we have the usual tsundere Rika who is hardworking and has a body of a gravure model. These three girls alone is enough to keep you entertain for the whole 12 episodes despite the garbage plot. Sakura Ayane also deserves an award for her voice acting for Saki Saki. In fact, the whole main girl voice actress are tier S too.Also, I want a season 2 for this anime because the true best girl Shino moments will shine. She has barely screen time on season 1 but in the manga, oh boy she captures many of the readers heart. Season 2 will be a lot better than the season 1. I hope they consider it.So that\'s about it.

(episode 4)Maybe because this anime is the first one to make me think: “I hate this guy, the story is too whacky and the jokes are too repetitive… why am I watching this? What’s this love-hate?”And maybe that’s all I wanted to say in this “review”But let me add some things to make this feel somewhat complete- I hated the guy from moment one as his actions are just brain damaging stupid (but why is he slowly and lowly starting to grow on me?)- the jokes are occasionally funny enough to make me smile but most of the time...they just keep the story running- the art is very soft “modern slice of life” and, as it’s with most anime nowadays, solid (*animators in pain)- the two girls for now have a kinda enjoyable chemistry and are typical for those kinda shows extreme types of simple tropesI come back to Kanojo mo Kanojo every week but it’s soooo mediocre that I’m either forgetting it instantly after finishing or keep it in memory as “The show with the guy who’s a dick for not settling with one girl and starts to accumulate a harem in a weird manner, just for the sake of having a harem cuz many of us watchers are single dudes who just can’t help but to be absorbed in stupid shit like this.”Farewell, my fellow degenerates!Update (episode 8)There's a tiny hint of a plot, the characters are likeable, the fan service is on an appropriate level and tbh, for those who've never had a girlfriend it's beautiful-and-dreadful to see girls actually fighting over one guy.In some weird manners, this is developing into a good show. they just keep the story running- the art is very soft “modern slice of life” and, as it’s with most anime nowadays, solid (*animators in pain)- the two girls for now have a kinda enjoyable chemistry and are typical for those kinda shows extreme types of simple tropesI come back to Kanojo mo Kanojo every week but it’s soooo mediocre that I’m either forgetting it instantly after finishing or keep it in memory as “The show with the guy who’s a dick for not settling with one girl and starts to accumulate a harem in a weird manner, just for the sake of having a harem cuz many of us watchers are single dudes who just can’t help but to be absorbed in stupid shit like this.”Farewell, my fellow degenerates!Update (episode 8)There's a tiny hint of a plot, the characters are likeable, the fan service is on an appropriate level and tbh, for those who've never had a girlfriend it's beautiful-and-dreadful to see girls actually fighting over one guy.In some weird manners, this is developing into a good show."", ""This anime is trash and so am I.This is the epitome of trash anime.

Just for the representation of polygamy alone, it\'s unique, but I also see some depth in the characters like in Kuzo no Honkai. Also like that anime and Domestic Kanojo, there\'s a nuance to the characters because it\'s a drama and you have to understand what they\'re all thinking and feeling to feel the tension.There\'s some good comedy in Kanojo mo Kanojo too, and it does a good job of showing the jealousy and insecurity inherent in a polygamous relationship, but the characters work through it and learn to care about each other\'s feelings. ', 'Start to finish this is one of the worst anime that I have ever seen. Throughout the show I was laughing, not at the punch lines but at how terrible there attempts at a joke could be. In terms of story writing, there is little to no character development for any of the characters. Each time a climax is reached, a character will seem to be on the brink of discovering some reasoning or moral behind the story, they just double down on their delusional take that got them into the predicament in the first place. Honestly that concept would be a funny punchline, but...the show takes itself so seriously that any shimmer of humor that I got from its funny moments is promptly washed away by the terrible sound track and writing.Some of the best moments of show are when the main character is not on the screen, which unfortunately is not very often. The first episode alone threw me off because it really seemed like Saki, the girl with red hair, would be upset with the idea of being in a polyamorous relationship. She then agrees as soon an Naoya, the protagonist lowers his head and says please. In the rest of the show she is incessantly jealous of the other girl, Nagisa, yet for some reason defends her at every opportunity. I guess the reasoning is ""because she\'s cute"". there was one mystery that keep me interested to this character, which is how she feel in love with Naoya in the first palace. It is hinted at like two time and finally addressed  in the last episode. Boy what a letdown it was as I learned that she knew he had a crush on Saki in the first place, and the reason she feel in love is because he was so persistent in asking Saki out repeatedly.Nagisa might just take the cake as the worst written character in the show, which is quite the feat trust me. Her whole deal is that she is really cute, but clumsy, tehe! Ok cool, then why after episode one does she do 0 clumsy things until the middle and ending of the series. I think there end up being 3 times in the entire show where her clumsiness is addressed, which is ridiculous because that is all she has going for her. At a certain point it felt like she wasn\'t even in some of the episodes because she just doesn\'t say or do anything meaningful or funny ever.Just when you start thinking that you are finally getting into the meat and potatoes and the main cast can start developing they throw in a third love interest named Rika. What was the point of all the triangles in the intro if it ends up as a god damn love square. They spend the next 2-3 episodes with Rika\'s tits on the screen all the time. All the while she is trying to get Naoya to like her because he initially rejects her random suggestion of dating her. This is after she see\'s Naoya with the other two girls and knowing this she still just instantly and randomly does this I really don\'t understand why.I mentioned it briefly, but the music was so consistently off-putting it was honestly impressive. Every serious scene has some weird piano or even worse the cowboy song that should have stayed in some western movie about a sheriff who has to duel at noon. The animation is terrible, the backgrounds and angles seem randomly chosen, especially when they are in Naoya\'s house. If you look at any of the background characters, they are always looking away form the camera or will show up out of nowhere. The only running gags in the show are Naoya getting punched in the face after every interaction, or about one of the girls breast size. You get tired of these after the first time. One thing I will say is that Saki has a few good tsukomi\'s when Naoya does something stupid....wait there\'s a season 2?! the show takes itself so seriously that any shimmer of humor that I got from its funny moments is promptly washed away by the terrible sound track and writing.Some of the best moments of show are when the main character is not on the screen, which unfortunately is not very often. The first episode alone threw me off because it really seemed like Saki, the girl with red hair, would be upset with the idea of being in a polyamorous relationship. She then agrees as soon an Naoya, the protagonist lowers his head and says please. In the rest of the show she is incessantly jealous of the other girl, Nagisa, yet for some reason defends her at every opportunity. I guess the reasoning is ""because she\'s cute"". there was one mystery that keep me interested to this character, which is how she feel in love with Naoya in the first palace. It is hinted at like two time and finally addressed  in the last episode. Boy what a letdown it was as I learned that she knew he had a crush on Saki in the first place, and the reason she feel in love is because he was so persistent in asking Saki out repeatedly.Nagisa might just take the cake as the worst written character in the show, which is quite the feat trust me. Her whole deal is that she is really cute, but clumsy, tehe! Ok cool, then why after episode one does she do 0 clumsy things until the middle and ending of the series. I think there end up being 3 times in the entire show where her clumsiness is addressed, which is ridiculous because that is all she has going for her. At a certain point it felt like she wasn\'t even in some of the episodes because she just doesn\'t say or do anything meaningful or funny ever.Just when you start thinking that you are finally getting into the meat and potatoes and the main cast can start developing they throw in a third love interest named Rika.

Like it doesn't shy away from being trashy it knows what it is which is a trashy harem. You dont have to think when watching the show its mindless and its fun. Not every  show has to be well written, be deep, or even have good characters when you have a show that is so out of left field and that it has so much irony and self awareness.You wont miss anything if you dont watch it but its entertaining "", ""I'm gonna try to keep this fairly short as this is my first time writing a review on here, so I do apologise if I ramble.As this anime is now half way through its airing, I think it's okay to make a fair judgement on this garbage show. I must admit, this show is enjoyable at times, I'm not bored while watching it and it's a pretty easy thing to enjoy and consume. However, each episode is so frustrating, I understand this isn't a show to be taken seriously, however the stupidity in this show is just so frustrating overall and it fails to make...it's tropes funny. I believe one of the reasons I feel this way about this anime is because this type of show isn't aimed at young women like myself, but I'll talk more on this later.Characters- 1/10The main reason this show is frustrating and poor is because of the characters, mainly the main character, Naoya.Naoya is such an infuriating character and it would surprise me if anyone actually believes he's in the right or a likeable guy. To sum up Naoya's character I would say he's basically the type of guy that fails to make women have an enjoyable time in bed. His character is so pathetic and he constantly talks about wanting to make his girlfriends happy but the fails miserably at this. Honestly, a part of me really hopes Saiki and Nagisa realise how trashy this man is and they finally leave him and his bs behind.Saiki is the only character I actually kind of like. I pity her for letting her boyfriend walk all over her and guilt trip her into a poly relationship she clearly is unhappy in.Nagisa is boring, she's literally just there to be a 'cute uwu anime girl'.Rika is also just there to be eye candy, she also has a shitty pick me attitude therefore she's unlikeable too.Story- 3/10To my point at the beginning where I mentioned one of the reason I probably feel this way about this show because it's not aimed at women; this show is honestly just made up of female characters that cater to the male gaze, and in a very poor way. I do enjoy harem anime, I have no problem with anime catered towards a more male audience, however, this anime does this so poorly and stereotypically I hate it. You have all these perfect big boobed, submissive women that just let Naoya walk all over them for his own desires it's just shitty and frustrating, there's basically little plot outside of this idea.Art- 6/10The art is nothing special. Mid-tier. It has lots of bright colour but apart from that there's nothing special.Sound- 6/10Opening and ending is pretty catchy.Enjoyment- 6/10Like I said at the start, this anime can be pretty enjoyable and it's an easy thing to watch. Still very frustrating though. I've seen anime way more enjoyable.Overall- 3/10If you wanna watch a frustrating anime that caters towards the male gaze in a horrible fashion and that has nothing really that special going on, then go for it. it's tropes funny.

Another girlfriend anime, who caught the interest of many people because of their cute waifus, but there are some aspects that made this anime adaption pretty trash, but there are also a few good things I can recall...Story: 2/10 - It\'s just terrible, no even gonna lie. ""I got confessed by another girl, but I already have a girlfriend, what am I supposed to do"" Man just turn her down, that would be the logical thing to do, right? But our MC is dumb as hell so he decides to...date both of them at the same time... Then they start living together, the 3 of them... no comment.Art: 6/10 - Being completely honest, the art is alright, I don\'t hate it but I don\'t like it either. The only complain I have is that in some scenes of the anime, there are quite some art mistakes which bother me a little bit too much (I don\'t know if this was on purpose or something like that, but there were a LOT) For example, of Episode 2, Shino Kiryuu doesn\'t have high black tights on, but a little bit further into the scene, she does (why would they do that man for real) Another example is Episode 3, at some point, Nagisa has a blue ribbon, then, she has Saki\'s color ribbon (I just don\'t get it man) Maybe this is for comedy purpose or something like that, but it\'s just not the way.Sound: 5/10 - Honestly, the opening is so lame, I hate it. But when it comes to the ending, that\'s honestly a good song, I think pretty enjoyable. Now when it comes to sounds effect in the anime, there are some who give that comedy vibe and make the scene somehow funny. But there are sound effect which are just not right. They are just so bad, for example, that time where Nagisa was taking a look at Saki\'s phone and she found out about her search history, that sound effect sounded like cats begging for food or something, no idea, I just know that it wasn\'t fit for the scene.Character: 3/10 - Our main character, Naoya, is made so honest and annoying as hell, always trying his best in the wrong way. Saki is cool I guess, but extremely dumb, when it comes to this into a romance anime, how are you even supposed to make progress? She had a lot of potential, but it was done other way, lowkey dissapointed, not to mention that she is the only one who gives the anime a comedy twist, otherwise this would be such a lamer anime. Nagisa is also cute, but she holds back way too much, typical character who is either excited or really embarrased, nothing less nothing more, typical cute character that is forgetable in no time, no development at all. Now Rika, she\'s also cute, but so god damn stubborn, when she got introduced, she literally slip the beans of her job. Who the hell does that, when you have a secret, you are supposed to HIDE it, not to make it MORE obvious that you have a secret. Now speaking about Shino... lets say she\'s the only character with actual braincells, but she\'s also a love interest so I can\'t say for sure... It\'s kind of confusing, and she didn\'t appear much in the show as a love interest role until episode 10 - 11, so I guess she\'s fine.Enjoyment: 6/10 - As a romance anime, this is dog water, but when it comes to comedy, it\'s somehow funny, some dialogues are actually funny, but some of them doesn\'t make sense at all. I can understand that a lot of people are watching this because of the cute anime girls. If you enjoy watching comedy, this anime is worth giving a shot, if you enjoy watching romance, I don\'t recommend watching it.Overall: 6/10 - I was actually expecting more from this anime, yet I\'m really dissapointed on how did it turned out to be. This is cringe as hell and pure comedy, which is not bad at all, not romatic at all. The main girls are really cute, I won\'t deny that fact, there were times where I laughed, but there were also times where I felt confused and wasn\'t catching up with what was actually happening in the stupid story, if anything, I was smashing my desk for how cringe it was and after every episode I had to take a break to analyze what was actually going on. So, overall, im giving this anime adaption a 5 out of 10, it mostly depends on what are you looking for, a romance anime or a comedy anime, that\'s all it is about. date both of them at the same time...

The story was CLEARLY not made to leave you in awe. Story isn’t mediocre but like I said, the authors agenda clearly isn’t to make a memorable, completely renovating, jaw dropping, ground breaking, never to be seen anime/manga. Now, the thing that is carrying this anime is the COMEDY, I laughed every episode and this is EXTREMELY subjective so I can...understand a bad score, but seeing the reviews of people who score it badly, they’re clearly nerds who took this anime wayyyy too seriously to begin with.Enjoyment= 10/10Story= 6/10Looking at the authors agenda giving it a score of 7 almost feels disrespectful but I am SORRY, giving it an 8 would be disrespectful to my list.I think this is better than rent a gf understand a bad score, but seeing the reviews of people who score it badly, they’re clearly nerds who took this anime wayyyy too seriously to begin with.Enjoyment= 10/10Story= 6/10Looking at the authors agenda giving it a score of 7 almost feels disrespectful but I am SORRY, giving it an 8 would be disrespectful to my list.I think this is better than rent a gf', ""This anime was not made to be taken seriously, people need to understand that this is just comedy mixed with the harem genre.When I first saw Girlfriend Girlfriend I thought it was cringe because I was thinking they were actually being serious about the story, but after watching the second episode I immediately knew what they were going for, just an anime to enjoy, not a MASTERPIECE.The characters in this anime are really good, the personalities of all of them make the situations in which they are involved really natural and not robotic like in another anime were the characters are sometimes doing thing that...are out of character.If you want to watch something refreshing, funny and enjoyable here is Girlfriend Girlfriend for you, the other reviews are taking this anime way too serious, also really great ending song.8/10 because I enjoy it A LOT.Also this is my first review, I'm not joking or anything, I just felt like I had to say this about this anime because its really underrated. are out of character.If you want to watch something refreshing, funny and enjoyable here is Girlfriend Girlfriend for you, the other reviews are taking this anime way too serious, also really great ending song.8/10 because I enjoy it A LOT.Also this is my first review, I'm not joking or anything, I just felt like I had to say this about this anime because its really underrated."", ""When I first saw the plot of the show, I hated it as I thought it said MC two times, and I cant bear watching Cheaters and NTR.

So while you are reading this, please don\'t think about whether it is realistic or not. What makes this anime interesting are the characters, the story and the jokes / comedy of it. I recommend this anime for people who like comedy or rom-com manga.First, let\'s talk about the story. I rate it 8/10.The story is unique to me, and the backstory / stories of the heroines were in addition...is very funny, so I rate it as 8 for now. it may change in the next chapters. Also, the way the author uses the ""Neo Updating Rom-Com"" concept is very good.Next, let\'s talk about the Characters. I rate it as 10/10.The main characters are stupid in different ways. They are also quite unique. Also, the heroines are really cute. Let me describe them. These characters make the story more interesting and funny. So, I rate it a 10 as of now.・ MC / Naoya - He is an honest and straightforward person. (In a good and bad way) He is stupid, like he literally asked his girlfriend if he can do two strokes.・ Saki Saki - Tsundere and hyper heroine. First GF of the MC. She is stupid like the girl in \'Aho Girl\', the only thing that differentiates them is that Saki Saki can feel the embarrassment. For your information, ""Saki Saki"" is her real name.・ Minase Nagisa - brave, humble, hardworking heroine. 2nd GF. She is brave because she confessed to the MC, even though he already has a girlfriend. She is humble because, for the most part, she doesn\'t care about herself. She is hard working because she literally works hard to achieve her goal. She is stupid in her studies, even though she studies / works hard, she still fails.・ Mirisa - Tsundere, Youtuber heroine. She is more Tsundere than Saki Saki. She is also stupid like the other main characters.・ Shino - Saki Saki\'s friend. She disagrees with both times. as of now she is just a supporting heroine, but we\'ll see ...Art, I rate 8/10.Since the author\'s art style looks good, and it looks clean, then I rate it 8/10.Fun, I rate 10/10.I really enjoy it, since it always makes me laugh. Makes sense, since the author of this one is also the same author of ""Aho Girl"" which is a manga / anime comedy.Thanks for reading this far. Again I recommend this anime for anyone who likes comedy and rom-com anime / manga. Don\'t read this if you hate harem anime. is very funny, so I rate it as 8 for now. it may change in the next chapters. Also, the way the author uses the ""Neo Updating Rom-Com"" concept is very good.Next, let\'s talk about the Characters. I rate it as 10/10.The main characters are stupid in different ways. They are also quite unique. Also, the heroines are really cute. Let me describe them. These characters make the story more interesting and funny. So, I rate it a 10 as of now.・ MC / Naoya - He is an honest and straightforward person. (In a good and bad way) He is stupid, like he literally asked his girlfriend if he can do two strokes.・ Saki Saki - Tsundere and hyper heroine. First GF of the MC. She is stupid like the girl in \'Aho Girl\', the only thing that differentiates them is that Saki Saki can feel the embarrassment. For your information, ""Saki Saki"" is her real name.・ Minase Nagisa - brave, humble, hardworking heroine. 2nd GF. She is brave because she confessed to the MC, even though he already has a girlfriend. She is humble because, for the most part, she doesn\'t care about herself. She is hard working because she literally works hard to achieve her goal. She is stupid in her studies, even though she studies / works hard, she still fails.・ Mirisa - Tsundere, Youtuber heroine. She is more Tsundere than Saki Saki. She is also stupid like the other main characters.・ Shino - Saki Saki\'s friend.

The way Naoya builds his harem is simple and the story doesn´t have any interesting nodus. Unfortunately, I must conclude that simplicity of this story often reminds me of some hentai.Art - 8/10I think the art style of this anime was made pretty clean, characters look nice, graphics are smooth, and it excels especially...in good usage of bright colors. Only thing I would point out is the fact that Naoya´s face is, in my opinion, a little effed up, but that´s just my honest opinion.Sound - 5/10Honestly, when it comes to sound, I just can’t help myself from thinking that it is extremely average. None of the voice acting performances seems to be somehow standing out. The OP does not irritate me or something, but it is not the kind of good OP that sticks in your head, and you can´t get rid of it.Character - 7/10Even though none of the characters seems to have very remarkable personality, I still like the way they are made. Most conversations do make at least a little sense, and almost every character is made very likable (the anime gives you basically no reason to ""hate"" any particular character).Enjoyment - 9/10I must admit that I quite enjoy watching this series. It can be really funny sometimes (well, it´s a comedy....), and I would say that it suits well for a ""side anime"" (since you don´t have to focus on the story too much). Also, it has some good fan-service.OVERALL - 7/10In conclusion, it´s an anime that is not very serious and does not drastically stand out in any way, but it´s very easy to watch, can be funny and has a nice fan-service.Also, this opinion may differ from the one I will have when I finish it so don’t take it too seriously :) in good usage of bright colors.

I had a great time with this show.StoryIt's a school harem. Nothing new here. Things get stupid. Then stupider. Then cringey stupid. But it's fun.

But again, it is...what it is.I digress.This show presents some over the top, ridiculous situations and they get more absurd as it progresses - that means it turns into either something beautiful or an actual dumpster fire. In either case, the viewer isn\'t going to look away.They have top VA talent, a harem of waifus to choose from (if that\'s your thing), good production.I\'m not saying this show is amazing, but what I am saying is: this show is not as bad as it is currently rated (6.55). what it is.I digress.This show presents some over the top, ridiculous situations and they get more absurd as it progresses - that means it turns into either something beautiful or an actual dumpster fire.

Even at the beginning, I am pretty sure that not just me, but many others, were intrigued by the working viability of an active polygamous relationship. Having one girlfriend is already quite a bit, but two? You\'d have to truly believe that this entire thing would work to continue with it. Plus the pacing ran really...quickly at the beginning, so much so that it went from boyfriend/girlfriend to boyfriend/girlfriend/girlfriend living together. In the first episode. People may call that ""rushed"", but in my opinion it was stupidly awesome.Now of course, we cannot have an anime without characters, can we? Naoya Mukai, the main guy of the series (and pretty much the only guy in the series) is a stupid bastard who digs himself a hole with every word he says. Yet, his personality forces him to continue digging, in the hopes that he\'ll eventually dig himself out of the other side of the world. That being said, he is a very extreme protagonist, often pushing himself to make ludicrous promises and do crazy things to prove himself. Yet all this would never had been good had it not been for his resilience. No matter what, he keeps his promises, he does the things, and he continues digging, no matter the cost. This is a man I can respect, even if he sometimes looks like an asshole doing it sometimes. The girls pretty much pale in comparison to Naoya, though Nagisa Minase, Naoya\'s second girlfriend, gets a bit of character development ONLY IN THE LAST EPISODES. Adding to the cast we have Saki Saki, Naoya\'s first girlfriend and childhood friend, Rika Hoshizaki, the girl who really, really wants to get close to Naoya, and Shino Kiryu, Saki\'s friend. Oh yeah, did I mention that they all have feelings for him?The one thing I find quite interesting about the series is how much the anime hates on Naoya. Pretty much every single episode he is getting punched, elbowed, or kicked, repeatedly in some cases. Its been done so much its almost comical, and a relief to see it happen. Now, I don\'t condone abuse of any gender at all, but Naoya being able to get up after every beating is just phenomenal.Rating: 8/10 (Not good, but stupid enough that I can like it) quickly at the beginning, so much so that it went from boyfriend/girlfriend to boyfriend/girlfriend/girlfriend living together.

If I could get the same enjoyment out of it again I would re-watch it but sadly its a bright flame that dies fast. Overall its a bad bad show with dumb characters bordering on genuinely mentally disabled at worst, and criminally oblivious about social and human norms at best.The ""love"" dynamics in this show make some hentai plots seem reasonable. Under no reasonable circumstances should any of these women put up with...the main character\'s shit like they do, yet for some unspeakable eldritch set of circumstances he finds himself the love interest of a small harem of women who are otherwise successful and normal except for that they find themselves absolutely enraptured by a walking breathing case of autism. Unlike other shows where women just can\'t say no, the main character finds himself incapable of telling any mildly attractive woman ""no sorry im taken and cannot date you"". Even if he somehow finds a way to do so, he\'ll still somehow trip dick first into her cavernous open and waiting vagina ""accidentally"" and have to add her to the harem of women who could have any other more successful and sane man.The story is just dogwater, there isn\'t really one aside from ""here is girl, she likes main guy, but he shouldn\'t date her."" and then quickly following a  set of wacky shenanigans and wasted time, it ends with ""I love you too and we will all date happily in my big brother-esque home of mentally ill people.""Animation is like an easter egg hunt of find the frame. My friends and I found ourselves pausing and dissecting frames and scenes for character faces and models as well as backgrounds and other shit that we could find just because it was so prevalent. A lot of things about this shows art and animation are so bad, I was just waiting for the show to tell me ""here is what we spent our budget on"" but its like they embezzled the rest of the cash and payed for the show with $5 and a mysterious box that when opened just has some lint and dust in it.Overall I\'d say just skip it, but if you have the ability to appreciate hot garbage and laugh at it then its a good time for the whole weeb friend group to watch. the main character\'s shit like they do, yet for some unspeakable eldritch set of circumstances he finds himself the love interest of a small harem of women who are otherwise successful and normal except for that they find themselves absolutely enraptured by a walking breathing case of autism.

Its a vicious cycle that never ends. Some stand out, others fade away in the shadows. In this day and age, with the rise of \'cheesy\' comedy/romance, its every production for itself so to speak, looking for whom stands out the most. In all the animes i\'ve watched, Kanojo mo Kanojo is certially one to not forget yet lackluster.Our story revolves around Mukai Naoya who finally gets to date his childhood friend, Saki Saki but, in the middle of their relashionship, a girl suddenly confesses to Naoya:Nagisa Minase. Naoya overcomed by his feelings, somehow, finds a solution to date...BOTH Saki and Nagisa. Already that last sentence gives a huge warning for what is about to come and i can assure: its a good warning. Seriously, this isn\'t some common highschool comedy romance; the imagination to pull jokes is incredible and i found myself laughing all episodes. There\'s a lot of goofy moments; all helped thanks to the characters personalities. To show you the best example would be Naoya; he\'s always insecure about one of his girls and says something super exagerated that in real life, you\'d probably be considered insane. He\'s not afraid to admit he watched videos of girls just for the oppai nor to tell everyone he\'s two timing; you will love him. However, this is the problem of the show: the two timing. Because it has a story behind it, it\'s easy to lose interest given how poor they start to introduce characters and how incredibly long they focus on the story instead of the comedy. If an episode is mostly story, you might aswell just not watch.In terms of other factors, its a mixed opinion. Art is good; i really love the character design(specially Saki Saki) and the enviroment behind the scenes however, nothing that will really blow you away. There\'s also plenty of visual errors throught the episodes with eyes and hands not been drawn well. Music is as common as you\'d get; there\'s not a single piece of music i can say ""wow this is amazing"", no music at all would have been better; specially the OP and ED, those are terrible.

At least in terms of what I have seen from the romcom genre. A romance anime where the MC picks both love interests instead of one. Sure, it sounds interesting from the premise for those who like romcoms as its something new to deal with and situations in this series might not be as cliche as regular romantic comedies.The only issue is that Kanojo mo Kanojo is just bad. because both love interests have already been promoted to girlfriend, it takes away a lot of the potential character development as well as the relashionship development...between said love interests and the MC and it also takes away the chance for the viewers to pick the better match out of the options and have their standpoint on the characters change and progress.This type of anime might work if its a pure comedy anime or something with a twist that creates actual plot developments and story. For example, the MC could be secretly dating the love interests without the other ones knowing, which would lead to the development of drama and a goal for the MC to work towards, not letting the girls find out about the others (although this kinda sounds like something where everyone would trash on the MC for cheating).I recall now about reading a manga that is similar to this series called Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo (The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You) that has a premise similar to this one. However I feel that that manga does this ""troupe"" a lot better. The manga has a main story point for it to focus on and yet it never takes itself too seriously. You can tell when reading it that it is a comedy manga first and a romcom second.

It\'s just a guy doing a two timing and other two girls are also trying to get their chances on him. I mean how can someone like this much of a dumb guy. In terms of animation they completely sucked but ok these kind of shows don\'t need much of animation. It was some rom com in which whenever they tried to make it romantic it just got annoying and whenever they try to make it funny it just got cringe. Really that was some horrible shit. Now music, that is a plus point of the anime, the op is really good and the osts are fine but they were like as if they were didn\'t made for this. Like the scene was some trash with some trash dialogue and the music was like some serious confession and this anime tries to justify two timing I know in a sarcastic way but if you\'re doing so make it funny you\'re clearly justifying it as it\'s really ok dude thats just hell lot of annoying. The characters mostly scream out for no reason (they do that to make their point a big deal) but that also just annoys me more.

I didn't expect it to be 100 GF that has an excellent comedy and very endearing characters but I was expecting more.The anime is just boring, the plot does not draws attention at all, being almost worse than ecchi animes like To Love-Ru but this is worsened by the fact that To Love-Ru didn't try to tell a story while GF GF does. The characters are plain or irritaiting and the humor is almost non-existent. If you want a good polyamory...story with good comedy and fairly well written characters I recommend 100 GF but in this anime you will not find anything of that.The only thing that I think is good of this anime is the art. Not the animation, that is pretty basic and in some distant plane scenes the characters are pretty deformed but the art. The style and the colors are quite good and, specially the colors are pretty original.Overall: 5/10 story with good comedy and fairly well written characters I recommend 100 GF but in this anime you will not find anything of that.The only thing that I think is good of this anime is the art.

The girls know what to do and the author knows exactly what he's doing.Don't watch this if you wanna watch a wholesome romance show, for this one you wanna group call with your friends or solo watch it and...enjoy the absurdity that Girlfriend, Girlfriend is. enjoy the absurdity that Girlfriend, Girlfriend is."", 'I have no words to even describe this masterpiece of an anime so far, only 5 episodes in and i don\'t think i have laughed more while watching anything else. I consider this a display of what true satire looks like. I\'m watching this and thinking ""no way they are being serious right now."" Yeah i mean, we can all see that the overall writing and substance of the whole show (or lack there of) is as bad as it can get, but that\'s what makes it so good. You have the epiphany of the most generic, vanilla main character, being a total chad for...20 minutes per episode. Mans pulled 2 females, and is easily persuading both of them into staying in a relation ship. And besides all that, the art style and animation is super cute and nice to look at.Btw, when Naoya handed Rika money to keep silent about the three-way relation ship, in episode 4, i think i laughed the most out of watching any anime ever, including Gintama, Saiki K, Konosuba etc etc. 20 minutes per episode.

I 100% didn\'t expect it to be a ""parody"". Well actually, it kinda isn\'t.STORY: 3/10When i 1st saw the 1st episode and saw that this was pretty much a parody of the harem and romance genre i stupidly and ignorantly told myself: ""Hey, maybe this could be the Konosuba of romance"". How wrong and dumb i was. After a promising 1st episode the show hits a wall in every...sense. The jokes become very repetitive and the characters go from amusingly exaggerated to annoying. The show constantly points at its plot-holes (like a lot of parodies do) but just ignores them instead of making jokes on that. Out of the 5 episodes i watched 2 of them felt like filler. Overall extremely disappointing and bad.ART: 7/10I cant lie. Even if i do not like the show the animation is pretty good. The visual comedy is probably the funniest part about this car-crash and it has the quality you would expect from an anime like this. It isn\'t anything we haven\'t seen before and it doesnt compare to some of the other shows that are airing this season. (ex:Dragon Maid-sama S2)SOUND: 7/10Again, I cant really say the music is horrible, actually, I really enjoyed the OP and ED and the sound design was actually done pretty well. The only problem i would have is the sometimes over-repetitive music is present (like most romances done by small studios) but overall the sound is the best part about the show. Don\'t go in expecting too much tho.Character: 3/10From the best part we go to the worst. It gets a 3 because Saki is an amazing character and perfect for a parody, her voice-acting is amazing and she is build really well. As for everyone else, utter garbage. The MC might be the worst character of this season and Nagisa is so void of a personality that it hurts. Rika seems to be the same as Nagisa so far. The characters are the 2nd most important part of a parody and this show fumbles them hard.Enjoyment: 3/10Other than the 2nd episode i didn\'t really find myself excited for any of the new episodes or encouraged to watch more at a time. Actually i find the latter impossible because of the repetitive jokes and annoying characters. In the end it feels like a chore to watch, and about mid-way through the 3rd episode i already realised that GxG isn\'t going to be good anytime soon. It was the most boring show this season by far.ENDING STATEMENT: Its rare that we get a parody anime. It\'s even rarer that it actually is good. Girlfriend x Girlfriend isn\'t. Even if i didn\'t like it i hope Tezuka Productions bounces back from this and gets some better manga/LN to adapt because they have shown that they can deliver on the technical side. Even so, i cant recommend this show to anyone.OVERALL: 4/10 (closer to a 5) sense. The jokes become very repetitive and the characters go from amusingly exaggerated to annoying.

So please keep that in mind, for future weeks as we often get more episodes.Well yes, I definitely understand the big flaws in the series, and yes, it can be quite trashy at times. I acknowledge that. however, some part of the series, especially the open mindedness of most of the characters, is quite frankly very relieving. I say this, because I’ve seen a couple of reviews calling trashy, and even some of the people praising it acknowledge the trash and as of this series. And like...I said I acknowledge that, but I want to make sure that we don’t get carried away and just focusing on that one aspect of the series. We’ve seen far too much of that with reviews in general, and I wanna make sure that we don’t go down the same path with this one.So with all that said, here’s my review of the series thus far. The story is quite bizarre, and is quite poorly told to be quite frank. I like the very general premise of the series, like I said before, but some parts are just ludicrous even by harem standards. I mean, having the two girls in question move in with the main guy, and the parents are just perfectly OK with that? I call BS on that. Plus the main guy Naoya can be very annoying at times! He’s very melodramatic, and considering all the drama that we’ve seen in recent years in just our day-to-day lives, it’s not a very pleasant thing to see, to say the least. Remember, anime is supposed to be an escape, not a reminder. And that’s all the really bad things I can think of thus far, with the exception of a couple of gross scenes like trying to eat lunch in some of the restrooms? Blech, disgusting!So now onto the good things. First, there’s the very general premise of the story. No matter how unrealistic it is, remember, this is a story so to be fair, it’s not supposed to be entirely realistic. A guy confessing to his childhood friend, and upon being confessed to another girl, being unable to turn her down, and actually asking the girl that he confessed to, with the second girl I might add, that he can’t reject her, but he still has feelings for her, and then he would like to date both of them. So yeah, at this point, it is genuinely absolutely ridiculous. Totally unrealistic, I get that. But we needed that set up, so we could get something really amazing afterwords.And what that was, is a guy dating two girls at the same time, willingly and with the full knowledge from both girls about the situation. And yeah, I was thinking “this has disaster written all over it” too. However, I was quite shocked and impressed, that not only wasn’t it really, but the two girls genuinely have care for not just the guy, but for each other. Even going so far as to help out one or the other, when they get down regarding the situation. It actually shows quite a bit of maturity, which is shocking considering what the series is supposed to be about.And speaking of mature, how about Saki Saki? Wow, not only is she a class act, but she’s very rational too. I think for the most part, she would do the same sort of things we would do if we were in her shoes. She may be my favorite character, but it’s still too soon to say. Like I said, Naoya he’s very annoying quite often, but he also has a very good heart, and shows genuine care and compassion, sometimes too much actually. And the girls themselves point that out, and try to direct him to do otherwise. And then there’s Nagisa. To put it simply, she has “innocence” written all over it. I guess that she is that type of character, there’s usually always one really innocent, wholesome character in the bunch, so I guess that in this case, it’s Nagisa. And finally, there’s this new girl, Rika, the “parody YouTube” boobstreamer. For those of you who don’t know what a boobstreamer is, it’s a girl who makes videos showing off her, curvaceous figure if you will. And in terms of commitment, she makes Naoya seem like a cool customer. I mean, camping out in the backyard of the main cast, just to try to impress the guy, even though that he said himself that’s not what he wanted? geez, chill out a bit.And the music and sound effects are just outstanding! I think this is the best aspect of the series to be quite frank. I absolutely love the opening theme, and a lot of the music in between is great. And I especially love the sound effects too. The art isn’t too impressive, but then again, like I said about the nature of this type of series, it’s like, what do you expect? I mean some parts are good, don’t get me wrong.So that’s it, at this point after five episodes, I’ll give it a 7/10. I said I acknowledge that, but I want to make sure that we don’t get carried away and just focusing on that one aspect of the series.

If you don't believe that, then you will hate this show. On its surface it is no different than all the dime a dozen harem shows, however the honesty of the 3 main characters really holds this whole show together. They all want to date together honestly, and the quirky moments end of feeling incidental to the show.HOWEVER.This only holds true for the first 5-ish episodes of the show, and a bit of the final episode.  The middle part of the show is dragged down by a girl called Milkers who has big boobs.  The...show will try to justify her existence but she actually adds NOTHING to the show and only negatively impacts it.  At first, I thought she was a unique addition with her aggressiveness and modern sensibilities, but she ends up outstaying her welcome and ignoring the main character who VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY tells her no when she asks to date him.You COULD claim the series main theme is determination to never give up on what you want, it is brought up plenty of times to agree with this sentiment. But when it was made very clear, multiple times, that the main character was not interested in her, that should've been it with this character. And unfortunately she occupies a large middle chunk of this season.The saddest part is that this show was on its way to being a 10/10 for its genre if not for this huge, pointless, arc.Now then. The music ranges from average to fairly catchy, but overall it is probably unmemorable.The art was very good, however many times there are details said about the girls that aren't shown within the show, like muscle tone and hair details. But of course boob size can be shown easily so it's there.Also it's worth noting that some legal issues were brought up near the end of the series that mention how marrying two people in Japan isn't legal, and some other issues are likely to show up as well, EVENTUALLY. But within a school setting, there shouldn't be any real drama considering how honest the 3 main characters are.Also I guess either Japan doesn't know about Mormons or it's just straight up illegal there I guess.In short, the show is amazing as a drama for the first 4 episodes with pieces of genuine humor. Then it turns into a purely trashy comedy with Milkers and is complete garbage.Then the final episode is good again, but I'm pretty sure Milkers will stick around that I worry for a sequel season.   Also the last girl introduced, Shino, seems like a good addition, so it's not like new character can't ever be brought in and work with the show. show will try to justify her existence but she actually adds NOTHING to the show and only negatively impacts it.

Then there are those who believe that in order for an Anime to be good it needs to be as sophisticated as HXH or FMAB. I don\'t believe that a plot is what matters for a story to be enjoyable, characters are paramount to writing a story people will like. GF GF is one of those anime that doesn\'t take itself seriously which is something I can respect. However I am going to...break this review into 5 Categories: Story, Production, Characters, Enjoyment, & My overall feelingsStory: 6/10A highschool boy doesn\'t want to choose between two girls, why not date both? It makes sense to look at this plot and be disgusted by the idea but with the way the show handles it, it does a fairly good job. I loved Rent-a-Girlfriend so going into this anime I had a feeling of what to expect and that\'s exactly what I got from start to finish. These harem plots are not my cup of tea for the most part so this section and most of them (with the exception of one category) are subjective to me.Production: 3/10This is by far the worst aspect of the Anime. The animation in this show it dirt poor, they rely way too heavily on zoom ups and still frames and you can really tell how rough the animation is here. The art seems decent however the lining and the filter they seem to add makes the anime look a bit ugly. This isn\'t meant to disrespect the animators, I am well aware they worked their best here. It\'s just that the end product looks very low budget. The Opening, despite having limited animation, was actually quite creative with it\'s direction. Overall, this is the most objective category here and I wish the Art & Animation looked a bit better.Characters: 4/10Stories with a little to no plot must need interesting and enjoyable characters to watch, they are the face of the series. Upon my time watching anime I learned that (as stated before) Plot is second to characters. That\'s why you have terrible anime such as sword art online in which has a fantastic plot, Lucky star: a show that has no plot but has great characters which makes it enjoyable, and anime like attack on titan which can accomplish both at once. GF GF attempts to go the comedy approach with a light plot but the issue here is that the characters lack enjoyment. The biggest victim here is definitely Naoya. This man is a menace to society looking at the stuff he\'s done on screen. He is the most Shounen esk protag in any rom com I have ever seen. ""The man that never gives up"" ""the man that is oblivious to common sense"" ""the man that has a very select few of emotions"". You watch him on screen and just cringe about every decision he makes. The other female characters are boring. Saki is annoying for most of the season, Minase is a bit too boring until the last episode, Rika\'s goals make no sense considering how popular she is on social media, and we really didn\'t see much of Shino yet. The characters are boring.Enjoyment: 3/10Honestly, If I had to watch the entire season back to back I don\'t think i\'d finish it. Watching this anime felt like a chore. The comedy was too generic and like everything we have seen in a romcom like this before. Rent a Girlfriend was sort of the same way however in that anime, it looked beautiful and I don\'t hate Kazuya (HOT TAKE). I\'m not here to look for a FMAB type story, I love anime that are light; however this anime did not capture my interest.I recommend this anime if:- You Love Harems- Love Highschool settings- Love searching for new waifus- You are looking for time to burnI DO NOT recommend this anime if:- You are someone who hates harems- Hates stupid MC\'s- Wants a plot heavy story- You get bored easilyMight be a hot take for some. If you enjoyed GF GF that\'s awesome, enjoy the anime you like. For me, this show wasted my time and I am most likely not waiting to watch season 2 if it happens to be released.

Thank You for reading my review, I greatly appreciate it!', ""This is what harem anime should be, fun, dumb, and not trying to be realistic / dramatic.I love that everyone speak their mind out loud & being honest in this anime, no complicated social norm or logic, it's easy to watch and laugh at the absurdity of this anime.Why this anime entertain me is probably because in real life i must think about social norm, consequences, and other factors before i express myself or do something, but in this anime screw all that, let just be honest do whatever we want and have fun. It feels very nice break from 'think before you act' norm,...very satisfying escape, now that's what i call entertainment. Just like people love watching horror to feel the danger without actually in danger, this anime do the same with breaking social norm.Probably this is the first harem anime where i enjoy the 'harem' aspect, because this anime didn't ask me to take it seriously. It become very enjoyable absurd fantasy where girls fight mindlessly for a guy with everyone basically doing socially unacceptable things all the time. very satisfying escape, now that's what i call entertainment.

It's unfortunate but I can at least appreciate their characters and they all had some really great comedic moments.Overall I'm not sure if I recommend this anime, it's not bad per se but it just didn't go where I wanted it to, the serious elements just didn't fit whatsoever but maybe the comedy makes this worth watching it's up to you!

If you take this seriously, no shot you’ll like it. If you don’t find this funny, it’ll be a drag. There’s tidbits of fanservice if you care about that. Animation’s fine, but characters are the real treat. They are complete trash.I think Girlfriend, Girlfriend, Rejected Girlfriend, and Vicariously-Living Girlfriend is a deconstruction of harems. I say I think since the original author wrote Aho Girl which was a joke, so later he probably saw Quintessential Quintuplets and was inspired to make a harem satire. And satire it is, since everyone in this show is overly dense and randomly horny....That sounds awful, but the absurdity is cranked up to a point where it wouldn’t be entertaining without it.Sakisaki is the resident tsundere main girl, Nagisa works hard and is too caring, and Milika wants to end Naoya’s polyamorous relationship since she wants him by herself. Naoya Pannacotta Fugo, the main guy, is lovingly shallow like the beach water I dip my toes in while enjoying the gentle sea salt breeze at Santa Cruz.

I make protein shakes and smoothies with it; estrogen too. Cows work hard to produce gallons everyday. I thank the dirt for my lunch, as the dirt grew the grass they ate to make the dairy. Low-fat 1% is my favorite, but Milika is whole milk in the sense that she contributes the most content in the show. Her introductory arc has her camp outside the dude’s house and film MeTube videos, content within content. Did you know whole milk isn’t 98% or 100% fat, but 3.25%? Sakisaki is 2% reduced fat milk. The industry standard, she beats the shit out of Naoya because slapstick is funny. Nagisa is fat-free skim milk. You can’t go wrong with choosing that. It’s nice and has less calories. Shino’s existence in the show is basically like the opening. Kinda there, far away, not really involved. She isn’t important until like the last three or two episodes, so you barely know her. Her shtick is being stripped naked for some reason. Read the manga if you like girls who resemble stereotypical grandmas.

It’s not that it’s a harem, it’s not that it’s an ecchi, it’s just the entire plot and character development is just—lukewarm. We’ll break it down.One of the most important things about a RomCom lies in the emotional stakes and chemistry between the characters. Off the bat, our protagonist Naoya is completely lacking. He’s extremely daft, which seems to legitimize his “two-timing” in a way that “he doesn’t know better”. But like, this daftness is frankly kind of irritating, to anybody who watches it, but his girlfriends seem entirely enamored by it. These two...girlfriends in question are:1. Saki, who is a childhood friend and somehow fell in love with him despite his clingy, no personality persistence.and2. Minase, who seemed to fell in love of him because... I don’t even know, he’s genuinely unattractive by how daft he can be.Neither of these love interests are earned in any way. The protagonist isn’t even a real person most of the time. The only relationship I can understand is Milika’s, whose arc’s finale was one of the few, genuine cute moments of the show. And even then, I find that the writers really had to twist Milika’s character arc to have her fall in love with him, even considering his white knight act, but I’m honestly okay with that.At the end of the show, the show falls more and more into a drawn out boredom, because the onsen arc is really just boring. We see Naoya repeat the same thing under the same consequences, no new character development is formed, and the ones that do just lack any impact.I suppose it’s worth a watch if you’re bored, but it’s not much but a B-tier harem in a really saturated market of stories which have already done it better. girlfriends in question are:1.

Now, fascinating is a weird word to use to describe the interest of this show. Looking at the title, the promo art or reading the synopsis, you know exactly what kind of show this is going to be. I saw it from a mile away and didn’t bother watching it at first because I knew exactly what kind of show it wanted to be. But after looking at some clips on Crunchyroll’s Youtube channel (Side note; what is with Crunchyroll’s video titles lately?), I found it pretty funny actually and...preceded to watch the first episode. Here I am now telling you why this show is actually one of the most enjoyable, trashy anime I’ve watched lately.Sit back, relax and scream to the rooftops you want two waifus to go out with as I present to you the anime review for Girlfriend, Girlfriend. Let’s begin.Story: 6/10Our story follows Naoya Mukai who finally gets to date his long childhood friend, Saki Saki. However, things take a strange turn when another girl, Nagisa Minase, confesses her feelings to Naoya. Naoya, not wanting to hurt Nagisa’s feelings, decides to offer a proposition to Saki by suggesting that he two times Saki and Nagisa to not hurt either girl’s feelings. Saki naturally rejects it at first, but reluctantly agrees to it and just like that, Naoya is in a three way relationship with Saki and Nagisa.And thus, the shenanigans begin. The story is entirely focused on this three way relationship and the constant wrenches thrown into their plans to keep it under wraps. The narrative isn’t really a focal point to this show as it’s mainly used to keep the core premise of show constant throughout its runtime. Instead, it focuses on the scenarios that would be normal for a standard relationship, but this ain’t a standard relationship so things get awkward and they have to make compromises now. This does lead to the show’s comedy of just how our characters tackle these situations and to be fair, they are pretty hilarious. Just seeing these characters trying to wrap their heads around these things and try to make compromises does make me laugh. It is the fact though that this show does have no shame about what it is. It gladly embraces it which I think helps the show be more loose and try to have fun with itself.The show even throws some wildcards in there to keep to change things up every now and then to keep it fresh. Otherwise, I think the story would have been putting our lead characters situations that would have been, “this is what a couple would do, but now with a three way relationship.” It does mainly come into play with the two other girls, Rika Hoshizaki and Shino Kiryuu, to keep Naoya, Saki and Nagisa on their toes or risk having their relationship be exposed to the public. Although that doesn’t stop Naoya but I will get to that. But I will say, Rika’s introduction does cause a real padded out middle section in this series and causes the pacing to slow down. Before, it was going at a nice pace but when a couple of episodes after Rika gets introduced, its starts to stretch itself out and gets a bit tedious, despite it still having some funny moments in there as well.Characters: 7.5/10The characters do help carry the comedy as well as they are pretty much all idiots but in their own way of stupidity. Let’s start with Naoya. In terms of high school harem protagonists, Naoya is probably one of the most refreshing protagonists in this archetype. Sure he looks the part, but he doesn’t act like it. He has a big heart with a loud voice. He’s very much always thinking of how to make both Saki and Nagisa happy to make this relationship work; even apologising if he believes he is not doing a good job of it and will reassure that he will try harder. It’s refreshing to see a protagonist of these genres be so different from the norm. It can make for some funny comedy if he reads the room wrong because he’s trying to do the right thing. He’s fully aware though that this three way relationship is wrong but doesn’t want to hurt either Saki or Nagisa’s feelings. Don’t get me wrong, he’s still as dense as a brick and struggles to read the room but at least he responds differently. But his personality can get annoying at times because of that loud mouth of his. It often leads to some groaning moments because he’s shouting things that he shouldn’t be saying out loud again and again. It’s part of his personality sure, but does get annoying by the end.Saki would probably be considered our resident Tsundere yet she isn’t entirely Tsundere but she is a bit of a hothead, with her always misunderstanding thing and jumping to conclusions right away. This is her brand of idiocy that causes her to have the best reactions out of any other character. I think she only sticks to this relationship because she doesn’t want to be seen as a bad girlfriend.  Determined to prove to be the better girlfriend, she strives to be more appealing to Naoya despite Naoya’s determination to treat Saki and Nagisa equally. This does make her my favourite due to her shenanigans and misconceptions. The fact that she also has a pretty dirty mind and that she may be bisexual also makes it pretty hilarious, especially early on in this series.Then there is Nagisa. A cute, innocent girl who just simply wants to make Naoya happy and dedicate her life to pretty much do that. This is where her idiocy comes in because while she will make sure that Naoya is happy, it does put her in some awkward spots and the fact that she pretty much sucks with her academics due to all that time preparing to be the perfect girlfriend to Naoya. She’s a good counterpart to Saki because she has an opposite personality where she is more collected and willing whereas Saki is prone to lashing out and doesn’t always agree with Naoya’s decisions, even though she resorts to blackmail quite a lot. Her chemistry with Saki is great and it’s funny seeing them two try to think of ways to help or cheer up Naoya. Or lie to keep Naoya to themselves.Rika (or Milika) and Shino act more as roleplayers but do have good chemistry with our characters. Shino does do that a little too late though but Milika just clicks. A Gacha Youtuber who uses her large cleavage as clickbait (Smart). She has a tendency to not give up and commit to the task at hand. We see this not long after her introduction of this in full display. She is the wild card element in this, not knowing when she will strike to force herself on Naoya. It’s also where the story stagnates somewhat because the episodes will then boil down to, “when will she strike” because you know its coming but it’s also the frequency of when she does it. They do try to mix it up so it doesn’t get too stagnant at least.Animation: 6.5/10Animation has never been a focal point in these kind of shows and it is the same here. But I will say, these character designs do a great job of making these girls cute; which is one of the golden rules when making a harem anime. Their eyes especially make them really cute. They do also express well which does help with the comedy. Saki stands out in this regard considering she acts as the overreacting character of this series. As for the rest of the animation, it’s fine. Art direction is solid but the animation itself is nothing special.Sound: 7.5/10This soundtrack definitely knows when to turn it on and when to turn it down. When it wants to be serious and loud, it can be and produces humorous results. When it wants to be calm and...well...serious, but in a different way, it can be quite touching. I don’t think it’s the best and the more over the top part of the ost really does overshadow the rest of the ost, but it does add to the scenes just to make it a bit funnier.I actually like the opening in this show. ""Fuzaketenaize"" by Necry Talkiehas a very nice beat to it with the drums and guitar. It also doesn’t feel like it’s trying to hit that high note and just wants to give a cool beat to it. Recommend that you listen it with headphones as well. As for the visuals, hope you like triangles because the symbolism of the three way relationship is all over the place; with also some literal and symbolic interference from Milika and Shino. Actually, now I think on this, this OP is a lot better than I give credit. Now I do think there are better openings but this is one of the best this season.The ED is also pretty good but not as good as the OP.  ""Pinky Hook"" by Momo Asakura is mainly good for it’s visuals with the song just complimenting it. Now I’m not talking about the girls in their swimsuits (Although, that does get a thumbs up from me), but rather when we see the girls use their phones. We see them using them from a third person view but in the background, we see a first person view of them using their phones. I just think that it’s kind of neat. Again not as good as the OP but pretty solid.Conclusion:I actually would give this show some credit, this turned out to be a better show than I initially thought. I would have thought this would be a simple guilty pleasure show (which honestly was filled by Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory this season)  turned into, in my opinion, a legit, funny show. I think the humour is good, it’s characters are enjoyable if annoying at times and it does have some solid production values. I do think that this concept of a three way relationship from the word go was executed pretty well with the various scenarios and the characters that help make it work. But the most important thing, it has some good waifus in a season where there are a lot of quality waifus that you can make a solid case for being best girl.Now, this is all subjective. It still has those trashy elements that can turn people away and I would kind of agree. But this is guilty pleasure with extra steps that help make it a solid show. I don’t think you can really go wrong checking this out and seeing if you like it or not. I mean, from the synopsis alone, you should have a clear idea if you are going to enjoy it or not. But that maybe hypocritical of me to say because I said at the beginning of this review that I initially didn’t watch it, only to pick it up a little bit later. So it is worth to at least check out because who knows, you might actually enjoy it.My Personal Enjoyment: 8.5/10Overall Score: 7.2/10 Recommendation: Consider it preceded to watch the first episode. Here I am now telling you why this show is actually one of the most enjoyable, trashy anime I’ve watched lately.Sit back, relax and scream to the rooftops you want two waifus to go out with as I present to you the anime review for Girlfriend, Girlfriend.

""Fuzaketenaize"" by Necry Talkiehas a very nice beat to it with the drums and guitar. It also doesn’t feel like it’s trying to hit that high note and just wants to give a cool beat to it. Recommend that you listen it with headphones as well. As for the visuals, hope you like triangles because the symbolism of the three way relationship is all over the place; with also some literal and symbolic interference from Milika and Shino. Actually, now I think on this, this OP is a lot better than I give credit. Now I do think there are better openings but this is one of the best this season.The ED is also pretty good but not as good as the OP.  ""Pinky Hook"" by Momo Asakura is mainly good for it’s visuals with the song just complimenting it. Now I’m not talking about the girls in their swimsuits (Although, that does get a thumbs up from me), but rather when we see the girls use their phones. We see them using them from a third person view but in the background, we see a first person view of them using their phones. I just think that it’s kind of neat. Again not as good as the OP but pretty solid.Conclusion:I actually would give this show some credit, this turned out to be a better show than I initially thought. I would have thought this would be a simple guilty pleasure show (which honestly was filled by Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory this season)  turned into, in my opinion, a legit, funny show. I think the humour is good, it’s characters are enjoyable if annoying at times and it does have some solid production values. I do think that this concept of a three way relationship from the word go was executed pretty well with the various scenarios and the characters that help make it work. But the most important thing, it has some good waifus in a season where there are a lot of quality waifus that you can make a solid case for being best girl.Now, this is all subjective. It still has those trashy elements that can turn people away and I would kind of agree. But this is guilty pleasure with extra steps that help make it a solid show. I don’t think you can really go wrong checking this out and seeing if you like it or not. I mean, from the synopsis alone, you should have a clear idea if you are going to enjoy it or not. But that maybe hypocritical of me to say because I said at the beginning of this review that I initially didn’t watch it, only to pick it up a little bit later. So it is worth to at least check out because who knows, you might actually enjoy it.My Personal Enjoyment: 8.5/10Overall Score: 7.2/10 Recommendation: Consider it', ""The anime is nonsense has a poor story but after all this, it will definitely make you laugh.Although the characters are not that great but their lines definitely are !!To enjoy this show leave all logic and smart shit out the door and enjoy as it comes to you.Really loved Saki Saki taunts, bitching and almost everything about her character from start to end. The character of Mianse and Naoya is kind of okayish. Milika is san is above average too. Shino's character is shitshow who don't get much screentime or important stuff to do in the show.(Saki 10/10 naoya minase 7/10 milika 8/10 shino...3/10)Hope you enjoy it! 3/10)Hope you enjoy it!"", 'well, it\'s kind of hard to review this one.

It was like 50 Eps each day during my high school time, but now 5 episodes per week are all I can afford. I\'m saying this so you guys can get a picture of how I see this anime.*Anime Review Starts Here*Well, my first impression of this anime was a trashy story, cringy characters, the MC is just an unloyal brat despite his justification. Was I wrong about...that? NO, but DANG this anime is very very very entertaining.....yes, as a man I hate the MC. he is unloyal, selfish, and an idiot.yes, the girlfriend is kinda airheaded. why the hell does she accept his BF wants to have another GF.I planned to drop this anime after the 7th episode or so. But after the season ended, I was surprised that this anime is the only anime I didn\'t drop. Why\'s that?Well, saying this anime\'s story trash is just like saying Gintama\'s story plagiarism......Yep, this anime is kinda stupid and i curse the characters a lot. But, I cursed the character while literally laughing MAO.In the end, this anime is a pure entertainment comedy. Nothing is deep, or serious in this anime. we won\'t get a deeply psychological story like in the Monogatari series, a touching fantasy romance in the Your Name, or a mystery like in the ""erased"". Because this anime is not them and never intended to be like them.

YES', ""Don't take this show at face value. It may look bland and boring because it's a harem, but it's really not. The main character only has eyes for the 2 girls that he's in love with.Kanojo mo Kanojo is not something that takes itself too seriously, in case the first episode wasn't clear enough. It's ridiculous, but comedic at heart.The characters, while clearly not intended to be individuals who have deep, moving backstories (if it's not clear enough by now) are goofballs. They're not supposed to be characters with a deep backstory.The art is definitely enough to keep me looking at everything this...show has to offer. Whether it be the character designs, or the places they go. It always has at least 1 thing to make me think it's cute and bubbly.The sounds are always entertaining, the VA's are entertaining. Hell, Rie Takahashi is in this show, and she's an out of this world VA with incredible vocal range, but this review isn't just a Rierii worship review.I enjoy this show because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It allows me to turn my brain off for 23 minutes, and I will never complain about being given time to let my brain shut off for a little while.It's not the greatest show of all time, and it never intended to be. It's just a show about a dude trying to balance out a relationship with 2 girls he loves very much with plenty of harem and rom com hilarity that comes with it.The point of this review is to tell all the people who are just being negative about it just to be negative to go ahead and step back, take a breather, and come back with a more positive attitude, and if you feel like you are somehow special enough to be offended by this, then you really need to take a mental health day and just simmer down.A negative mind will never live a positive life.

There is a slight plot in the regard that MC is the equivalent of an NTR lover, but that\'s it. There is nothing else. Women do things. Man does resulting thing. No cohesion, no build up, just ""thing happens"". This is even meant to be a comedy anime, but I didn\'t laugh a single time in my 2 episode viewing time. I was both watching to poke fun at my least favourite genres and to actually see why my friend told me...to watch this. I can tell you that, as a ""comedy"" anime, it unsurprisingly brings nothing funny to the table, similar to many other comedy anime.Art: 4Very basic. It\'s nothing special. Simple, basic, no massive colour depth, just blobs of colour, but they\'ll do. After all, this is meant to be a harem anime.Sound: 5The music is OK. The opening is dreadful. It plays, and plays, and plays, and just feels boring. Compared to something that just repeats like Kokkoku\'s OP, Flashback, it falls flat. Flashback is very good in how it repeats it\'s entire chorus thing that it had. However this OP? Plain boring. The rest of the sound? It\'s alright. Background music is OK, and it fits the genre.Characters: 2MC is an autist. He is over the top, speaks his mind too much and is overall an annoying and utterly stupid character. I see why they gave him this personality quirk to differentiate him from being a borderline hentai protagonist, but really? A loud mouthed, spacially unaware joke?The 2 main girls are even worse. Both of them are essentially the same damn character with different hair and different breast sizes. One can cook, one does sports. Wow. I will say that the MC and red haired girl play off each other fairly well and actually seem like childhood friends, but still, they don\'t work together as a 3. The blue haired girl is just plain annoying.Enjoyment: 1I was in a call with multiple people watching the first episode of this show, and they could hear my suffering. This show is utter garbage. I wanted to die because of how many tropes and unfunny jokes and one liners were being used. I didn\'t even have fun making fun of this shitshow.Overall: 2I\'m being nice and tacking on an extra point for effort. That\'s it. This show is trash. If you want NTR, watch Netsuzou TRap.

You love watching stupid characters being hilariously stupid together2.

I kept hoping that GG would live up to that level of insane comedy, and while the style of humour is similar, it runs out of steam early on and never recovers.  Aho Girl had a couple of things going for it that GG lacks.  Its premise was broader, so the comedy took in the full scope of Yoshiko's idiotic antics, making each episode varied and unpredictable.  GG is hamstrung by its singular focus on the fact...that a guy is openly two-timing his girlfriends.  The same gags are repeated over and over, and it quickly gets tedious.  At the same time, it's trying to be an earnest romance series half the time, but that side of it is just a grab-bag of tired cliches.  The other advantage Aho Girl has was its shorter episodes; this author's style of comedy is very rapid, and the full-length episodes of GG make everything feel slow and drawn out.It doesn't help that the animation is sub-par.  Art is generally on-model, but the sheet count is so low that it feels like a motion comic half the time.  In the end, the story gives no compelling reason to keep watching past the first few episodes. that a guy is openly two-timing his girlfriends.

Because if you do, you'll have pure trash to be swallowed, and if you don't, you'll have an experience worth watching for...**No Spoilers**Story - 6/10-As you already should know, Kanojo mo Kanojo is a very mediocre series. It dwells on using very weird fantasies and conflicts the author had created but goes through a very smooth path introducing the plot and characters. However, it doesn't make up for the lackluster that is: The plot. As it's really dumbfounded and overall a pretty bad thought, but the execution of the series makes it a little...bit better than it should.Art - 6.75/10-The art is really vibrant and colorful. It uses bright, brimming colours that'll make you not want to fall asleep and makes it for an enjoyable look. However, the animation is not consistent as it looks very roughly drawn at times, making for weird eye placements and body composition... Certain still-shots do look magnificent though ;)Sound - 7.5/10-The opening and ending are really catchy and the voices for characters really make you feel at home watching anime. The voices fit perfectly if listened long enough and the OST's make for an alright enhancement for scenes. Sound effects, as expected for an ecchi/romance, are really good too.Characters - 8/10-These characters are of course the most generic over-used things of all of anime-industry: But what if that's what makes it good? Unlike other series, Kanojo mo Kanojo has the knowledge of knowing what their characters are. They're straightforward and each have a supporting role to the series. either to give us some fanservice, romance, comedy, the series really nails in making you care. And we also get an ecchi/romcom MC who's not as dense as others and strives when the thought is around, so let's be grateful.Enjoyment - 8/10- Adding all those good points I've made, I really enjoyed the series as a whole. It was nice having a lie down watching and not have a care in the world as watching this series makes you feel really comfortable and warm. The moments it makes are also really memorable and through out almost each episode I've had a laugh or two. Really great stuff.Overall - 7.5/10- Overall this series is great. It manages to subdue you throughout and introduces great chemistry between characters. I had a lot of fun watching and it really made me care about the romance genre a lot more. I know it has its overwhelming amount of cons, but if you sit back and relax, this anime will be one comforting watch for the ages.If you've actually made it down here, thanks for the read.

I\'ll try my best to avoid stepping on any spoilers for the actual substance in the plot.It\'s not often I see an accurate depiction of polyamory in anime, considering the nature of the consumer-base I\'m not surprised at all this is the first time I came across something like it. As of writing this, I have two partners, we\'ve been together for years, and get along just great, so maybe I\'m biased, but at the very least I have the lived experience necessary to give...this anime a review without labeling it as a ""Harem"" anime... even if it does an admittedly mediocre job at avoiding those tropes. It tries at the very least, and doesn\'t dance around it with ""Oh no, protag-kun has to choose one of us!"" like every harem I\'ve watched, the anime goes out of its way to point out how fucked up it is to have to do something like that when you\'re in that position.The characters are very obviously exaggerated, as they should be in any anime in my opinion, aiming for realism in any genre is boring, bordering on discomforting, which is why the anime is made the way it is, over the top characters are great for getting laughs out of people like me... Which, it did a good job at. I was actually rolling in laughter during some episodes, the characters are meant to be laughed at due to their absurdities, even if you can relate to them, you can still laugh at the fact that at the very least you aren\'t as bad as that, and THAT\'S fun for me.Though most of the drama in the anime itself stems from the protagonist\'s over the top nature, and the main 3 having to hide their relationship from the prying eyes of their peers, considering their age it\'s perfectly reasonable for them to all be horrified at the prospect of gossip spreading and tarnishing their reputations. They\'re naive in alot of aspects though, and it humanizes them, and in-spite of everything I find myself still rooting for Naoya, not because I think he\'s the most sociable person on the planet or because I\'m biased from having dealt with the stress involved in both being in that position and being on the receiving end of those kind of actions, but rather because he\'s committed in trying his absolute best to make things work regardless of what the world around him may view it as, you can\'t call it anything but noble.The artwork and animation is about what I\'d expect out of a direct transcription of the manga, this one in particular actually shocked me with how close the anime is to the manga in that sense, it\'s as if the pages came to life and started moving exactly as they did in my mind. Though as a composer, the music is a bit of a let-down... It\'s nothing remarkable as far as Anime goes in current year and doesn\'t do much to drive the motion forward that stark silence wouldn\'t do better most of the time. The OP is a bop though, This is one of the few anime where I don\'t skip the OP after hearing it once.The pacing actually kinda blew me away, each episode somehow only felt like 5 minutes at most and I was left astounded when I realized an entire episode had passed just like that, it\'s absolutely AMAZING to binge because of that.I\'m no anime watching expert, let alone a reviewer, this is my first time ever reviewing something this seriously outside of rambling to my friends, so make of this what you will.

Also sorry if I use grammar mistakes or use commas in the wrong area, I\'m bad at grammar.Girlfriend, Girlfriend (also known as: Kanojo mo Kanojo) is a very... unique anime. I\' m not saying that as a negative thing though. It\'s definitely not a masterpiece, it has its flaws, but it\'s not horrible.This story follows a regular guy named Naoya, his life is (supposedly)...""perfect."" He has a girlfriend named Saki Saki, and he loves her, despite that they both only started dating recently. That all changes when Nagisa enters the anime. (very quickly) and asks Naoya on a date. A regular person would just tell her that they already have a girlfriend and politely decline, but Naoya thinks Nagisa is cute and felt bad declining. Nagisa and Naoya barely even know each other, yet Nagisa has been working her whole life for this confession. She has done everything to make sure she looked good. Naoya decides to ask his girlfriend, Saki Saki, if he can date both of them and Saki Saki says no, obviously. But after a lot of begging, Saki finally says yes and Naoya is now dating both Saki and Nagisa. Anyways, back on to me review...I do love animes that include LGBTQ+ (for this anime being polyamorous) but this anime just isn\'t all that great. To be fair, when I first watched this anime, I loved it. But now, looking back... It just wasn\'t that good. I don\'t know how to explain it. I\'d say the story is for the most part, a little original. I mean, it\'s not everyday where you see a polyamorous anime. But I felt like there was something missing from this anime. The characters were mostly unlikable. I personally hated Naoya and Nagisa. Saki was best girl, Rika and Shino were pretty okay.Answering the main question: Would I recommend this anime? Well... It depends!If you like Rom coms, I\'d say you\'d enjoy this anime. It\'s definitely not for everyone, but it\'s not all that bad. But I do have to say, the art is kind of terrible. It\'s one of those so bad that It\'s good animes. If you liked Rent-a-Girlfriend, then I think you would enjoy Girlfriend, Girlfriend.

THIS is that anime. I can honestly say in this case, that ""it\'s so bad, it\'s kinda rlly good"".The plot after the first episode is just Naoya trying to live with his harem and- expanding it. It\'s pretty funny, cringe asf and sometimes...just sometimes....rlly freaking wholesome.If you\'ve got free time in your hands and wanna watch a show devoid of any logic, kinda cringe harem and a funny plot-look no further...this is it.Overall, I\'ll give this a 6/10 for the sheer humour and second hand embarrassment very enjoyable and you can\'t stop watching.

First off, this isn\'t a trashy show, and it isn\'t an intellectual show, and there\'s no deeper meaning. It\'s straight absurdist comedy.The story is a pretty generic high school romance...story, just with the MC already in a relationship, and then adding another girlfriend. There\'s nothing particularly daring here, but it works really well. The biggest weakness is the art, it\'s not terrible, but it\'s pretty mediocre, although you don\'t watch a show like this for the animation or artwork.The biggest strength is the voice acting, it is absolutely on point. Ayane Sakura is fantastic, as is Junya Enoki and Ayana Taketatsu. I don\'t know if I\'ve seen a comedy with VA\'s as well rounded as this.Overall, for a quick laugh where you can unwind after the week, and power your brain down to the combined brainpower of the character in this show, I highly recommend it. story, just with the MC already in a relationship, and then adding another girlfriend.

At this point there was already much discussion about how it may be the trashiest anime of 2021, and I absolutely had to see it with my own eyes. Now, after 12 long episodes, I have a few things to say...If you enjoy shows that don't take themselves too seriously, then this may be right up your alley. Just be aware that this is NOT going to be a very good show by any standard. The main character is painful to watch navigate social situations, the two girlfriends are the most stereotypical female harem...characters imaginable, the show's pacing is poor at best, the fan service borders dangerously close to outright hentai at times, and it seems the only thing that furthers the plot is sex. In many ways, this is the worst show I've seen in a while. However, there is a certain silver lining in this show's failings.Story (4/10): *SPOILER WARNING* The story is so bad that at many points it is outright comical. I've laughed almost as much watching this show as I did watching Konosuba, and it definitely delivered more enjoyment than many other so-called comedies that I've seen. Yes, the story has many genuine flaws regarding pacing and character development, but are you really watching Girlfriend Girlfriend for the character development?!? The one thing that really does pain me about the story is the lackluster ending. I wish the story could have stayed more on the comical side, but the writers really pushed for an emotional moment in the last episode that falls completely flat due to the absurdity of the previous 11 episodes. Nonetheless, I genuinely enjoyed the Rika/Milika arc and thought it was a great few episodes, but, unfortunately, it seems the story peaked there.Art (7/10): The art is quite nice. I'm a fan of the animation style and I found the show very visually appealing (no, not just in the lewd sense). The female characters all have very distinct looks and associated colors that represented them; from what I remember, Nagisa was almost always wearing something blue with Saki and Rika wearing red and yellow respectively. In terms of quality, the animation is about on-par with other 2021 rom-com releases such as Quintessential Quintuplets. No disappointments here.Sounds (7/10): The opening and ending songs are very good. The OST is about average, and I think it really helps accentuate the comedy at many points. The superb voice acting is one of the true saving graces of this show. Without the proper tone and delivery of some of the lines, I don't think many of the comedic moments would have been nearly as valuable. I was also quite happy to hear Ayana Taketatsu as the voice of Rika given her role as Nino in Quintuplets. I don't know, seems like a fitting role for me.Characters (8/10): I still don't know how I feel about the characters. From many perspectives, they are terrible human beings. They're selfish, psychopathic, inconsistent, and all-around bad people. Yet, they somehow have a certain synergy to them not seen in many other shows. Many interactions over trivial things become entertaining to watch simply because of the characters who are interacting, and the dialogue is something unrivaled in both stupidity and comedy. Rika especially steals the show in this regard; she is by far the most comedic character, and the show is really at its best when she is on screen. Nagisa and Saki don't disappoint either. They're constantly quarreling over breast size, who loves Naoya more, and other nonsensical topics. Because of this, I enjoyed watching Nagisa, Saki, and Rika despite hating the tropes they're based around.Enjoyment (8/10): I hate to admit it, but I genuinely enjoyed this show, in part because I knew what I was getting in to. I found it satisfying to turn my brain off and let the nonsense that is Girlfriend Girlfriend take me for a ride. In many ways, this show has the same enjoyment factor as the sweetest of candies and the greasiest of foods; it isn't good for you in any way whatsoever, it may even be detrimental to your health, but there's just something about it that makes it enjoyable. Just take it in small doses otherwise you may lose some IQ points!Overall (7/10): This is a very special 7 out of 10. Compared to other 7's I've given, this show is considerably worse. This should be considered if you seriously intend on watching it. I really can not stress how bad this show is. However, I find myself unable to give it a worse rating simply because of how ridiculous it is. If viewed from the correct perspective, this show can be quite entertaining, but if you go in expecting something of actual quality, you will be greatly disappointed.In summary, watching Girlfriend Girlfriend will surely leave you with a few less brain cells than when you started, but hey, that's okay! Scientists believe the average human has close to 86 billion brain cells, so losing a few won't be so bad. If you can accept this show for what it is, a hybrid between a trainwreck and a dumpster fire, and muster up enough courage to still watch it, then maybe you can enjoy it as much as I did! characters imaginable, the show's pacing is poor at best, the fan service borders dangerously close to outright hentai at times, and it seems the only thing that furthers the plot is sex.

However, I find myself unable to give it a worse rating simply because of how ridiculous it is. If viewed from the correct perspective, this show can be quite entertaining, but if you go in expecting something of actual quality, you will be greatly disappointed.In summary, watching Girlfriend Girlfriend will surely leave you with a few less brain cells than when you started, but hey, that's okay! Scientists believe the average human has close to 86 billion brain cells, so losing a few won't be so bad. If you can accept this show for what it is, a hybrid between a trainwreck and a dumpster fire, and muster up enough courage to still watch it, then maybe you can enjoy it as much as I did!"", ""I have definitley found a hidden gem here, this anime really moved me in ways I didn't think were possible but probably would never re watch though, got boring towards the end but mostly interesting through and through good for those people that just want to kick back and enjoy your avarege harem anime I guess.

That manages to feel so shameless pandering and it managed to make your 12-year old mind look interesting?, well this anime still worse than that.It’s literally all the harem clichés combined together and took a backseat to lackluster world-building and characters with all the personality of a wooden plank. Personally, althrough i find the female characters kind of charismatic, i found the main character Naoya Mukai just so unpleasant, he is obnoxious, annoying, mean to his girlfriends and i think the only way i could laugh...at him was if he was decapitated by a 3d maneuver.But certainly it's your typical high school comedy anime, with all the jokes literally free range of every raunchy, smelly or generic reference in the Japanese animation universe to result in something so drab to watch. But what a surprise  that the jokes mostly involves toilet humor, mainly because one of the characters eats in school bathroom, but we know it's going to unnecessarily stupid because they just have all the enjoyment of hearing a bad uncle joke while waiting on a bank row. at him was if he was decapitated by a 3d maneuver.But certainly it's your typical high school comedy anime, with all the jokes literally free range of every raunchy, smelly or generic reference in the Japanese animation universe to result in something so drab to watch.

I know he tried to be fair in his relationship, but he looks like he tried very hard to be fair. Unlike Fuutaro Uesugi, this guy seems like a terrible simp.

Arguably, a modern masterpiece in the same category as Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer. This anime is a hell of a rollercoster. As most harem anime, this anime has it\'s own world logic that challenges our view on modern soceity. Things that would be considered ""absurd""  and ""crazy"" happen regularly without any of the main characters questioning the ridiculousness of the situations.

Nah, no two-timing for me.” - Kanojo, Okarishimasu Chapter 184A new summer, a new romcom adaptation. Last year, we had Kanojo, Okarishimasu and let’s just say... it was flamed by many people, but that doesn’t include me. I’m a proud KanoKari fan and I’ll perhaps be a fan till it ends. This year though, we have Kanojo mo Kanojo, or in short, KanoKano. Like KanoKari, you have 4 girls to choose from, but UNLIKE KanoKari, I doubt that you can choose one to be your new top waifu.This show... I definitely have mixed feelings about this. It is by far...one of the most ridiculous and cringy shows that I’ve watched, but those factors itself is why I liked this anime.I know, I know. This show, claimed by many, is a garbage romcom harem show that isn’t worth watching, but this is the perfect example of an anime that is so bad that it’s actually good. You might be disgusted of my taste on why it’s rated high according to my overall rating of this show in this but you should definitely be disgusted of me rating KanoKari an 11/10 (yes, really.) Anyways, there’s one factor that makes Kanojo mo Kanojo actually good— and that’s the comedy of this show. A few might think “Oh it only has the comedy tag because the anime itself is an entire joke” well you’re wrong.Let’s start my review...Story | 2/10The story is just absolutely ridiculous. The author’s like “oh hey this is our MC Naoya, he has a girlfriend unlike you haha. We’ll make you even more jealous by giving him ANOTHER girl” and our MC, just straight up told his girlfriend, Saki to grant permission to two-time her. Of course, a normal reaction would be angry. But she got persuaded by Naoya and the other girl, Nagisa and accept to two-time her.Welcome to anime logic, where everything happens.Art | 5/10Well the artstyle is pretty okay, and the animation of this anime is a bit clunky at times and becomes bad. Although I like the art a bit... There’s room for improvement though, because this is the same studio that animated Quintuplets Season 1.Characters | 7/10The character design looks pretty mediocre. It’s not good, but not bad either. But we’ll look at the personalities of the characters that we’ve met a lot so far:Our MC, Naoya, is definitely the best character here. He’s straightforward, honest, and a man of his word. Whatever he says, he will do it like “cutting his dong via surgery” but is easily stopped by the girls because of going overboard. He’s pretty likeable to be honest, and although he might be pretty cringy due to how loud he is, he’s a pretty good boy.Naoya’s girlfriend, Saki, is what I believe is the best girl of this series. The name alone gives me Oregairu vibes. She’s like the female version of Kazuya from KanoKari with all of the perverted imagination she’s thinking, but not as annoying as you would think.Nagisa is a good character too. Saki gets jealous of her because of the difference in... assets. I’ll just say that she’s insane, but not the bad type of insane.As far as I’ve seen, Shino has only appeared for a few scenes so we haven’t got much info about her.Rika on the other hand, is that streamer shown on Episode 3 and made a debut today. So since we finally get to see her in action this episode, I really don’t have a lot of info about her too.Sound | 9/10This is one of the factors that makes this show good. Although the OP and ED are good, the one that’s making this show shine a lot is by means of the acting. My god, who would’ve thought this over-the-top acting can be this good to bring out enjoyment. Yeah it could be loud and such, but isn’t that what over-the-top means...Enjoyment | 9/10Ridiculousness and cringiness of this anime aside, the comedy is amazing. It is perhaps the hardest I’ve laughed out of all the 2021 anime I’ve seen so far. Well, to be honest I haven’t really seen a lot of anime released this year, but still. Let me just say the comedy is not as good as The Disastrous Life of Saiki K, but still really good.The bad aspects from the first 2, aka the absurd story and the clunky animation PLUS the over-the-top acting (good aspect btw) combined together makes it a whole lot better to be honest.Overall | 7/10I wouldn’t have thought that I would have given this show a 7/10 but that’s because I’ve enjoyed this anime. Although we’re only 4 episodes into this show, It hasn’t really made me think that this is painful to watch, unlike many who seem to not like this show. It’s understandable that people don’t like this show.I’d like to see what this show still has in store for us. Maybe more jokes? Who knows?

There\'s no major spoilers for RAG here*.I\'m honestly not sure how to best sum up my experience watching Girlfriend, Girlfriend. The anime put forth an interesting and thought-provoking concept: can you be in a romantical relationship with more than one patterner and is that kind of relationship sustainable? I certainly applaud anime for doing something I haven\'t seen before or trying to think outside the box, and while I\'m sure that Girlfriend, Girlfriend pretty much does what just about any...other harem anime does, I\'d consider this to be one of my first real harem anime (I\'ve seen Rent A Girlfriend, but the execution is different as Kazuya mostly finds himself drawn to one girl while the others are pining for him). I think Girlfriend, Girlfriend tackled the aforementioned question well and it raised a lot of interesting points about what goes into a polygamic relationship. I can also appreciate the show taking a generally light hearted and comedic approach to the question, as the characters themselves openly acknowledge ""yeah this situation is kind of ridiculous"".So what\'s my gripe with this show? Well, I think it\'s painfully dragging out the whole polygamy relationship for plot reasons and the fact that the main character, Naoya, and his actions quite frankly make little to no sense to me. I\'ll dive more into my issues with his character further down in the review but to sum it up now: I did not like his character and I didn\'t find him redeemable. Not for being some sort of jerk or that he treats the girls in his harem like trash (quite the opposite actually), but because his actions throughout the show are generally dimwitted and stupid as he desperately tries to get his harem to work. He has no problem two-timing with his girls together, but there comes a situation roughly halfway in the show where there\'s a third girl introduced (I mean hey 3\'s a party am I right?), and Naoya refuses to include her on the basis that three-timing is worse than two-timing. Now I\'ll agree with him on that but the principle is very much the same and I view it as once you cross that line, it\'s a slippery slope downward. It\'s not so much that I disagree with polygamy or I believe that it doesn\'t work at the end of the day (that\'s for an entirely different discussion and I\'m not trying to inject my personal views too much into this review), but my complains stem from the set up and the maintaining of the polygamy in this anime...it\'s just bad and cringey to watch at times. Simply put: the execution is generally bad, but the show doesn\'t take itself seriously for the most part either.I did not take any issues to the production value of this anime. The animation was good, I liked the character designs, and the art was enjoyable. The English VAs did a fine job and fit their characters well. The music was satisfactory, I didn\'t find it to be anything particularly memorable but it did its job. The intro for the anime is ""Fuzaketenaize"" and the outro is ""Pinky Hook"". Both had pretty good visuals and conveyed what the show was about pretty well in a light-hearted manner.Now as for the plot, there\'s some stuff to talk about: We\'re introduced to our main character, Naoya who has finally achieved his long held dream of turning his childhood best friend, Saki, into his girlfriend after hundreds of past rejections by her. It\'s established early on that Naoya was (and still kind of is) *DOWN BAD* for Saki who is a loud, smart and energetic kind of girl and would seemingly never go for someone as spineless as Naoya, but I digress. Naoya is on top of the world as he is very much in the honeymoon phase with Saki. However, now that Naoya is in a committed relationship, he is apparently the new hot commodity for girls in this anime to confess with their love to him (What do they say about wanting something you can\'t have?). He is approached by a girl named Nagisa who he had never met before (No, not the one from Assassination Classroom!) and who for whatever reason confesses her love for him and asks him out. Nagisa politely turns her down, stating that he already has a girlfriend, but Nagisa tells him she just needs to try harder (Um...okay?). This apparently triggers a Vietnam flashback for Nagisa as he is reminded of all his failed attempts to get with Saki. After succumbing to the power of big ol\' anime tiddes and big blue eyes, Naoya then pulls a complete 180 and folds as he accepts her confession. Nagisa, understandably excited, then brings up the question: ""Hey wait you said you had a girlfriend"". Rather than cheat on Saki with Nagisa, Naoya resolves to find a way where he can date the both two of them with them both being okay with it.So Naoya brings Nagisa with him to ask Saki about being in a polygamic relationship, and she rightfully freaks out and contemplates leaving his dumbass right then and there. Nagisa then works her charms and Saki eventually relents. Naoya decides to take what seems like what\'s already a bad idea and have both Saki and have them both move in with him. (Nothing like rushing an already big decision!)  Nagisa ends up being a pretty good housewife, but she starts developing an inferiority complex due to Nagisa\'s more mature figure. Then the awkward topic of sex comes up in this new wacky relationship. Nagisa offers to let Saki go first, but Saki insists that her and Naoya aren\'t that far into their relationship. Naoya then says he wouldn\'t mind a threesome (lol) and even Saki is tempted (Saki lesbian arc when?). After Saki seemingly declines it, Naoya decides to be a celibate monk until they\'re all more comfortable with each other, much to Saki\'s disappoint which she tries to hide (Go to horny jail, Saki!).After some more awkwardness, Naoya, Nagisa and Saki all resolve to sleep in the same room together. It\'s then revealed that Nagisa has been skipping out on school and as a result is far behind. Particularly, she is bad at math (Hey just like me! This particular scene is also one of my personal favorites in the show). The topic then comes up about how they\'re going to manage their relationship while at school and Saki insists on keeping the arrangement a secret and just publicly have it to where Naoya and Saki are still together. Once it\'s revealed that Nagisa has no friends, Naoya attempts to proclaim that she\'s his girlfriend but is hilariously shot down by Saki. Eventually, Saki changes her mind to where they can all hangout when they\'re alone which is at lunch time. They eventually settle on the gym store room which is out of the way and has a padlock.Saki then begins to worry about her place in the relationship as Naoya and Nagisa are the only ones who actually do anything in terms of chores or providing anything, despite their insistence that she\'s fine. Saki goes to horny jail as she tries to seduce Naoya, which he declines. She then accuses Naoya of preferring Nagisa because of her big ol\' anime tiddies and moves back in with her parents (ironically they\'re next door neighbors). Naoya tries everything he can possibly think of in order to try to win her back but is curved by Saki each time. He ends up staying up for three nights straight as Nagisa feels guilty for spending all this newfound alone time with him. She then pulls the ultimate trump card and stages an incident where Naoya ""accidentally"" touches her boobs for Saki to see, which causes her to fly into a jealous rage and storm over back to Naoya\'s place. The three end up talking about their respective roles in the relationship and Saki admits she feels inferior. Nagisa surprisingly admits that Nayoa also does too much for them and that by somehow taking all the responsibility he was somehow being self-ish (Okay...?). Naoya then passes out from his 3 day exhaustion and Nagisa and Saki debate how exactly they\'ll be ""equals"" and they both come to figure out that they\'re both gamer girls. They play this mobile game which I guess is supposed to be Raid Shadows Legends reference and Nagisa is actually pretty bad at the game, so Saki tries to teach her (I mean hey, I like me a bad gamer girl too...wait this isn\'t the review for that!). They then also watch the equivalent of a twitch streamer in this anime by the name of Milika in an effort for Nagisa to try to learn the game, and it turns out she may be going to their school because their school uniform is in the background in one of her thumbnails.We then get introduced to Rika, who is actually Milika, who pulls up on them while they\'re having lunch in the storage room in an effort to hide herself after her thumbnail screw up. In a panic and also one of my favorite scenes (actually I saw this scene on TikTok and that\'s what piqued my interest in this anime), Naoya reveals his whole arrangement to Rika which causes her to start trolling them. Naoya desperately pleads with Rika to keep quiet and even offers his *WHOLE LIFE SAVINGS* as hush money which Rika declines. Nagisa then finally gets a word in and exposes Rika as Milika (the name does kind of give it a way too, doesn\'t it?). The two parties are at a stalemate and they agree to keep quiet. Rika then decides Naoya isn\'t so bad and what\'s to make their throuple a quadruple by joining in on the action. Rika then gives her ""qualifications"" and even has Nagisa beat in the big ol\' tiddies department. Naoya declines, as not only do Saki and Nagisa don\'t trust her (for good reasons too), Naoya tries to take a principle stand that three timing is somehow worse than two timing (which even Saki calls him on his BS) and that her reasons for wanting to date him are shallow (which he\'s not wrong on). Rika, who can\'t handle rejection, then resolves to join the relationship by any means necessary.The next few episodes resolve around Rika hilariously trying to join into the polygamy. She literally stalks them home and sets up a tent in Naoya\'s backyard. Despite the fact that the situation could\'ve easily been resolved had they just called the cops on her (which if memory serves it was brought up in passing), Naoya, Saki and Nagisa engage in a game of attrition with Rika as they hope to wait her out. Rika tries a variety different ways to seduce Naoya and he himself even admits that he\'s not sure if he can resist her charms forever (I mean bro you folded once for a girl with big bondonkers, you\'d definitely fold for another girl with even bigger bondonkers). They eventually resolve to just give away her stuff to charity. Rika then angrily confronts Naoya out on the street and tries to out him as a groper. Naoya offers to replace everything if she just leaves and Rika.EXE still can\'t process why Naoya won\'t go out with her. He then reasons because he\'s wholly committed on making both Saki and Nagisa happy, which causes Rika to actually fall in love with him. Rika\'s father then pulls up and tries to drag her home after learning that she\'s been a tiddy streamer on off-brand Twitch. He also tries to delete her account, but Naoya talks him out of it and sticks up for her, which causes Rika to fall hard for Naoya which Saki and Nagisa pick up on and worry they\'ll have to fight her for Naoya\'s attention but at least she ends up going back home.The story then takes a weird turn when Saki\'s mom (ignorant of the polygamy), tries to set up her daughter to try to ""be intimate"" with Naoya. It eventually gets to Saki\'s head that since Naoya is easily flustered and that he\'s determined to treat them equally, she may never get laid, so decides to go back to seducing him. Her elaborate trick is to wear a seductive bunny costume (Bunny Girl Senpai reference anyone?), and manages to get him to touch her lack of tiddies despite his no sex rule. Nagisa finds Saki\'s Bunny Girl Senpai and initiates the sexy cosplay wars by dressing as a classic maid and even calls him ""master"" at one point. At school, Rika returns to try to apologize to Naoya, thinking that he rejected her out of anger and offers to let him humiliate her but he insists that wasn\'t the case. Naoya attempts to apologize but it makes Rika want to confess and Saki later hears Rika admitting to herself that she\'s in love with Naoya.Rika tries to subtly rizz Naoya up, so Saki goes full over-protective girlfriend mode and clings to his side throughout the day. Saki refuses to leave Naoya\'s side so much so that they end up having to change into their uniforms in the same room. Nagisa uses her blackmail to lure Rika away from them to buy Naoya and Saki some breathing room. Later, Nagisa admits she was jealous that Naoya and Saki got to spend all day together and Saki offers to give her and Naoya some alone time, but Naoya insists that Saki watches him and Nagisa cuddle, which apparently turns Saki on as she ""punishes"" Naoya. Rika continues to try to rizz up Naoya, but because Naoya is dense as a black hole, he can\'t really tell if Rika is into him but he is starting to suspect it. Saki and Nagisa then lie to Naoya and convince him that Rika is just overly horny and is trying to get her hands on any man. Naoya then apologizes to Rika in front of the class for thinking that she had a crush on him, which pisses her off and she drags him away for a private chat. Naoya then explains she thought Rika was ""in heat"" and Rika initially blows a gasket for Naoya being stupid enough to believe the obvious lie but decides to play it off as having a cold. Naoya affirms that he\'d still reject Rika because of his commitment to Nagisa and Saki, so she decides to turn the tables and announce her love for Naoya in class before dragging him to the gym storeroom to reveal her evil plan of continuing to flirt with him until he finally falls for her. Naoya, with the mental fortitude of God himself, resists Rika\'s advances but Rika goes with the nuclear option and kisses him before running off. Nagisa and Saki are rightfully upset but they decide to not count the kiss as there was no emotion so that whenever they do kiss Naoya, that will be their first kiss. Naoya, oblivious to the entire situation, suggests they go on a date to lift their spirits and Saki suggests a hot spring date.The final arc of this show revolves around Naoya, Saki and Nagisa visiting the hot springs and doing their best to keep their relationship from being outed to their friends. Shino, Saki\'s best friend who set her and Naoya up to be together, begins to grow suspicious of Naoya\'s activities and tries to confront him but is blocked by Saki. Nagisa debates if she should make a move on Naoya but after seeing how Saki is still distraught over Rika\'s kiss, she decides to support her instead. As they travel to the hot springs, Naoya figures they can be more open about their relationship as they don\'t know anybody there and so he holds both of their hands in public which causes people to stare. Saki then internally wonders if she\'ll finally get laid on this trip. Rika then finds out about the date and decides to stalk them as Shino decides to follow them as well, still suspecting that Naoya is two timing. When they arrive at the hotel, they find Rika lying in wait for them. Making this more complicated for the trio, Shino also shows up. Nagisa decides to blackmail Rika into saying she tagged along with her to avoid outing the polygamy to Shino. Nagisa and Rika then pretend to hang out around Shino, essentially self-sacrificing herself, but Naoya refuses to leave her out of the date and sneaks across the roof to see her. Nagisa refuses to go with Naoya. He then finds himself alone with Rika who tries to seduce him once more. Rika then tries to win over Naoya but her towel accidentally falls off and he\'s able to escape, but then falls into Shino\'s bath. Shino then confronts Naoya and asks if he\'s cheating on Saki. Naoya tries to run but Shino tries to stop him, causing her towel to fall off and when Saki and Rika pull off they find the two in a rather...compromising position. Nagisa then cleverly takes the photo to use as blackmail on Shino. Saki then punishes Naoya for his mess up. Nagisa tries to let them have their alone time but Naoya refuses to leave her out. The incident is found by the other hotel guests and Saki punishes Naoya again. Saki then tells Nagisa she doesn\'t have to sacrifice herself for their sake and Nagisa admits she\'s used to working hard just to be considered average.In the final episode, Nagisa goes into why she fell in love with Naoya, and she basically admired Naoya\'s persistence of trying to win over Saki. As a result, she dedicated herself into being the ideal girlfriend for him (now if something like that could only happen to me...)  Naoya overhears everything and encourages her to stop holding back, which causes her to run off in embarrassment. Naoya and Saki chase after Nagisa, with Rika and Shino also joining in after they bump into her. During the chase, Nagisa explains that it\'s impossible for her and Saki to be equals and that she has to be subordinate (which she makes a very good point). Saki, Rika and Shino can\'t keep up with Naoya and Nagisa with Naoya eventually catching her and insists they\'ll work through whatever issues arise. The others catch up and Nagisa finally drops the charade and admits to Shino that she\'s also dating Naoya by kissing him on the cheek. Saki happily accepts this and declares that her and Nagisa are now rivals for the title of ""senior girlfriend"". The three of them then runoff from Shino and Rika and enjoy the rest of their vacation.Shino then sits them down and tries to understand the relationship. She criticizes Naoya for two-timing and puts forth a lot of legitimate and logical reasons why polygamy would be difficult at best to maintain (girl was spitting facts in this scene). Naoya then plans to tell Saki\'s mother about the arrangement but Saki rejects the idea. Shino then resolves to break the polygamic relationship to save Saki. The scene also seems to imply that Shino may be falling for Naoya too as the background fades to black and rose petals drift across the screen which has been reserved for the romantic scenes in this anime, especially after she tearfully says she ""won\'t give up on Naoya"". In the final scene, they\'re all back at school with Rika once again trying to rizz up Naoya, and Saki and Nagisa protectively cling to him as they have a stare down with Rika. Shino sees them and then accuses Naoya of 3 timing. As the camera pans up towards the credits, Rika insists she\'ll make Naoya fall for him while Saki worries for their future. Nagisa assures her that\'ll be alright and Naoya doubles down that he\'ll make Saki and Nagisa happy.Alright now for the characters!Naoya: I hated his character. Now I don\'t know what goes into someone\'s head when they decide to have an open relationship or engage in polygamy and I\'m not trying to judge here, but his reasoning made abloustely no sense to me. This man spent his whole life trying to get with his childhood best friend and was so down bad for her that he was literally on his knees for her, and then once he finally gets with her, he turns around and almost immediately falls for a girl who he had never met before all because she vows to be persistent. If I was Saki I would honestly be questioning his loyalty and would\'ve dumped him. Now, Naoya does end up being a loyal boyfriend and often overextends himself to try to make both Saki and Nagisa happy. I will give him credit for staying true to his word and for not crossing his own lines in the sand that he draws when Rika tries to seduce him (even though I think from a principal standpoint it\'s kind of moot, but adding on to the polygamy would probably make it more unstable than it already is so I understand that part. Besides if Saki and Nagisa don\'t want Rika in, she\'s got no shot). Aside from his loyalty and commitment, both of which are essential ingredients in any healthy relationship period, there\'s really no reason to like Naoya. The fact that he folded so quickly to Nagisa and was insistent on making his relationship with Saki (mind you she did sign off onto it after being talked into it), the anime gave me reasons to dislike Naoya rather than like him. He\'s also a pretty bland character and the anime doesn\'t offer much reason for the audience in rooting for him aside from his loyalty and commitment to Saki and Nagisa. It\'s impressive that he pulled two beautiful girls, but I do think he\'ll find himself having to choose between one of them in the end. He\'s certainly among my least favorite MCs in anime.Saki: I honestly felt bad for her character. By all accounts, she had a great relationship going with Naoya and then got talked into being in a polygamic relationship with him and another girl that she wasn\'t initially sold on. I do suspect that she\'s bi as she does make a lot of admiring comments about Nagisa in her internal monologues, which I think can provide for an interesting dimension in the story should they choose to make it go down that way. It\'d also be pretty hilarious to me. She also rejected Naoya hundreds, possibly thousands of times before she finally agreed to date him, so I\'m curious as to what changed. All we know is that her friend Shino set them up and we\'re not provided more information beyond that. Since we eventually got Nagisa\'s backstory, I would imagine this would get explained at some point down the line. Saki is a relatively bland character representing the childhood friend archetype and seems to be something of a tsundere herself, but she was a likable character and I honestly felt bad that she was pretty much dragged into all this. Also let\'s not forget she has to contend that she has to contend with a perhaps more objectively attractive girl for her man\'s attention and is often worried that Naoya will leave her because of Nagisa\'s attractiveness, so she feels the need to do these drastic things to try to maintain her position in the relationship. I can relate to her struggles to a degree. Again if I was her, I would\'ve dumped Naoya\'s ass and I\'m not sure what\'s going on inside her head. She did have a lot of good and funny moments throughout the show and her relationship with Nagisa was wholesome to see as it developed, despite some of its weird turns.Nagisa: I did like her character. Though I think her reasons for liking Naoya were pretty flawed, she did come across as a likeable character and a genuinely nice person. For most of the series she does try to pull her weight into making the whole polygamy work and doesn\'t really try to one-up or take advantage of Saki expect for her kiss with Naoya at the end and her frenemy declaration with Saki to compete for this title of ""senior girlfriend"". She does seem to have a lot of respect for Saki and I\'m curious why she also wanted to go along with the polygamy, but I do wonder if she may have feelings for Saki as well. Her thoughts on Saki aren\'t as clear as it is vice versa. She also has a ruthless side which I like, this girl can whip up blackmail like she\'s baking a cake. You would definitely not want to get on her bad side. She has great chemistry with Saki and is a generally wholesome and funny person as well. Nagisa had a lot of great moments in the show.Rika: She\'s as much as a villain as you can get in a show like this. While she\'s certainly attractive, she\'s also very petulant and gives off a lot of ""mean girl"" vibes. Her affection towards Naoya is truly mind boggling but some people can\'t take no for an answer and she\'s one of them. Rika does make the story interesting and I think she\'s a good rival character but I\'m not sure what more they can do. Naoya is clearly weak willed (if he fell for Nagisa, he can probably fall for Rika), so I\'m curious what scheme she has up her sleeve in order to insert herself. But I will say her repeated basic attempts to rizz him up are starting to lose their comedic value. Speaking of which, Rika does have some good and hilarious moments throughout the anime and did help to keep things interesting.Shino: Even though she was prominently displayed in both the intro and outro, we really didn\'t see all that much of her character throughout the anime but she got more screentime in the end. She\'s Saki\'s best friend and is responsible for her and Naoya getting together (though how is still not explained). I do understand her reasoning for being opposed to the Naoya\'s polygamy and her frustration but if her friend is ok with it, I don\'t see why she should care that much so long as her friend is happy. This leads me to my theory that she is also interested in Naoya, given the rose petal scene at the end when Naoya affirms his commitment to Saki and Nagisa. They also had them be awkardly on top of each other and that\'s typically a sign of characters getting together or having romantic tension. They\'re definitely setting her up to be another antagonist character though I suspect she\'ll eventually try to either get Naoya all to herself (for some reason), or join the polygamy as well.Girlfriend, Girlfriend is a show I can best sum up as ""interesting"". It had some genuinely funny and enjoyable moments. The relationship between Saki and Nagisa as it developed was wholesome to see as they supported each other, and Rika made things interesting. The show also did explore an interesting and legitimate question about polygamy: ""can all parties in a relationship like that truly be equals?"" and it so far seems the show is trying to answer ""no"".My biggest gripes with the show was that I found Naoya to be a generally unlikeable character and that a lot of things that happen in the plot are forced, and some plot points are a little questionable to outright ridicilious. Overall though I did find myself more often than not enjoying it as I laughed to myself and asked what my life had come to.The anime did happen to remind me of Rent A Girlfriend. It\'s a somewhat similar set up of 4 girls ultimately trying to or at least are interested in getting with the protagonist. However, RAG tried too hard to take itself seriously and GG openly made fun of itself, which makes some of GG\'s cringe more tolerable than RAG\'s. Though Kazuya isn\'t trying to be in a polygamy in RAG, there is chemistry between him and each of the 4 love interests just like there is in GG (even if some of the relationships aren\'t as profound).So would I watch a Season 2 of this since it\'s been announced and is coming soon? Eh...why not...I\'ll probably wait for the dub though. If you like cheesy harem anime, Girlfriend Girlfriend will probably be right for you, but I\'ll admit it wasn\'t half-bad. other harem anime does, I\'d consider this to be one of my first real harem anime (I\'ve seen Rent A Girlfriend, but the execution is different as Kazuya mostly finds himself drawn to one girl while the others are pining for him). I think Girlfriend, Girlfriend tackled the aforementioned question well and it raised a lot of interesting points about what goes into a polygamic relationship. I can also appreciate the show taking a generally light hearted and comedic approach to the question, as the characters themselves openly acknowledge ""yeah this situation is kind of ridiculous"".So what\'s my gripe with this show? Well, I think it\'s painfully dragging out the whole polygamy relationship for plot reasons and the fact that the main character, Naoya, and his actions quite frankly make little to no sense to me. I\'ll dive more into my issues with his character further down in the review but to sum it up now: I did not like his character and I didn\'t find him redeemable. Not for being some sort of jerk or that he treats the girls in his harem like trash (quite the opposite actually), but because his actions throughout the show are generally dimwitted and stupid as he desperately tries to get his harem to work.

He is approached by a girl named Nagisa who he had never met before (No, not the one from Assassination Classroom!) and who for whatever reason confesses her love for him and asks him out. Nagisa politely turns her down, stating that he already has a girlfriend, but Nagisa tells him she just needs to try harder (Um...okay?). This apparently triggers a Vietnam flashback for Nagisa as he is reminded of all his failed attempts to get with Saki. After succumbing to the power of big ol\' anime tiddes and big blue eyes, Naoya then pulls a complete 180 and folds as he accepts her confession. Nagisa, understandably excited, then brings up the question: ""Hey wait you said you had a girlfriend"". Rather than cheat on Saki with Nagisa, Naoya resolves to find a way where he can date the both two of them with them both being okay with it.So Naoya brings Nagisa with him to ask Saki about being in a polygamic relationship, and she rightfully freaks out and contemplates leaving his dumbass right then and there. Nagisa then works her charms and Saki eventually relents. Naoya decides to take what seems like what\'s already a bad idea and have both Saki and have them both move in with him. (Nothing like rushing an already big decision!)  Nagisa ends up being a pretty good housewife, but she starts developing an inferiority complex due to Nagisa\'s more mature figure. Then the awkward topic of sex comes up in this new wacky relationship. Nagisa offers to let Saki go first, but Saki insists that her and Naoya aren\'t that far into their relationship. Naoya then says he wouldn\'t mind a threesome (lol) and even Saki is tempted (Saki lesbian arc when?). After Saki seemingly declines it, Naoya decides to be a celibate monk until they\'re all more comfortable with each other, much to Saki\'s disappoint which she tries to hide (Go to horny jail, Saki!).After some more awkwardness, Naoya, Nagisa and Saki all resolve to sleep in the same room together. It\'s then revealed that Nagisa has been skipping out on school and as a result is far behind. Particularly, she is bad at math (Hey just like me! This particular scene is also one of my personal favorites in the show). The topic then comes up about how they\'re going to manage their relationship while at school and Saki insists on keeping the arrangement a secret and just publicly have it to where Naoya and Saki are still together. Once it\'s revealed that Nagisa has no friends, Naoya attempts to proclaim that she\'s his girlfriend but is hilariously shot down by Saki. Eventually, Saki changes her mind to where they can all hangout when they\'re alone which is at lunch time. They eventually settle on the gym store room which is out of the way and has a padlock.Saki then begins to worry about her place in the relationship as Naoya and Nagisa are the only ones who actually do anything in terms of chores or providing anything, despite their insistence that she\'s fine. Saki goes to horny jail as she tries to seduce Naoya, which he declines. She then accuses Naoya of preferring Nagisa because of her big ol\' anime tiddies and moves back in with her parents (ironically they\'re next door neighbors). Naoya tries everything he can possibly think of in order to try to win her back but is curved by Saki each time. He ends up staying up for three nights straight as Nagisa feels guilty for spending all this newfound alone time with him. She then pulls the ultimate trump card and stages an incident where Naoya ""accidentally"" touches her boobs for Saki to see, which causes her to fly into a jealous rage and storm over back to Naoya\'s place. The three end up talking about their respective roles in the relationship and Saki admits she feels inferior. Nagisa surprisingly admits that Nayoa also does too much for them and that by somehow taking all the responsibility he was somehow being self-ish (Okay...?). Naoya then passes out from his 3 day exhaustion and Nagisa and Saki debate how exactly they\'ll be ""equals"" and they both come to figure out that they\'re both gamer girls. They play this mobile game which I guess is supposed to be Raid Shadows Legends reference and Nagisa is actually pretty bad at the game, so Saki tries to teach her (I mean hey, I like me a bad gamer girl too...wait this isn\'t the review for that!). They then also watch the equivalent of a twitch streamer in this anime by the name of Milika in an effort for Nagisa to try to learn the game, and it turns out she may be going to their school because their school uniform is in the background in one of her thumbnails.We then get introduced to Rika, who is actually Milika, who pulls up on them while they\'re having lunch in the storage room in an effort to hide herself after her thumbnail screw up. In a panic and also one of my favorite scenes (actually I saw this scene on TikTok and that\'s what piqued my interest in this anime), Naoya reveals his whole arrangement to Rika which causes her to start trolling them. Naoya desperately pleads with Rika to keep quiet and even offers his *WHOLE LIFE SAVINGS* as hush money which Rika declines. Nagisa then finally gets a word in and exposes Rika as Milika (the name does kind of give it a way too, doesn\'t it?). The two parties are at a stalemate and they agree to keep quiet. Rika then decides Naoya isn\'t so bad and what\'s to make their throuple a quadruple by joining in on the action. Rika then gives her ""qualifications"" and even has Nagisa beat in the big ol\' tiddies department. Naoya declines, as not only do Saki and Nagisa don\'t trust her (for good reasons too), Naoya tries to take a principle stand that three timing is somehow worse than two timing (which even Saki calls him on his BS) and that her reasons for wanting to date him are shallow (which he\'s not wrong on). Rika, who can\'t handle rejection, then resolves to join the relationship by any means necessary.The next few episodes resolve around Rika hilariously trying to join into the polygamy. She literally stalks them home and sets up a tent in Naoya\'s backyard. Despite the fact that the situation could\'ve easily been resolved had they just called the cops on her (which if memory serves it was brought up in passing), Naoya, Saki and Nagisa engage in a game of attrition with Rika as they hope to wait her out. Rika tries a variety different ways to seduce Naoya and he himself even admits that he\'s not sure if he can resist her charms forever (I mean bro you folded once for a girl with big bondonkers, you\'d definitely fold for another girl with even bigger bondonkers). They eventually resolve to just give away her stuff to charity. Rika then angrily confronts Naoya out on the street and tries to out him as a groper. Naoya offers to replace everything if she just leaves and Rika.EXE still can\'t process why Naoya won\'t go out with her. He then reasons because he\'s wholly committed on making both Saki and Nagisa happy, which causes Rika to actually fall in love with him. Rika\'s father then pulls up and tries to drag her home after learning that she\'s been a tiddy streamer on off-brand Twitch. He also tries to delete her account, but Naoya talks him out of it and sticks up for her, which causes Rika to fall hard for Naoya which Saki and Nagisa pick up on and worry they\'ll have to fight her for Naoya\'s attention but at least she ends up going back home.The story then takes a weird turn when Saki\'s mom (ignorant of the polygamy), tries to set up her daughter to try to ""be intimate"" with Naoya. It eventually gets to Saki\'s head that since Naoya is easily flustered and that he\'s determined to treat them equally, she may never get laid, so decides to go back to seducing him. Her elaborate trick is to wear a seductive bunny costume (Bunny Girl Senpai reference anyone?), and manages to get him to touch her lack of tiddies despite his no sex rule. Nagisa finds Saki\'s Bunny Girl Senpai and initiates the sexy cosplay wars by dressing as a classic maid and even calls him ""master"" at one point. At school, Rika returns to try to apologize to Naoya, thinking that he rejected her out of anger and offers to let him humiliate her but he insists that wasn\'t the case. Naoya attempts to apologize but it makes Rika want to confess and Saki later hears Rika admitting to herself that she\'s in love with Naoya.Rika tries to subtly rizz Naoya up, so Saki goes full over-protective girlfriend mode and clings to his side throughout the day. Saki refuses to leave Naoya\'s side so much so that they end up having to change into their uniforms in the same room. Nagisa uses her blackmail to lure Rika away from them to buy Naoya and Saki some breathing room. Later, Nagisa admits she was jealous that Naoya and Saki got to spend all day together and Saki offers to give her and Naoya some alone time, but Naoya insists that Saki watches him and Nagisa cuddle, which apparently turns Saki on as she ""punishes"" Naoya. Rika continues to try to rizz up Naoya, but because Naoya is dense as a black hole, he can\'t really tell if Rika is into him but he is starting to suspect it. Saki and Nagisa then lie to Naoya and convince him that Rika is just overly horny and is trying to get her hands on any man. Naoya then apologizes to Rika in front of the class for thinking that she had a crush on him, which pisses her off and she drags him away for a private chat. Naoya then explains she thought Rika was ""in heat"" and Rika initially blows a gasket for Naoya being stupid enough to believe the obvious lie but decides to play it off as having a cold. Naoya affirms that he\'d still reject Rika because of his commitment to Nagisa and Saki, so she decides to turn the tables and announce her love for Naoya in class before dragging him to the gym storeroom to reveal her evil plan of continuing to flirt with him until he finally falls for her. Naoya, with the mental fortitude of God himself, resists Rika\'s advances but Rika goes with the nuclear option and kisses him before running off. Nagisa and Saki are rightfully upset but they decide to not count the kiss as there was no emotion so that whenever they do kiss Naoya, that will be their first kiss. Naoya, oblivious to the entire situation, suggests they go on a date to lift their spirits and Saki suggests a hot spring date.The final arc of this show revolves around Naoya, Saki and Nagisa visiting the hot springs and doing their best to keep their relationship from being outed to their friends. Shino, Saki\'s best friend who set her and Naoya up to be together, begins to grow suspicious of Naoya\'s activities and tries to confront him but is blocked by Saki. Nagisa debates if she should make a move on Naoya but after seeing how Saki is still distraught over Rika\'s kiss, she decides to support her instead. As they travel to the hot springs, Naoya figures they can be more open about their relationship as they don\'t know anybody there and so he holds both of their hands in public which causes people to stare. Saki then internally wonders if she\'ll finally get laid on this trip. Rika then finds out about the date and decides to stalk them as Shino decides to follow them as well, still suspecting that Naoya is two timing. When they arrive at the hotel, they find Rika lying in wait for them. Making this more complicated for the trio, Shino also shows up. Nagisa decides to blackmail Rika into saying she tagged along with her to avoid outing the polygamy to Shino. Nagisa and Rika then pretend to hang out around Shino, essentially self-sacrificing herself, but Naoya refuses to leave her out of the date and sneaks across the roof to see her. Nagisa refuses to go with Naoya. He then finds himself alone with Rika who tries to seduce him once more. Rika then tries to win over Naoya but her towel accidentally falls off and he\'s able to escape, but then falls into Shino\'s bath. Shino then confronts Naoya and asks if he\'s cheating on Saki. Naoya tries to run but Shino tries to stop him, causing her towel to fall off and when Saki and Rika pull off they find the two in a rather...compromising position. Nagisa then cleverly takes the photo to use as blackmail on Shino. Saki then punishes Naoya for his mess up. Nagisa tries to let them have their alone time but Naoya refuses to leave her out. The incident is found by the other hotel guests and Saki punishes Naoya again. Saki then tells Nagisa she doesn\'t have to sacrifice herself for their sake and Nagisa admits she\'s used to working hard just to be considered average.In the final episode, Nagisa goes into why she fell in love with Naoya, and she basically admired Naoya\'s persistence of trying to win over Saki. As a result, she dedicated herself into being the ideal girlfriend for him (now if something like that could only happen to me...)  Naoya overhears everything and encourages her to stop holding back, which causes her to run off in embarrassment. Naoya and Saki chase after Nagisa, with Rika and Shino also joining in after they bump into her. During the chase, Nagisa explains that it\'s impossible for her and Saki to be equals and that she has to be subordinate (which she makes a very good point). Saki, Rika and Shino can\'t keep up with Naoya and Nagisa with Naoya eventually catching her and insists they\'ll work through whatever issues arise. The others catch up and Nagisa finally drops the charade and admits to Shino that she\'s also dating Naoya by kissing him on the cheek. Saki happily accepts this and declares that her and Nagisa are now rivals for the title of ""senior girlfriend"". The three of them then runoff from Shino and Rika and enjoy the rest of their vacation.Shino then sits them down and tries to understand the relationship. She criticizes Naoya for two-timing and puts forth a lot of legitimate and logical reasons why polygamy would be difficult at best to maintain (girl was spitting facts in this scene). Naoya then plans to tell Saki\'s mother about the arrangement but Saki rejects the idea. Shino then resolves to break the polygamic relationship to save Saki. The scene also seems to imply that Shino may be falling for Naoya too as the background fades to black and rose petals drift across the screen which has been reserved for the romantic scenes in this anime, especially after she tearfully says she ""won\'t give up on Naoya"". In the final scene, they\'re all back at school with Rika once again trying to rizz up Naoya, and Saki and Nagisa protectively cling to him as they have a stare down with Rika. Shino sees them and then accuses Naoya of 3 timing. As the camera pans up towards the credits, Rika insists she\'ll make Naoya fall for him while Saki worries for their future. Nagisa assures her that\'ll be alright and Naoya doubles down that he\'ll make Saki and Nagisa happy.Alright now for the characters!Naoya: I hated his character. Now I don\'t know what goes into someone\'s head when they decide to have an open relationship or engage in polygamy and I\'m not trying to judge here, but his reasoning made abloustely no sense to me. This man spent his whole life trying to get with his childhood best friend and was so down bad for her that he was literally on his knees for her, and then once he finally gets with her, he turns around and almost immediately falls for a girl who he had never met before all because she vows to be persistent. If I was Saki I would honestly be questioning his loyalty and would\'ve dumped him. Now, Naoya does end up being a loyal boyfriend and often overextends himself to try to make both Saki and Nagisa happy. I will give him credit for staying true to his word and for not crossing his own lines in the sand that he draws when Rika tries to seduce him (even though I think from a principal standpoint it\'s kind of moot, but adding on to the polygamy would probably make it more unstable than it already is so I understand that part. Besides if Saki and Nagisa don\'t want Rika in, she\'s got no shot). Aside from his loyalty and commitment, both of which are essential ingredients in any healthy relationship period, there\'s really no reason to like Naoya. The fact that he folded so quickly to Nagisa and was insistent on making his relationship with Saki (mind you she did sign off onto it after being talked into it), the anime gave me reasons to dislike Naoya rather than like him. He\'s also a pretty bland character and the anime doesn\'t offer much reason for the audience in rooting for him aside from his loyalty and commitment to Saki and Nagisa. It\'s impressive that he pulled two beautiful girls, but I do think he\'ll find himself having to choose between one of them in the end. He\'s certainly among my least favorite MCs in anime.Saki: I honestly felt bad for her character. By all accounts, she had a great relationship going with Naoya and then got talked into being in a polygamic relationship with him and another girl that she wasn\'t initially sold on. I do suspect that she\'s bi as she does make a lot of admiring comments about Nagisa in her internal monologues, which I think can provide for an interesting dimension in the story should they choose to make it go down that way. It\'d also be pretty hilarious to me. She also rejected Naoya hundreds, possibly thousands of times before she finally agreed to date him, so I\'m curious as to what changed. All we know is that her friend Shino set them up and we\'re not provided more information beyond that. Since we eventually got Nagisa\'s backstory, I would imagine this would get explained at some point down the line. Saki is a relatively bland character representing the childhood friend archetype and seems to be something of a tsundere herself, but she was a likable character and I honestly felt bad that she was pretty much dragged into all this. Also let\'s not forget she has to contend that she has to contend with a perhaps more objectively attractive girl for her man\'s attention and is often worried that Naoya will leave her because of Nagisa\'s attractiveness, so she feels the need to do these drastic things to try to maintain her position in the relationship. I can relate to her struggles to a degree. Again if I was her, I would\'ve dumped Naoya\'s ass and I\'m not sure what\'s going on inside her head. She did have a lot of good and funny moments throughout the show and her relationship with Nagisa was wholesome to see as it developed, despite some of its weird turns.Nagisa: I did like her character. Though I think her reasons for liking Naoya were pretty flawed, she did come across as a likeable character and a genuinely nice person. For most of the series she does try to pull her weight into making the whole polygamy work and doesn\'t really try to one-up or take advantage of Saki expect for her kiss with Naoya at the end and her frenemy declaration with Saki to compete for this title of ""senior girlfriend"". She does seem to have a lot of respect for Saki and I\'m curious why she also wanted to go along with the polygamy, but I do wonder if she may have feelings for Saki as well. Her thoughts on Saki aren\'t as clear as it is vice versa. She also has a ruthless side which I like, this girl can whip up blackmail like she\'s baking a cake. You would definitely not want to get on her bad side. She has great chemistry with Saki and is a generally wholesome and funny person as well. Nagisa had a lot of great moments in the show.Rika: She\'s as much as a villain as you can get in a show like this. While she\'s certainly attractive, she\'s also very petulant and gives off a lot of ""mean girl"" vibes. Her affection towards Naoya is truly mind boggling but some people can\'t take no for an answer and she\'s one of them. Rika does make the story interesting and I think she\'s a good rival character but I\'m not sure what more they can do. Naoya is clearly weak willed (if he fell for Nagisa, he can probably fall for Rika), so I\'m curious what scheme she has up her sleeve in order to insert herself. But I will say her repeated basic attempts to rizz him up are starting to lose their comedic value. Speaking of which, Rika does have some good and hilarious moments throughout the anime and did help to keep things interesting.Shino: Even though she was prominently displayed in both the intro and outro, we really didn\'t see all that much of her character throughout the anime but she got more screentime in the end. She\'s Saki\'s best friend and is responsible for her and Naoya getting together (though how is still not explained). I do understand her reasoning for being opposed to the Naoya\'s polygamy and her frustration but if her friend is ok with it, I don\'t see why she should care that much so long as her friend is happy. This leads me to my theory that she is also interested in Naoya, given the rose petal scene at the end when Naoya affirms his commitment to Saki and Nagisa. They also had them be awkardly on top of each other and that\'s typically a sign of characters getting together or having romantic tension. They\'re definitely setting her up to be another antagonist character though I suspect she\'ll eventually try to either get Naoya all to herself (for some reason), or join the polygamy as well.Girlfriend, Girlfriend is a show I can best sum up as ""interesting"". It had some genuinely funny and enjoyable moments. The relationship between Saki and Nagisa as it developed was wholesome to see as they supported each other, and Rika made things interesting. The show also did explore an interesting and legitimate question about polygamy: ""can all parties in a relationship like that truly be equals?"" and it so far seems the show is trying to answer ""no"".My biggest gripes with the show was that I found Naoya to be a generally unlikeable character and that a lot of things that happen in the plot are forced, and some plot points are a little questionable to outright ridicilious. Overall though I did find myself more often than not enjoying it as I laughed to myself and asked what my life had come to.The anime did happen to remind me of Rent A Girlfriend. It\'s a somewhat similar set up of 4 girls ultimately trying to or at least are interested in getting with the protagonist. However, RAG tried too hard to take itself seriously and GG openly made fun of itself, which makes some of GG\'s cringe more tolerable than RAG\'s. Though Kazuya isn\'t trying to be in a polygamy in RAG, there is chemistry between him and each of the 4 love interests just like there is in GG (even if some of the relationships aren\'t as profound).So would I watch a Season 2 of this since it\'s been announced and is coming soon? Eh...why not...I\'ll probably wait for the dub though. If you like cheesy harem anime, Girlfriend Girlfriend will probably be right for you, but I\'ll admit it wasn\'t half-bad.', 'Cuando te enteras de la premisa te esperar cualquier cosa, probablemente no le des una oportunidad, así me pasó, pero luego con ya conoces las obras y el estilo del autor entiendes por donde va y lo disfrutas mas, me encanta su comedia aunque es entendible que a algunos no les guste, pero para mi fue super entretenida, y eso es lo que busco al ver un anime.En cuanto a su segunda temporada, la espero con ansias aunque creo que no viene arcos muy interesantes pero se que la disfrutaré tanto como la primera, una pena que tenga doblaje al español, de todas formas lo...recomiendo y espero le den una oportunidad a este estilo de comedia. recomiendo y espero le den una oportunidad a este estilo de comedia.', 'This was what you call a complete waste of time and effort.

When I watched the first episode I thought the concept was stupid, the main character was lousy, and plenty of other negative things. However, I was heavily mistaken. I followed my 3 episode rule and, to my surprise, I was starting to enjoy this anime. The witty jokes with damn-near perfect setups, the soundtrack, the noises that were played fit everything at almost all times.Let's talk characters. The main character, Mukai Naoya, is a less than bright teen who is surprisingly determined. The first 3 episodes did make me question whether or not I would enjoy this main character,...but he grew on me rather quickly. As the story progresses, you can see how heartfelt all of his words are, as well as his determination to keep both of his girlfriends happy. His first girlfriend, Saki Saki, is a pink haired energetic girl. She is quick to lose her temper, and adds plenty of comedy to the scenes she is in (though it can be rather overkill sometimes). His second girlfriend, Minase Nagisa, is a shy, love-able girl. Her worry towards Naoya and Saki Saki builds her character as you travel deeper into her feelings throughout the show.I find the art in this show to be very good. I like the character designs, and all the scenes look great. There was never a moment where I thought the art looked bad, though it still isn't amazing, which is why I give it an 8/10.I think the sound in this show is amazing. Every scene has fitting music, and the various sound effects used make the show so much more enjoyable. This show would be entirely different without the sound it has.My enjoyment of the show was pretty steady, though sometimes episodes felt a little dragged out. There was only about 2 episodes where I actually wondered how much longer I had to sit through it. There are very minimal dull moments, and as the story goes on, things only get better.Overall this anime is an 8/10 for me. Despite the many people who claim this anime is bad with a lousy main character, it's worth trying. It's my personal opinion that those who claim the main character is lousy just didn't watch in far enough. If you're looking for a comedic anime with romantic aspects, this anime is definitely the one. but he grew on me rather quickly. As the story progresses, you can see how heartfelt all of his words are, as well as his determination to keep both of his girlfriends happy. His first girlfriend, Saki Saki, is a pink haired energetic girl. She is quick to lose her temper, and adds plenty of comedy to the scenes she is in (though it can be rather overkill sometimes). His second girlfriend, Minase Nagisa, is a shy, love-able girl. Her worry towards Naoya and Saki Saki builds her character as you travel deeper into her feelings throughout the show.I find the art in this show to be very good. I like the character designs, and all the scenes look great. There was never a moment where I thought the art looked bad, though it still isn't amazing, which is why I give it an 8/10.I think the sound in this show is amazing.

Without spoiling anything, the storyline can appear a little confusing at first (A male MC trying to achieve a Harem with some girls, and being successful). After watching the first few minutes of the episode, you can easily predict how the plot and characters will turn out for the rest of the series. I hope there are some interesting plot twists along the way that will keep my attention!Character: Although I can see potential improvement for the characters to be dynamic, I would assume (based on the manga)...that the characters will stay flat and consistent with their personalities. The main MC is pretty much a moronic and shameless typical male, who is somewhat perverted and also very dense. The female characters (his girlfriends), all have different personas; some being tsundere, others being extremely delicate. Overall, the characters are anticipated to be the typical anime characters (not unique from other animes).Art + Sound: Not much to say about these sectors. The art is pretty good quality, but so far no scenic views that caught my attention. The sound is also pretty decent.Enjoyment: Having the cringe storylines where the MC embarrasses himself and his girlfriends in the middle of the class is intriguing enough for me to be entertained. There are numerous times where I found the plot to be humorous from the anticipated yet also the unexpected actions from the MC. And so I can surely say I am entertained!Overall, it is still somewhat entertaining to watch, and so I will watch this anime until the end, but my recommendations for this anime aren't too high.

Enjoy!"", 'Normally seasonal ecchi garbage shows are enjoyable despite their drawbacks. Be it because they are so bad that they are actually funny, or because ecchi elements are only to bait you to watch an otherwise bland but good comedy.This season there were two contestants for the role of ""degenerate but fun"" shows: Mother of the Goddess\' Dormitory and Girlfriend, Girlfriend.And I\'m surprised that out of those two MotGD was better, by a long way.Girlfriend, Girlfriend was supposed to be light-hearted romance comedy with ecchi elements and that it is. But Nothing more.Story. 3/10Every new situation or gag is given over-the-top emphasis that most of...the time just slows down the action due to long sequences of reactions/screaming. This waters down the pacing, making story progress seem slower than it actually is - if one would cut half of those shots this anime would end in 7-8 episodes. Mostly because there is almost no story, just repeated gags and situations to wich characters always react the same over-exaggerated way, being suprised every time by almost the same thing. After first 4 episodes nothing really happens story-wise, characters follow set course doing the same shocked/embarassed/apologising/hitting sequence over and over again, just in a little different setting. Most of the time their actions are lacking any sense even by anime standards and storytelling lacks any coherence.Art. 6/10Still shots look good most of the time, making me think that manga it was based upon wasn\'t as bad as the show suggests. Character designs are cute, even if they are a little bland and not standing out in any way. Even considering hyper-energetic and exaggerated expressions most of the time, facial features were nicely drawn making it clear what emotion/state of the mind is displayed.Sadly animation was lacking. Most of the time animation consisted of shaking the screen and/or adding some moving lines. People sometimes walk in funny/stiff way. At least backgrounds look good.Sound. 8/10Voice actors gave their best considering lacking story and setting. Most of the time jokes or dialogues suffer from bad timing but it seems the cause is not acting itself but unnecessary pauses and too long reaction shots. Cast is experienced and sound very good most of the time, voices fit their characters. Sound effects are typical for this type of comedy - every time something happens there is some weird sound to boost weirdness of what\'s happening on the screen. This gets tiresome rather fast. Overall sound engineering is on the good side, but could not rescue this show.Character. 5/10This series has almost no character development and most of the characters are oversimplified. There is simple-minded and there is lack-of-any-mind. Most of the time MC acts like typical harem protagonist and is unaware of his situation, to the point of parodying that trope. Even the girls are acting as if they used all their brainpower to get to this high school and are now to tired to think about anything. Nothing changes in the dynamic between the main trio after two first episodes, most of backstory shown changes nothing and feels more like a filler, just explaining again what was said before. Character\'s motivation is very simple, almost the same for most of them and lacks any flavour.Enjoyment. 5/10As a comedy this is lacking, mostly because jokes are repetitive and half of the time their timing sucks. As a parody of harem trope it still is bad, even though the idea of not having to choose only one girl seems new. What this show could have done good because of this idea of breaking harem trope was hampered by poor execution. Because half of the show consists only of reactions there is not enough story and character presentation to feel attached the cast.Overall. 5/10This show is dumpsterfire not because of constant fanservice and lewd scenes, but because it lacks any resemblance of coherent storytelling and good character design. Basic idea of choosing more than one girl out of your harem would get you only so far. Lack of good jokes and constant over-exaggeration of everything that happens (not that there is a lot happening there) makes Girlfriend, Girlfriend boring and not worth watching. If you want a good rom-com show there are many to choose, if you want borderline hentai there was Mother of the Godess Dormitory the same season as G,G, which not only has a little better artstyle, but also better story (albeit even more silly) and some character development.Watch this only if you just have to watch every ecchi anime a season has to offer. the time just slows down the action due to long sequences of reactions/screaming.

I watched it directly after Rent-a-Girlfriend because I was watching all the 3 most popular “girlfriend” anime all at once because I was in quarantine, and it was nice to see it make a joke out of all the harem anime tropes and play off actually having multiple girlfriends at once. That being said, that is about all there is to it. The rest of it is some of the lowest-quality stuff of all time. The characters were super 1 dimensional, and really had nothing going for them except their gags and interactions. The characters literally have no traits...except the stock character tropes they are made up of. The art style isn’t necessarily bad, but it's not good either. The animation is also some of the worst animation quality I have ever seen. It was the first time I actually noticed the animation quality because it was so bad, and I have never been able to look at animation the same way after.

Kanokano is imo, a really fun cringe filled mess, and it\'s actually good.Alright , let\'s get these easy stuff out of the way. Art, icky at times, but good and colorful, which really adds that comedy vibe. Voice actors, are legends, they\'re the reason most of us watched. Music, absolutely amazing, the bgm really fits and the op and ed slaps.Ok now the characters, *sigh*. First, we have our boi, our main man, Naoya, he\'s stupid, but this isn\'t bad compared to edge lords and (some) otaku mc\'s. He\'s stupidity is one of the factors of...the show (actually everyone is stupid, except Shino), it makes the show hilarious, because the interactions are priceless. He also has determination, I think that is actually the theme of the anime (oh my God, I\'m looking deep into Kanokano), everyone is determined and it is that determination that drives the plot forward. I also love how he is aware of his idiocy, so damn funny. His goal: make the two-timing relationship work, and the way he executes it was hilarious. Anyway, Naoya is crazy, he has no shame, adding another layer of humor. Like I said, all of these traits make the show funny (I\'ll expound on that later). Next, is our other idiot, violent flat girl, Saki, she is stupid, but has common sense. At the start, she was against all this and was being rational, but alas, she succumbed to her inner stupidity. Her violent nature, punishing Naoya for his stupidity added to the comedy, though cringe at times. Her goal: How to act like a girlfriend, to match the pure skill that Nagisa possesses, so she can impress Naoya. Then there is another idiot, the humble busty girl, Nagisa, she isn\'t necessarily an idiot, but her niceness makes her an idiot. She probably has the most character development, because of her backstory at ep 12 (kinda cringe btw). Her overly nice nature, was fun to watch and really funny. She also wants to keep the relationship, even if it means her being number 2. Her goal: Be Naoya\'s girlfriend, but at the same time putting herself down, to prioritize Saki, since she technically stole her man (ah the irony). Her character is actually pretty complex if you think about it. Of course, there is the idiot who falls for a two-timing bastard, the tsundere booba, Rika, basically the antagonist. She is likes Naoya, because harem logic, but gets rejected. Her second identity is a pretty nice plot point, and she speaks fax about the industry. Her goal: Make Naoya lover her, because she can\'t believe a two-timing bastard won\'t fall for her, but it changes to ""I wanna take Naoya for myself"". Last, is the rational, bestfriend chopping board, Shino, she is basically represents society, its views on two-timing. She only appears in the last 3 eps, but makes her point, and is very reasonable. However, Naoya\'s raw determination beats it, as she said ""But, in the end, Mukai is still Mukai"". Also, turns out she used to like him, so that adds depth. Note, if you say ""these characters don\'t feel real"", I think that\'s the point, that\'s the shows comedy aspect, to have characters so outrageous. To summarize:Naoya-determined idiot, who is blatantly honestSaki-usually the voice of reason, but still a idiotNagisa-super nice and wants to stay with Naoya even if it means she has to sufferRika-another determined idiot, who wants to be with NaoyaShino-voice of reason in this absurd situationanyway, I enjoy these characters their over personalities make it intriguing.Ok now were at the plot, this is a pure comedy so it doesn\'t really matter if the plot is bad (if one can balance plot and comedy then it will be legendary), since the main point of a pure comedy is to make us have a good time and a smile on our face while watching. And if the jokes dont hit, then this isn\'t the anime for you. So, the plot is a mess, basically just live with 2 girlfriends-> conflict, because duh-> new girl shows up-> go on vacation-> someone puts sense into them->Final conflict. Living with 2 girlfriends, gives exposition and shows how they interact with each other. The initial conflict (Saki leaving), gives a slice of reality and shows Naoya\'s determination. The result is a deeper bond shared between them. Rika shows up, gives an antagonist, results in funny interactions (actually this whole show is a funny interaction), makes the others jealous (first kiss) and motivates them even more. Go on vacation (travel), just shows more funny interactions, Rika development and sets up the climax with everybody. Someone put sense into them, shows a rational view on their relationship, then mc swears that he can make it it work. Final conflict, major Nagisa development, and mc shows he can make it work. I guess it does since they all seem happy.I just have a blast watching this anime, so the creators accomplished whatthey wan, I guess.tl;dr: The plot is a mess and is stupid, but very funny, the characters are over the top and very exaggerated, however, that is the point, since this anime is a pure comedy.Sorry if I wrote this review wrong, since I summarized the story and gave my opinions on it, but I\'m new to reviewing so cut me some slack also its 5am as I\'m writing this. the show (actually everyone is stupid, except Shino), it makes the show hilarious, because the interactions are priceless.

On one hand it's a harem anime with borderline insane, unlikeable characters who's antics sometimes make me cringe so hard I can feel my skin crawl. On the other hand it is a hilarious comedy anime with borderline insane, likeable characters who's honest, no-holding-back approach to their problems is a breath of fresh air compared to the bog standard, paint-by-numbers, forgettable harem trash we're unfortunately used to consuming.Mukai Naoya, an impulsive, stupid, big-hearted nice guy is dating his childhood friend Saki Saki, a loveably stupid,...loving yet quick to temper girl who is very, very horny and thinks about sex a lot. Minase Nagisa, a cute, pure, incredibly stupid, timid girl (who sometimes will resort to blackmail to protect the things she cares about) one day openly confesses to Naoya with a boxed lunch that she spent 6 months and time off school honing her cooking skills to preparing to make for him. Naoya being the nice guy that he is can't turn her down and so (after a fight with Saki) he decides to date and live with both of them.A funny premise for sure. However, as an anime it has one major flaw. It's just not worth watching over reading the manga. The manga is better paced making the jokes funnier and it's a lot easier to digest the cringe (especially Naoya's) when the scene isn't dragged out and there's no voicing acting attached. In that way it doesn't do enough to distingue itself as it's own thing.

The first 3 episodes are a little difficult to get past as must of the humour lands flat, but once Hoshizaki Rika, a busty, stupid, narcissistic metuber who's trying to keep the fact that she's a famous metuber a secret enters the picture the show starts to pick up steam.I'm honestly not sure how I feel about this one. I personally dropped it after 9 episodes only because I was satisfied with what I had seen of the show, but I think this is a 'try it out for yourself and you'll know if you like or not' sort of anime. I would recommend the manga over the anime personally, but in the end the choice is yours. And no, this is not a hentai.5/10 Mediocre. loving yet quick to temper girl who is very, very horny and thinks about sex a lot. Minase Nagisa, a cute, pure, incredibly stupid, timid girl (who sometimes will resort to blackmail to protect the things she cares about) one day openly confesses to Naoya with a boxed lunch that she spent 6 months and time off school honing her cooking skills to preparing to make for him. Naoya being the nice guy that he is can't turn her down and so (after a fight with Saki) he decides to date and live with both of them.A funny premise for sure. However, as an anime it has one major flaw. It's just not worth watching over reading the manga. The manga is better paced making the jokes funnier and it's a lot easier to digest the cringe (especially Naoya's) when the scene isn't dragged out and there's no voicing acting attached. In that way it doesn't do enough to distingue itself as it's own thing.

But like always, I never consider that maybe the show’s just not going to be even that much fun to poke at, which is where I’m sitting now with this one. Note to self, never watch anything from this artist anymore.Story:A story about some casual polygamy, Mukai Naoya is a boy who managed to get his childhood friend Saki Saki (oh that isn’t a typo) to date him in spite of him pestering her about dating him every month since they were...kids. Now in high school and their relationship set in stone, some other girl comes up to Naoya and confesses to him, saying that she had spent the better part of their first year in high school practicing how to be a good girlfriend because he is the love of her life. For…some reason. Not sure what to do, Naoya does the sensible thing and begs his first girlfriend if it’s ok for him to have a second girlfriend. Which clearly was the correct choice of action and isn’t going to have any lingering consequences in the slightest.The novelty of Hiroyuki’s stories is their absolute nonsensical bullshit that makes you question the validity of your own sanity as you spiral out of control from the cast’s insane suggestions, actions, and strings of dialogue. However unlike Mangaka-san to Assistant-san and Aho Girl, this show is a full cour of 30 minute episodes. And it is…terrible. The show is a few hours worth of characters trying to make an obviously bad polygamous relationship work out with the most compelling joke in the series being the one where Naoya suggests a threesome to the girls before getting shot down. This show lives and dies by its gimmick, and I honestly can’t really say there’s much else about it aside from Hiroyuki’s classic storytelling of watching characters spiral out of control from their own self-made holes that they dug themselves into without considering sensible solutions like calling the police, talking it out, or just not having two girlfriends in the first place. Sure there’re a few wrenches in the plan like Milika’s entire existence, but the plot just kind of runs back to the exact same thing in the end anyway, so things don’t really change as drastically as I think the show thinks it does.And for me, there’s…not really much else I can really say about the show’s story. Every episode is practically the same thing, with the only difference in plot being what brand of crazy we’re dealing with today, all of it leading back to the fact that this two girlfriend situation really isn’t a very good idea! And it continues to not be a good idea until the final minute of the show where even the characters are like “Well we’ll make it work somehow.” No, you will not! You didn’t make it work for 12 episodes, how do you think it’s gonna work out beyond that point?!Characters:Naoya is a special brand of stupid, being that of a man who tries to make both of his girls happy, but is also dumb enough to compliment other girls the way a doting boyfriend would compliment his girlfriend despite the fact that his partner(s) is just standing right there. While not the worst character that Hiroyuki has made by far, Naoya is a character that feels more like an exercise in frustration than a character that’s enjoyable to watch. Naoya exudes the comedic stylings of his original creator, which ends up with a character that’s hellbent on trying to fix situations by escalating them in the dumbest ways possible. And because he’s mostly a mouthpiece, there’s not really much else to say unless I want to write out the amount of times he saves that he loves the girls that he’s with and how amazing they are. Which starts to lose its value heavily when that ends up becoming every other line out of this guy’s mouth.For his girlfriends, Saki and Nagisa, we have a pair that embody both the voice of reason, and the hopeless romantic kind of tropes respectively, with Saki often times acting as the straight man calling out everyone’s bullshit, but not enough to stop the train from happening or resetting the situation back to zero so the crazy, comedic misunderstandings can stop and we can return back to the earth. Nagisa by contrast is the only character with a backstory of some kind. A backstory that isn’t very compelling when you realize that she devoted her time and effort to Naoya of all people. Cute, sure, and would work for a shoujo romance for some insulin sugar moments, but leaves little impact anywhere else because this is a comedy series, and Naoya is a character that rarely makes up his damn mind aside from picking option 3 when given the option to pick either option 1 or option 2.Rika and Shino are the last two characters in this show, and convey the aggressively forward girl who’s both a twitch thot and a walking boob trope, as well as the friend character who rightfully so is concerned about the validity of her friend’s relationship because oh my god, what did Saki do to deserve this? Rika in my opinion greatly overstays her welcome and kind of steals the show in the worst way possible halfway through the show by never taking no for an answer and being an all around nuisance that for all intents and purposes should lead up to a steep number of legal infractions, but it’s all fiction so who cares. The most value these two add is to be obstacles in the threeway relationship, which really doesn’t do them any favors because if your only role is to add conflict, that’s more of a human obstacle for drama than something that has significance to the plot.Aesthetics:Average works for a descriptor. I don’t think Tezuka Productions was going for any awards when they were doing this one, so the way this show looks is…fine for the most part. Credit where credit is due however, the production staff did a good job at replicating Hiroyuki’s style, and even made the slapstick look as good as it did since exaggeration and speed lines were used liberally in order to keep up with the show’s energy and tempo.On the note of the comedy stylings though, this show reuses a lot of jokes. More than I expected. For some reason the show always defaults to a pose where Naoya is grabbing a girl by the shoulders before violently shaking her, as well as physical abuse from Saki because…comedy. This combined with more boob jokes than I think actually needed to be there, and we end up with a lot of very similar looking frames and a lot of exhausting jokes that really lose their luster once they start being told more than three or four times. Yes, we know that Rika has G cups, why do you need to remind us of this fact every episode?Personally I don’t find “Fuzaketenaize” by Necry Talkie or “Pinky Hook” by Momo Asakura to be very compelling songs. If I had to give credit to one being remotely interesting, I’d give it to the OP because it at least starts interestingly and for a brief stint of time, got me interested in this show. I think the main vocalist’s voice is what draws me in for me because it’s such an unusually high voice that contrasts some other aspects of the song, which is a nice contrast if nothing else.Final Thoughts:My slow descent towards a mind filled with tv snow static was a…bizarre turn of events that I didn’t really expect when going into this. The show while I expected would be terrible but fun on paper became something that I not only lost interest in, but became an exercise in concentration as my psyche just couldn’t handle the amount of purposeful stupid that I was subjected to on the screen before drifting off to somewhere else.Personally, I think giving this show a full cour instead of making it a short like the rest of the series’ that Hiroyuki has created was one of the biggest mistakes the production of the show made. Because the show is just one long joke, and that joke can only really be funny for a certain amount of time before it gets stale and becomes a chore to watch instead of an enjoyable viewing experience. I think the most value I got out of this show was the numerous amount of stupid dialogue screenshots that could serve as great meme pics or out of context images that similarly, would be funny for a few seconds and then lose their luster after you get your little chuckle. That and the voice actors really gave it their all to sell the sheer amount of stupid that this show has. Seriously, props to Ayane Sakura for just absolutely destroying her vocal cords for a bit.As an overall viewing experience however, I don’t think this show is worth it. The first episode got a small chuckle out of me because of the novelty of the experience, but after that, it all just goes downhill from there and becomes an exhausting and tiring experience that overall just feels kind of unrewarding to watch. Cause if you produce something like eight episodes of a comedy series and the audience doesn’t laugh once, maybe the concept just really wasn’t as funny as you thought it was. kids.

Yes, the story premise is dumb. The characters act dumb and over the top. But what matters is it\'s fun to watch. It\'s simply fun.Not every piece of media is written to tell some life-changing narrative, to give some message of importance. Things are still made *for fun.* If you watch the first ten minutes of this anime expecting it to take itself seriously, and then dislike it for not taking itself seriously, then the problem isn\'t Kanojo mo Kanojo,...it\'s you bro.This show has been a joy to watch so far. The whole time I laugh and say ""this is so fucking stupid"" but I love every minute of it. The characters are crazy and react as such, the animation while generic fits the content perfectly. The girls are all fun characters (Saki is best though), and yeah the MC is a dense and stupid blockhead, but that\'s the point of him.This anime is for shutting the mind off and laughing at the absurdity of it, and if you\'re into it: consuming the fan service. A solid 7 harem comedy romp. Just gotta be willing to have fun. it\'s you bro.This show has been a joy to watch so far.

doesn\'t deserve it so i\'ll be using MAL rating system with a brief explanation.So we are talking about Kanojo mo KanojoStory: Your generic harem romcom that tries to be innovative by having a actual romance without having routes, it doesn\'t have any story really, it\'s just a guy struggling with polygamy, so why a 2 you ask, well, first thing it the subject of the ""story"" is beyond utopical for modern standards and just makes fun of something that\'s not to be joked around, the progress...is almost nonexistant as their issues with it are pretty subpar instead of realistic ones, and because of the necessity to introduce the other 2 girls in the season they ended up stealing the time of the actual plot for just excessive shitpost, basically its a generic romcom without anything special to it\'s name that tries to be funny towards polygamySo my rating is 2, it just gets 1 extra point for at least being a harem with romance instead of To Love-Ru version 64Art: Pretty straightfoward i don\'t hate nor love it, it doesn\'t look special at all and everything on it looks overly simplistic (without using simplicy as a positive trait) but also doesn\'t look awful to the point of annoying me to look at, also i kinda like the color pallet tbhMy rating is 5, it\'s mediocre, you can also consider it bad and i wouldn\'t judge, but it\'s def not goodSound: Same logic as art, don\'t hate, but never mattered enough for me to care to listen to it nor it has any special traits (they recycle the same sounds on every episode tbh), you could argue a 4 on this if you agree with me that both the ending and opening OST are awful, because they are, but i\'m giving it a 5 because my reasons for it are pretty subjectiveMy rating 5, it\'s mediocre, tho going on personal opinion i would give a 4 because i mostly dislike it whenever i\'m caring about the soundCharacter: I had faith in shino, even tho i knew she was a GF option i thought she would be the one with brains, but nope she also sees hope on the same thing she stated tje issues, so yeah everyone in this anime is stupid, literally everyone, which is bad for character reasons, but the anime barely tries to take itself seriously so it\'s not as bad (unlike bokutachi no remake which tries to take itself seriously while being constantly stupid), the characters are also unidimensional, outside of Nagisa which for a two episodes got promoted as the only character development, from a hopeless person to a hardworker which is something at least, but it gets shown on such a stupid logic, she\'s literally working hard for someone that\'s already dating which means that if the script wasn\'t prepared for polygamy she would either pull a NTR or be rejected, which means her goal was pointless on a logical scenario, Shino also shows some change for her regular self with the whole twist that she liked Naoya before, but like, its a 10 seconds moment, it\'s not enough to really say she stopped being unidimensional, Saki and Mirika are the same from start to finish, Saki is just the comical relief that does what a GF is supposed to do while also being stupid, and Mirika is your average twitch streamer, that\'s also somewhat stupid, with a even more stupid reason to like Naoya, loving someone because he respects your only fans is just hilarious because that mean she could like any of her subs (which he\'s one btw) which makes her reason to like Naoya plain, there\'s nothing special about it, Naoya himself is dumb and annoying for the whole series he doesn\'t change at all, tho it\'s interesting how considerate he is, he\'s still stupid, i think this is enough reasoning to explain my rating tbhMy rating is 3, i don\'t think the characters are like, overly awful, and there\'s some small bits of development, but they\'re mostly bad, and i don\'t disagree with anyone that gives this a 2 or even a 1.Now comes the last rating which funny enough i don\'t use it as my Overral Score because its a  subjective matter, which is the enjoymentAnd funny enough my enjoyment is 8, for a simple logic, i just like stupid humor with excessive shitpost and funny memes etc. I agree with the logic that ""its so cringe that makes it good"" but solely for enjoyment reasons, that doesn\'t fix any of the issues stated above, if you wanna know how to properly use comedy and stupidity without looking like a garbage anime i reccomend understanding why Gintama is one of the most popular animes ever made while having it\'s foundation around memes/Shitpost/stupidity, then you\'ll understand where Kanojo failed on a artistical level.My overral score is 4, it\'s just bad, doesn\'t know how to properly deal with the subject of polygamy, everything lacks development, everything feels generic, but if you like shitposts i reccomend you watch it, a anime doesn\'t need to be a masterpiece for anyone to enjoy it (but that won\'t change the fact that it\'s bad)Honestly i don\'t know what you people expected from the same author of Aho girl, which manages to be a lot worse than this, but at least it doesn\'t touch a sensible topic like polygamy (tho the last episode of it promoting minor sexualization is a gigantic issue), also the anime ends a bit similar to aho girl where it pulls a backstory towards the reason the main subject started (and also it\'s a trivia thing, it\'s one of the reasons they use Aho instead of Baka on this), at least props for the author managing to improve from trash to bad but enjoyable, because at least i enjoyed this while i hated aho

honest with what he wants in his relationships. Good change of pace from plenty of male leads in harm comedies. The characters find themselves in the most contrived awkward situations because the plot demands it... dont think too much about it. This is definitely an anime you need to turn your brain off for. The biggest complaint in the story is that it can often get repetitive and pacing can slow down in some areas. I think more content from the manga could have been adapted to fill the 12 episode...count, so the pacing would be more palatable overall.ArtNot too bad or good, just acceptable. The background characters are by far the most boring looking ones.SoundThe opening is a real bop, and the ending is pretty decent too. The background music sounds like it belongs in Yu-gi-Oh or another shonen anime. Feels out of place for sure.CharacterThe main highlight of this anime. There are no side characters other than a few exceptions who only has a few minutes of screen time. The main lead is defintiely a breath of fresh air from other male harem leads. Complete moron, but has good qualities too. The other characters other than Shino are played up to 11 and act in a unrealistic over the top way. Very endearing somewhat unlikeable characters. The characters carry the series for me.EnjoymentIf you want something serious, look elsewhere. If you want something endearing, over the top, and stupid this is definitely an enjoyable series. You definitely have to turn your brain off though. The pacing can be a bit slow and it can be repetitive, but it is still worth a watch. I think the worst thing a series can be is boring, and this show is generally entertaining througout.OverallThis is the definite dumb fun anime. This is entertaining and I had a fun time. There are leaps in logic, but thats what makes the show fun. It is like placing a bunch of over exagerrated personalities into one room and watching them get into petty conflicts with each other. count, so the pacing would be more palatable overall.ArtNot too bad or good, just acceptable.

This was a disappointment.It started very good, but then it just got more and more annoying. I lost my interest mid-way and really struggled watching the last remaining episodes.I was intrigued by the idea of the polygamy. But honestly, I was disappointed with how immature it was. I felt like the main character was lacking and didn\'t have any depth. He didn\'t have any personality. I wanted to see more of their life as poly-couple, but instead it was all silly ""hush hush"", ""kyaaa oh noo this...and oh no that"". I just couldn\'t connect and relate to it at all. The potential definitely was there, but then all of the characters were just throwing ""NAOYAAAA SUKIIII"" everywhere. It was just such a turn-off.I really liked the cute, light and airy art style. The idea was interesting. But the characters were just lacking. And the way the story developed was just meh. It\'s a no for me.But if you like silly humor and want to watch something ""light"" and ""no-brainer"" with cute characters then go for it! and oh no that"".

Girlfriend, girlfriend is an anime that has a similar effect on your brain as huffing paint. With now brain cells are watch winner and die after watching this anime, it's a miracle I'm able to operate a keyboard. Often times when Watson's anime I would have to stop multiple times to catch a breath at the sheer cringe of this anime. This anime is definitely one for the books in terms of story development and character design. It is kind of interesting in a way it's a little bit similar...to the Quintuplets anime. Although this time the main anime protagonist is both extremely dumb yet somehow ends up with multiple girlfriends. The first episode alone, apply it is already the smoldering dumpster fire. Throughout the show, this dumpster supplier turns more into a chemical fire and then a tire fire.

Whenever I think about degen-shows, I will now forever think of this one at the top of the list. This show has no charm, and instead feels like its constantly trying to cram whatever cliché situations it can find down your throat. Despite the concept that originally got me interested, there is no originality to this show, there is no depth to this show, and there nothing worth watching or sticking around for in this show if...you take anime seriously.But you don\'t have to take anime seriously, and in all seriousness, you shouldn\'t. This is one of most ""its so bad its good"" shows that I have come across in anime, maybe because it feels like its actually trying to be a decent show, unlike others which clearly want to be made fun of like Trinity Seven. If you are able to shift your perspective on this show and laugh at more the characters and writers as opposed to the jokes themselves, you might have an enjoyable experience on your hands. To be honest, there aren\'t that many shows that can consistently make me laugh as much as Kanojo mo Kanojo can. Think of this as like the Amazing Spiderman 2 or The Room of anime, I myself like to think that the story is actually a social experiment on Saki to destroy her mind from the inside. Every time some ""serious"" development occurred I laughed, whenever that stupid soundtrack came on trying to set a gentler tone I laughed, it is just waaay too stupid not to laugh at.The artstyle looks good on the surface, but several episodes into the show it really does not hold up. The animation was never really that good (the first shot of the entire show with a basketball turned me away from watching it twice), and the artstyle is just way too bright for me. The colour palette feels very boring, and I feel like I could\'ve enjoyed the show a little bit more if the lines were darker and more dominant. Also, there are a lot of weird shots where they would zoom out of a second layer of the frame to fit with the current layer, similar to the quick-time events from Balan Wonderworld, which is NOT the comparison you want to be drawing. The voice acting performances were fine, Junya Enoki really made the most out of his character, I was not a fan of the VA for Rika that much as her performance was kind of just annoying (which I guess is in line with the character herself so...), but what\'s amazing is that the VA for Saki is the same VA for Mari from Joshiraku, which is great and hilarious at the same time.So in conclusion, if you can remove yourself from the actual story of this show, the characters and their feelings, and all the cringe, you can turn this absolute garbage fire into a stupid fun night if you\'re bored, or have some drinks with friends. This is a bit of a shorter review, but this is one of those shows where you really have to see it for yourself. :) you take anime seriously.But you don\'t have to take anime seriously, and in all seriousness, you shouldn\'t.

It revolves around Naoya Mukai who had continually begged his childhood friend Saki Saki to be his girlfriend...but then he opts for ""two-timing"" when a girl named Nagisa confessed to him.To describe the show, it is awkward because of the concept. But it is also bizarrely funny. The characters themselves are likable in their own ways: Naoye is a character who is...hard to figure out. There is obviously something wrong with him. Basically, he is someone who is very, very criminally honest. He finds himself liking Nagisa despite the fact that...he is already in a relationship, but he tries to somehow make both girls happy with the relationship. It\'s not so much that he is being cruel or rude with the ""two-timing..."" his mind is just wired weirdly. Like him rejecting Nagisa\'s confession amounts to him thinking that he was lying about seeing her as attractive or something like that.Saki is also pretty good. She is the one that does suffer from feeling insecure when it comes to sharing Naoya with Nagisa: she can\'t cook; really do chores; or anything really, but you do feel bad for her in some ways. But it is funny when she beats the stuffing out of him whenever he sticks his foot in his mouth.Nagisa, at first I did not get: the first few episodes of why she was so intense with wanting to get together with Naoya aside from a brief flashback that shows she met him a semester or so again from afar. She is sweet and is typically seen as Saki\'s rival since she is better than Saki in lots of ways: cooking, doing chores, giving unadulterated attention to Naoya...but it comes at a cost: she spent all her time bettering her cooking skills, body, etc. that she has the worst grades in her class.Animation\'s fine nothing too special.

Works for meAnd so anime was solved forever."" ~SungWon ChoThis show is basically that sketch made into a real anime. The standard rules for high school comedies are thrown out the window as protagonist decides to just date them both. But he has standards, he won\'t 3 or 4-time on his girlfriends that he\'s 2-timing with. That\'d be immoral. So with that we have the standard love polygon formula back in play, only now it\'s with protagonist\'s first two girlfriends and potentially 2 other girls, just treating the first two...as a single point on the polygon since they are both apparently fine with the arrangement as it stands.The comedy from this show is derived from how it manages to pretend to break the rules of it\'s tropes while actually doing nothing of the sort. It still has the same misunderstandings and obnoxious jealousy situations you\'re used to seeing, but with a new hat that makes it look just barely a little different. I still had a ton of fun watching it, and it\'s not like it wasn\'t without it\'s unique moments. but it\'s a 10/10 concept with a 7/10 execution.

Not because it\'s polygamy but because I dont even know where to start.KmK is a pitiful attempt at legitimating polygamy using every shortcut possible to force a romance between the characters.Let\'s start with the beginning. The MC starts dating his childhood friend (cliché I know) then a cute girl he doesnt even know confess to him and he forces his girlfriend to accept a two time relationship. So we\'ve got a main character that put on the same level his childhood crush and a cute girl he just met. It\'s stupidly beautiful how stupid it is....I genuinely dont know if this man doesnt really love his girlfriend or if he\'s just plainly stupid. The author doesnt even know what a relationship is and he/she wants to convey a message about polygamy ? It\'s absolutely shameful to use polygamy as a fanservice way to sell more books using multiple girls. I\'ve already read multiple mangas about it. Some decent one and a peculiar one which is on my all time high list of the best books i\'ve read. But this...Let\'s be clear, it\'s only the first episode of it. I dont want to spoil anything important but later on, two other girls fall in love with the MC (what a spoil they\'re both on the cover picture). One is a sort of prostitute or idk what who wants to go out with the MC because her ego refuses the fact that the MC goes out with two women but no her. Oh and she\'s famous on youtube because she posts videos of her breast aswell. The other girl isnt really covered by that first season of the anime.Obviously, it\'s not rocket science to guess it but characters are terrible. The MC is the biggest idiot i\'ve ever seen. He has no personality, talks without reflecting, he acts without reflecting. Simple he has never used his brain once in this anime. Everything he does is plainly stupid. I spend my time criticizing the virgin MC in romance animes but this MC makes me miss the virgin MC.  It\'s flabbergasting.The girls are... Well the blue girl is an objet. She decides to live with the MC without even knowing him, she fell in love with him without even talking to him, she accepts polygamy because ""if it wasnt for polygamy, he would have rejected me"". Yes let\'s not be ashamed of it. She\'s an objet, a cute little thing to ""protect"". Oh and does it surprise you if I say to you that she\'s good at doing chores ? Haha obviously notThe red one is, well as her friend said ""a pushover"" she says yes to everything when you force her. And indeed she accepts everything, the two time relationship, the other blond girl later on. Everything.The blond girl (youtube, breast you remember ?) is the tsundere princess. She tries forcing the MC to love her (which shouldnt be complicated if the author were coherent because that\'s exactly what happened with the blue haired girl...) because of her ego. Then she really falls in love with him because... Ehhh because that\'s it.Overall this anime is a shame. It uses polygamy as a source of fanservice, relationships are terrible. Character dev is almost non existent, the MC is one of the worst i\'ve ever seen, there is no deepness whatsoever nor story. It\'s just their daily lives. Near the end, some smart points are used like ""how do you wanna live in polygamy it\'s not even accepted by the law"" and those kind of things  but our MC is smart ! He will do it !

I hope people enjoy my review and enjoy your weekend"", ""this anime is an unapologetically misogynistic dumpster fire that serves as a power fantasy for men that cannot grasp emotions such as empathy or compassion. featuring *incredibly* realistic girls that are willing to do anything for a man they barely know and even more alarmingly an abusive and manipulative mc whose harassment is treated as mere thoughtfulness and consideration, this anime does little but serve the eye of men who view women as no more than objects. the mc is shown constantly grabbing women by the shoulders, waist, etc. that are obviously very uncomfortable with the situation, while the only thing the mc does to...help the situation is to creepily walk closer to said victims. his harassment of his first girlfriend, saki, as he asks her to go out with him every month for years before her finally giving in to his unwanted provocation is played off as his biggest strong suit, determination, and is shown to be just about the most attractive thing to the girls that seemingly fall in love with him at first sight. one of the girls even notes that saki only agreed to let him two-time because she is a pushover and with enough harassment will do what he wants, but don't worry its okay because that girl is also going to fall in love with him!i would not give such a review if it was just some random hentai or whatnot. the reason i am writing this review is because of how generally well received this anime was and how, looking through the reviews, most people don't seem to understand how incredibly harmful the positive reception of this anime is, and how incredibly harmful it would be if misogynistic pieces such as this continue to be normalized. help the situation is to creepily walk closer to said victims. his harassment of his first girlfriend, saki, as he asks her to go out with him every month for years before her finally giving in to his unwanted provocation is played off as his biggest strong suit, determination, and is shown to be just about the most attractive thing to the girls that seemingly fall in love with him at first sight. one of the girls even notes that saki only agreed to let him two-time because she is a pushover and with enough harassment will do what he wants, but don't worry its okay because that girl is also going to fall in love with him!i would not give such a review if it was just some random hentai or whatnot. the reason i am writing this review is because of how generally well received this anime was and how, looking through the reviews, most people don't seem to understand how incredibly harmful the positive reception of this anime is, and how incredibly harmful it would be if misogynistic pieces such as this continue to be normalized."", 'Unfortunately this anime does a great disservice to the manga.The manga is indeed obvious satire based on Kyogen traditional Japanese comedy, which can be described as slapstick, jackass and buffoonery. It is obvious starting from the style in manga (where each character is represented with a mouth open for half of the face either yelling or in exasperation). Each character in manga is obvious idiot from the beginning.The satire includes not only the harem genre per se, as something only complete idiots can go into and even make it work, but also Japanese society and customs, where not only the moral choice of...not rejecting a second girl does exist, because she worked hard and you have to be selfless and polite, but also the outcome of this choice, where a second wife is not a rarity.The main idea is that MC is so proper and true, thus, inflicting any inconvenience to the other party is impossible. Therefore, when 2 girls propose, it is impossible to turn away any of them. The only ethical solution that is paradoxical but apparently works, if all parties are in consent to date both of them. But this is how the troubles only begun. The heroes are so busy trying not to hurt each other so they have no time to ... almost anything. The intimacy is also a huge problem, if one goes first, the other will be hurt. The MC sees a threesome as a solution but it also looks immoral to them.The author of the manga just drives this custom to absurdity, adding third and second girls. The third girl is also obvious Japanese stereotype of the blond girl with the boobs, anti-Japanese, rude, selfish, grabbing what she wants without any manners. The fourth girl is an illustration that no matter how smart you are, love will make you an idiot.To the show\'s defense, it is really hard to translate this manga into an action.The panels in the manga take most intensive moments so the manga looks like a series of the still shots when the heroes are yelling. Of course this style is extremely hard to accommodate into an anime but the failure of the show is not only in this.It is not only that filling the time gaps between the panels adds new nuances and add character to the characters where it wasn\'t in the source material.The director just doesn\'t understand the spirit, the atmosphere of the manga. In the resulting show the pace feels wrong, the highlights are on the wrong moments, the key moments are subdued, etc.The MC is not shown as painfully proper. He is shown as a creep who cannot decide which girl to date so he asks to date them both.The girl do not behave like in manga despite saying the same words. They are just plain unnatural.And here is why. They tried to turn a parody and slapstick into a romcom and failed.They tried to make it more like ordinary romance story and this fails on the same level as you try to insert Ronald McDonald into Oregairu and do not notice he doesn\'t fit.Mostly they fail to translate the key moments.A little spoiler here.Saki-chan is freaking out that she doesn\'t do something special for Naoya and the suspense grows and at some point Saki does something extraordinary and everybody is WTF?! and she is ""he finally asked me for something"" and this is hilarious because his ask was more like a figure of speech but the catharsis is real and disproportionate.And they failed. They have made the trick obvious and the catharsis subdued. WFT?!Episode 5 actually shows some light in the end of the tunnel but it is already chapter 13!!! not rejecting a second girl does exist, because she worked hard and you have to be selfless and polite, but also the outcome of this choice, where a second wife is not a rarity.The main idea is that MC is so proper and true, thus, inflicting any inconvenience to the other party is impossible.

That being said, I feel even though I\'ve only seen 5 episodes at the time of writing this, my opinion won\'t change.This show is bad. Horrible even. Cringe-worthy material. But it is so good at the same time. It\'s a bad show that hides a surprisingly deep story underneath.You see, just because a show has a horrible script, bad pacing, and annoying voice acting doesn\'t make a show a ""bad show"". Sometimes, that\'s the whole point....""Why would I want to watch a show where the MC literally wants to go out with more than one girl?"" The absurdity of it makes it hilarious. The poorly written lines with terrible shrieking of the voice actors makes for hilarious content.But what makes this show even more confusing is that it actually has a really sweet story underneath all the bad. This guy doesn\'t just want to go out with as many girls as possible. He is trying to share his love with other people, and it weirdly kinda makes sense. He likes this one girl, but when someone cute shows up confessing THEIR love for you what do you do? Reject them or break up with your current girlfriend? It takes a hard situation and puts a comedic spin on it. And I can\'t get myself to stop watching it. I really enjoy this show and when it\'s over, will probably find the manga somewhere to read it.

If you liked 100 girlfriends you will like this one too. The comedy was top notch in this, it had some laugh out loud moments. I watched the dub and the sub and personally the dub had some killer lines like ""are you gunna shit in the yard"" ""Woof woof sweat checks"" ""You are one nasty little girl"" strait had me dying and sending a video...to all my friends. Every episode kept the story moving and never felt boring. The animation, art and, coloring were just as good as the first. Such a vibrant color palette really makes this anime pop. The music in this one was fantastic also, the op and ed were just strait bangers, I would listen to them in the car while driving to and from work. They are following the manga almost completely. A lot of the plot twist and events that happened I honestly forgot about. What a great show, season 3 is gunna be a banger!! 10/10 to all my friends.

Feels like this was really made in a rush with the intention to satisfy the average loser biggest dream, have 4 or more girlfriends at the same time! So epic. Trend going along with ""100 girlfriends to date me blah blah"" anime.Oh boy what has happened to romcoms lol, same exaggerating facial expressions, same ""funny anime moment"", the slip and either fall into boobs or grab boob. Girl slapping someone because they saw pantsu etc. And what does kanojo mo kanojo do...different? Ding ding! you are correct, nothing. Its pretty lame, cashgrab to watch season 2 where something happens, as in someone gets mad over who is getting more time with the boyfriend, i guess.You can expect the usual here, bikini episode, road trip, hot water place spa? (forgor the name).Characters are basic, and the only motive is ofc something that the boyfriend(mc) did something in the past to help the girl and now she has had a crush for him over 30000 years. And ofc she confesses in midts of all this poly/harem drama.Just watch something else, this is not even the slightest funny. Very much forced comedy. Slop content 2024.Art is whatever is standard in 2015, music is boring who cares, mc cant handle basic human interactions because he is so shy and ""we need to exaggerate everything in a romcom haha""I would recommend taking a break from anime if this is a 10/10 that another reviewer meant. A 3 year old break different? Ding ding! you are correct, nothing.

Especially for a character named Shino! I really hate it!What business did he have to lecture other people's relationships? I think it's up to them...whether they want to be ambiguous or not, Shino has no right to make useless questions about their relationship.Honestly, this really annoys me, if only there were no debates like that, maybe I could enjoy this anime until the end, or at least minimize debates that end up just stalling for broadcast time.I hope the second season is better than this one, because even so I still like it, even if not the last episode. whether they want to be ambiguous or not, Shino has no right to make useless questions about their relationship.Honestly, this really annoys me, if only there were no debates like that, maybe I could enjoy this anime until the end, or at least minimize debates that end up just stalling for broadcast time.I hope the second season is better than this one, because even so I still like it, even if not the last episode."", ""English.It seems that this series is going to fulfill the heroic dreams of many people, this is very simple in its concept, a couple of boyfriends have a relationship of three after going through a series of events that made all this happen, now how the series progresses plot throughout the series and the story is very... curious?, since not only do they not show us an interesting story of a three-person relationship and its possible complications, they show us a group of teenagers who lead with all this in their day by day in the most heroic way possible since it is the best...that the writers of this series could do.
