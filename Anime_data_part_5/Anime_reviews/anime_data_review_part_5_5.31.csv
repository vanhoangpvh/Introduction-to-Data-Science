Kurayukaba,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56553/Kurayukaba,"[""The atmospheric setting of the narrative evokes a blend of metropolitan energy and industrial-era rusticity, with some small steampunk undertones for some vehicles. Set against the backdrop of the industrial revolution, the story unfolds in the labyrinthine tunnels of an underground railway system, teeming with vibrant communities and towns.Centered around a detective grappling with a perplexing missing persons case, each crime scene is marked by enigmatic symbols, drawing him inexorably into the depths of the underground. Beginning his investigation by infiltrating the notorious Laughing Masks gang, the detective soon discovers that the true perpetrators lurk in the shadows, orchestrating events with sinister intent.As the plot...unfolds, the narrative takes a somewhat jarring turn in its final act. The detective's sudden recollection of crucial details regarding the culprits, attributed to a mysterious form of hypnotic suggestion, feels somewhat contrived. Nonetheless, the narrative presses onward as the protagonist accompanied by the enigmatic Tanne, delve deeper into the murky depths of the underground.Throughout their journey, Tanne, a figure shrouded in mystery, accompanies the detective, hinting at a deeper backstory that remains tantalizingly elusive. However, despite these hints, the narrative fails to fully explore her character, leaving the audience yearning for a deeper understanding of her role in the unfolding events.While the resolution of the case ultimately feels somewhat lacking in depth, it is evident that the narrative is constrained by the limitations of its runtime, leaving many intriguing threads unresolved. Despite this, the film's richly atmospheric setting and compelling premise ensure an engaging viewing experience, even if the resolution may leave some viewers wanting more. unfolds, the narrative takes a somewhat jarring turn in its final act.

This is almost intrinsecally niche, showcasing a hazy plot that doesn't even aim to be complete whatsoever. What I mean by this is, Kurayukaba is unapologeticaly unconventional, pathologically enigmatic and, even then, I completely felt for it, from beggining to end. And believe me, if you're a sucker for rich worlbuildings- specially for steampunk settings-, atmospheric and clever- even if sometimes confusing- storytelling or experimental art, then this is certainly worth your time.If you feel tempted to watch this film, even if just a...bit, then it's noteworthy to say that this belongs to a two-film project, the other one being Kuramekukagari, both 1-hour long. I haven't watched the latter, but it seems just as interesting as this one. Even then, what about Kurayukaba? What makes it good or special? Well, first and foremost: it's setting. This film feels limited both by budget and timelenght, and even then it does everything and then some to sell you in it's vast, dynamic and eerie world, prompted by amazing art direction, active efforts to deepen in small yet rich details of the scenary whenever it's possible and a general sense of atmosphere, an uncomfortable call to your curiosity and desire to discover more about what's hidden in the darkness of the rails. It has been long, and I mean, very long, since I felt so fascinated by a fictional setting, since I had that sensation that, if I could take control of the camera and look around, I'd find life and secrets in every corner.On the other hand, the plot suffers a bit more due to the lack of time, but the film tackles that issue in the best way possible: not a single dialog seems wasted, things are left for the viewer to figure out and the story progresses at a pace that both let's you appreciate the world around you, but doesn't let you enough time to lose the sense of speed and dizzyness of the overall mistery. In the end, we don't arrive at a definitive answer, the world is too vast to unravel and we just witnessed a small stage where things happened before and after. It could be more well rounded up, but considering it's limitations, it felt like the best experience possible around the strambotic premisse of this narrative.In conclusion, this gave me a very specific vibe, one I rarely feel, in fantasy stories such as Robert Holdstock's Lavondyss, or dark, misteryous tales such as Midori (the non-rapey parts I mean), a feeling that there's always something bigger than you, some enticing magic on the words and imagery that will swallow you up anytime or wake you up at the snap of a finger. And that's, I believe, one of the most powerful feelings a work of art can ever make you feel. bit, then it's noteworthy to say that this belongs to a two-film project, the other one being Kuramekukagari, both 1-hour long.

Miss Monochrome The Animation 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30384/Miss_Monochrome_The_Animation_2,"[""To kick things off, I presume that you - the person reading this - has watched the first season of Miss Monochrome: The Animation. In that case I,ll get straight to business.Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 continues the story of Miss Monochrome, Maneo manager and Ruu-chan. Each episode focuses on one of the aspects of super idol life, like touring, fanbases, merchandise and so forth, much like the first season.Each episode lasts longer than last season, allowing for better plots for the individual episodes. The show is as light-hearted and funny as ever, and all in all I'd like to say that Miss...Monochrome: The Animation 2 does what the first season did, but even better :DAn enjoyable watch! Monochrome: The Animation 2 does what the first season did, but even better :DAn enjoyable watch!"", 'The Japanese T-Pain is back! Miss Monochromosome returns to bring us longer episodes! More songs! More rope to hang ourselves with! Yet despite my trepidation at returning to a short that I hadn\'t enjoyed previously, it seems something happened in the last two years that means this Miss Monochrome was actually a somewhat enjoyable watch (maybe it was the GF:Beta cameo? Maybe not).Season two of Miss Monochrome picks up where 2013\'s story left off. Left penniless after being conned by Mana-chan out of her fortune, Miss Monochrome now lives in a tiny, tumbledown room with a newspaper bed with only her charging station, her job...at the convenience store & her faithful robovac Ruu-chan left. But those setbacks clearly haven\'t put a dent in her determination to pursue her dream of becoming a top idol, so she\'s back on her feet with a plan to make an album & go on tour. If only she knew where to start.The changes between season one & two of Miss Monochrome are pretty much all for the better. The story this season has a much more relaxed pace than in season one, which struggled with its shorter run time & less focused story to feel like more than something stuck in front of a music video promo. The longer length of each episode means that each story has more time to be setup & carried through, & since most of the characters in season one return to season two it means less time is needed for character introductions. It\'s also clear even before the announcement of season 3 that season two really shouldn\'t be viewed as a complete story in itself, which explains why its climactic episode feels like a mid-season finale rather than an actual ending.The humour also seems to have improved noticeably. References are given more weight than just a passing quote or remark, & some episodes indulge in some particularly absurd scenarios. My personal favourite was when Miss Monochrome is briefly whisked away on a whirlwind romance - sorry, ""friendship""- by a giant battery (Shocking, isn\'t it?) There are some atrocious puns (promoter...pro-motorist...Initial D reference opportunity!) & it does suffer the usual anime problem of repeating a joke ad nauseum, though.The returning characters are all more or less as they were. Maneo continues to be Miss Monochrome\'s well meaning but not all that helpful boss & manager. Mana shows up now & then to remind everyone that she\'s happy to help when the opportunity to defraud presents itself. Kikuko is there to offer encouragement when her & Miss Monochrome\'s paths cross, & Ruu-chan continues to be the little robovac that could. The only noticeable change to the existing characters is Miss Monochrome seems to have learned sarcasm between season one & now, but not how to express it in a way others can pick up on it. This ties in with the main new character introduced to the show, Yayoi, who is a gullible klutz that will all too eagerly rush out to do whatever ridiculous thing Miss Monochrome tasks her with. The other main addition is Akiko, a coworker at the convenience who can also play a wicked guitar riff. Overall they\'re an enjoyable bunch to watch, though Yayoi\'s insistence of saying ""I\'m such a klutz"" every episode gets annoying pretty fast.It would be amiss to talk about Miss Monochrome without mentioning the music, since that\'s what it\'s really all about. I won\'t pretend to be a fan of what\'s normally considered idol or vocaloid music, so I wouldn\'t say any of it was particularly enjoyable. However, it all seemed okay for what it is & the OP in particular had some charm to it that meant I didn\'t skip it after the first listen. The same can\'t be said for the ED, though. Not because of the song, which was alright for what it was. However, the ED sees the return of the 3D Monochrome performing a mocapped dance routine & it\'s even more the stuff of nightmares than last time. The mocap is good enough that the body moves like an actual person, which makes Miss Monochrome\'s oversize anime head bobbling about on top of her shoulders look like something out of a horror film.Much to my surprise, Miss Chromosome 2 turned out to not only be an improvement on season one, but actually rather enjoyable to someone who didn\'t really like it previously. It\'s not without its problems, but it has it\'s charm & the focus of lighthearted comedy rather than the usual teen melodrama that usually makes up idol stories is a refreshing change. Will have to wait & see if season three continues this, but for now Miss Chromosome 2 is a enjoyable first half & a notable improvement on what came before. at the convenience store & her faithful robovac Ruu-chan left.

Now that I have watched it, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed.For those who don’t know the story of Miss Monochrome, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 is a continuation of the first season, Miss Monochrome: The Animation. Our main character, Miss Monochrome, wants to stand out and become a famous idol. Although she has taken a few steps to become one, she doesn’t know what else to do from there. As a result, she decides to make her first album and go on tour.The...pacing in this anime is somewhat slow as the episodes carry on with its story. With that being said, the story progresses much more. Something that should be noted, before you watch this, is that it builds its suspense off of the first season. If you watch this alone, you might not feel the same suspense as for the people who watched the first one. I advise that you watch the first season before you watch this. The thing that interested me the most about Miss Monochrome was its ridiculous, over-the-top comedy. While Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 pertains some of that over-the-top comedy, it doesn’t hold that same amount as the first season.Needless to say, the art style of Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 is very reminiscent of the first one. The atmosphere is upbeat, light, and the character designs are unique as always. However, the upbeat atmosphere sort of counteracts with Miss Monochrome’s sense of humor making the anime seem a bit of a mess. There is also a bit of 3D CGI included, but only at the ending theme song like the first season.Moreover, the characters are the same except that Miss Monochrome has developed a sense of humor and a bit of a selfish personality. For example, she is more sarcastic in this than the first season. Being the android that Miss Monochrome is, she doesn’t know when to use sarcasm properly. While some may find this humorous, others may find this to be off-putting as the same jokes are repetitively used. Speaking of sarcasm, when Yayoi Konno, a new character that wasn’t seen before in the first season, takes what Miss Monochrome says to heart, she creates a larger than life situation which usually results for the worse. Expanding on a few characters I mentioned, some additions include Akiko, a talented guitarists who is conveniently an employee at the store where the main characters work at, Yayoi Konno, Miss Monochrome’s promoter who is a bit of a klutz and overambitious about the work she does, and there’s an idol group called Caramel, but I won’t go into too much detail about them.Surprisingly, all of the voice actors and actresses have returned except with a few new additions. If you didn’t know, Ruu-chan has gotten a voice actor. Unfortunately, he doesn’t speak as much as I hoped for, but nonetheless, he was still fun to hear. Akiko and Yayoi were also fun to hear, I thought they were a great addition to the show as they seem to create fun moments. For those who wanted an opening in the first season, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 has added a theme song called Black or White which is about one minute long. Also, the ending theme song is called Step by Step which is about two minutes long and mocapped with a 3D CGI version of Miss Monochrome which is similar to the first season’s ending. Both songs are sung by Miss Monochrome; if you’re a fan of VOCALOID, you might like the way she sounds. To me, the opening and ending theme songs sounded all right, I did not hate it nor did I like it.Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 does make references to other shows here and there, incorporating it into the story which indeed make it funnier. It also references jokes back to the first season. However, the only issue I had with this anime was that it didn’t seem to have the same amount of humor like the first season. Some episodes were funnier than the others and other episodes felt stale. Like I said before, it felt like it was more plot driven and climactic.If you want to get a better understanding of the comedy and story, it is advised to watch the first season. On the other hand, if you want to understand the references they make, note that this is not required to make it more enjoyable but you might want to check out a few other animes such as Initial D, Golden Time, and Wooser no Sono Higurashi. Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2’s humor pertains some of its unexpected funny moments, however, it is not as random as it was in the first season. Unfortunately, the show sets up for a third season. Hopefully, we will see Miss Monochrome become a popular idol. I look forward to watching the third season. pacing in this anime is somewhat slow as the episodes carry on with its story.

The episodes are longer. Therefore more content. I have to say, the anime doesn\'t have anything substantial in these longer episodes, it is like the 1st season but drawn out, what I will say however is that the anime does indeed have a plot going for itself in a linear direction, unlike the 1st season\'s episodic nature. It makes for a lot more interesting stuff but it is still in line with the...random nonsense that happens with Miss Monochrome and her life. It is good, but quality doesn\'t improve or impair. As for characters, it is the same, more specifically, there is very minor development in any character. As for the new character, Yayoi, she is a walking cliche, being a klutz when working and an aggressive person behind the wheel.

Every story was locked to the childlike android personality that naturally led to fiasco, but in a comical development, and Monochrome's never giving up attitude in her ever miserable circumstances was inspiring, just as was the season's tear-jerking happy ending.The title was a success so the second season could afford: many new characters, OP+ED (vs just ED) and other things. But the magic of the original series was left behind in the Season 1.There're, sure, nice things that the fans must and will enjoy: a perfect OP; Monochrome inventing delayed joke as her...thing; Mana-chan's cameo - that she rocked - expected nothing less from her; lots of little cyber jokes...But it is all diluted in a lot of water, and - most of all - not held together by the original concept: as Monochrome became successful, she lost her charm and the sympathy of the audience.

I think it helps that the story focuses more on the business side of becoming an idol. Plus, the length of the episode has nearly doubled! This definitely feels like the animation studio has gotten the hang of things when it comes to this franchise. They even fixed mistakes that were in the earlier episodes, like how in the first episode the robot vacuum suddenly talks but then they remove that in the next episode. It also helps with their experiments using a play on...words, such as the multiple definitions of an album and how they initially go on tour.Episode 2 was my favorite episode - they did the Tokyo Drift! I was surprised that the robot vacuum suddenly gained magical transformation powers, but it fit very well in the context of that scene. I do wish that they stopped making Yayoi-tan so clumsy all the time, though. I find her constant tripping on nothing to be a bit annoying.Episode 8 was weird. They probably needed to pad for time. I recommend skipping that episode.The ending was somewhat satisfying, however Mana still owes Miss Monochrome from the first season!I realize that I didn't talk about the music in the first season. However, considering that there was only one song, I don't have much else to say, other than the repetition was annoying. However, there are quite a few songs this season, and I enjoy them more than the song in the first season. Again, it felt like they were getting the hang of things this season. It feels like everything has more direction, from the anime to the music.

Best part is you don't need much context from the first season in order to get into this one. All you need to know is she wants to become an idol, and you don't have to worry about the rest.

Kidou Senshi Gundam AGE,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10808/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_AGE,"['Since completing the series, I feel I should update this review.Well, this will be my first ever review for a series.. reasons for me actually taking the time to write one, is because I believe this is a very underrated series as it\'s part of the Gundam franchise.. I\'ll break it down.Story: 10The story progress was brilliance at it\'s best. The show progresses throughout 100 years, and moves through three generations.. I felt this was a very interesting concept that could be explored in other Gundam series in the future. There was a lot of accusations towards this series about being a children\'s version...of a Gundam series.. This is inaccurate, as throughout the entire series it is very serious in the way it approaches the dialogue and story..Art: 10Why? because it was different then what I normally see and now in the end, it\'s unique.. People complain that the art is childish. the Gundam wasn\'t designed well,etc.. if you pay attention it develops into a very well designed Gundam; following the series as both the story and the characters evolve.Sound: 9The sound design is amazing, but out of the OP or ED I have grown increasingly fond of \'My World\' by SPYAIR.. the song has such a great meaning behind it, which is a perfect fit for the arc, and after this series I have become a great fan of their music and I recommend anyone who enjoys the ED to check out the rest of their music line up.Enjoyment: 10I greatly enjoy this series, because I\'ve grown to love each of the characters.. As you move through each arc you clamor to find out what happens to each of the side characters, the previous main characters, etc.. overall the show just engulfs you until the very end.. It proves that if you stick with it, it can stand with even the best of the franchise.Overall: 10This series has been a complete joy to watch and I wish it would of went farther into the storyline, definitely worth the watch.. if your hanging on the fence to watch or not watch, this is no SD Gundam.. and for that I am thankful.. To me this ranks with Gundam Wing and Gundam 00 , which are among my favorite series.. Go watch this already.. quoted from a comment on GA.com episode 20..

""People hated AGE, but it just keeps getting better and better..""', ""I was quite reluctant to write a review on this, but after seeing this anime getting so much hate which it truly doesn't deserve, at least not until someone has seen at least first few episodes of an anime which is expected to have a 4Q run (50-ish episodes), I decided to write a review on much hated Gundam AGE to share my takes on it.What the synopsis tells is, the story begins with the death of Flit Asuno's mother. Flit's mother, and probably his entire family became a victim of an attack by Unidentified Enemy, or UE as they are referred to in short....Flit, a genius, carrying the bloodline of Asuno family, often regarded as the geniuses who have been the creators of previous models of Gundam, creates the Gundam AGE and develops its AGE System to protect everyone from further attacks from UE.Lame the whole story synopsis sounds I know, and I was myself reluctant to watch this anime after seeing Gundam 00 franchise ending up being a complete trainwreck with 'aliens' in the movie 'A wakening of the Trailblazer' courtesy of Director Mizushima. ALIENS! is a NO NO for Gundam. Dare I say, we have Macross for that. So I was expecting pretty much similar failure of 'Aliens in Gundam' which never would work out. But after seeing the first three episodes, I can humbly say, it would have been a mistake to not have followed this series. Because so far, it has had a very steady but nicely paced development of a story that is expected to improve much more from here on out!So here are my few takes.Flit is our 14 year old protagonist, although looks more like a 10 year old. Yeah, he is a couple of years younger than Setsuna F. Seiei and Kira Yamato, which is a BIG MINUS(!) for most of us. I seriously don't know why though.FIGHTING against ALIENS? Did they ever once show that the opponents are aliens? If you have asked me, they look more like mobile suits in Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari. And there is no way to tell they are 'alines'. At least they gave hints that those could be piloted by men's worst enemy. If you are smart enough, you might as well assume the rest. It's alright for Flit though, as long as he keeps thinking he is fighting aliens. No level headed 14 year old would keep his cool aiming his DODS Beam Rifle and destroying mobile suits being piloted by a species you would rather not aim at.As many have stated already in their hatred, this is a matter of fact, a Wonderful KID'S ANIME(!), I will assume it is to be one, since it just showed nothing more than a little girl holding a teddy on one hand and her mother on the other and crying her eyes out seeing the place she was born being destroyed right before her, a helpless young boy unable to save his mother as she dies right in front of him, an entire space colony being destroyed with countless lives lost and lots of blood.The characters are matured, despite some of them just being kids. Fourteen year old Flit is actually more matured than Setsuna and Kira ever became in their twenties. Emily is your 'simple' girl as many gundams had in their run, but unlike most of those, she seems to be the main heroine of the anime. Although Yurin, a mysterious girl, have grabbed my attention the most so far. The rest of the side characters so far have an air around them, which makes them not just another side character, two of them who stood out are Aynor Grudech and Aloi Miles. However, the character designs follow the old Gundam, and Gundam Zeta franchise, which might not be taken lightly by some fans, who actually loved the more matured and detailed character designs in newer gundams like Gundam SEED and Gundam 00. Don't get me wrong, since I am one of them too.The background details and the background music in Gundam AGE are nothing short of brilliant. I am really impressed with the level of animation quality they have put in an anime that is expected to run a whole year! The OP by Galileo Galilei is good, but the ED by Kuribayashi Minami is one of the best of all the OPEDs of anime airing at this moment of time.The only thing probably I am really trying to overlook is the Gundam model itself, which is not as detailed as the gundams we have seen over the last decade or so. I cannot agree more with those who think the Gundam AGE design is mediocre and lacks originality, because I thought the same way too. But what gives? I already think the anime has huge potential and could be one of the better shows this season, or might even become one of the best shows in the whole calender year. You just never know. Into episode three, and it has shown much more promise than Gundam 00 managed in its entire first half of season one. There you go. I have just said it. I hope you didn't judge Kemono no Souja Erin by its cover, and I will request you not to do so for Gundam AGE too! We are definitely going to see a few time-skips!

I was raised by badly-dubbed Malay episodes of G Gundam and Gundam Wing, and i\'ve seen the first two episodes of Gundam SEED and i kind of enjoyed it.When i heard about people raging over Gundam AGE, i said to myself ""Hm, stupid weeaboos not being raised by Doraemon, Astro Boy and Ninja Boy"". From the character design i can basically tell that it\'s not only for kids, but it\'s also for parents or those raised by traditional kids anime from the 80\'s and early 90\'s. And i understand that. This is not for the 00/SEED fan. And...it pretty much says that in the artwork.But seeing the first two episodes, i said to myself ""Hey, this is not bad. Not a great start like 00 but still decent"". It\'s okay.The story is pretty much a rip-off of Nadesico where some kid named Flit Asuno (played by Toyonaga Toshiyuki from DRRR!!) lost his mom but got this AGE system which enables him to pilot Gundams. He has a cute female childhood friend named Emily and works with an Agasa lookalike scientist in the development of a new Gundam.In this story the space colonies are under attack by unknown Alien-looking mechs called GAFRANs. The fact that they look different that the usual Gundam enemies makes me want to believe that the story is pretty much a rip-off of Nadesico. Dead parents, supernatural technology, space colonies and alien enemy mechs without an early backstory makes this story sound like Nadesico, and to me that\'s kind of a low point.The characters are okay. Flit is a type of guy who wants to pilot a Gundam, since they look cool in oil paintings. Alot of them look very old-school, especially one military guy named Aynor who looks like he just came from a 1980\'s mecha anime-themed Japanese barbershop. And Haro\'s back. Hooray.I\'m really loving the art. It looks well-made and very polished. So far they are using the budget well and it\'s use of simplicity to create a very child-like character design is one thing i applaud Sunrise for. I love it when anime companies that do really big projects does an anime that is based on childlike art (like IG\'s Usagi Drop and Gainax\'s P&S), and Gundam AGE is one of them.The sound is nothing to be judged. I\'ll wait for the next few episodes before making a judgement out of it. So far, Toyonaga makes an okay Flit and i love the AnoHana OP from galileo Galilei, and having them do the OP for AGE is pretty cool.So far, it\'s an okay show. It has a chance to get better after the next few episodes provided Sunrise won\'t fuck this up in SEED Destiny levels.

(like a compact 0079, Zeta, ZZ run)+ The Viewer should should like they were given positive dividends when continuing from Gen 1 thru Gen 2EX: Gen 1 Flit was aiight, BUT Gen 2 Flit was pretty Badass. He develops a cold hatred towards the enemy after what we\'ve seen him go thru...in Gen 1. and that\'s cool+ The 2nd Generation as a whole was really enjoyable to watch+ AGE-1 SpallowCons:- Antagonist has no face in the 1st Gen- Little to no creativity for mobile suit design- Took awhile for me to get into the pokemon-esque character design.3rd GEN Cons (yes, it\'s so bad, it gets its own section)- Pretty much after the halfway point of the 3rd Gen is utter bullshit. Lemme explain- The 3rd Gen hero Kio Asuno switches up his view after experiencing something tragic, making his choices completely illogical and down right dumb. It also changes his combat style, which is also bullshit.- Character development is pretty much shot.- The\'re trying to force emotion by constantly having a death occur constantly- Char clone. and a bad one- Flit Asuno in the last moment becomes IMO the worst protagonist in the Gundam franchise.Final Note/Impression:A cool concept that\'s completely defiled by the 3rd act of this TV Series. My feels about Flit Asuno are similar to a playthrough of Mass Effect 3: I work so hard for a satisfying conclusion, only to realize that what i wanted will never be presented in front of me. in Gen 1. and that\'s cool+ The 2nd Generation as a whole was really enjoyable to watch+ AGE-1 SpallowCons:- Antagonist has no face in the 1st Gen- Little to no creativity for mobile suit design- Took awhile for me to get into the pokemon-esque character design.3rd GEN Cons (yes, it\'s so bad, it gets its own section)- Pretty much after the halfway point of the 3rd Gen is utter bullshit.

My feels about Flit Asuno are similar to a playthrough of Mass Effect 3: I work so hard for a satisfying conclusion, only to realize that what i wanted will never be presented in front of me.', '*Due to the nature of the plot of this show, this review contains slight spoilers*There\'s much to say about Gundam AGE--from the time it was first unveiled, the fanbase went crazy in anger thinking it was going to be some childish take on the franchise, things like how the Gundam wasn\'t even going to be piloted but controlled from afar by the AGE device, that they were going to remove any grimdark from the show, and so on. In any case, AGE is a significant departure in look from the grittyness of the previous Gundam, Gundam 00--00 had darker, mature-ish character and mecha designs, and...AGE has a look more associated with children\'s anime (no surprise then that this show\'s writer and character designer also worked on projects like Inazuma Eleven). Despite all this, the show isn\'t really ""childish"" in any sense, and ends up being a typical Gundam show--or a sad attempt at being one.Yes, Gundam AGE is no doubt the worst Gundam out there. Okay, I haven\'t seen fan disfavourite SEED Destiny outside of the first few episodes, but it\'ll have to be pretty bad to beat what writer Akihiro Hino and director Susumu Yamaguchi have presented us with here. They\'ve presented us with a show that could have been a very solid show but instead refuses every attempt at being good.Basically, Gundam AGE is a ""multigenerational Gundam"", which focuses on protagonist Flit Asuno, his son, and his grandson, all of which pilot three generations of the titular Gundam AGE. From that summary alone, I\'d expect a very interesting plot involving intense familial themes, some romance, and perhaps some grand villainous threat that threatens the Asuno clan and their friends and their society over the decades. Instead this is merely a setup for infinite amounts of squandered opportunities at interesting plot threads. Take the expected romantic themes--relationships are reduced to little more than a casual mention at best, with pathetic attempts at creating love triangles that the concept art for the later characters made painfully obvious which girl ""won"", seeing how each son resembles their mother. ""Won"" belongs in quotes because little to no characterisation is given to any of the girls and love interests besides perhaps Yurin, who is a carbon copy of Lalah Sune from the original 0079 Gundam. Speaking of Yurin, we also get a scene so bizarre early on that it seems like a parody of the battle involving Lalah, Amuro, and Char from the original Gundam, involving a psychotic little kid as Char. Oh, that scene is also completely serious and sets up one of the major story threads, something so bad it puts all the borrowing of the original MSG plot Gundam SEED did to shame.That\'s only a taste of the plot you\'ll find in this show. Gundam AGE effectively has three story arcs separated by timeskips, centering around Flit in the first, his son Asem in the second, and his grandson Kio in the third. It wouldn\'t be a stretch to say the first is ""based on"" Mobile Suit Gundam, the second on Zeta Gundam, and the third on ZZ Gundam. The first arc is pretty much junk--a shadowy faction with strange mobile suits are blowing up colonies, but it mostly ends up being a mixture of filler and dumb ripoffs of the original Gundam. The rest is better though, if only because it gets to answer the question of what Gundam protagonists and their comrades are doing decades after the events of their show, and Gundam AGE delivers for the second arc, which ends up being the only salvageable part of the show in the end. Here we see Flit\'s friend Woolf as a grizzled badass, Flit himself playing a role equivalent to the villainous Titans of Zeta Gundam, and that\'s sadly about it, because while the second arc presents an interesting story, it squanders its true potential by wasting about a third of its space with rather pointless high school filler arc that does little but set up the character of Gundam AGE\'s Char clone Zeheart. The arc also unceremoniously wastes an interesting plot point by killing off one of the most interesting characters of the first generation for no reason only a few minutes after he\'s reintroduced for the second arc. But at least we have a solid plot--angry humans on Mars want to take back the Earth, and start a total war with the Earth Sphere humans, which amounts to typical Gundam stuff. Oh, and look for a ripoff of one of the ending scenes of Gundam Wing (or Char\'s Counterattack, which Gundam Wing borrowed from) because Gundam AGE can\'t resist stealing famous Gundam scenes for its own use (although I admit this scene is pretty cool).The third arc and the finale are what ends up utterly killing the show. Everything comes together to produce a flat nothing, with a corny plot development leading to protagonist Kio Asuno turning into perhaps the whiniest Gundam protagonist ever. This plot development involving him going to the home colony of the Mars humans ends up being horribly, horribly done, even though the writers no doubt intended it to be one of the tearjerking moments of the show. This also shows Gundam AGE\'s love for killing off characters in dramatic death scenes when they barely have been given any character development. Not that that stops them from giving a full episode devoted to a minor character introduced only the previous episode which goes into detail about her life, only for her to be killed off at the end of it. Nice misplaced priorities there, eh?The ending is as bad as you\'d expect by this point. The main villain reveals his plans, which are so utterly, utterly stupid they don\'t make logical sense even by Gundam villain standards. The Char clone of the show--who like most Char clones, comes across as fairly sympathetic for most of the show--chooses to go along with such idiocy and redoubles his efforts. And for the finale, expect a complete anticlimax--some people die in pointless ways, and the final episode is solely about a fight against a character who makes his first appearance in that same episode and has almost no personality. Wonderful.Discounting the horribly wasted plot, Gundam AGE isn\'t all bad. While the artstyle and fight scenes are nowhere near the visceral glory of Gundam 00, for what it\'s worth everything is smoothly animated and sufficient. The character designs aren\'t that bad once you get used to them--it could be Hisashi ""sameface"" Hirai of Gundam SEED after all! The mecha designs are also pretty great, although the majority of the enemy mobile suits look like they\'d better fit in a non-Gundam mecha anime, what with the draconic design of many of them. And compared to other Gundam shows (looking at you, SEED), AGE limits the number of Gundams floating around--there\'s a grand total of four Gundams (plus ""backpacks"") in the show. Three are the protagonist Gundams, each with nice allusions to the original RX-78 Gundam, the Zeta Gundam, and the ZZ Gundam respectively. The fourth is the Gundam of one of the villains, featuring a wonderfully alien design.The soundtrack for Gundam AGE is incredible, with some nice modern elements pervading it. It certainly continues the trend of the newer Gundams (Turn A and onward) having awesome soundtracks that REALLY stand out unlike the still-good but less unique soundtracks of the older Gundams. The opening and closing songs are mixed bunch, the first two openers being cheesy, harmless J-pop, the third being a nice upbeat J-rock song, the final being a stellar J-pop song. Endings are less unique, with only the first--an electronic J-pop ballad--being memorable. As for the voice-acting, there\'s nothing negative I can say--Kazuhiko Inoue does a great job as the coldhearted older Flit, Hiroshi Kamiya does the villainous Zeheart well, and Daisuke Ono as Woolf makes the most out of the character. Prolific seiyuu Takehito Koyasu (who\'s done several other noteworthy Gundam roles in his time) shows up here as well.But that\'s merely the makings of a potentially great show. In the end, the writers chose to squander every bit of potential for this show, instead creating this trainwreck in its place. Gundam AGE had the chance to be one of the franchise\'s most memorable shows, but instead it\'s something to be looked down on, and will be remembered as one of the worst moments for Gundam. Avoid this, and avoid this well. AGE has a look more associated with children\'s anime (no surprise then that this show\'s writer and character designer also worked on projects like Inazuma Eleven). Despite all this, the show isn\'t really ""childish"" in any sense, and ends up being a typical Gundam show--or a sad attempt at being one.Yes, Gundam AGE is no doubt the worst Gundam out there. Okay, I haven\'t seen fan disfavourite SEED Destiny outside of the first few episodes, but it\'ll have to be pretty bad to beat what writer Akihiro Hino and director Susumu Yamaguchi have presented us with here. They\'ve presented us with a show that could have been a very solid show but instead refuses every attempt at being good.Basically, Gundam AGE is a ""multigenerational Gundam"", which focuses on protagonist Flit Asuno, his son, and his grandson, all of which pilot three generations of the titular Gundam AGE. From that summary alone, I\'d expect a very interesting plot involving intense familial themes, some romance, and perhaps some grand villainous threat that threatens the Asuno clan and their friends and their society over the decades. Instead this is merely a setup for infinite amounts of squandered opportunities at interesting plot threads. Take the expected romantic themes--relationships are reduced to little more than a casual mention at best, with pathetic attempts at creating love triangles that the concept art for the later characters made painfully obvious which girl ""won"", seeing how each son resembles their mother. ""Won"" belongs in quotes because little to no characterisation is given to any of the girls and love interests besides perhaps Yurin, who is a carbon copy of Lalah Sune from the original 0079 Gundam. Speaking of Yurin, we also get a scene so bizarre early on that it seems like a parody of the battle involving Lalah, Amuro, and Char from the original Gundam, involving a psychotic little kid as Char. Oh, that scene is also completely serious and sets up one of the major story threads, something so bad it puts all the borrowing of the original MSG plot Gundam SEED did to shame.That\'s only a taste of the plot you\'ll find in this show. Gundam AGE effectively has three story arcs separated by timeskips, centering around Flit in the first, his son Asem in the second, and his grandson Kio in the third. It wouldn\'t be a stretch to say the first is ""based on"" Mobile Suit Gundam, the second on Zeta Gundam, and the third on ZZ Gundam. The first arc is pretty much junk--a shadowy faction with strange mobile suits are blowing up colonies, but it mostly ends up being a mixture of filler and dumb ripoffs of the original Gundam. The rest is better though, if only because it gets to answer the question of what Gundam protagonists and their comrades are doing decades after the events of their show, and Gundam AGE delivers for the second arc, which ends up being the only salvageable part of the show in the end. Here we see Flit\'s friend Woolf as a grizzled badass, Flit himself playing a role equivalent to the villainous Titans of Zeta Gundam, and that\'s sadly about it, because while the second arc presents an interesting story, it squanders its true potential by wasting about a third of its space with rather pointless high school filler arc that does little but set up the character of Gundam AGE\'s Char clone Zeheart. The arc also unceremoniously wastes an interesting plot point by killing off one of the most interesting characters of the first generation for no reason only a few minutes after he\'s reintroduced for the second arc. But at least we have a solid plot--angry humans on Mars want to take back the Earth, and start a total war with the Earth Sphere humans, which amounts to typical Gundam stuff. Oh, and look for a ripoff of one of the ending scenes of Gundam Wing (or Char\'s Counterattack, which Gundam Wing borrowed from) because Gundam AGE can\'t resist stealing famous Gundam scenes for its own use (although I admit this scene is pretty cool).The third arc and the finale are what ends up utterly killing the show. Everything comes together to produce a flat nothing, with a corny plot development leading to protagonist Kio Asuno turning into perhaps the whiniest Gundam protagonist ever. This plot development involving him going to the home colony of the Mars humans ends up being horribly, horribly done, even though the writers no doubt intended it to be one of the tearjerking moments of the show. This also shows Gundam AGE\'s love for killing off characters in dramatic death scenes when they barely have been given any character development. Not that that stops them from giving a full episode devoted to a minor character introduced only the previous episode which goes into detail about her life, only for her to be killed off at the end of it. Nice misplaced priorities there, eh?The ending is as bad as you\'d expect by this point. The main villain reveals his plans, which are so utterly, utterly stupid they don\'t make logical sense even by Gundam villain standards. The Char clone of the show--who like most Char clones, comes across as fairly sympathetic for most of the show--chooses to go along with such idiocy and redoubles his efforts. And for the finale, expect a complete anticlimax--some people die in pointless ways, and the final episode is solely about a fight against a character who makes his first appearance in that same episode and has almost no personality. Wonderful.Discounting the horribly wasted plot, Gundam AGE isn\'t all bad. While the artstyle and fight scenes are nowhere near the visceral glory of Gundam 00, for what it\'s worth everything is smoothly animated and sufficient. The character designs aren\'t that bad once you get used to them--it could be Hisashi ""sameface"" Hirai of Gundam SEED after all! The mecha designs are also pretty great, although the majority of the enemy mobile suits look like they\'d better fit in a non-Gundam mecha anime, what with the draconic design of many of them. And compared to other Gundam shows (looking at you, SEED), AGE limits the number of Gundams floating around--there\'s a grand total of four Gundams (plus ""backpacks"") in the show. Three are the protagonist Gundams, each with nice allusions to the original RX-78 Gundam, the Zeta Gundam, and the ZZ Gundam respectively. The fourth is the Gundam of one of the villains, featuring a wonderfully alien design.The soundtrack for Gundam AGE is incredible, with some nice modern elements pervading it. It certainly continues the trend of the newer Gundams (Turn A and onward) having awesome soundtracks that REALLY stand out unlike the still-good but less unique soundtracks of the older Gundams. The opening and closing songs are mixed bunch, the first two openers being cheesy, harmless J-pop, the third being a nice upbeat J-rock song, the final being a stellar J-pop song. Endings are less unique, with only the first--an electronic J-pop ballad--being memorable. As for the voice-acting, there\'s nothing negative I can say--Kazuhiko Inoue does a great job as the coldhearted older Flit, Hiroshi Kamiya does the villainous Zeheart well, and Daisuke Ono as Woolf makes the most out of the character. Prolific seiyuu Takehito Koyasu (who\'s done several other noteworthy Gundam roles in his time) shows up here as well.But that\'s merely the makings of a potentially great show. In the end, the writers chose to squander every bit of potential for this show, instead creating this trainwreck in its place. Gundam AGE had the chance to be one of the franchise\'s most memorable shows, but instead it\'s something to be looked down on, and will be remembered as one of the worst moments for Gundam. Avoid this, and avoid this well.', ""Gundam Age is an attempt to attract a new, younger audience by re-packaging the core Gundam lore that has been established over the years into story arcs that follows three generations of Gundam pilots. While the premise is cool, the majority of its flaws comes from having to tell all three arcs within a 49-episode constraint.Because there are so many characters in so little time, they are given few opportunities to develop.

Which is a shame, because the main characters are actually interesting and full of potential.In terms of visuals, I was initially caught off-guard by the disparity between character design and mech design.

I wish, at some point, there would be a Gundam series that shows combat which better illustrates the relative performance between Mech A and Mech B, and then how each pilot uses them to determine the outcome. But I suppose that would not be in the best interest of a series that is dependent on continuously rebooting itself: setting too high of a standard makes the next reboot even harder.In the meantime, I suppose GA is worth a look for those who don't want to invest much time into the Gundam franchise, as it's meant to be an updated and condensed collection of past Gundam themes and mech designs.

Sadly most of the reasons aren't valid. Some say its too childish (Yet watch shows with children in them, even the gundams with children piloting), some say it's art is disgusting (Yet watched Higuarashi), and some haven't taken the time to even watch it. Here's an unbiased and unwarranted hate-free review:Story -The story is very unique, as it spans 3 generations of characters in the same family, a first for a Gundam series, and rarely done in ANY anime. This brings a certain level of connection to a war, and extra connection to...characters. However, there isn't simply enough time to flesh out each individual story arc; without each other to lean on, they would be virtually unwatchable. A 3 Season series would probably have worked best, as each arc is only 15 or so episodes.  One thing to say is that the story feels like an RPG playing out right before your eyes, and rightfully so, as the story was written by the talented game company Level 5, who made classics such as Dragon Quest VIII and Rouge Galaxy.Art-The Art is good, but not great. Its typical Gundam art; not groundbreaking but highly animated and explosive. Aimed at kids it isn't, there's things here that you'd see in your typical Gundam series. The Gundam models look crisp, and have some original concepts, but alot of similarities to other Gundams from the series. Was it a homage? Or did they run out of ideas? You be the judge.Sound-Other than the explosions, there isn't anything to talk about. The voice acting is standard fare, as well as the music.Character-The great thing about this anime is that there are so many characters, you'll fall in love with one of them. The best feeling in the world is moving to the next story arc/generation and seeing a character front he previous one make a return, or even upgrade from supporting to main. However, just like the story, there isn't enough time to flesh everyone out; most characters have a single storyline (avenge death, here to kill and destroy, i'm the captain, etc.). There are a few characters you'll fall in love with, but while some stay around for almost the entire series, sadly some of them only appear for a few episodes before leaving for whatever reason.The main characters are without a doubt the best part of the show. What I love is that none of them, while being in the same bloodline, are clones of each other. They each have their own issues, hopes and fears, and to see them react to each other, especially near the end, makes up for the lack of character development anywhere else.Enjoyment-You would think that with such average scores of the other categories I wouldn't have enjoyed the series, but you're oh so wrong. As awkward as the stories and characters are, it was actually one of the more enjoyable anime to watch. You had to see what happened next; granted, you won't find anything shocking here, but it was always interesting to see what character would be relevant in the next episode, especially near the end when characters would pop in/out and mains would conflict.

As an example: Kamen Rider (another well-known childrens franchise) has 4x the ratings in a similar timeslot.Animation:Being a Gundam series, Sunrise has spared no expense on the budget. Reports put it at double the budget of the average show. Taking place in zero-gravity quite often, the characters smoothly float around in a realistic manner....The mobile suits and ships in the combat scenes look very nice, although the shader they use on the Diva makes it look rather cartoony. The scenery inside the colonies can also be quite good at times. Unfortunately due to the rather simple character and art designs, all that money only really shines during the fighting scenes, and not in the character interaction scenes.Story:Since the show is targeting a younger audience, but they still want to entice the older fans to watch it, the writing can be a bit haphazard at times. There are times where the characters pull off genuinely ingenuitive tactics to outsmart the enemy. Many times though, they seem to do frustratingly stupid things that cause a scene to be drawn out unrealistically. The small scale of many of the conflicts also leave one wondering how this is considered a world-enveloping battle with the UE. IMHO they could have done a better job of providing a story that was easy for younger viewers to follow, while still providing battles that involved smart combat decisions.My biggest gripe related to story and writing I would have to say is the AGE System. Some of the equipment it comes up with really shouldn\'t be effective at all and is rather silly. And the Deus Ex Machina factor of it always coming up with exactly what the MC needs to bail him out of danger becomes trite very quickly. This can really dampen the emotional draw of the battles at times.Characters:Keeping in mind the young age of Flit to start the series, I thought he acted appropriately most of the time. My only major quibble was, as I said above, some of the writing for his battles was really stupid and could make one ""facepalm.""I liked most of the supporting adults in the cast as well. Grodek is a really awesome captain, and Millais is a competent junior officer. Granpda is rather ridiculous looking, like he\'s straight out of a 70s anime, but I give it a pass because of the target audience.I thought Asemu was a great character when first introduced, but the more I see of him, the less I like him. While Flit uses skill and practice, Asemu is more like a mix of early-Kamille from Zeta Gundam, and the whiny outbursts of Shinn -- complete with the lack of skill and crutching on superior equipment that Shinn did. The dynamic between him and Zeheart also seems much more ""DEEP"" than being actually nuanced.Both of the female lead characters introduced so far, as is typical of non-UC Gundam stories it seems, are rather useless tag-along type characters that are IMHO overshadowed by far better written female secondary characters. They don\'t bring anything worthwhile to moving the story along, they don\'t have any real skills, and they generally lack any sort of character development. They\'re basically just the de-facto baby-maker to ""pop out"" the next generation of pilot in the story.In conclusion:Sunrise tapped popular childrens\' entertainment company Level5 to write the scenario and create character designs for Gundam Age. Unfortunately their expertise doesn\'t appear to be translating very well into the Gundam universe. If you are an older Gundam fan, don\'t expect a lot of intelligent combat. There IS some, but it\'s few and far between. But if you aren\'t too picky, the current offering isn\'t nearly as terrible as say, Seed Destiny. A lot of the supporting cast are really great to watch.As for kids -- it\'s an okay show, but the slow pacing and uneven storytelling doesn\'t hold the viewers attention as well as it could.

As more about the true nature of this unknown enemy comes to light and each Asuno member bares witness to the hardships of this war, each one develops a differing mentality with how to handle the unknown enemy threat and this drives their developments for later episodes of the series.Gundam AGE is a...bit tricky to properly judge since each generation arc within the series has it varying levels of quality in terms of plot. The Flit arc is the most watered down of the arcs as it takes on a black-and-white moral compass with portraying the enemy threat as irredeemably evil, relies heavily on plot formulas typical of Gundam and sci-fi titles and sticks with simple character types throughout its run. The Asemu arc offers the best quality of the series as it is a little more complex with the conflicts faced by Asemu as he struggles with the pressures put on him to follow in his father\'s footsteps and is conflicted with how to handle things when learning that a close friend of his is part of the enemy force. The later two arcs with Kio are where the series quality nosedives when attempts to make the enemy force sympathetic are poorly implemented, the rationales of some of the characters don\'t make much sense, Kio being a worst character than Gundam SEED\'s Kira in being a pacifist fighter and the sudden introduction of new enemy threats just for the sake of creating enemy threats to drag the plot out.The generation gimmick actually works against Gundam AGE since the pacing of each arc is rather rushed to 11-15 episodes a piece, limiting how much depth the series can provide to its world and characters. To a great extent, the series just rehashes character types, plot elements and characteristics of its mecha and technologies from prior Gundam titles, waters the typical themes of the franchise down and expects viewers of the series to accept what they are watching. The issues between Asemu and Zeheart were pretty much the saving grace of AGE for me as the execution of other plot developments and character issues within the series are either rehashed from prior Gundam titles, too shallow to really care for or were flawed as such where I found myself questioning what the writers of AGE were thinking when they put together this series, especially with their efforts at trying to make the enemy threat more sympathetic compared to their depiction in the Flit arc.Visually, Gundam AGE is rather average in terms of quality. While sporting a good deal of visual detail and vivid color, character and scenery designs are a bit on the plain side. Federation mecha designs are pretty much typical of what has been depicted for past Gundam titles, though the mecha utilized by the enemy forces sport unique designs as they take on a variety of forms from the Gafran units introduced in the Flit arc to the gorilla-like Xambrag piloted by Zanald Beihart in the later Kio arcs. The animation has its moments of decent choreography with action scenes thanks to the unique designs of many of the enemy units, though the majority still resort to whatever\'s been done with prior Gundam titles and shortcuts are noticeable in more complicated battle scenes such as fights between large factions of Federation and enemy forces.Overall, Gundam AGE is one of the more weaker entries of the Gundam franchise as its efforts with the ""generation arc"" gimmick lead it to rehash story, character and world elements from past Gundam titles in a mostly generic, rushed and (later on) sloppily implemented mess. The Asemu and Zeheart rivalry redeems the series to a degree for me, but it is still not enough to save AGE from being nothing more than a mediocre series.

Gundam Age is a tribute to the Universal Centry\'s triple threat Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and ZZ Gundam with Gundam AGE-1 we see the similarities between RX-78-2; with later advancements we see similarities between the gundams. There are some who say that AGE ripped off of SEED but when they say that they don\'t seem to have seen 00 Gundam, nor have they seen Zeta Gundam or...ZZ Gundam. Because the forms of the mechs were more characteristic of Zeta Gundam and ZZ Gundam than of 00 (despite the UE\'s forms).Overall, this is a great Slice-of-life mecha anime that explores the idea of a protagonist being overwhelmed with anger, and revenge. And what happens when that is seen first and foremost. I put this one off for a while, but now I wonder why. This is a very good calling back to the old UC series\' and it puts a new spin on it. If you want an idea of what it\'s like. Imagine Amuro being a father, and he sends his kid to war, and then his kid has a kid--and so on. Imagine the lineage you\'re leaving behind. This show is a growth of all three characters, Flit, Asemu and Kio.The way the show ends? You\'ll have to see. Some people are disappointed, but I am not. The character development in the third arc really made it a necessity. Some say that after Arc 2, you will get bored. But really--Arc 3 is where the major character changes are made. It is really worth it for Gundam fans, and for non Gundam fans, this is a good one to start with.Cons: There ARE some episodes that leave ideas floating, and there are some things that don\'t make sense. More ""PIS"" (plot induced stupidity) stuff but overall, the anime is good. I loved the story, and the characters the most.What did this show do the best? Flit and his whole story throughout the three arcs, showed the advancement of story without seeming like it NEEDED to go on--it just seemed to flow. It didn\'t seem like a forced story. ZZ Gundam.

It didn\'t seem like a forced story.', '[2nd Edit] MS Gundam AGE is a mixed bag that you should see if you like the Gundam franchise. It does some things that no other Gundam did so far (I know, I`ve watched them all), so it has some extremely original content. It is interesting in its own way, with a particular charm of its own. More bellow.Story: You probably guessed by looking at its promotional poster that Gundam AGE is a shonen Gundam. Thus, beware for classical Japanese teen drama, classical ""moral questions"" that are always the same and, of course, some of the ""killing is wrong, we all should live in harmony""...stuff. Hence, the overall political plot is lame. HOWEVER, the storytelling aspects are where Gundam AGE shines the best. It shines on the aspect that no other Gundam did in one series so far: you will follow the characters throughout generations. Yes, it does not stop on the kids in the cover, it goes on and on as they grow into adults. This baffled me so much because I was not expecting anything like that. This is important for you to know because otherwise, you might think that it is just some classical shonen anime. I only persisted because I am a die-hard Gundam fan. However, the moment that I saw that Gundam AGE was about generations, this show gained a different meaning. Gundam AGE is divided into 3 arcs, in which the second one is the darkest of them all. Gundam AGE attempts to kinda rewrite the UC in some other way. So think that from 1-15 ep you are watching Shonen MS Gundam, from 16 to 28 you are watching Shonen Zeta Gundam (dark as Zeta, in its way), and from 29-50 you are watching a mix of Shonen Unicorn + Char`s Counterattack + Zeta. You know something I think its funny? Iron-Blooded Orphans is considered the Gundam with the highest body count, in terms of named characters. Well, shonen Gundam AGE comes very close! I fully support the writer\'s choice to create a whole generation odyssey, instead of a single story with the same characters.Art & Sound: The art is OK, better than Gundam SEED, worse than Gundam 00. It\'s somewhere in between. Sometimes the characters design are extremely lame, being far from what the franchise usually do. They are frequently out of proportion, with tiny lets, large arms. But these are the exception, not the rule. The sound is cool. The openings are fine. If I am not mistaken, the composer is the same as Gundam SEED, which is awesome.Characters: Ah! here is where Gundam AGE shines. First, remember that this is a shonen anime, it is not dark and mature as Iron-Blooded Orphans, or Zeta Gundam. But in its own rules and world, the characters in Gundam AGE have great development. For you to have an idea, you will follow Flit Asuno (the main protagonist) from 13 years old until 64 years old. You will also follow the other two protagonists, Asumo Asuno (his son) and Kio Asuno (his grandson), as Gundam pilots as well, and this is awesome. They have great character development in the entire series, and here is where I was caught off-guard. I wasn\'t expecting everything they become. I can`t say without spoiling, so I just know that it is pretty good. Other secondary characters like Woolf Enacle and Ainoa Grodek are extremely likable as well. As always, you will have some irritating characters but they are not invasive like in other shows of the series. My only complaint here is the Char clone of Gundam AGE, he is probably one of the worse Chars clones in the entire Gundamverse, maybe being a little better than Full Frontal. The only problem is the lame romance subplot. All Gundam has a romantic subplot and the one in Gundam AGE is one of the lamest.Mechas: They have a strong influence from several Gundam series, especially 00. Gundam AGE 1 looks like a deluxe edition of RX-78-2. AGE 2 strongly resembles Exia and 00 Raser, and AGE 3 looks like a mix between Full Armor ZZ Gundam and Virtue from 00. It also has the ""modular"" nature of RX-78-2 and Impulse (from Destiny), with similar launching apparatus in mid-battle. The Gundam Legilis is beautiful and was heavily inspired by Wing Gundam Zero. I also enjoy the AGE System, the star of the show, that is basically a giant weapon-building 3D printer. The AGE system is such a good idea that it changes the whole flow of Gundam AGE. Awesome. The only thing I don`t like in terms of mecha in this show is the Vegan MS (the NPCs that are always blown-up), they have a reptilian aspect that looks ridiculous. Aside from that, all Gundams look awesome.Overall, this is a great series. Keep in mind its shonen origins but I can assure you that this series becomes something very enjoyable that you will have a good time seen it.

All I can say is that Flit and Asumo characters will surprise you.', 'This is my first review for an anime, though this is not my first Gundam series and it will not be my last. Hopefully some will find this useful.I\'ve been an avid watcher of both mecha animes and the Gundam series itself. I was initially discouraged, from both word of mouth and initial reviews, to do my best and avoid this series entirely. Eventually, I decided to see for myself just how this new series stacks up to the competition.No synopsis, lets go right in to the nitty-gritty.Story: 6The story and idea itself isn\'t bad. Rather it was quite novel idea that Bandai came...up with. A Gundam series spanning three generations. Sounds great on paper, but somewhere along the way things just went awry.Lets start with the first thing: UE or the Vagan. The premise of Flit and co. fighting against what can be perceived as aliens doesn\'t work. The majority of the reasons given are somewhere alone the lines of ""the scenario doesn\'t work because it\'s a Gundam series"". A better way of looking at this is that the scenario itself is poorly executed. Recognize that unknown enemy doesn\'t necessarily have to translate to aliens. A rogue group of emotionless humans who cause destruction through advanced technology and never leave behind witnesses or evidence can also be shaped to fit the mold of an unknown enemy. If anything, what is just described above fits similarly to what the Vagan are. Through rumors and stories it is understandable how that will eventually become what the characters believe are aliens. But to have even the Earth Federation believe that the Vagan are aliens themselves? That really stretches suspension of disbelief.  Even though it is revealed that the top brass knows who and what the Vagans are and with all the foreshadowing, to present such this scenario to the viewers for a little over 15 episodes is a bit too much and can fails to hook on to viewers given the silliness of the situation.The second thing is the pacing and premises of the three generations/arcs are suspect. In regards to Flit\'s arc, I can count 5-6 episodes where it was spent on non-important issues. The Fardain arc, though interesting, does little to nothing in terms of driving the plot or setting up character development. Sure the death of Boyage has an impact on the development of Flit but that happens several episodes down the road and could have been setup without wasting 3-4 episodes on Fardain. Time spent on Euba and Zalam, that were basically never mentioned again, could have been used to develop characters like Woolf or Largan or setup other plot points. Though Asemu\'s arc was interesting the weird pacing of the arc lessen the impact it could\'ve had on the audience. It is hard to believe that Asemu comes to a sudden realization of his fatal flaw near the last 2 episodes of his arc and only after Woolf dies. Not only does it make light of everything else that happens to Asemu as a result of his jealousy (including his near death experience), it may slight viewers by making Woolf\'s death as a quick fix to wrap up a plot point. Out of all three arcs, Kio\'s arc is perhaps the most boring and does nothing to add to the story. Project Eden\'s true intentions and EXA-DB are revealed, but they add little to help wrap up the story.Overall the story is extremely mediocre and could have been made to be a lot better.Art: 7The art designs of the characters and mobile suits really brings back nostalgic memories. Though some complain that they look childish, the art designs feel as though it has gone back to the roots for a more MSG type look. With that said, some of the mobile suit designs could be better. This is especially true of the Vagan mobile suits. Most of them looking like flying lizards. It also seems as though the art department got lazy and didn\'t feel like making more mobile suits for the Earth Federation. Come on, Genoaces for all three arcs?Sound: 7The musical compositions are solid. They are not anything amazing like the Unicorn or MS IGLOO but they get the job done.Characters: 5When it is easier to empathize with a minor character that gets kill off in two episodes than it for a major character than there is a major problem in the works. The character development for some of the characters are just outright bad.Two of the more egregious examples are Zeheart and Kio. For a fair part of the anime, the viewers see Zeheart as a person who struggles between fulfilling Ezelcant\'s Project Eden and his wishes to lead a normal human life. Though Zeheart seems as though he is willing to go through with fulfilling Project Eden, one can see that he has difficulty ridding the obstacles to the plan namely Asemu and Gundam. Not only that, Zeheart has streak of being a stern but caring commander. Which is why when he blindly submits to Ezelcant after becoming the leader of the Vagan and killing off his subordinates in order to achieve his plan, it ruins his character. This isn\'t to say that it wasn\'t a valid way of developing his character but it is a bad way. It contradicts and ruins everything that makes Zeheart who he is up until that point. Even something like Zeheart altering Ezelcant\'s plan after finding out the truth behind Project Eden would make more sense.As for Kio, he never really got character development to begin with. He reaches that phase of naiveté where he ""wants to protect everyone"" and ""stop the fighting"". This is fair considering he was exposed to the more humane side of the Vagan but he never grows out of that phase. He desperately tries to stop the fighting for the better part of the last arc and doesn\'t  stop after seeing that his attempts are fruitless and the deaths of his fellow soldiers. Kio almost becomes this wishy-washy Kira clone who constantly spews about peace, but never actually does enough to amount to anything.Compare Kio to Uso from Mobile Suit Victory Gundam. Much like Kio, Uso is constantly bombarded with the realities of war and seen deaths of those close to him. There is a small time frame in which he comes to the same conclusions as Kio, but after seeing that the only way to stop the fighting is to fight and forcibly end the war, Uso\'s character develops. Uso values peace but understands that he has to fight for it and rather than enforcing his views on everyone he uses it as a rallying call to motivate himself. This example could have been a direction in which Kio could have been developed except it never happened.These two are only the more prominent examples but there are other gripes to be had. One can make an argument that Emily was a poorly done version of a concerned friend - almost bordering  on possessive and obsessive. Yurin is the star-crossed lover of Flit who is so one dimensional it seems as though she was only added in as a love interest and to fan Flit\'s hatred of the Vagan.Some interesting characters seemingly fall off near the end as it seem that the directing and writing team struggled to make a consistent character and resolve plot points. It was interesting (at least in the Gundam franchise) to see a character so driven by revenge and hatred and have it affect every decision he ever makes. And yet he softens up at the end just to tie up the plot. Again this makes for extremely bad character development.All of these characters could have been used to make the anime slightly better had they been better developed.Overall Impression: 6Was it bad as everyone made it out to be? Not exactly. Were there parts that really annoyed the hell out of me and made me feel like dropping this anime all together? You betcha. As a Gundam fan I wasn\'t as disappointed as I was with the fanfic plot that is Gundam Seed Destiny. But that\'s not really saying much. There was an opportunity that the Gundam franchise and Sunrise could have capitalize but due to shoddy directing and writing a lot of it went to waste.For the average watcher, they may get some mild enjoyment out of this. Even then it may feel taxing and boring at times. It stands as a mediocre Gundam series and will always be remembered as a mediocre Gundam series. up with. A Gundam series spanning three generations.

The majority of the reasons given are somewhere alone the lines of ""the scenario doesn\'t work because it\'s a Gundam series"". A better way of looking at this is that the scenario itself is poorly executed. Recognize that unknown enemy doesn\'t necessarily have to translate to aliens. A rogue group of emotionless humans who cause destruction through advanced technology and never leave behind witnesses or evidence can also be shaped to fit the mold of an unknown enemy. If anything, what is just described above fits similarly to what the Vagan are. Through rumors and stories it is understandable how that will eventually become what the characters believe are aliens. But to have even the Earth Federation believe that the Vagan are aliens themselves? That really stretches suspension of disbelief.  Even though it is revealed that the top brass knows who and what the Vagans are and with all the foreshadowing, to present such this scenario to the viewers for a little over 15 episodes is a bit too much and can fails to hook on to viewers given the silliness of the situation.The second thing is the pacing and premises of the three generations/arcs are suspect. In regards to Flit\'s arc, I can count 5-6 episodes where it was spent on non-important issues. The Fardain arc, though interesting, does little to nothing in terms of driving the plot or setting up character development. Sure the death of Boyage has an impact on the development of Flit but that happens several episodes down the road and could have been setup without wasting 3-4 episodes on Fardain. Time spent on Euba and Zalam, that were basically never mentioned again, could have been used to develop characters like Woolf or Largan or setup other plot points. Though Asemu\'s arc was interesting the weird pacing of the arc lessen the impact it could\'ve had on the audience. It is hard to believe that Asemu comes to a sudden realization of his fatal flaw near the last 2 episodes of his arc and only after Woolf dies. Not only does it make light of everything else that happens to Asemu as a result of his jealousy (including his near death experience), it may slight viewers by making Woolf\'s death as a quick fix to wrap up a plot point. Out of all three arcs, Kio\'s arc is perhaps the most boring and does nothing to add to the story. Project Eden\'s true intentions and EXA-DB are revealed, but they add little to help wrap up the story.Overall the story is extremely mediocre and could have been made to be a lot better.Art: 7The art designs of the characters and mobile suits really brings back nostalgic memories. Though some complain that they look childish, the art designs feel as though it has gone back to the roots for a more MSG type look. With that said, some of the mobile suit designs could be better. This is especially true of the Vagan mobile suits. Most of them looking like flying lizards. It also seems as though the art department got lazy and didn\'t feel like making more mobile suits for the Earth Federation. Come on, Genoaces for all three arcs?Sound: 7The musical compositions are solid. They are not anything amazing like the Unicorn or MS IGLOO but they get the job done.Characters: 5When it is easier to empathize with a minor character that gets kill off in two episodes than it for a major character than there is a major problem in the works. The character development for some of the characters are just outright bad.Two of the more egregious examples are Zeheart and Kio. For a fair part of the anime, the viewers see Zeheart as a person who struggles between fulfilling Ezelcant\'s Project Eden and his wishes to lead a normal human life. Though Zeheart seems as though he is willing to go through with fulfilling Project Eden, one can see that he has difficulty ridding the obstacles to the plan namely Asemu and Gundam. Not only that, Zeheart has streak of being a stern but caring commander. Which is why when he blindly submits to Ezelcant after becoming the leader of the Vagan and killing off his subordinates in order to achieve his plan, it ruins his character. This isn\'t to say that it wasn\'t a valid way of developing his character but it is a bad way. It contradicts and ruins everything that makes Zeheart who he is up until that point. Even something like Zeheart altering Ezelcant\'s plan after finding out the truth behind Project Eden would make more sense.As for Kio, he never really got character development to begin with. He reaches that phase of naiveté where he ""wants to protect everyone"" and ""stop the fighting"". This is fair considering he was exposed to the more humane side of the Vagan but he never grows out of that phase. He desperately tries to stop the fighting for the better part of the last arc and doesn\'t  stop after seeing that his attempts are fruitless and the deaths of his fellow soldiers. Kio almost becomes this wishy-washy Kira clone who constantly spews about peace, but never actually does enough to amount to anything.Compare Kio to Uso from Mobile Suit Victory Gundam. Much like Kio, Uso is constantly bombarded with the realities of war and seen deaths of those close to him. There is a small time frame in which he comes to the same conclusions as Kio, but after seeing that the only way to stop the fighting is to fight and forcibly end the war, Uso\'s character develops. Uso values peace but understands that he has to fight for it and rather than enforcing his views on everyone he uses it as a rallying call to motivate himself. This example could have been a direction in which Kio could have been developed except it never happened.These two are only the more prominent examples but there are other gripes to be had. One can make an argument that Emily was a poorly done version of a concerned friend - almost bordering  on possessive and obsessive. Yurin is the star-crossed lover of Flit who is so one dimensional it seems as though she was only added in as a love interest and to fan Flit\'s hatred of the Vagan.Some interesting characters seemingly fall off near the end as it seem that the directing and writing team struggled to make a consistent character and resolve plot points. It was interesting (at least in the Gundam franchise) to see a character so driven by revenge and hatred and have it affect every decision he ever makes. And yet he softens up at the end just to tie up the plot. Again this makes for extremely bad character development.All of these characters could have been used to make the anime slightly better had they been better developed.Overall Impression: 6Was it bad as everyone made it out to be? Not exactly. Were there parts that really annoyed the hell out of me and made me feel like dropping this anime all together? You betcha. As a Gundam fan I wasn\'t as disappointed as I was with the fanfic plot that is Gundam Seed Destiny. But that\'s not really saying much. There was an opportunity that the Gundam franchise and Sunrise could have capitalize but due to shoddy directing and writing a lot of it went to waste.For the average watcher, they may get some mild enjoyment out of this. Even then it may feel taxing and boring at times. It stands as a mediocre Gundam series and will always be remembered as a mediocre Gundam series.', 'Gundam Age, the latest installment of the Gundam franchise. Instead of just one main character, the story is set into 3 generations, with 3 different gundam pilots over a continuing timeline. Sounds like a great concept, right?It is, at first. But then now in episode 31, we are already on the third pilot. That\'s imo is the problem. I\'m sure in the interest to sell toys, they need to iterate the different Gundams fast. In return, the story and characters suffer. The first arc started with Flit Asuno. This arc is actually fairly decently paced at first, but it\'s clear that they want to...move things fast. Character development became disjointed. This is even worse on the second arc, with Asemu Asuno. I mean you literally see things turning around just after a dialogue or two or after the next scene, something that should be paced slower imo. It\'s extremely disjointed. Worse, just when things seem to pick up and you started to see Asemu\'s development, they ended the arc and started the third one. Don\'t get me started on the supporting characters. Other than the main pilot and maybe another one second main pilot, the rest of the pilots are pretty much useless, which makes you wonder how they can become pilots in the first place. This is amplified in the second arc to the extreme where Asemu/Woolf are pretty much the only ones doing everything. Very annoying.I\'m sure you already read the story somewhere else, so I\'ll skip that. But I do want to point out the fan services. Thing is, I\'m not sure to say whether they are fan services, or the writers are lazy. The AGE Gundams design, many scenes, etc mirror pretty much the UC series, AGE-1 to the original Gundam, AGE-2 to Zeta Gundam, and AGE-3 to Gundam ZZ. As for similarities of scenes, just watch the finale of the 1st arc, very obvious.The mecha art is superb. What do you expect? It\'s Sunrise. The characters, on the other hand, seems to be simplified, or even ""kidified."" It\'s definitely not OO, but it actually harkens back to the older Gundam series. Not a big deal imo, but the disjointed pacing doesn\'t help the overall enjoyment.In the end, it\'s an okay Gundam series. I mean it\'s refreshing to see a simpler Gundam design (versus SEED), and some scenes brings nostalgia from the UC Gundam series. Still, the story seems too simplified, especially after OO, and the pacing is just annoying. Let\'s just hope we can get over this quickly and move on. move things fast.

(100年に渡る3世代の物語)ART: Being the animated gundam series to succeed Gundam 00 on TV, AGE has received some negative lashes for its ""colorful"" or ""childish"" character art. Nagumo Takuzo (video games Inazuma Eleven and Prof. Layton) is responsible for the character art, and it does give off the impression that it wouldn\'t respect the serious story of the Asuno Family, nor respect the military fiction genre that commonly follows Gundam. While I do feel that way, and while I do think their characters faces and noses sometime look lazy, I think the style accentuate the characters.  The...mecha art is good, and I enjoy checking out blogs for the toy models. There are a few designers who worked on different previous gundam works such as Wing, X, Crossbone,  and even 00, but the gundam AGE itself seems to adopt more from 00. You can\'t help but see Exia within AGE-1. Except the starcraft, there are little to no CGI used anywhere. That\'s a plus for me! You can follow the battles easily. Background art, like the forests and building structures of the colony, are well done. The openings are great to watch too.STORY: AGE is developed for younger watchers to recognize the Gundam product, and to appeal to a wide audience, which I think makes it easy to follow. I thought a storyline about three generations of pilots from the same family was a great idea. Destruction and violence takes place; also, it has features that are orthodox to the previous shows like the Earth Federation and space colonies, a youthful gundam pilot compelled to battle with a super weapon designed by his family, and military personnel and civilians escaping on a spacecraft. Explaining more may be giving out spoilers, but you if you\'re familiar with the UC series, you can probably point them out while watching AGE. Plus, I think the UE are a cool enemy. Their vicious fighting tactics, and the Federation\'s helplessness against them, make them interesting to watch. On the other hand however, the story being VERY linear and being unfair to its supporting characters is a negative. Since the storyline is split into three generations, time passes quickly and the seasons are shortened. Plenty of climaxes, but short seasons. This leaves things to have small develop time.SOUND: Lovely music. The OPs and EDs are a mix of rock and pop. I especially like the opening themes ""Asu he"" and ""SHARP"". The ED ""My World"" is well done too. Voice-wise, Kazuhiko Inoue (Jerid from Z gundam, Gai from ASTRAY) does well as a narrator. Like a grandfather to his grandchildren, his gruff tone relays the setting\'s tense reality, of generations thrown into chaos by the UE. Along with him, other VA from previous gundam works such as Sakaguchi Daisuke (Usso from Victory Gundam), Yusa Koji (a minor in gundam X), Ono Daisuke (Sven Cal of STARGAZER), Toichi Hiroki (Lasse of 00), Endoh Aya, (Kimie Crossroad in 00), Romi Paku (Loran from Turn A), Suwabe Junichi (Sting of SEED DESTINY), and Kusanoki Taiten appear in the cast. The main characters (Eguchi Takuya, Toyonaga Toshiyuki, Yamamoto Kazutomi) are voiced by more-or-less new VAs but they do well in portraying the boys.CHARACTER: Like I said, the story is straight-forward. The main characters, as members of the Asuno family, receive the most development. Each season quickly passes by, leaving characters and replacing them before you get to know them well enough. This feels pretty bad when it comes to romantic relationships. One thing that bothers me is that because the gundam is a force to be reckon with, many (not all) side characters are more-or-less insignificant. Also, the antagonists are so vicious in their supposedly ""fair goal"" that they seem like monsters more than anything.ENJOY/OVERALL: Simplicity in story, bad direction with some characters. I like the family concept in AGE and the evolution of the gundam. Good music. I think it\'s a fair show and has the gundam essentials.

However, that could also be the thing that makes the show suck. Lets say u got so attached to a generations MC then they went and skip to the next gen. U'll feel incredibly frustrated. Frustrated that he's pushed to being a subbed character or removed. Thats what i got when i watch this series.The story was similar to gundam seed. So if u like seed i think you will like this too. This series will make u cry if you get to attached to...certain characters certain characters"", 'Gundam AGE - what many people consider to be a disappointment and probably one of the worst additions to the Gundam saga. One could however also counter that claim with G-Saviour and Gundam SEED Destiny. With much promise in its story and character arcs, AGE still manages to be a mediocre, but not an unenjoyable experience.Note: This review contains spoilers, especially in art, characters and story, but if you seen enough Gundam like I did, you won\'t have much of an issue with them. Some of these spoilers are also very predictable.Story: 5/10This is the hardest area to write about. The plot looks very...promising and could hold much potential. Three story arcs? Three (Well, not three.) Gundams tossed around these arcs? A war with an unknown enemy with far superior designs? Sign me up.Unfortunately, Sunrise managed to squander almost every opportunity to make the world more interesting, and the story more likeable. The three arcs can be rated as this: Not bad, but not good either - Good, even very good - What are you doing, Sunrise. Like the third arc\'s minirating suggests, the third arc turns so bad in its halfway point that the whole show looks bad. If you look more subjectively at the story, however, it\'s more forgivable, even though I like seeing a lot of combat and the appearance of the new Gundam model makes it pointless.The worst issue with the story is the low amount of world-building and the amount of characters killed for almost no reason. There\'s some in the second arc that are almost completely pointless, and the third arc makes that even higher, removing possibilities of more character development.Art: 9/10Gundam AGE\'s art is criminally underrated - both the Gundams and the UE (or whatever I should call them for the sake of the review) have impressive designs that look more original than the designs in other installments. The idea of a modular Gundam is also great, although that concept is put on hold in the second arc, and only returns in the third arc, with the Gundam AGE-3.If I could summarize the Gundams with just a few words, I\'d describe them like this: Original Gundam - Zeta Gundam - Double Zeta (ZZ) Gundam. I won\'t describe the other Gundams - mainly because it would ruin the experience a little bit and they are quite distinguishable. It also isn\'t difficult to say what they\'re inspired by.The Federation designs don\'t look too bad, either, and are a welcome sight compared to the typical GM-like mobile suit design that appears oh-so-often. The ships also look great on both sides of the conflict, and Sunrise wasn\'t afraid to experiment with designs overall, which made the show better.Sound: 10/10I got to admit, the soundtrack is flawless. It fits well into every setting it\'s placed in, and shows the intensity of the scenes well. The sounds are also perfect, especially in the Gundams\' case. The openings are also pretty good and fit the arcs rather well.Character: 5/10This is where AGE falls again, and rather hard. I\'m only rating it at 5 because I\'ve seen far worse examples, and this definitely isn\'t one of them. The main characters are all pretty meh, except for Asemu, which is a decently built character, and Kio, who is practically THE reason the third arc flopped so hard. Flit doesn\'t seem bad, and in the second arc, he turns into a surprisingly good and believable character. The end of the third arc ruins that a bit, but that\'s expected. Woolf is a badass in the second arc as well, and he\'s still a good character in his own right in the first arc, too.Unfortunately, a lot of female characters don\'t get that building they deserve, and they mostly turn into only romantic interests and, really, objects of insemination for the main characters. After that, they\'re practically only mentioned in sentences like ""I wish Mom was here"", or ""Mom must be worried"". I wish that wasn\'t the case, they could have brought some important character development. Some of the characters, as mentioned earlier in the review, tend to be killed off rather often, sometimes being introduced in the same episodes. One of the main villains even decides to throw some of that important building into the trash can and do some stupid things which only very few characters in Gundam can do, and that\'s quite an impressive feat.Enjoyment: 7/10Despite all these negative factors, the series is still enjoyable - a lot of the combat scenes are really likable, and the villain scenes are also decent. I feel bad for writing so little about enjoyment, since it\'s really pointed out by the previous sections of the review.Overall: 6/10I\'ve seen a fair share of bad anime. This is a fairly mediocre one as well, but I don\'t think it deserves this much hate, despite me understanding all of it.Would I recommend the series? No. There\'s definitely better examples of Gundam to watch, like Zeta Gundam. The series also failed due to attempting to fit three mini-series into a 49-episode format, and that\'s my biggest gripe with it by far.Overall points:+Great designs.+Amazing soundtrack.+Second arc in most of its entirety.+Decent enjoyment overall.-The second half of the third arc is so bad a seperate review could be made on it.-Character development is pretty mediocre most of the time.-Story\'s opportunities are mostly squashed, and thus the world-building is also rather mediocre.-The attempt to implement three mini-series into the rather limiting episode format ends up rather badly.(I think that\'s about it from me about AGE. I really expected this to be a shorter review, but I waited a few days for my experience to settle in, so I could form a more coherent and cohesive review.

When I say 6/10 I mean it was an okay show, but nothing too special. I still personally think it merits watching, and honestly I\'d give it a much higher score overall if not for the ending bar, but we\'ll get there later.Story: 7/10: Nothing too terribly special for the most part it\'s a typical Gundam story except the bad guys are aliens. I will say that the Flit/AGE 1 arc starts off pretty bad. The first 2-3 episodes were pretty good, then it drops off until the last couple episodes...IMO. AGE 2 actually had a pretty engaging plot IMO, and is by the far the best arc o the show. AGE 3 had some potential story wise, but is largely brought down by it\'s protagonist. AGE-FX was pretty unmemorable story-wise. The ending drags down the overall rating. If it weren\'t for FX I\'d give the story a 8.Art: 7/10: The art was generally pretty clean during the action scenes and the regular scenes were usually pretty good too. The only things I hold against it are: 1) I didn\'t like the art style. Common complaint I know, but the more ""kiddie"" art style really didn\'t do it for me. 2) Sometimes it seems like the animators were trying to see how much they could get away with. Like in one scene an enemy MS opens fire on the good guys! ....Only to harmlessly shoot in a circle around them. Other times characters might be half animated when talking at a distance. Which isn\'t unusual anime\'s commonly do this to save budget clearly, but AGE will linger on these scenes sometimes; once even having a minute and a half conversation with the characters half drawn. It honestly just felt like the animators were trying to see if anyone cared enough to stop them.Sound: 6/10: The OP\'s and ED\'s are generally pretty good. With some real standouts like OP 1 or ED 2, but that\'s about it. The only track from the entire OST I remember is Unmei no Saki he and that\'s mostly because it play during the most memorable scene of the show.Characters: 7/10: This show takes place over 3 protagonists and 4 arcs. It stands to reason that a lot of the characters don\'t really get fleshed out too well. That said the show did have some outstanding characters sometimes. Certain characters like Woolf or Dique who do end up making reappearances in AGE 2 are surprisingly well thought through. Especially Dique since he gets practically no screen time, and is usually a joke in AGE 1. On the other hand other side characters like Emily don\'t end up getting the attention they should throughout the show.The protagonists are generally handled well. Flit started off kind off annoying, but ended up as my favorite and was a lot of the driving force for me to watch the show. How he progresses from AGE 1 to AGE FX was really the most interesting part, and I maintain that even though the focus shifts to different characters in the other arcs Flit Asuno is always the main character of the show.Asemu is also a great character, and solidifies AGE 2 as my favorite arc overall. Though they did make a little bit of a weird choice for his character in AGE 3/FX, but even then he was still great.AGE 3/FX had the worst protagonist which is why I give the characters only a 7. Honestly a lot of the ratings on the show take a hit from Kio. The only thing he didn\'t really effect was the sound. Kio Asuno is your typical Shounen protagonist screaming about how ""War is bad!"" without offering any real solutions. He\'s also an extremely powerful X-Rounder (Read: Newtype) and isn\'t too terribly interesting. The only thing he really had going for him was his relationship to Flit. AGE 3 does actually end with the possibility that Kio would have to grow up, which was really interesting, but it was immediately shot down by the Deus Ex Machina that is AGE FX.The main villain of the show also provided a very interesting comparison to Flit, but unfortunately the show never really capitalized on that.Enjoyment: 8/10: Despite my various issues withe show I found it overall pretty entertaining other than AGE FX. It\'s worth watching if not just to see how Flit and Asemu change throughout the show. Also, AGE 2 was just plain good.Overall: 6/10: While  would say it was an entertaining show I wouldn\'t say it was a GOOD show. It\'s clearly got issues in terms of both tone and pacing, but overall it was enjoyable to watch nonetheless. I\'d probably have given it a 7/10 or maybe even 8/10 if it wasn\'t for FX. IMO. AGE 2 actually had a pretty engaging plot IMO, and is by the far the best arc o the show. AGE 3 had some potential story wise, but is largely brought down by it\'s protagonist. AGE-FX was pretty unmemorable story-wise. The ending drags down the overall rating. If it weren\'t for FX I\'d give the story a 8.Art: 7/10: The art was generally pretty clean during the action scenes and the regular scenes were usually pretty good too. The only things I hold against it are: 1) I didn\'t like the art style. Common complaint I know, but the more ""kiddie"" art style really didn\'t do it for me. 2) Sometimes it seems like the animators were trying to see how much they could get away with. Like in one scene an enemy MS opens fire on the good guys! ....Only to harmlessly shoot in a circle around them. Other times characters might be half animated when talking at a distance. Which isn\'t unusual anime\'s commonly do this to save budget clearly, but AGE will linger on these scenes sometimes; once even having a minute and a half conversation with the characters half drawn. It honestly just felt like the animators were trying to see if anyone cared enough to stop them.Sound: 6/10: The OP\'s and ED\'s are generally pretty good. With some real standouts like OP 1 or ED 2, but that\'s about it. The only track from the entire OST I remember is Unmei no Saki he and that\'s mostly because it play during the most memorable scene of the show.Characters: 7/10: This show takes place over 3 protagonists and 4 arcs. It stands to reason that a lot of the characters don\'t really get fleshed out too well. That said the show did have some outstanding characters sometimes. Certain characters like Woolf or Dique who do end up making reappearances in AGE 2 are surprisingly well thought through. Especially Dique since he gets practically no screen time, and is usually a joke in AGE 1. On the other hand other side characters like Emily don\'t end up getting the attention they should throughout the show.The protagonists are generally handled well. Flit started off kind off annoying, but ended up as my favorite and was a lot of the driving force for me to watch the show. How he progresses from AGE 1 to AGE FX was really the most interesting part, and I maintain that even though the focus shifts to different characters in the other arcs Flit Asuno is always the main character of the show.Asemu is also a great character, and solidifies AGE 2 as my favorite arc overall. Though they did make a little bit of a weird choice for his character in AGE 3/FX, but even then he was still great.AGE 3/FX had the worst protagonist which is why I give the characters only a 7. Honestly a lot of the ratings on the show take a hit from Kio. The only thing he didn\'t really effect was the sound. Kio Asuno is your typical Shounen protagonist screaming about how ""War is bad!"" without offering any real solutions.

Often time drama is created out of thin air, only to be resolved in the same episode and never mentioned again, despite the series being based around the flow of time and ripple...effect of actions through time, few events and characters actually impact the nearly 100 year plot.The first protagonist, Flit, is an immensely tragic character who by the end of the series becomes something that his younger self would be terrified of. However, the show refuses to recognize this fact outside of few inconsequential exchanges.Early on he states his distaste for war and the fact that the older generation only uses and manipulates the younger one to fight their battles, but as he becomes the older generation himself, his handling of the central war and his actions towards those he loves makes it clear he is lost. The show does not frame it this way, and exalts him as some slightly misguided hero.His son, Asemu, is the most interesting arc of the show. His relationship with his friend Zeheart is established well despite only occurring over around 15 episodes and many memorable side characters are introduced during this part. Unfortunately,  both Asemu and Zehearts characters are butchered as we reach part 3. I could see an argument for simply starting the show from here.The final part, with Kio as protagonist, pulls from ZZ and Unicorn, with a dash of SEED. Kio's father and grandfather have failed him in a variety of ways the show handwaves over. Despite this, he has a kind heart, and turns out to be the only one capable sympathizing with the enemy. The enemy has finally reached the final phase of its (poorly thought out and senseless) plan and many characters on the enemy side are forced by the show to nonsensically go along with it, which weakens Kios theme of humanity understanding each other.The show finally ends in an extremely anticlimactic fashion; with the aftermath of 100 years of war reduced to a 10 second narration before cutting to credits. To me, the true message of the show is contained in the visuals and lyrics of the ending song to part three. As their loved ones watch on, grow old and die, Flit and Asemu fight on without ever looking back at those they claim to be protecting. Only Kio decides to truly live. I wish the show did not lose sight of this message. effect of actions through time, few events and characters actually impact the nearly 100 year plot.The first protagonist, Flit, is an immensely tragic character who by the end of the series becomes something that his younger self would be terrified of.

It has Three generations spilt into a 49 episode series. Each generation has its own protagonist and new characters. I was really intrigued by this premise and I wanted to know why this is one of the black sheeps of the Gundam series. Anyways lets start the review.Story:4This story had so much potential. The premise is so good. The execution however is not that great. Generation 1 is fine enough even though it wastes time with a pointless arc. It should've been just...10 episodes so more time could have been given to the second generation. The second generation was probaly the best even though it suffers from the problem of not having enough time to properly expand its story. The OVA Memory of Eden does kind of help a bit but not by much. The third generation is where my problem with the story is. A lot of the plot points that were introduced in first and second generations just comes crashing to the ground in the third generation and the ending is so garbage. Everything just feels so rushed in last few episodes. Honestly the third generation is the only reason why I gave the story a 4. It hurts the series so much.Art:7I really like the art style here. Its not perfect and it doesn't look as good as Gundam 00 in my opinion but it does look nice. The colors are nice and bright and everything is animated well.The mech designs however are a mixed bag. I like the Gundams and all of the Earth Federations mobile suit designs even though most of them look a little too generic in my opinion. My main problem with mobile suit designs is with the U.E suits. They look so out of place in Gundam and were obviously only made that way so kids could tell who the bad guys are.Sound:8The sound track is pretty good. No track felt out of place and misued. The main standout are the Gundam themes every single time I heard one of them I couldn't help but get a bit excited!The songs for the OPs and EDs were pretty good too. They matched the vibe of each arc pretty well.Characters:5Hoo boy Gundam AGE has some major problem with its characters. Its not that many of them are bad its just that the series doesn't give them enough time to develop. Most characters just get forgotten about and never mentioned again episodes after they are introduced. When they try to have emotional moments with characters that have barely been developed it just ends up feeling really flat.Enjoyment: 6I'd say this is a fairly fun watch. The battles are fun, and the pacing is ok.If was a kid watching this I would've probably liked a lot more but as a grown adult its still fun.Overall:6Overall I'd call Gundam AGE serviceable. It scratchs my Gundam and mecha itch and its good enough entrypoint for kids to get into Gundam if they don't want to watch the Gundam Build series. For adults I'd only recommend it if your ok with watching a series with obvious flaws. 10 episodes so more time could have been given to the second generation.

The beautiful story, the unfortunate sadness from certain characters that lost their lives during the struggle between the federation and the vagun during the seventy year long conflict, but three parts that I will say that absolutely amazed me were the age system, which is basically a self learning computer, that constantly made up grades to gundam pilot at the time's gundam. It took into account for every battle situation that was at hand as that was brilliant. The second part...that amazed me was the fact that three generations of pilots ended up being in all one anime, you see the cover of the anime shows three boys, which at first my initial thought, was they were probably close friends, I was wrong, it was the grandfather, father, and then the last to pilot a gundam was the grandson. Now, the last and final part that astonished me was, that ship they used, they never changed it, in the entire series they used one ship. That ship held so many memories for everyone especially the grandfather, the first pilot of the gundam. That is what I loved the most. It was like a home for each gundam pilot and crew that came before the next. This gundam series deserves the highest rating possible. I loved it so much, from beginning, to end. that amazed me was the fact that three generations of pilots ended up being in all one anime, you see the cover of the anime shows three boys, which at first my initial thought, was they were probably close friends, I was wrong, it was the grandfather, father, and then the last to pilot a gundam was the grandson.

Mu Wang Zhi Wang: Qi Lin Jue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37737/Mu_Wang_Zhi_Wang__Qi_Lin_Jue,"['Please note, I\'ve watched all 4 seasons of Mu Wang Zhi Wang before writing this review.This donghua follows two opposing groups, a group of tomb raiders and a group of tomb guardians (with a hinted third group that doesn\'t show up much in this season). The story centers on the tomb raiding group, specifically Lou ManFeng, the white haired main character. He an a friend are raiding a specific tomb, aiming to obtain the ""tomb clear"" medallion, located in the tomb\'s deepest parts as proof of successfully reaching the deepest chamber.The plot itself tries to present itself as complex, though it comes off as quite...contrived and overly complicated. Since this donghua is an original story (not an adaptation), the story telling is quite weak and they rely on flashback/retcons to cover some unexplainable phenomenon (like how did the MC get that Qilin tattoo(?)). There was also some needless romantic drama in order to redeem some of the ""villains"" so that she would side with the MC\'s group.When it comes to character design and animation quality, it is not bad. However, since this donghua season was released back in 2016, the ""early days"" of 3D donghua, the animation, especially the action/fights are quite stiff. Also note that this season was also originally released in 720p (you may be able to find 1080p upscaled though).Overall, this donghua tries to build a larger world than needed creating complexity and drama where it is unneeded. It has some weak story telling and plot building.

Also, despite being “Egghead Recap”, it barely touches upon Egghead. Though that’s not a bad thing, we don’t need to be reminded of episodes that literally just aired.The most enjoyable part was the opening, but obviously that sequence is not original to this recap. I mean, barely anything is original to the recap, just the short chibi sequence and some of the narration. So for example despite the Puncture attack...animation sequence being awesome, I can’t credit it to this recap as that’s just reused footage from the series. Well, recap is as recap does.I would equate the experience of watching this recap to reading Law’s wiki page.

A girl named Churuya who fights frantically to obtain what is denied to her. Churuya\'s very own forbidden fruit, smoked cheese.Churuya’s world is unlike any other, it’s a place where the inhabitant wear emotionless expressions whose gazes are filled with indifference and scorn. Hysterically staring at her while wearing slick smiles whenever she isn’t looking. Churuya-san story ingeniously explains a tragedy of sorts that encompasses the concept of egoism. Put in simple words: ""This cheese is mine. You can’t...have any.""The malice of the twisted world she lives in is mainly depicted by a cynic boy named Kyon, one of Churuya\'s classmates. Uncaring, malicious, and sharp tongued as he is, Kyon puts Churuya through countless hardships with false promises of giving Churuya a small taste of her adored smoked cheese. As the story progress, the viewer witnesses how this fiend slowly transforms Churuya into a constant source of mockery for his personal amusement. However, his heartless deeds aren’t restricted to Churuya-san as another one of the classmates of Churuya-san named Ryoko shares a similar predicament. She’s enamored with the same very man who treats Churuya worse than beasts. All too soon, what is feared the most by Ryoko becomes a reality in her eyes as well. It is well known that history has to thing to repeat itself. Unfortunately for her, this tyrant already prepared his own agent for her before she could notice. Kyon doesn’t hesitate make her despair in every chance he gets entirely ignoring her pure feeling towards him, thinking that it’s too easy. Far too easy to let it go.In this world, Haruhi, Yuki, Itsuki and even Mikuru are a shell of their former selves. They are no longer who they used to be. They are empty shelves with the sole mission is to contribute to Churuya’s anguish. Disguised as Churuya\'s close friends they carefully weave their webs around her seeking for right opportunity of ridicule further. There is no trace left of their past kindness and caring for her friend. Now, they’re all dull and ruled by immense apathy.  All of them devoid of common sense and compassion towards her smoked cheese-starved friend.Because of the distressing events in her short life Churuya has developed the peculiar condition of saying ~Nyoron whenever something upsetting happens to her. These words uttered from Churuya’s lips are a cry for help that express both anxiety and frustration, words of grief that has no equivalent to any language known to man.  Byproducts from a well hidden daily misfortune cause by smoked cheese deprivation.Being called names, abused, trampled all over and then discarded like yesterday’s newspaper. Churuya is pushed around mercilessly in inhuman ways that breaks the heart and touches the very soul. Churuya’s tale is a journey to find her own utopia where she can be happy. A place where she isn\'t discriminated against for her liking of smoked cheese. An utopia where the world is painted yellow.

Thank you.', ""Nyoro-n Churuya-san was one of the most out there and random Animes I have ever watched. After finishing Haruhi-chan, I was still craving more Haruhi-related randomness, so I decided to watch Churuya. It was killer. I enjoyed Churuya's childlike way of looking at the world and her rabid obsession with smoked cheese. My only problems with this anime are:1. I didn't quite like the art style. The way that all of the Brigade member's faces are just a series of lines arranged to make a face seems to reflect a sort of laziness.2. Yūko Gotō didn't do the voice exactly the same. I know that's...a sorta picky thing to say, but that's just the way I am.However, I enjoyed watching the show with my favorite episode being 7, featuring Churuya's Great Great Adventure, a video game starring the one and only Churuya-san. a sorta picky thing to say, but that's just the way I am.However, I enjoyed watching the show with my favorite episode being 7, featuring Churuya's Great Great Adventure, a video game starring the one and only Churuya-san."", ""Hee-hee, after watching this, I really wanted to try smoked cheese. I really like Churuya-san now, she's really cute.

Mostly jokes about smoked cheese, and total random-ness, with just some dashes of cute moments, and you have Nyoro~n Churuya-san.

The humour basically revolves around little inconveniences happening to the main character who responds by going ""nyoro..""There are no funny gags or hilarious situations like you would normally find in anime.

Onipan!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50955/Onipan,"['Onipan is by far, in my opinion at least, one of the best and most enjoyable examples of what shorter anime are capable of.Just a little background on the show before I get into the main portion of the review. The show is broadcast in smaller 2-3 minute segments in Japan and then once the show has aired all of these segments throughout the weekdays, the episodes are condensed into longer episodes, usually lasting between 13-16 minutes. So whether you\'re looking for a bite-sized or more traditional, albeit slightly shorter, anime viewing experience, Onipan has both bases covered.Where to begin? The show itself is a...really fun and light hearted story about Oni girls who embark on a quest to better the image and relations between the Oni and Humans, which sounds kind of grandiose now that I think about it but you only have to watch the first few minutes of the first episode to gain a true sense of just how pure and wholesome it is.The girls, Tsutsuji (Red Oni), Tsuyukusa (Blue Oni) and Himawari (Yellow Oni), are all adorable and have a unique, yet familiar, dynamic that ends up never leaving a dull moment between the three of them, and that\'s not even mentioning the varying array of side characters that appear throughout the episodes.It\'s also worth noting that the voice actors for the girls are three brand new young voice actors, and whilst it\'s fairly easy to tell that these young girls have yet to accumulate the years of experience you would see from just about any other VA in the anime industry, they soon feel right at home in their respective roles and it lends a level of authenticity to the Oni girls that you wouldn\'t otherwise see from a slice-of-life show like this.The animation is spearheaded by none other than Wit Studio, (Attack on Titan S1-3, Ousama Ranking, Vivy: Fluorite Eye\'s Song, etc.) allow me to preface this quickly by saying this isn\'t their most flashy piece of work compared to the aforementioned, but it doesn\'t skimp on animation when it counts, and has it\'s memorable moments of animation that would make any fan who knows their anime studios stop and think ""Yep, this is Wit Studio alright.""The OP and ED... er well, just the ED I guess, is a super fun, catchy and upbeat song with stylish visuals that conveys all you can expect from the show and cast, which only leaves you craving more of their Oni antics every time you watch it.There\'s really not much else to say about the show if I\'m being honest, and that\'s not intended in a harsh way, quite the opposite in fact, it\'s fun, cute, funny and wholesome, just about everything you could want from a story like this.It goes without saying, but of course this is just my opinion, it\'s definitely not for everyone, but I wholeheartedly encourage anyone to give the first episode a go, and who knows? you may just end up falling up with these loveable Oni girls just like I have. :D really fun and light hearted story about Oni girls who embark on a quest to better the image and relations between the Oni and Humans, which sounds kind of grandiose now that I think about it but you only have to watch the first few minutes of the first episode to gain a true sense of just how pure and wholesome it is.The girls, Tsutsuji (Red Oni), Tsuyukusa (Blue Oni) and Himawari (Yellow Oni), are all adorable and have a unique, yet familiar, dynamic that ends up never leaving a dull moment between the three of them, and that\'s not even mentioning the varying array of side characters that appear throughout the episodes.It\'s also worth noting that the voice actors for the girls are three brand new young voice actors, and whilst it\'s fairly easy to tell that these young girls have yet to accumulate the years of experience you would see from just about any other VA in the anime industry, they soon feel right at home in their respective roles and it lends a level of authenticity to the Oni girls that you wouldn\'t otherwise see from a slice-of-life show like this.The animation is spearheaded by none other than Wit Studio, (Attack on Titan S1-3, Ousama Ranking, Vivy: Fluorite Eye\'s Song, etc.) allow me to preface this quickly by saying this isn\'t their most flashy piece of work compared to the aforementioned, but it doesn\'t skimp on animation when it counts, and has it\'s memorable moments of animation that would make any fan who knows their anime studios stop and think ""Yep, this is Wit Studio alright.""The OP and ED... er well, just the ED I guess, is a super fun, catchy and upbeat song with stylish visuals that conveys all you can expect from the show and cast, which only leaves you craving more of their Oni antics every time you watch it.There\'s really not much else to say about the show if I\'m being honest, and that\'s not intended in a harsh way, quite the opposite in fact, it\'s fun, cute, funny and wholesome, just about everything you could want from a story like this.It goes without saying, but of course this is just my opinion, it\'s definitely not for everyone, but I wholeheartedly encourage anyone to give the first episode a go, and who knows? you may just end up falling up with these loveable Oni girls just like I have. :D', 'Onipan! is a show about 3 oni girls joining the human world to improve the general opinion of how onis are viewed. The main gimmick of the show is that when they need help, their sidekick, Kuma, will give them the Oni tiger-striped pantsu (hence the name OniPan!) and they will transform magical girl style into the outfit needed.If 60 episodes seems too daunting to pick up, allow me to explain that each ""episode"" is very short. Each episode aired at different time over a week and were compiled into a full 12-13 minute episode later. With 5 mini-episode in each full episode, that makes...the show clock in at only a little over 2 hours.Another thing to make mention of, this show is a very Japan-styled comedic show. You need to understand the basics of what oni are in Japanese folklore, like the story of Momotaro. This show also does a lot of references to other media which include: Dragon Quest, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Food Wars, The Phantom Menace(?), Sailor Moon, and other things I may have missed. The comedy will be a hit or miss depending on whether you can enjoy the subtlety of the humor and the fact that the show doesn\'t take itself seriously.My honest opinion is just let your brain relax and enjoy the goofy antics and 4th wall breaks. This show does a really good job of what it set out to do and the shorter episodes help keep the simple plots from going on too long.All in all, it gets an 8.

(TM)I've always been a fan of director Ohta and his crew. They make some of the best comedies out there from Mitsudomoe to the legendary Sabagebu. But the team is most well known for their work on Doga Kobo's comedies such as Yuru Yuri and Uzamaid. While recently we haven't seen much output from them apart from the dreadful Abilities Average show, imagine my surprise when they're doing a kids show (like an actual kids show with the time shown on the top left and such) with stunt cast idols as the MCs. So how does this fare...compared to the team's other works?First off, the MCs don't sound particularly well. As it usually goes for characters not voiced by regular seiyuu, everyone sounds off. This is especially jarring since they are surrounded by a plethora of professional seiyuu, making their amateur performances all the more glaring and noticeable. But, I have to admit, after several episodes of being with them, you get used to them and actually start to like them well enough. Yellow's is still off after all is said and done though.Secondly, since this is a kids show, a lot of the raunchy humor or more crude stuff has been totally sand down. What you get is a very sanitized Ohta show. This does have the side effect of erasing some of the humor, but good direction and writing still sees the show having some good laughs here and there. Plus its 12 minute run time ensures nothing gets dragged on for too long.Even animation-wise this show is more reminiscent of Doga Kobo's comedies than Wit Studio. Very bright vivid colors (but not too bright) and relatively simple, but appropriate and pleasant to look at. Seems to be a recurring theme this season, shows by different studios resembling shows from other studios. And the EDs are just amazing, quite possibly some of my favorites this whole season.All in all, the show is pretty funny for the most part and does not become too repetitive with its jokes. Some segments do feel like its trying too hard to be funny to kids, and the show often references material kids won't even know, but it's still a very enjoyable show throughout, even if it isn't as strong of Ohta's previous works.7/10 compared to the team's other works?First off, the MCs don't sound particularly well.

He also finds various steamy situations from a few beings entranced by his beauty or who wish to use his body.I am a yaoi fan, love bishounen, and also like lighter shounen-ai anime and manga as well. As...a gay guy, even some of the ones that are suppose to be light-hearted or comedy too often have characters that are too little like real guys, gay, bi or otherwise, from my perspective and experience. So it's hard for me to find them really enjoyable, especially when they are trying to represent supposedly real gays, bis and others. They try too hard, and still don't get it right.

Puzzle & Dragons Cross,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32772/Puzzle___Dragons_Cross,"[""Okay, since most of the reviews about this show are negative, here's my counter claim.For starters, when seeing the trailer for this anime, I originally thought it would be another Pokémon clone. Now, after seeing about 17 episodes into the series, I don't see much of a similarity besides that they live in a world inhabited by monsters.THE STORY: The story is pretty average. The main character is a dragon caller in training , who works with other dragon callers to help balance the world, and stop drop impacts(which are huge monster attacks). I like the story, but it's not what I'd call the best...plot ever.THE ART: The art style of the show is very good. Most of the monsters don't feel to over designed, and I like the character models. I also like the way Vienna City, and the regions of Dragoza Island look. The animation is good, but I don't like how at times, there is little animation. There are some scenes in episodes that just consist of the characters just standing around talking, which just gets boring.CHARACTERS: I honestly like the characters in this series because they have good personalities. The only one I'm not too fond of is Ace(the main character) because he's really boring. I know other Animes like this have pulled something off like this(Yo Kai Watch and Digimon Universe: Appli Monsters for example) but in both shows, these characters boring personalities are used as importance in the show. Here it isn't. Besides that, I like the rest of the characters' personalities. My favorite character would probably be Charo, because of his dark past and his 'never giving up' attitude.SOUND: The show's soundtrack is probably one of it's best parts. I never skip over it's opening when watching subbed or dubbed episodes because of how good it sounds. Hell, I love listening to its ending song, because it's pretty catchy(though I don't know what it means). The soundtrack music in episodes is also really good, and I find myself listening to it outside of the show.THE VERDICT: Personally, I enjoyed watching this show, and I do recommend it if you're interested. My Rating: 8.2/10 plot ever.THE ART: The art style of the show is very good. Most of the monsters don't feel to over designed, and I like the character models.

That\'s basically the whole story >_>""I don\'t understand what\'s going on"" was my first thought of this anime. The cringe was too real.But the art wasn\'t bad. It was just.. Um, fluffy? I really don\'t know how to describe it. I\'ve watched up to episode 5 and ""fluffy"" is all I can say about it. The characters were also.. very young-looking. In a bad way. How old are the characters supposed to be? They look like 11 year old kids.The sound was.. Uh, I\'m not an expert on...sound but it was okay. Probably the only thing that I liked. The opening wasn\'t really to my liking, but I get where it\'s going at.The characters were just.. eh. First, the main character Ace is all ""Oh wow that Lance guy is just a show-off blah blah blah"", then later he\'s the one showing off and I\'m sitting here like.. ""What the heck is going on?""No characters actually had a really decent personality. They\'re just your typical, everyday people who show off too much. Ace was just too much for me.I really did not enjoy this at all, I\'m sorry. It\'s basically Pokemon, but more advanced. There\'s D-Gears, which, you put a monster drop in. Say ""Release"" and out pops the monster. Sound familiar? Yep.The only main difference is that in order to launch powerful attacks, the monster user/owner/whatever you want to call them needs to summon ""drops"" and make combos. Um.. a little too original.Overall I really just couldn\'t continue watching this. Sure, I agree this anime was.. okay. But I think this show is meant for kids.

""What the heck is going on?""No characters actually had a really decent personality. They\'re just your typical, everyday people who show off too much. Ace was just too much for me.I really did not enjoy this at all, I\'m sorry. It\'s basically Pokemon, but more advanced. There\'s D-Gears, which, you put a monster drop in. Say ""Release"" and out pops the monster. Sound familiar? Yep.The only main difference is that in order to launch powerful attacks, the monster user/owner/whatever you want to call them needs to summon ""drops"" and make combos. Um.. a little too original.Overall I really just couldn\'t continue watching this. Sure, I agree this anime was.. okay. But I think this show is meant for kids. I do recommend this anime for the younger viewers. But as for the teenager/adult viewers, I don\'t think this will be your cup of tea.', ""Starting off as an easy happy go lucky anime that follows most of those 'been there done that' troupes of the genre to a T with very little originality until you reach about episode 41 where this anime takes a suddenly yet refreshing dark turn into an oppressive race war which has got me hooked and kept me intrigue as to how it will be resolved.There's plenty of Ho-yay bait for the fujo/fudan fans and a variety of fan service as one would expect from the puzzle & dragon title. Moderate to decently animated fights scenes with RPG pacing, cute adorable monsters and your...standard magical transformation scenes which are thankfully spaced out and speedy enough to keep the action going.The animation quality can be hit or miss at points, the fight scene in episode two with Lance vs Crimson Dragon is even cringe worthy at parts as they try to replicate the mobile game into a world environment, this steadily gets better as the series progresses.I'd recommend giving it a go, a very under rated series imo standard magical transformation scenes which are thankfully spaced out and speedy enough to keep the action going.The animation quality can be hit or miss at points, the fight scene in episode two with Lance vs Crimson Dragon is even cringe worthy at parts as they try to replicate the mobile game into a world environment, this steadily gets better as the series progresses.I'd recommend giving it a go, a very under rated series imo"", 'What can I say about this besides .... boring.I mean maybe it will pick up later but unless this is going to be a new long running series it\'s running out of time.Nothing about this series is ""bad"" in the sense they did anything wrong.

Set in the historical Edo period, it follows young, clean-cut Shinsengumi officer Sabu, and blind, lecherous old man Ichi, who gives neck massages on the street (a traditional, low status job for blind men), but also an unlikely master-swordsman, with the blade concealed in his cane.""Sabu and Ichi"" follows a pretty standard, episodic, \'who-dunnit\' format, but in a traditional Tokugawa setting. It also follows the \'buddy-cop\'\' formula, with naive, enthusiastic, by-the-book Sabu contrasting with the...irreverent wisdom, unconventional approach, and street-smarts of Ichi. Each episode sees a crime commited, with the duo unravelling the clues, and catching the villain by the episodes end, in a largely self-contained format. Although there is quite a bit of character development through the course of the series, especially in the fleshing-out of the backstory of these two, complex, well-rounded characters.I was extremely impressed with ""Sabu and Ichi"". It\'ss early date and black and white imadery may put some people off, but I found a surprisingly mature, engaging story with beautiful art, offering a very authentic-feeling insightt into both Tokagawa Japan, and the early days of anime. ""Sabu and Ichi"" clearly had a limited budget, rrelying on the tricks of \'limited animation\' to maximize story-telling despite those limits. But it also uses some pretty innovative, experimental techniques, using compositing, Dezaki-esque paintings, or even the odd piece of live footage, to create a truly unique, boundary-pushing approach to story-telling.Showing influence in everything from Samurai Champloo to Cowboy Bebop to Rurouni Kenshin, ""Sabu and Ichi"" holds its age extremely well.

The characters (who so far have zero individually defining traits) might as well be wooden dolls.I've seen plenty of donghua that were clearly training projects for animators or script writers to get better at making CGI shows, but this is...awful. I have to assume it's just a filler show, because it's hard to imagine that anyone actually put effort into this.My recommendation: look for other donghua shows adapted from novels or other sources; they've already got a popular story behind them.

Shirogane no Ishi: Argevollen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23325/Shirogane_no_Ishi__Argevollen,"[""Allow me to preface this by saying that I find the concept of reviewing anime to be laughable. If you do not like the anime by the summary enough to pick it up, chances are a person will not be able to sell the idea to you. Furthermore, there is always the 1/4 rule, where you watch the first quarter of an anime before deciding to drop it.The fact that I am making a review is a testament to how much this show caught my interest and became one of my favorite shows of the year.This show has often been accused of being 'generic,' while...it is anything but. While by all means a show that could be called a 'Real Robot' anime, it is best to not even consider it a mecha-- rather a military drama, that features giant robots. More than anything, we are watching the daily life of a platoon of troops as they move from place to place.We see tactics of military combat, rather than brute forcing using the super-protype, the Argevollen. While strong, all of the advantages provided by it are primarily a combination of psychological effect (a powerful machine capable of destroying a machine with a kick, while moving far too quickly to seemingly be piloted by a human), as well as the element of the unknown (most of the people who encounter it die, or are captured). And even then, the show constantly needs to remind you in the early part, that what our protagonists are using, is a prototype.They can't fix it properly due to not having the full manuals on its assembly. They can't equip it properly, as all of their weapons are meant for another model of mecha. They can't change pilots, due to how the OS and UI of the machine was set up, only able to register the MC and activate with the Heroine.The fights in the early part feel sluggish, as though these machines are not meant to be lightning fast warrior that we are used to seeing mecha portrayed as. It's something new. Another thing that is new, is seeing how easily the machines are taken down-- even the titular mech. We see them shot and shut down/destroyed by artillery fire, or even infantry. Sometimes, they don't even get in their robots.Combining a refreshing concept for a show that is officially of the mecha genre, we have the character designer from To Love Ru: Darkness working on this, giving us something that is aesthetically pleasing. That is to say nothing of the soundtrack, which feels fitting of a military anime.Characters all get their time to shine, but sadly for the life of me, I could not remember their names. Too many, but then I realized that most of the names that were memorable, were the nicknames that people gave the characters. This made sense, seeing as how in the military, giving nicknames to your juniors and other colleagues is something that the media loves to portray. It gives a sense of camaraderie.Overall, I highly recommend Argevollen. If nothing else, you get a show that is unlike many others of the genre. it is anything but.

First thought that comes to mind is a generic mecha show with warfare and military concepts adapted into a struggle between nations in a world of dominance. The first episode doesn’t stride far from that as we learn the current state of affairs between the two nations – Arandas and Ingelmia. During on brief struggle, we find out that the main protagonist of the series, a young man from Arandas’ 8th unit named Tokimune Susumu is able to pilot a mysterious mecha suit. It’s known as the Argevollen and its potentials can change the course of this...war forever.Essentially, Argevollen rides on the war theme quite a bit with its introductory episodes. As an original anime though, this show has a lot of unoriginal clichés. The military warfare between two sides, troubling pasts of the main characters, generic looking robots, and political affairs are just a few to name. In essence, you shouldn’t expect anything very unpredictable from the start of the show. In fact, the series sets itself up like a rock ready to be thrown. It has all the concepts and it’s just ready to bounce away at something in front of it.The main protagonist Tokimune is your typical main guy with the skills to pilot the Argevollen. As the title stands for itself, the series bases off the mecha by its literal term - Silver-Willed Argevollen. This actually has a bit of a meaning besides just a flashy name. Apparently, the show plays around the idea that the pilot and the mecha can become a unit where it can only be piloted by those it accepts. While it doesn’t mold with Sentai tropes (as in the pilot actually transform into the mecha), the concept still feels peculiar. Nonetheless, the show preys on several developing routes for Tokimune. He becomes more confident in combat, improves his piloting skills, and even begins to form interpersonal connections with his other comrades. The most prominent of this is seen with a young woman he saved named Jamie. Although incompatible, there’s an innate connection between the two. The problem is that their relationship really suffers from development. The war drains most of the screen time for this series and leaves room for little else. There are a few breather episodes here and there but most of that is played off vaguely with its almost sarcastic-like atmosphere. Jamie herself isn’t exactly an interesting girl either as she is often worried about what she needs to do. Likewise, Tokimune is a character that I find to be monotonously dull as he is too much of a soldier on the battlefield and less so as a person.As the series carries on, we learn more about who Tokimune is fighting including against ace pilot Schlein Richthofen. Take their relationship as a sort of archetype rivalry like a snake and mongoose. While Tokimune does have the skill to use Argevollen, Richthofen proves his skills in combat through his natural instinct and abilities. His skills can be easily recognized in the beginning stages of the series as he takes out multiple opponents on the battlefield. At the same time, it’s also noticeable that Richthofen isn’t a cold-hearted man as he values his comrades shown in several episodes when his forces are decimated. Nonetheless, his encounters with the Argevollen brings about the best of what technology can do. And speaking of technology, that’s actually a funny thing to bring up. Technology in this show is very fictional. While it’s believable that mecha doesn’t exist, there are also hardly any other modern weapons of war such as cruise missiles or fighter jets. In reality, the world this show takes place in is more like an example of an alternate universe.As a 2 cour show, one should also carefully consider investing time with its characters. There’s no doubt that the show has a wide range of characters from various backgrounds whether it’s the serious commander of Unit 8 (Ukyo), experienced pilot Silfy Appleton, lone soldier Masaru Okui, or freshman recruit Namie Portman. Although the show isn’t able to fully focus on all of them on an individual basis, it does succeed in getting people to notice them. I’m not just talking about their roles on or off the battlefield but them as people. Besides Tokimune, we learn more a bit more about their characteristics, background stories, and even their purpose being part of the war. And to be honest, that is quite important as reasons is what drive people to do things such as fighting. Likewise, Tokimune’s reason regarding his past involves his sister as he plays an avenger-like player in their cruel world.Throughout the course of the show, it’s also easy to ask questions yourselves about the purpose of the war. There’s also certain aspects of themes involved such as the propaganda-like atmosphere going on. Surprisingly enough, there’s a decent deal of realism (not counting the world and the mecha suits). War efforts can be felt similar to actual world wars with what commanders do to obtain absolute victory. This includes strategic sacrifices, authoritative discipline, and even potential coup among its country’s factions. I think the message the show is trying to achieve is to depict the reality of what war is like and how no one should be a doorknob. While it can feel repetitive and seemingly endless, the show never deconstructs itself from what it started originally. It can get to some people’s skins after they realize just how much the show tries to fire up their premise. Yet from my perspective, this show finds itself having fun at times with the story it has set up with its characters and concepts.On most parts, artwork is pretty standard. Although I don’t have anything big to complain about, most of the character designs are just downright dull and generic. Almost everyone has that military-like expression whether you’re a newbie pilot or commander of a unit. The fact is, the character designs are belong average with little to write home about. On the other hand, we do have some creativity when it comes to mecha designs. The most-talked about robot would obviously be the Argevollen with its sheer metallic design covered by silver scales. Looking at it carefully, the Argevollen is the main mascot of the series for both its innovative design and symbol of hope. Other noticeable designs include the Trail Kriegers, which takes the form of walker-like war machines. It’s a war after all people.While not very prominent, the soundtrack does play some noticeable roles throughout the show. For starters, the OP and ED songs has a serial-like war theme with its experimental tones. Meanwhile, the second ED song of the show depicts more of sadness, perhaps the horrors of war. In retrospect, OST is moderate on most parts although it can strike quite the cord during climatic battle scenes. As the show lacks comedy on most occasions, there’s also a quiet feeling for emotional scenarios and conversations. Dialogues remain very straightforward though so don’t expect any prude jokes except on rare occasions.There’s no denying this show is about war and what it means to both sides. If the first few episodes doesn’t get you into the war-like atmosphere, then consider Argevollen enter your on-hold or drop list. There were times when I considered how a 2 cour show can build itself with all these overused archetypes. In fact, it gets to be increasingly difficult to craft a plausible show based on something so hackneyed. But looking at it carefully, the show manages to keep pace with itself. It’s not just the premise or characters but the overall development of what it’s trying to execute. Either on or off the battlefield, the show doesn’t kid around and maintain its mature atmosphere. It settles with the reality of war through death and destruction that doesn’t kill itself by just bringing in casualties. No, instead Argevollen combines general clichés with a list of generic pieces to fuse it into a big puzzle.

No, instead Argevollen combines general clichés with a list of generic pieces to fuse it into a big puzzle. Whether you want to be part of that is up to you', ""Argevollen isn't as bad as people made it out to be after the first episodes rolled out. It was a rare and appealing experience to a military history fan in that the plot structure is often focused around the political and military dynamics of the conflict. Unlike in a lot of other anime, we're simultaneously privy to the strategic momentum of the war from both sides' perspectives, their internal divisions and agendas, as well as progress on the field involving a whole array of tactics and plans. This means that there's more to it than a screaming protagonist smashing bad guys. Unfortunately he just has...to be there in the first place.Indeed, to be blunt, none of the characters in this show were good. They had so much time in the quieter filler episodes to make things interesting, but the dialogue and artistic direction outside of action sequences really didn't hit the mark enough to create memorable character-based moments and foster genuine character development instead of empty sentences thrown back and forth between Tokimune and Jamie. There was a lot of time wasted on the numerous side-characters whom it's hard to really connect with except on a very basic level, such as the primordial charm of the two other pilots of the Independent 8th (though don't be expecting them to receive any development at all). This is especially true of Namie, who was simply a plot device from start to finish. Moreover, although it was supposed to be a story based in war, there's a distinct lack of tension and tribulation. Nobody ever seems to feel under pressure, everyone is always clean, laughing and comfy, dramatic emotional sequences are kept to a minimum, we're very rarely exposed to the grimmer sides of conflict, and throughout it feels like we're watching a bunch of kids pretending to fight a war for a school play rather than the real deal.To be fair, however, it's an action and plot-driven show rather than one based around characters, and things were kept fairly interesting for me because apparently unlike a lot of other viewers I'm quite happy with a bread and butter of honest warfare between two sides and some background political/technological dynamics that keep you guessing how things will end up. There were sprinklings of good drama at odd points though perhaps not enough to warrant the wooden characters and attempted seriousness of the mood most of the time.Essentially it's the SAO of mecha to me - very fun and watchable when it sticks to its guns (literally) and gives us plenty of high-class action, but usually falls short when it tries to be deep or create interesting characters.5.5/10 to be there in the first place.Indeed, to be blunt, none of the characters in this show were good.

You get the ideal. All these issues do exist and I'm aware of them. So by now you're wondering about the nine. It's because I DON'T CARE! This is exactly what I want! Hot mech on mech action without whiny teenagers! Following the curved line to the hot mech on mech action! First of all, the enemy is other humans, not monsters, or robots, or aliens, or demons, or lucifer hawks etc. but other people piloting the...enemy mecha. There's not enough of this in anime. Characters are one dimensional, so much so that they only fill their roles with no deviation. And it's fine because they are a well oiled military machine working together for sometime. So this getting to know you process is reserved for new characters as it is in real life. The animation is sluggish in the first 12 episodes but they find their rhythm and style around this point. The character distinctiveness is rough in the start but as characters fulfill their roles their identities become clear.

Argevollen belongs to neither type, since its action is not cool and the war is boring. The cast is bland archetypes, the robots are all CGI, and you are never given any reason to care about who wins or who dies. And by the way, nobody important dies, not even amongst the secondary ones. What kind of a war is this?A pretty dull one, that’s the kind it is. It’s just done for natural resources with no political aspect to it. Why...would the audience care about such a trivial thing? Super robot series would have some megalomaniac bad guy who wants to take over the world. It’s cheesy but it’s fun. Real robots would expand to religion or humanism or something other than “we need more oil guys, let’s have a war.” That’s boring. And it doesn’t even feel like a war because it plays out like a cheesy fighting shonen, where the lead gets power ups and loses control a few times before going back to his happy-go-lucky bland archetype.Just compare Argevollen with the original Gundam. In both shows a rookie ends ups piloting the new overpowered robot and is sent to stop the invaders. The difference is, in Gundam you see civilians being under attack and the pilots rush to protect them, half of which get killed, with the other half freaking out from all the devastation. In Argevollen, you only see soldiers fighting in the front. They are just doing their job, and they are pretty peachy about it. Is this a war or a playground?We don’t even get much of a conflict since the plot is mostly stand alone skirmishes with a few sluggish bulky enemy units. The rest of it is slice of nothing happens amongst characters we are given no reason to care about. And they are all laughing and having a good time as if fighting for their lives is a game. They barely have any psychological pressure. It gets somewhat more interesting when the enemy levels up their mecha but even then there is no memorable villain. The only one who does something is a jerk and even he is completely bland and forgettable.Even the pretty colors are not pretty enough. The CGI is not rendered well, the explosions have no punch to them, and the characters look and talk in such generic ways you can confuse them with the cast from a hundred other series. There’s nothing special in the way the show presents itself.Even if for some reason you manage to finish this sorry excuse of a series, you won’t get any closure. The war is not over, they just have a short truce. The good guys leave on vacation as if nothing of importance happened throughout the whole series. You know, trivial stuff like half of them dying and the other half being scarred, or having a different perspective in life after all the mayhem they witnessed? Nothing happens, they are the exact same people as in the first episode. And that includes the romance which is constantly teased yet nothing comes out of it.Argevollen is a dud. It doesn’t excel at anything and despite that making it better than trainwrecks it fails to be remotely interesting at what it aimed for. You can’t even laugh with how ridiculous it is, therefore it’s not recommended, it’s a complete waste of time. would the audience care about such a trivial thing?

I absolutely loved it, the neat little combinations of military slice-of-life were well done and entertaining to watch. The numerous characters all had excellent proportions of screen time and were simply enjoyable to see how they interacted. The various emotions caused by war, fear and love were very well portrayed throughout the show in my opinion.Of course the art was incredible, and the fight scenes were very fun to watch, especially the Arge/Strum duels.And then the anime made a fatal mistake.The clincher, the reason this show wasn't a very fun 8/10 mecha anime (or possibly...higher) was that the producers fell for what I think is a plot destroying, but very tempting, trap. They swapped main characters. Unintentionally. Tokimune is the main character for most of the show, however around episode 16-18 ish the plot becomes 100% driven by his Squad Captain, Somonji... and that change in focus from the squad and the MC of the majority of the show throws the anime completely off the rails. If there is one thing in an anime that seriously irks me. It's when many episodes or worse, the key plot points of a story, are basically driven by one STUPID, MORONIC character... and that's effectively what happens in the conclusion of this anime.if this one flaw I've described however doesn't bother you, then I would highly recommend Argevellon as a fun, entertaining show that progresses pleasantly and will leave you with some decent hype moments (As a straight man, I can say that Argevellon looks super sexy at some points in this anime) but will also leave you with a smile. higher) was that the producers fell for what I think is a plot destroying, but very tempting, trap.

Taiyou no Ouji: Horus no Daibouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1044/Taiyou_no_Ouji__Horus_no_Daibouken,"[""Technically this film is leagues away from the quality of films later produced by Takahata and Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli. Still it's a great little film with more depth than is first apparent. It's a shame Takahata encountered such resistance and lack of backing from the studio when making this film. It could have been so much more. At one point still frames replace the animation becuase they ran over budget in production!  A landmark in anime nontheless. "", ""I saw this movie on a whim while I was looking for episodes of the live-action TV show &quot;Firefly&quot;, which I've been meaning to watch for years, and was pleasantly surprised. Horus/Hols:Prince of the Sun (localized under several other titles in other countries) has an amazing pedigree-directed by Isao Takahata , animation credits by the famous Hayao Miyazaki, among other famous names in Japanese animation, and is considered to be the first modern anime film, as it broke away from the typical Disney movie fare that they saw in anime.That being said, the movie still looks, feels, and sounds like Disney animated classic, which is...not a bad thing at all. While it's obviously a children's movie, it doesn't pull too many punches.  While both Hols and Arthur from the Disney movie &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; get their magic weapons in the same way, Prince of the Sun isn't all kids' stuff. The opening sequence is actually a pretty taut action sequence: Hols, the courageous Norse hero, defends himself from a pack of evil wolves with an axe on a rope. It's very well-choreographed and animated, but doesn't manage to be too violent, or gruesome in any way. Not only that, but the antagonist, Grunwald, wants to rule the world by killing off the human race, which has been forced into a tiny fishing village on a northern fjord. Some of the themes of the movie, like Socialism and xenophobia  might be lost on children too.Another Disney-like quality of Prince of the Sun is the music, it's damned great. The soundtrack has a beautiful and rousing score, and most of the background music follows the motif of the awesome main theme, which basically sings about how awesome Horus is. There's some more singing later on in the movie, but it's not obtrusive and fits the scenes rather well. You won't have to worry about a spontaneous dance number, but the singing that's there is rather beautiful, if mournful at times.And like any good Disney film, the movie looks gorgeous.  While they don't have the same detail as say, a modern Chibli movie, they're still very pretty, and make the movie even more worthwhile. According to the wikipedia, it was behind schedule, and over 30 minute of film had to be cut, and replaced with still images. It's a bit jarring to go from fluid-looking movement to still frames, but it doesn't happen too often, and the rest of the visuals make up for it. The characters have this soft, rounded look to them, but that doesn't make Horus look any less the hero, and some of the enemies he faces, like a giant fish monster with a death beam would probably be nightmare fuel for a little kid. Speaking of Horus, he makes the movie. He has the qualities of any good shonen hero, but with more resolve, and less stupidity.I'd say that even if you're not a fan of older anime, you'll be enchanted by Prince of the Sun. It made me feel all fuzzy and nostalgic inside, and I can easily see my younger self falling in love with it, and scrambling over the couches with a toy axe to imitate Horus' heroics. If I'm ever dumb enough to have children, I'll be certain to show them this film. It's a piece of anime history, and a great one at that. I totally recommend it. not a bad thing at all.

You have nothing to be afraid of""(NOTE: Source for history and background: http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/otherfilms/)When modern anime connoisseurs make their own lists of the most influential anime classics, they miss the name of Horus: Prince of the Sun. This one movie was groundbreaking in many ways. At the time it was released in 1968, animation projects were led more by the parochial philosophy of production companies wanting to market safe animations for as wide an audience as possible. Although Hols could not completely break free from the reins of the production company, it was one of the first...instances where the artists attempted to wrest control and create something that was a step above what the industry was doing at that time.Horus (or Hols) was the first major project for Ghibli co-founders and anime legends Takahata Isao (Director) (Grave of the Fireflies), Hayao Miyazaki (Concept Artist and Scene Design) and their mentor and colleague, Yasuo Ohtsuka (Animation director) of the Lupin III fame, among others. It is an important milestone in anime history, and not just because it launched the careers of Takahata and Miyazaki. Although the immediate impact of the movie was negligible, the long-term results were many and far-reaching. Hols was the first major anime to break free from the ‘animation-for-kids’ Disney mindset that was accepted as the norm at that time, and inspired as well as influenced a whole generation of artists and auteurs. After this movie, the industry gradually shifted away from the producer-centric trend to an approach where the artists would have more freedom and say. The change was slow, but the seeds were sown with Hols. For that reason, this movie is considered as the first modern anime by many anime history buffs and critics.Hols was a project marred with difficulties throughout its production period; many Toei Doga artists were embroiled in a union tussle with the company and management, and the fallout resulted in numerous problems and disagreements between the management and the team of artists. The paltry budget was not enough to satisfy the movie’s ambitions, and it took three years to complete the movie when its schedule was only 8 months. Toei refused to grant the budget to complete two action sequences and decided to pull the plug soon after release, and kept the movie in the theatres for only 10 days; the movie bombed at the box office, but was a hit with the critics, students and aspiring artists who had not seen anything like it before. Many who worked on the project were singled out by the company and ostracized, including director Takahata Isao who was demoted and was never allowed to direct a project for Toei again.Hols may be garbed in Scandinavian and East European culture, but it is in fact based on a puppet-theater drama written by script writer Kazuo Fuzakawa, which in turn is based on the ancient legend of aborigines of North japan. The producers at Toei Doga company changed the setting to make it more acceptable internationally, especially to the western audience, and they attempted to tone down the content to make it more ‘safe’ for the intended audience (i.e. children), but the young,and rebellious team of artists made sure that the management would not succeed completely in that endeavour.The movie’s concept of a chosen hero and the fight between good and evil was in vogue back in the late 60’s, and had not yet become a cliche. Yet the film was ahead of its time in handling the concept, because it not just explored the external concept of the struggle, but also the internal psychological aspect of it. It does this by exposing the depth of cruelty and deceptiveness that even the most well-meaning human beings can fall to, and how xenophobia and fickle-mindedness can degenerate and lead astray even the most amiable and harmonious of people.This psychological phenomenon is best represented in Hilda, the lone survivor of a massacre, and the movie’s tragic female lead. Her schizophrenic, inner psychological and moral conflicts throughout the story is perhaps the most striking part of the movie, and the one thing that probably stands out the most after the credits stop rolling. The sheer depth of her character overshadows even the protagonist, Hols, and the villain, Gruinwald, and sets Hilda apart from all the ‘heroines’ of not just her own time, but many female leads of today as well. Miyazaki himself acknowledged the character as a breakthrough, and some believe that it influenced his female characters.There is more to Hols than meets the eye. Despite its outer simplicity and kid friendly tone, Its treatment of such themes as Good and Evil, morality, unity among people, psychological realism etc is such that can only be appreciated by greater minds.The importance of community and rebellion against authority are also among the recurrent themes of the movie, poignantly reflecting the disagreements between the Toei team artists and workers against the company.However, a warning is due for modern viewers. In all its aspects, whether it be animation, sound, story, direction or pacing, Hols reflects the sensibilities of its times, even if it is superior to most animation projects of that period. This one is mostly for old school fans, or for fans of early Takahata/Miyazaki movies. Age may not have been kind to Hols, but it is so far ahead of its time that more informed viewers would be surprised that this movie was made in 1968 in spite of the production woes and a low budget. instances where the artists attempted to wrest control and create something that was a step above what the industry was doing at that time.Horus (or Hols) was the first major project for Ghibli co-founders and anime legends Takahata Isao (Director) (Grave of the Fireflies), Hayao Miyazaki (Concept Artist and Scene Design) and their mentor and colleague, Yasuo Ohtsuka (Animation director) of the Lupin III fame, among others.

After this movie, the industry gradually shifted away from the producer-centric trend to an approach where the artists would have more freedom and say. The change was slow, but the seeds were sown with Hols. For that reason, this movie is considered as the first modern anime by many anime history buffs and critics.Hols was a project marred with difficulties throughout its production period; many Toei Doga artists were embroiled in a union tussle with the company and management, and the fallout resulted in numerous problems and disagreements between the management and the team of artists. The paltry budget was not enough to satisfy the movie’s ambitions, and it took three years to complete the movie when its schedule was only 8 months. Toei refused to grant the budget to complete two action sequences and decided to pull the plug soon after release, and kept the movie in the theatres for only 10 days; the movie bombed at the box office, but was a hit with the critics, students and aspiring artists who had not seen anything like it before. Many who worked on the project were singled out by the company and ostracized, including director Takahata Isao who was demoted and was never allowed to direct a project for Toei again.Hols may be garbed in Scandinavian and East European culture, but it is in fact based on a puppet-theater drama written by script writer Kazuo Fuzakawa, which in turn is based on the ancient legend of aborigines of North japan. The producers at Toei Doga company changed the setting to make it more acceptable internationally, especially to the western audience, and they attempted to tone down the content to make it more ‘safe’ for the intended audience (i.e. children), but the young,and rebellious team of artists made sure that the management would not succeed completely in that endeavour.The movie’s concept of a chosen hero and the fight between good and evil was in vogue back in the late 60’s, and had not yet become a cliche. Yet the film was ahead of its time in handling the concept, because it not just explored the external concept of the struggle, but also the internal psychological aspect of it. It does this by exposing the depth of cruelty and deceptiveness that even the most well-meaning human beings can fall to, and how xenophobia and fickle-mindedness can degenerate and lead astray even the most amiable and harmonious of people.This psychological phenomenon is best represented in Hilda, the lone survivor of a massacre, and the movie’s tragic female lead. Her schizophrenic, inner psychological and moral conflicts throughout the story is perhaps the most striking part of the movie, and the one thing that probably stands out the most after the credits stop rolling. The sheer depth of her character overshadows even the protagonist, Hols, and the villain, Gruinwald, and sets Hilda apart from all the ‘heroines’ of not just her own time, but many female leads of today as well. Miyazaki himself acknowledged the character as a breakthrough, and some believe that it influenced his female characters.There is more to Hols than meets the eye. Despite its outer simplicity and kid friendly tone, Its treatment of such themes as Good and Evil, morality, unity among people, psychological realism etc is such that can only be appreciated by greater minds.The importance of community and rebellion against authority are also among the recurrent themes of the movie, poignantly reflecting the disagreements between the Toei team artists and workers against the company.However, a warning is due for modern viewers. In all its aspects, whether it be animation, sound, story, direction or pacing, Hols reflects the sensibilities of its times, even if it is superior to most animation projects of that period. This one is mostly for old school fans, or for fans of early Takahata/Miyazaki movies. Age may not have been kind to Hols, but it is so far ahead of its time that more informed viewers would be surprised that this movie was made in 1968 in spite of the production woes and a low budget.', ""This was a rather pleasant surprise, honestly. 'Horus/Hols' may not be the most elegant film, but it is certainly a testament to the sheer amount of talent found within the development team. With surprisingly fleshed-out characters and plotlines, accompanied by pretty competent artwork + sound, this relic will be sure to last in your mind for a bit.[Story - 7]The first 10-or-so minutes are pretty basic, admittedly: boy finds sword, is told of a demon, then is sent off to kill it after his father dies. After that, however, it takes a turn: he's almost immediately defeated by the demon, and is informally saved +...adopted by a village by the river. Here, he makes a little home for himself after slaying some beasts and whatnot.Still sounds tame? I don't blame you, it definitely feels like that. However, then comes the second half of the movie: While out on a hunt, our protagonist Horus encounters a mysterious girl named Hilda. At first, she just seems like a plain love interest who can sing and whatnot, but she is soon revealed to be something of an anti-villain.After subtle sabotage that causes a storm to blow over, Horus finds his resolve and goes off to slay the demon. And, of course, he does and there is a happy ending. However, the road leading to it is teeming with themes of struggling with social dynamics, against fate, and with your own desires. It's pretty solid for a kids' movie, especially from the late 60's.[Art - 8]The art is also rather intriguing, and probably the reason most of you will go and watch this. It might not have aged as well in terms of animation (there's one notable action sequence where it's a minute of freeze frames), but everything else remains timeless. The colour palette is mostly based in 'nature'-types, while the character design gravitates more towards an earthy-type of tone. The setting is also pretty convincing as a 'nordic'-type of fantasy world. The animation isn't even that bad save for that sequence: for the most part, every action is pretty fluid, and some (not all) of the lip syncing is on point. Truly impressive to see.[Sound - 8]The audiowork is also rather competent. The music can be rather melodramatic and Disney-esque at times, but it does the job well. I especially liked the 'village songs', as they really do suit the vibe that those scenes were going for. The SFX are also rather well-timed and consistent, and I failed to notice any noticeable mistakes. The voice-acting is pretty solid - while Horus sounds like a stereotypical shonen protagonist, Hilda has a rather haunting voice (both in song and speech). Grunwald and Drago sound like standard villains, but I'll let it pass since they didn't get a lot of screentime.[Character - 7]Definitely the most surprising aspect of the film. It might not be the precursor to 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' or whatever, but for what it represented during its time, the characterization is great. Horus is certainly not a deep character, or even /that/ interesting, but he does somewhat serve as the audience's proxy during the film: we share in his feelings and reactions to the plot twists, and to a noted degree. Grunwald and Drago are rather flat characters, but I can see how they helped influence the succeeding generations' villains: cunning, but ultimately lonely due to the weight of their power.The most iconic character, however, is the previously-mentioned Hilda. She's astonishingly well-written: as she struggles a lot with her own will to live, her want to socialize normally, her relationship with the antagonists, and so on/forth, you can see her breakdown happen over the course of the film. Of course, her betrayal of Horus is what pushes her the farthest into this, and even towards the end of the film, it influences her every action. Her fate at the end may not please everyone, but I found it rather heartwarming.[Enjoyment/Overall - 8]Ultimately, this was pretty fun. May not be the most polished thing, of course, but I'll blame that on the time period and standards of that period. Otherwise, it's a stellar movie that both children and adults can enjoy. I would recommend this to anyone, ESPECIALLY Miyazaki groupies. adopted by a village by the river. Here, he makes a little home for himself after slaying some beasts and whatnot.Still sounds tame?

You follow a young over-powered boy as he goes on a journey to defeat a big enemy terrorising the world - you know the deal.Even for the time, this art style was not great.

I give them credit for a movie of that time period because it REALLY look like anime was just starting to make aname for itself and the few elements that hold it back are a product of that era in animation and story telling.As far as classic anime goes, it wasn't that bad. The chorus of people every few minutes got terribly annoying and some of the character were bland but the story had a very classic theme to it; slay the demon, save the maiden, win the hearts of the...people. None of that was easy considering the only weapon that could slay the demon was unusable until about the third act. Also, the maiden not only had to be saved from the demon but also herself as she's feeling the evil in her own heart growing and it tore her between clinging to life and clinging to her humanity. And finally, as Horus was a newcomer to the village, he not only had to earn their trust (especially against a power-hungry man of the village) but also prove that they were in danger as he was the only one who could see it.Where the characters were uninteresting, the story somewhat made up for it.

At the time most Japanese animated features were made cheaply and quickly. But Takahata wanted to go one step further and create something elaborate and beautiful. It drove up the budget, to the point where it annoyed the Toei executives. At one point during production, the budget froze and so the animators were reduced to using still shots for certain scenes, such as a wolves attacking on a village...at about 29 minutes in, and later, when rats stampede through the same village. For similar reasons, the film was only given a limited release in Japan and it received poor box office numbers, even though the critics greeted it with raves. To add insult to injury, Takahata was demoted and never directed another feature for Toei again. Sometime later, Takahata and Miyazaki left Toei to find work elsewhere.Watching this animated film today you probably wouldn't even realize that any of this happened, but it did. The animation style is obviously 60's, but it has a lovely, rich palette. It's not quite as gorgeous as the Studio Ghibli classics we've come to know, but nonetheless it is lovely.HORUS starts out with an intense action scene in an unknown Scandanevian region in which we see our hero, a boy warrior named Horus (Hols in the dubbed version) battling a pack of silver wolves with only a hatchet as a weapon. In a quick twist not all that different from King Arthur, the tide turns in his favor when he draws a sword from a massive rock giant who appears out of nowhere. After this victorious fight, Horus returns home to his father, who dies after telling him about his village being razed by the evil Ice Lord Grunwald. Vowing to avenge his village, Horus sets off and eventually comes across a village of innocents. En route, he also encounters Hilda, a golden-voiced girl who sings songs on her harp. Unfortunately, she turns out not to be as nice and innocent as she seems, setting the stage for a potential showdown.The story contains many plot elements that Miyazaki would later use in his subsequent films, but in terms of character development, I'm afraid HORUS comes up a bit short. Horus himself isn't all that interesting, and neither are his companions. Even the villainous Lord Grunwald is pretty much what you'd expect from a manipulative, scheming, power-hungry baddie. Perhaps the most interesting character is Hilda, who is presented as a conflicted character torn between her friendship with the hero and the temptations of the villain. But her redemption at the end feels a bit rushed. Perhaps part of that can be attributed to the running time of 82 minutes; although it results for a faster pace, it does cause for some character bits that seem a bit hasty.Despite being a financial failure in Japan, HORUS: PRINCE OF THE SUN has attracted considerable attention from viewers both in Japan and even in the U.S.. Bizarrely, the film was shown on American television in the late 60's, renamed LITTLE NORSE PRINCE, although uncut. The dub was done by Fred Ladd's New York-based Titan Productions , so a lot of the voice talent will be reminiscent of shows around this period such as KIMBA THE WHITE LION and ASTRO BOY. They also dubbed THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF PUSS 'N BOOTS and ANIMAL TREASURE ISLAND. As such, the dub is occasionally campy and theatrically stylized, using only four actors(!). Because this was done in the age of reel-to-reel, there are obvious places where the actors struggle to match the mouth movements, and some stiff delivery. Truth be told, the dub is not so awful that it ruins the film, but it is mediocre by today's standards. (It should also be noted that Hilda's songs come across differently in the Japanese version, the English versions are noticeably dissimilar.)Despite its flaws, though, HORUS is still fascinating look at historical Japanese anime.

She is Hinano, a tree spirit who possessed the body of a wooden puppet after Cacao messed up his magic teacher\'s spell. Having taken an instant liking to Cacao, Hinano enrolls in his school. Between Hinano, monsters, two strange twins and their four-eyed cat master, a demon boy, odd teachers and students, and the fact that he may have the potential to be one of the greatest magic users of all time, Cacao\'s life seems to have taken several turns for the worse...and the weird. Meanwhile, the city is being threatened by alien monsters which take the form of trading cards that are packaged into chocolate bars. They show up at random times for the school defense force S.M.A.T. to battle and ... ahhh I give up!Storyline: [7/10]Trouble Chocolate series features Cacao, a student at Micro-Grand Academy studying magic. One day, while his magic class teacher, Ghana, is performing a spell to summon a tree spirit, Cacao finds and eats some chocolate, which turns out to be 200 year old magical chocolate. After eating the chocolate he becomes drunk and causes a wreck. During this, he interferes with Ghana\'s spell, letting the spirit, Hinano, escape. She inhabits the body of a marionette, who then moves in with Cacao.Subsequent episodes of Trouble Chocolate have little connected storyline. Maybe in the last 2 or 3 episode they back into storyline but rather than that, the show itself is a gag-parody of other anime. For example, two other characters, Murakata and Deborah, are constantly shown professing their love to each other, set to absurdly explosive special effects and backdrops, as is common (to a lesser extent) in many anime. According to what I heard and read, ToroChoco is a funny blend of Urusei Yatsura and Saber Marionette J but in the end, I can’t even see where the blend is. This anime tried to blend the element of trading card collectible which is probably in that year is popular, magic and sorcery like Harry Potter, sci-fi robot like Terminator and super sentai like Power Ranger show, and supernatural love comedy like Twilight movie (maybe not exactly like that but Bella loves The Vampire Edward and Living Tree Fairy Marrionette loves Cacao, got the catch!) resulting the weird comedy-gag combination ever.Art: [7/10]The animation is average for modern TV anime, with crisp computer coloring and animation. The character designs are cute and appealing, and would make for some great cosplay. However, pretty packaging can\'t cover up the fact that the rest of the show is lackluster.While the show was released back in 1999, this anime looks as good as recent titles. The colors were vibrant and fit well with the overall tone of the show. The picture was sharp and provided some great detail for the characters and backgrounds.Sound: [7/10]The background music sounds like the piano riff from ""Daydream Believer"" played over and over again. The opening is stock J-pop, and not worth mentioning except to make fun of the way they spell \'Choco\' (shi-ecchi-oh-shi-oh!). I found it the opening music is amusing and funny but clearly not the one you hear over and over again. The first ending, Ne, Nande... by Yoshizawa Rie is so-so and the second ending, Anata ni Aitakute ~Missing You~ (Millennium Dance version) by Sakura Tange and Kyoko Hikami is so techno remix, I really like that. Try to hear it, it’s fun.Character: [7/10]MOST of the characters was named after plant or food, like Almond, Cacao, Guana, Ham-Ham, Mackerel, Papaya, Sardine, Truffle and Wheat. ALL of the characters are simply hollow archetypes of anime (and non-anime) icons. Cacao is a tame wannabe Carrot Glace (Sorcerer Hunters), Hinano is a catchphrase-dropping wannabe Lime (Saber Marionette J), Professor Guana/Ganache is a surfer dude wannabe Gilderoy Lockheart (Harry Potter), and Truffle is a wishy-washy wannabe Mendou Shuutarou (Urusei Yatsura). The ONLY original character in this whole mess is Professor Big Bang, the bipolar transsexual Frankenstein monster. (Which in and of itself is a great big WHAT THE HELL!?!) In the end, ALL of the characters can make you laugh and I really give both the Japanese-language cast and the English-language cast a credit because they success delivering the jokes through out all episodes.Enjoyment: [8/10]Most of the gags and parodies were recognizable but were just not that funny. There were a few bright spots most notably the giant lucky kitty statue that attacks the school. Matcha and Azuki desperately want to be idols, but they lack any semblance of talent. After each of their acting scenes, a cold wind freezes everything in sight.In the last 3 episode showed me what this series could have been. It drew me into the story and made me care about the characters. It was engaging and finally made the romance between Cacao and Hinano believable. The writers really found their stride with this episode. I really enjoy this anime and whenever I watch this anime, I can always laugh and that was all that matter. This anime isn’t great anime but isn’t worse either.Overall: [7,5/10]Trouble Chocolate is not the worst anime I\'ve ever seen–I didn\'t totally hate it. I have seen far, far worse anime. But it is also nowhere near as good as I was led to believe. Originally released in 1999/2000, Trouble Chocolate is a good recent show that looks to be one of the ones that was going completely digital and not quite mastering it all that well. The show has a lot of bright colors, almost too bright in many instances, but they all retain a good solid feel here.Personal message and opinion:I can’t say much about this anime but I grew up with this anime. I was about 10 years old when this anime aired in my nation TV channel. For short, this anime really something for me. Trouble Chocolate has been very popular on the fansub circuit for a long time, and I\'ve heard nothing but good things about it. This anime has a hard time deciding what audience it is trying to target because they trying to blend together elements from so many genres yet not quite finding the right mix. But once you watch this anime, you’ll always remember this anime.Well, the fact that this anime was quite popular in overseas in United States by given a good score and professional comedy writer, Pamela Ribon actually helped with English dubbed Trouble Chocolate makes this anime somewhat interesting.

The first ending, Ne, Nande... by Yoshizawa Rie is so-so and the second ending, Anata ni Aitakute ~Missing You~ (Millennium Dance version) by Sakura Tange and Kyoko Hikami is so techno remix, I really like that. Try to hear it, it’s fun.Character: [7/10]MOST of the characters was named after plant or food, like Almond, Cacao, Guana, Ham-Ham, Mackerel, Papaya, Sardine, Truffle and Wheat. ALL of the characters are simply hollow archetypes of anime (and non-anime) icons. Cacao is a tame wannabe Carrot Glace (Sorcerer Hunters), Hinano is a catchphrase-dropping wannabe Lime (Saber Marionette J), Professor Guana/Ganache is a surfer dude wannabe Gilderoy Lockheart (Harry Potter), and Truffle is a wishy-washy wannabe Mendou Shuutarou (Urusei Yatsura). The ONLY original character in this whole mess is Professor Big Bang, the bipolar transsexual Frankenstein monster. (Which in and of itself is a great big WHAT THE HELL!?!) In the end, ALL of the characters can make you laugh and I really give both the Japanese-language cast and the English-language cast a credit because they success delivering the jokes through out all episodes.Enjoyment: [8/10]Most of the gags and parodies were recognizable but were just not that funny. There were a few bright spots most notably the giant lucky kitty statue that attacks the school. Matcha and Azuki desperately want to be idols, but they lack any semblance of talent. After each of their acting scenes, a cold wind freezes everything in sight.In the last 3 episode showed me what this series could have been. It drew me into the story and made me care about the characters. It was engaging and finally made the romance between Cacao and Hinano believable. The writers really found their stride with this episode. I really enjoy this anime and whenever I watch this anime, I can always laugh and that was all that matter. This anime isn’t great anime but isn’t worse either.Overall: [7,5/10]Trouble Chocolate is not the worst anime I\'ve ever seen–I didn\'t totally hate it. I have seen far, far worse anime. But it is also nowhere near as good as I was led to believe. Originally released in 1999/2000, Trouble Chocolate is a good recent show that looks to be one of the ones that was going completely digital and not quite mastering it all that well. The show has a lot of bright colors, almost too bright in many instances, but they all retain a good solid feel here.Personal message and opinion:I can’t say much about this anime but I grew up with this anime. I was about 10 years old when this anime aired in my nation TV channel. For short, this anime really something for me. Trouble Chocolate has been very popular on the fansub circuit for a long time, and I\'ve heard nothing but good things about it. This anime has a hard time deciding what audience it is trying to target because they trying to blend together elements from so many genres yet not quite finding the right mix. But once you watch this anime, you’ll always remember this anime.Well, the fact that this anime was quite popular in overseas in United States by given a good score and professional comedy writer, Pamela Ribon actually helped with English dubbed Trouble Chocolate makes this anime somewhat interesting.', ""Trouble Chocolate, is a little obscure for some people, but the good part about it is the fact it's what Rosario+Vampire's anime should've been like.Well the good news is, it's not a harem anime. The bad news is, it's obscure because it's a parody of other anime. Why is it bad? Not that many people would get it. No problems though, if you like comedy like me (unfortunately some don't) and have at least some experience in the comedy genre, I'll tell you now that Pamela Ribon, a professional comedy writer, helped write down the English Dub's script.I only watch 4 episodes of it,...and so far it's plot is in the Zatch Bell level (sadly...), and I am hungry for more. and so far it's plot is in the Zatch Bell level (sadly...), and I am hungry for more."", 'Trouble Chocolate is one of the few animes I have completed after only watching the English Dub version and I have to say it was a unique series that had some vibes from Urusei Yatsura.Story: 6/10The story follows a magician-in-training, Cacao, who wakes up one day to find a beautiful girl sleeping next to him. He freaks out and she wakes up, introducing herself as Hinano, a marionette. The show basically follows the two and their friends dealing with various problems that arise in every episode that are loosely related but somehow they all fall into full circle, all while Hinano tries to win...Cacao\'s love while Cacao isn\'t interested and obsesses over another thing (Sounds familiar?).Art: 7/10The art was pretty good considering that it was relatively ahead of its time before it became modern and the character designs are pretty eccentric enough to make cosplays out of them. They all looked nice and it fit well with their individual personalities.Sound: 7/10The OP is pretty catchy, especially with the way the singer says Chocolate. The EDs are really nice, with the first one having a slow, almost in a remembering type of song while the 2nd ED is fast-paced and is done to the style of Para Para. The show constantly uses a tropical-themed version of the OP throughout the episode which is pretty catch for my tastes.Character: 6/10The characters all pretty much named after a food or plant, and they pretty much follow a typical trope in anime: Cacao is a big eater who somehow gets drunk on chocolate all while ignoring Hinano\'s romantic advances, Hinano is the ""magical girl"" who loves Cacao despite his rejections, Deborah and Murakata are the romantic couple who go head-over-heels for each other, Truffle is the spoiled rich guy trying to win the attention of Hinano, and there are other characters who stereotype some other anime tropes.Enjoyment: 7/10The show is pretty much filled with cheesy moments that made me groan, but at the same time smile for how silly the jokes and scenes are. It wasn\'t necessarily funny, but it wasn\'t boring. It just made me smile for its silly scenes, where, as an example, one of the ""villains"" and their sidekick is too silly that you can\'t take them seriously.Overall: 7/10This is one of the series that I had fun watching, but it wasn\'t the best thing I\'ve ever seen. I recommend this if you have nothing to watch or you just want something silly to watch. As I said, I see this as a loose parody of Urusei Yatsura, and boy did it try to parody it.

The setting revoles around the theme of chocolate and food. Even the names of characters are certain foods. Characters are not unique, but are characterizations of stereotypical anime characters from 90s. For example, you have two lovestruck characters that their sole role in this anime is being in love with eachother, while the main character always saves the other main character in a pinch.If I were to...sum up the entire storyline without giving context, it would be like this: Someone invades the school, some student council looking people step in and ultimately fail, our main character gets power-up, the girl shouts his name, yadiyadiyada. You know how they say ""it\'s so bad that it\'s actually good""? yeah, this anime is actually one of those.If you like gintama type or no context animes, should probably give it a try.Oh, if you are interested, here\'s what character types you\'ll find in this anime; although if you think getting to know characters is a spoiler, don\'t read the following:a reckless male MCa magical girl deuteragonist that only says ""you\'re welcome"" (you\'ll get used to it)tasmanian devil kid from bugs bunnytwo chinese looking idol wannabe girls and their masterthe shopkeeper little dudeultra rich robot and weapons system boy with a katanaa frankenstein, a vampire, and a magician teacher (3 of them)two lovestruck pair with their ""protect the school"" team (which includes Hieda no Akyuu from Touhou)a secret evil organisation girl and his crime partner sum up the entire storyline without giving context, it would be like this: Someone invades the school, some student council looking people step in and ultimately fail, our main character gets power-up, the girl shouts his name, yadiyadiyada.

Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuushabu Shozoku 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35473/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuushabu_Shozoku_3,"['Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuushabu Shozoku is basically the Omake version of the great series Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru. There are three eight minute films and I\'ll be looking at all of them as a collective rather than individually.Story:We open with Yuuna giving her lunch to a pair of fighting cats. I hope it has lots of meat since cats can\'t survive on a vegetarian diet. Afterwards she meets up with the hero club to go help different people in whacky ways.The biggest problem with the films is that they overdo it with some of the jokes. Yuuna spends way too...much time in the first one with her stomach growling as a joke, for example. The films are also a little odd in terms of tone given how dark the series proper can be.That being said, they are fairly entertaining and they do deliver a decent amount of fun. And even if some of the jokes go on a bit too long or are kind of weak, most of them work well enough.Characters:The characters don\'t have the level of depth that they do in the series proper. Rather, they\'re simplified and their more comedic traits are amplified. Which makes sense given the aesthetic they\'re going for but it is a bit weird seeing these characters taken in a comedic direction given what I remember from the series.Art:The art direction is a simplistic, chibified style. It looks fine for what it is but it\'s not exactly a style I would consider particularly appealing. The backgrounds are very minimal and the characters look a bit like bobble headed versions.Sound:The actors do a good job. Terui Haruka, Mimori Suzuka, Nagatsuma Juri, Uchiyama Yumi & Kurosawa Tomoyo are all strong actors. Their performances aren\'t as good in this as they were in the series proper on account of the simplified characterisation but they\'re still strong. The music is okay.Ho-yay:There\'s still a bit. Yuuna and Tougou are still implied to have a mutual attraction. Yuuna also flirts a bit with both Karin & Itsuki.Areas of Improvement:1. More rapid fire humour would probably work better for this type of thing. I think they do drag their ""big"" jokes out a bit too much and they\'d benefit from faster set up, quick payoff and moving on to the next joke.2. These could use some dark humour. In my personal opinion, the darker elements of the series itself could have been used for some great morbid jokes.3. They could have gone closer to the art style of the regular series and come out with something that looks much better.Final Thoughts:These are okay. They aren\'t brilliant and the comedy isn\'t among the best I\'ve ever seen, but if you really liked the main series, you might enjoy them well enough.

Well for me was a lot of free time and a open mind . Yes , these wore my reasons for watching Z/X IGNITION .Yes , yes , i forgot to...add the pros of this anime .Good animation , the fights were really well done , the action scenes were fluid , only a nice budget could provide that .The OST was there , but I am the type that rarely pays any attention to this , so I will skip this and let other people decide in this regard .In regard of the voice acting one could only bring words of praise , the seiyuus made a wonderful job , every one of them matched the character especially the MC , nice to hear Kansai-Ben from time to time .Now for the last part and the reason as to why I gave this a 6 . The most important reason is the potential that this anime has , I tend and want to believe that this season is just the launching pad , they only presented the characters and just a part of the story and left us with a big ass cliffhanger .In the end I can say that I enjoyed watching this and with all due respect I belive that Z/X IGNITION deserves more than just a 1 ( appalling ) or 6 ( fine ) . If a second season will be aired , then this show will get a bigger score on MAL , if not , then that’s what it was worth .One last thing , some of you are wondering if there will be another season , well there is just a single answer to that , Infinite Stratos 2 , and with this I will end my review .Thanks for reading . add the pros of this anime .Good animation , the fights were really well done , the action scenes were fluid , only a nice budget could provide that .The OST was there , but I am the type that rarely pays any attention to this , so I will skip this and let other people decide in this regard .In regard of the voice acting one could only bring words of praise , the seiyuus made a wonderful job , every one of them matched the character especially the MC , nice to hear Kansai-Ben from time to time .Now for the last part and the reason as to why I gave this a 6 .

Although is a game based anime, and I've had some bad experiences with anime like that, this one was pretty good.Story 8/10: The story parts form a point where the characters have already developed certain relationships between them and their Z/X so I thought it was gonna get confused, since most game based anime are like that and don't explain more of the back story of the characters. But this was different since after 1 episode you can see the back story of all the characters and understand the whole story.Art...7/10: Although I've seen better graphics in lots of anime I don't think this was bad at all. I like the battle animation and the characters too.Sound 7/10: I don't really pay a lot of attention to sound unless it's pretty bad. This was not the case. It was good and I even enjoyed the OP and ED.Character 9/10: I like every character. I didn't found any of them annoying. And the fact that they put some hot girls is a plus. You can even see some fan service, although still censored.Enjoyment 9/10: Like I said before I really enjoyed watching this anime. I never got bored and I found every single episode great.I hope to see a second season.Oh and if anyone think I over rated the anime, well then it's you own opinion.

Azumi is your shy sick type who has a crush on Asuka but other than her backstory/character focused episode that more focuses on her Z/X Rigel voiced by Aya Uchida, she\'s still one of the more likable characters in the cast due to her typing. Ayase Kamiyugi is one of the more active characters in the anime, with her out for revenge and nearly causing a genocide of a certain Z/X kind makes her kind of a anti-hero type, but with her having some significance towards the plot and her backstory being one of the more interesting things in the anime, Ayase was quite honestly LA\'s favourite character in the anime, though she had competition with Aina. Now LA might give Ayase LA\'s favourite character status but Aina had significance in the plot and had another interesting plotline in the entire anime mainly due to once she gets into proper focus she has a hand in the major plotline throughout the entire anime and to be honest LA can see Aina\'s early insignificance as ""the childhood friend"" a take on her stereotype but worked for better or worse once she took up focus through the latter half of the anime.The thing is LA REALLY liked Aina in the early episodes due to her insignificance towards Asuka and was hoping for to be in the plot as she was locked out of the loop concerning Z/X\'s BUT LA was torn by her significance in the plot as she was lead into ""the dark side"" which brings in some of her hatred of Z/X\'s which brought a bad taste in LA\'s mouth as it progressed BUT it brought her into focus for once and thankfully she gets better.Unfortunately in the minor character department, LA will say this, they too get character development in the form of their own character focused episodes like Mikado Kurosaki, Chitose Aoba and Sera Kurosaki. The problem?, the anime already setup major plotlines and sure the main cast see what these minor characters are here for, but developing these characters for LA had a double edged sword to it, as sure knowing these characters are fine, but at the cost of CONSTANTLY delaying the major plotline focusing on Aina and the main cast, THAT is became a HUGE annoyance to LA in the latter half and with that the only three characters that mattered by the end of it were Ayase, Aina and Asuka.In terms of Z/X: Ignition in portraying the collectible card game.....this adaptation gave VERY little in terms of what the game is actually is about instead focusing on the sweeping battles and characters instead and LA knows other collectible card games have done something similar in terms of it\'s focus (see Selector infected series) however Z/X: Ignition does the bare minimum of what the card game is in real life and only gave some of the rules that ONLY suited the more ""serious"" plot whenever it could because they could.In terms of animation by Telecom Animation Film, the animation for the most part was average at best giving typical character designs and though the Z/X\'s designs are ""interesting"" they didn\'t do much to strike at LA to like the animation and LA was indifferent for it\'s animation for the most part. Z/X: Ignition also has a weird tendency to give fanservicey moments in some of the weirdest to projected moments that kinda ruined some of the moments when it CLEARLY didn\'t need it.For voice acting, well LA will say the voice acting is probably the most interesting thing with some stereotypical casting here and there like Hiro Shimono, M.A.O, Miyuki Sawashiro and Maaya Uchida. However the voice casting was great for the most part with some interesting roles ESPECIALLY with Satomi Satou voicing Gambriel who is a psychotic angel, however LA\'s MVP would actually go to Yurika Endou who voiced Aina as she did a rather great job in portraying her character (not to mention her vocal and dramatic range was surprising for a voice actor who currently has done less than 10 roles).Z/X: Ignition is at for LA mediocre in terms of what it was trying to do, as it sacrificed what the collectible game is actually about for a more serious character-focused plot and when it especially concerned Aina, LA was torn but by the end of it, Aina\'s involvement was interesting and probably the most interesting thing in the plot and it was the MAJOR focus of the anime as a whole. The minor character development for LA was fillery and only to delay the major focus but it was ""ok"" to know the characters in question in the process and the anime wanted it to be ""the finale"". Every time LA has something bad to say about Z/X: Ignition, Z/X: Ignition has a silver lining almost every time and because of this Z/X: Ignition is just mediocre and that is fine, it tried to make a story with original characters in the worlds of Z/X\'s and develop it\'s characters sure it wasn\'t focusing on the game itself but it terms of advertising the game LA had an inkling of what the game was about but LA wasn\'t gonna play or buy any of it\'s cards any time soon after finishing watching the anime.LA will interested in what the sequel Z/X: Code Reunion that was announced and will premiere in Fall of 2019 will do to expand and maybe give more development to the game instead of it\'s characters this time, not to mention Z/X: Ignition left a few plotlines dangling left over but LA isn\'t holding LA\'s breath to see it fulfilled let alone LA\'s desires for this anime to be patched up anytime soon by the looks of it.Adaptation-wise LA knew what Z/X: Ignition was trying to do with all it\'s strengths and flaws both helping each other and by the end of it it left LA with a.....Meh... incident or other Z/X\'s in the process of this anime.Asuka is your typical dense main male protagonist who is actually genki when it comes to ""being a hero"" but dense in the romance department, however he really doesn\'t have a backstory due to nearly the entire cast gravitating towards him with their backstories being fleshed out instead of Asuka.

Z/X: Ignition also has a weird tendency to give fanservicey moments in some of the weirdest to projected moments that kinda ruined some of the moments when it CLEARLY didn\'t need it.For voice acting, well LA will say the voice acting is probably the most interesting thing with some stereotypical casting here and there like Hiro Shimono, M.A.O, Miyuki Sawashiro and Maaya Uchida. However the voice casting was great for the most part with some interesting roles ESPECIALLY with Satomi Satou voicing Gambriel who is a psychotic angel, however LA\'s MVP would actually go to Yurika Endou who voiced Aina as she did a rather great job in portraying her character (not to mention her vocal and dramatic range was surprising for a voice actor who currently has done less than 10 roles).Z/X: Ignition is at for LA mediocre in terms of what it was trying to do, as it sacrificed what the collectible game is actually about for a more serious character-focused plot and when it especially concerned Aina, LA was torn but by the end of it, Aina\'s involvement was interesting and probably the most interesting thing in the plot and it was the MAJOR focus of the anime as a whole. The minor character development for LA was fillery and only to delay the major focus but it was ""ok"" to know the characters in question in the process and the anime wanted it to be ""the finale"". Every time LA has something bad to say about Z/X: Ignition, Z/X: Ignition has a silver lining almost every time and because of this Z/X: Ignition is just mediocre and that is fine, it tried to make a story with original characters in the worlds of Z/X\'s and develop it\'s characters sure it wasn\'t focusing on the game itself but it terms of advertising the game LA had an inkling of what the game was about but LA wasn\'t gonna play or buy any of it\'s cards any time soon after finishing watching the anime.LA will interested in what the sequel Z/X: Code Reunion that was announced and will premiere in Fall of 2019 will do to expand and maybe give more development to the game instead of it\'s characters this time, not to mention Z/X: Ignition left a few plotlines dangling left over but LA isn\'t holding LA\'s breath to see it fulfilled let alone LA\'s desires for this anime to be patched up anytime soon by the looks of it.Adaptation-wise LA knew what Z/X: Ignition was trying to do with all it\'s strengths and flaws both helping each other and by the end of it it left LA with a.....Meh...']"
Shining Tears X Wind,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2031/Shining_Tears_X_Wind,"['Characters/DevelopmentSetting the general scene is done well in the first episode, introducing a small amount of the cast during the first half and themes that exist throughout in the second. There is a large cast of characters present within the series, however they do tend to lack any depth to them, feeling flat and plain. An example being during the early parts of the series when both Souma and Kureha are taken to End Earth, we learn about the Soul Blades, which come from the heart of the person at hand. Typically Kureha gives Souma her heart to fight off the enemies at the start...and a few instances a little later, but soon after she becomes a background character not adding much to the storyline throughout the rest of the series. But that doesn&rsquo;t only apply to her though, as it happens to several other characters who become quite distant and seem to be quite useless without anymore purpose of being in the story. Character personalities are also rather stereotypical, although this isn&rsquo;t exactly bad it makes future events seem obvious. Souma plays as the main hero in the story who likes to do what is right, trying to protect everyone while he is at it, not wanting any deaths amongst his friends. Kiriya however seems to play as a form of rival between them for a short while in the start of the story. The focus on a majority of characters are lacking except when it comes to Souma, Mao and Zero who get most of the spotlight.The general flow and progression of the story itself is also rather non-existent as it feels rushed and rather uninspired. There is no sense of form or shape, which feels like a big mess of a plot. There are times when the characters need to be in a certain location due to specific event or plot device, and they seem to get to that one area without any signs of effort. The scenes switch too quickly between them and lack anything to break their time getting there or to show they actually traveled between locations. There&rsquo;s no sense of time as they are located in one place, then another soon after. The battles also suffer similar issues, which come across as dull and not very entertaining. They are too simply executed, nothing special about them. The Soul Blade concept of the story is definitely an interesting concept at first, but isn&rsquo;t approached very well. Later in the story it then becomes something less special. A wide variety of different blades take place and only two, other than the designs of them, seem to have distinct differences due to the way they&rsquo;re showcased to the viewers. The series does start out rather interesting during the first two episodes but that soon dies out and begins to crawl into an average plot development where things get a little too typical, with some nice twists here and there, but nothing remarkably rememberable.Animation/SceneryThe series keeps a rather bright, colourful and cheery tone to the series where colour matters to it&rsquo;s location. Fields and sunny landscapes use a lot of light greens and blues, while the dark and gloomy locations tend to use a lot of green tones. However the details within the scenes are existent, but they could have been better. The backgrounds themselve do represent their location well, but sometimes lack those extra details to make them look so much better, such as better lighting. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly special with the scenery except the colours do fit with the locations at hand, but the lack of detail makes them feel uninspired. Character designs are good for both the humans and beastmen in this series, as well as clothing choices. The animation however isn&rsquo;t too great, the generic actions are done simply enough but so have the battle sequences. Simple swings of swords, quick fights and still shots of the action are examples of what take place during these scenes that causes the fights to be nothing of special value, especially those later within the story.Audio/MusicNot much to comment here since I didn&rsquo;t pay too much attention to it, beside the following. The opening theme song is definitely a rememberable track and fits well with the fantasy setting of the series, but when it comes to background music I never noticed anything too special about it. Voices for the character fit well and didn&rsquo;t seem out of place, but were again stereotypical choices just like the character personalities.ConclusionHas a good concept with the Soul Blades but the series doesn&rsquo;t tend to flow well and lacks a sense of shape to it.

What anime isn't?? Throughout the story, I was annoyed by 2 things the most; one was that zero doesn't really have ANY point in the story except for as a ridiculous background information to how some characters were part of a group.second, the sword drawing techniques kept changing from standing, bending over backwards, to having ::cough::orgasms::cough::. Which really made me think the author was still indecisive about plot/animation in general.Characters were pretty good. Some of them could have used more development.Also, there is not much to say for the sound, near the end the background music was...just noisy and questionable for the scene at the same time.But it is overall an enjoyable anime to watch when you're bored which I obviously was. just noisy and questionable for the scene at the same time.But it is overall an enjoyable anime to watch when you're bored which I obviously was."", ""The best RPGs for the Megadrive were Shining Force and Shining Force II. Some of the best, if not the best Game Gear games were Shining Force titles. After a while, the word “Force” was dropped from the game titles and you got such games as Shining Blade, Shining Wisdom and so on. Either way, the Shining franchise has had a lot of high quality games for multiple platforms. So, why am I bringing this up? Well, the franchise also has an anime adaptation. The weird thing about it is that it's not adapted from one game, but two. Shining Tears and Shining Wind, hence...the title Shining Tears x Wind. The adaptation was handled by Studio Deen, which is no stranger to game adaptations having done Star Ocean EX, Fate/Stay Night and Bomberman Jetters prior to this. They've also earned my adoration for their work on the brilliant Read or Die and my contempt for the idiotic Kore wa Zombie desu ka. So, how will this adaptation compare to their other works?Story:The tale opens with several student, Kiriya, Souma, Seena, Kureha, and Saionji discussing recent disappearances in the area. When the others leave, a girl named Hiruda brings Saionji a strange book. The two ominously discuss making it work and they disappear shortly afterward. The other four agree to meet at school to figure out what to do, deciding to bring weapons, because that seems like a plan that couldn't possibly go wrong. Souma and Kureha arrive first and talk only to be interrupted by a fight between a wolfman and Mao, a cat-eared girl. Mao starts to tell them about herself, only for a gem she's carrying to be destroyed which causes all of them to be sucked into another world. Souma and Kureha find themselves alone and surrounded by monsters, but they're saved when Souma pulls a sword from Kureha's chest, revealing that he's a soul blader. (I'm not sure whether they're ripping off Utena or the soul blade thing is based off of some legend I'm unfamiliar with.) Now, Souma and Kureha have to find a way to return home, but first they have to help the peoples of this world deal with an imminent crisis.If it seems like I just glanced over that information, it's only because the anime does too. The pacing in this is ridiculously fast. It doesn't let you acclimate to the real world or main characters before dumping you into the fantasy world. The series basically assumes that you've played the games and will know what's going on so they don't have to take any time whatsoever to explain anything. To make matters worse, scenes only last for around five minutes before rushing to the next. The narrative never takes time to breathe. The worst part is that they have several important plot points that they never introduce until it's time to actually use them, which makes them seem like they come out of nowhere. The ending is especially guilty of this, introducing the plot device that's necessary to end the conflict only after the conflict has started. It doesn't even get mentioned in passing before that.In all fairness, the story, though hectic, isn't bad. It has quite a few interesting aspects. The political machinations are nice. I also like that every group is doing what they think is for the best in order to save the world and they certainly have some good scenes devoted to that. Unfortunately, those scenes are rushed through in order to cram the entirety of Shining Wind's plot into thirteen episodes. Yes, the story uses Shining Wind's plot but with greater emphasis on the Shining Tears characters than they had in that game.Characters:The characters in this aren't deep or well developed. Since they rush through the narrative so much, they never take time to develop the characters in any significant way. Which may lead you to conclude that the characters are flat if you've never played the games that the anime is based on. Even if you have played through the games, you might find yourself annoyed by the character portrayals. The female characters have it especially bad. They get relegated to the background and spend most of the series just kind of standing there, or having swords drawn from them, rather than doing anything. In theory, this is so that the focus can be on the soul bladers, but it comes across as, at the very least, pretty suspect.The interactions also suffer from the pacing problem. There are moments when characters almost feel like they're having a normal conversation, but then the scene will end or something will happen because the plot needs it to and the effect will be spoiled. It's like watching an abridged series where someone thought the character moments were less important than the action sequences. The “romantic” sequences are especially bad, frequently feeling like the characters have no chemistry and are just getting together because... someone wanted to throw in gratuitous romance.Art:The character designs are pretty well done, exempting some of the costumes (especially the fan-service based ones) but I don't blame the anime for that since they are using the established costumes from the games. Although I'm not sure why Hiruda has the tri-force on her costume. The action sequences are, mostly, well handled. The fast pace actually does work for the action sequences, giving them a dynamic feel. The problem is that some of them resort to random still shots in place of actually animating anything. The stills look fine, but they're just lazy.Sound:They got a really good cast for this. It features Ishida Akira, Mizuki Nana, Hoshi Soichirou, Okiayu Ryotaro, and Horie Yui in major roles and that's not even naming all of the highly skilled actors they got for this project. They are all just fantastic, delivering strong performances. The music is really good as well.Ho-yay:This has no signs of yuri, but it has a bit of yaoi. There's a scene where one of the guys lovingly sponges another off and it is extremely homo-erotic, oddly enough this is the best romantic scene in the series. There's also a bit in the end with the previously mentioned plot device that comes out of nowhere but they need to help end the conflict. The ho-yay factor is going to be a 4/10.Final Thoughts:Shining Tears X Wind is definitely a series made for fans of the games. If you don't like the games, you aren't going to like it either. If you've never played the games, you'll be hopelessly lost and have no idea what's happening or why. If you're a fan of the games, you'll probably enjoy the anime okay, but there are going to be aspects that you find annoying. As for me, I'm going to give it a 6/10. I do think it's interesting to see the story adapted in anime form and there are some parts of the story I enjoyed, but I hate that the female characters aren't allowed to do anything and the hectic pace harms it quite a bit. Next week, I'll take a look at another video game tie-in. Street Fighter II: the movie. the title Shining Tears x Wind.

The character development is okay, but there is no feeling put behind the changes that the characters go through and again it feels rushed. In this type of anime one would expect the characters to be a little more reflected in the sense that the viewer is more aware  of the changes that the characters undergo, Souma for example has a change...in the middle but as viewers we have no clue as to why. The other characters face similar developments at the end of the plot, but the lack of originality in the plot makes the viewer foresee this and thus ruins a bit of the enjoyment.The artwork, visuals and sound are not much to complain about. Visually this anime is quite stunning when it comes to the main characters, magical effects and some parts of the scenery, but when it comes to general people, enemies and battlefields a lot more work could have been added. The rushed feeling continues here, where the ""beastmen"", elves, demons and humans look like something that has been drawn by a grade-schooler, then copied up by the hundreds, the same with the ""enemies"". As far as scenery is concerned there are wide open fields that are filled with nothing but emptiness, and it cheapens the overall look. During battles (except for magic battles) there is not much action taking place, and the enemies movements are predictable and slow. The music is probably the only thing I have nothing bad to say about, but the voice actors could have been used better and the opening and ending themes were crap.The ""evil forces"" are in this anime completely understandable, NOT! What the fudge are they fighting against, it makes absolutely no sense, and it is not explained during the plot.If anyone were to create a remake of this anime i would firstly suggest making EVERYTHING better drawn, more detail and less ""copy-pasting"", original designs for the regular inhabitants of Earth End could also be better. Secondly I would suggest better voice acting, and cut the sward-drawing ""orgasms"", and also change the opening and ending songs into something more epic. Thirdly I recommend giving at least the protagonist some ""inside the head thoughts"" and explained the character development more thoroughly through thoughts and actions.

There is often no clear distinction from right or wrong, good or evil. There is, however, often grief and suffering caused by various circumstances and misunderstandings. More often than not, people simply turn their head and walk away...from the show because people just do not get it. White Album is the type of show that likes to tell the story as indirectly as possible to the viewers. Little things that may seem trivial at first can come back to haunt the viewers, so make sure to pay 110% attention!While White Album is technically a harem anime, viewers will be disappointed if they are looking for immature ecchi scenes, for instance boobie grabbing. White Album is not ecchi and/or sexually oriented, period. However, there is one well made French kissing scene in a car. The story revolves around our protagonist whose life got turned upside down when his girlfriend became a famous national idol. He was forced to distance himself from her by the music company and that is when his nightmare begins. Girls from various age groups, some he knew from the past, others he met along the way all started to barge into his life. Some wanted him to forget his girlfriend by allowing themselves as replacement. Others want to make sure the protagonist remain faithful and loyal to his girlfriend, thus they began to have plans of their own. All the while the protagonist is trying to fight temptation, worrying about his father, completing his university degree, and keeping himself sane amidst these chaos.For a studio that is not particularly well known for high quality animation, Seven Arcs did a wonderful job in producing this series. In addition to the regular animation, often times the viewers will see characters in their caricatures (distorted or exaggerated), other times a scene may be presented with pastel-like animation. Simply put, the production crew of White Album did their job skillfully and flawlessly.The producers also have a knack in bringing out the characters’ subtle emotions: they don’t have to say anything about their feelings, their facial expressions speak for themselves, and this series has been really good at throwing these feelings all over the place. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the show is viewers get to “read” the inner thoughts of the protagonist, rather than the traditional way of making the character goes into a long and boring monologue. These inner thoughts often reflect the ambiguity the protagonist has with his feelings and situation.With award winning seiyu performing the OP and various insert songs in between, White Album has at least one exceptional selling point it can brag about. After all, the story does heavily center on songs, thus it is only appropriate to get the most talented seiyu to do the job. Otaku should instantly recognize names such as Nana Mizuki or Aya Hirano, both have singing capabilities rivaling the top notch professionals. But perhaps due to over emphasizing on the songs, the BGM turned out to be rather lackluster (budget problem?).I had to do a quick re-watch of the series before mustering enough courage to write this review. In part due to its unclear way of portraying its characters and where they are heading. Please be mindful that season two, covering episode 14 to 26 will be airing in fall 2009, so don’t expect any form of closure to the story just yet. In fact, the ending was rather calm and did not do much to make viewers lust for season two until the final few scenes where things just seem to happen all at once around the protagonist. In a sense, this suit White Album just fine as most realistic/slice of life drama would have approached it in a similar fashion. from the show because people just do not get it.

They just end up banging a lot of chicks.White Album is a true life story about what it means to be a guy in the real world. In fact, a lot of people will say that this anime is fake and that there is no way that, how many were there, three, no, SIX girls would want to jump the bones of Joe Average, but you know what?? It\'s real, kids! In fact, it helps a lot when said loser in question is a big tool. Girls like that stuff. What success that the main character of this anime is a...big douchebag.So the story is about a guy (I don\'t remember his name, whatever, that wasn\'t important) who has a pretty girlfriend and just because he doesn\'t get to see her everyday, he decides to make use of all the other girls who are crushing on him. Instead of rubbing one out every night or just breaking up with the vapid, ignorant foolish girlfriend (who is a singer), he decides to scam on her body guard, on her co-worker, on their mutual school friends, and on a girl he is tutoring.This is probably the most realistic drama/romance storyline I\'ve ever seen because you know what, kiddies? People love to cheat. What\'s even better about this story is that everyone knows that Touya (right, that\'s his name!) has no backbone and they KNOW he has a girlfriend, and yet they all lure him into sticky situations. Damn, poor Yuki! People who she trusted go on to stab her so hard in the back. It is so fabulous to see these girls watch Yuki in the face and feel vague amounts of guilt about it. Hardcore. And Touya, the lucky bastard, knows she is that much of a insecure loser to stick with him even if he does decide to cheat on her or not.Art is pretty good, though they kept sticking in these stupid watercolour bullshit in the middle of thing. It was pretty distracting and I don\'t know why they even bothered to do it. And the music was all right EXCEPT when anyone sang. Good God, no wonder Yuki and what\'s-her-face are mediocre celebrities--their music sucks.What brought this whole anime down was TOUYA. Oh unfabulous heavens, was he such a pitiful snivelling LOSER. I swear, he cried more than the girls did!! Instead of just growing some balls and dumping his girlfriend who he doesn\'t even see and just settling on one of the girls he sees all the time and clearly wants, he keeps on dating Yuki and doing awful crap to her. Hell, he took time out of his day to go give a present to a chick who secretly hates his girlfriend and doesn\'t take the SAME TIME to see his actual girlfriend? Can you be more of a wang, Touya??Yuki is a moron. Leave it at that. Any other girl would know that when you catch your man giving other girls presents, when he doesn\'t pick up his phone, when you\'re calling him in the middle of night and he\'s not answering (most likely because he\'s sucking the face of one of your ""friends""), then he probably isn\'t that into you. But no. Idiot.Then all the other girls are whores. No kidding. They disregard Yuki, they ignore the fact that weak willed Touya has a limp dick and would hump them like a dog in heat, and they come up with all sorts of schemes to break the two of them up. But what makes them interesting characters is that they pretend so well to be innocent. In fact, they disguise their cunning bitchery by second-guessing what they\'re doing, but the fact is they still end up ruining people\'s lives because each one is a selfish succubus that wants Touya. Why, who knows, because he cries like a bitch over everything.White Album has an amazingly real story about shitty people messing up each others\' lives.

Man, what a wonderful thing to witness.', ""If you're seriously thinking of watching this, I would advice you to think twice.The first thing you have to put in mind when watching this series is that the setting is 1986, when handphones were still not that common, and national idols still existed.Story (5/10)The story starts out very nicely, with very well-done introductions of the characters. We have the main guy who is dating the supposedly main girl, who is doing her best to be an artist. That's where everything goes down in an avalanche. It's a very plain romance drama with very little comedy and it drags along like a log....Just watching it makes you become impatient and tick.Art (8/10)The art is quite well done, in the sense that it is very casual, and it uses light colors very well, hence the characters fit into the sceneries brilliantly. the animation is not particularly well done, but there are no mistakes.Sound (7/10)I expected better tunes, and more songs since it's supposed to be about music too. The OP ED is just alright.. and the bgms are fine, but they hardly compliment the anime much. it leaves a lot of room for improvement.Character (6/10)As the story drags along, the characters drag along as well. The main character is okay at the beginning, but as the episodes past, we see him becoming more and more pitiful and useless. He's indecisive, and very passive(how do you expect to keep an idol as a girlfriend like that??). For the other characters, they hardly ever develop, and all you'll learn about them is their past. Just one thing.. thanks to the main girl's voice, you'll melt like a butter. ^^Enjoyment (5/10)Sometimes, you'll find yourself smiling, and very rarely, open your eyes big in surprise at the plot twists.. but that's all. after each episode, you find yourself empty, and the next episode is just not as anticipating as the last.Overall (6/10)As a harem anime, this one has really failed in many aspects. It leaves a lot of expectations in disappointment and is really no more than another plain anime. Don't watch this unless you have a lot of time to waste.

This is purely based on the first season, since I haven\'t watched the second season yet.  I\'ve watched and read a lot of harem anime/manga, some are good, but most are just shallow, comedy-filled, mindless ecchi fanservices anime that I can\'t stand watching and decided to drop. But this one is clearly different, I\'d say that this is the best harem story I\'ve ever watched/read to date.Whilte Album\'s story is very good, it\'s more deep than most harem anime. This story is very realistic for a harem anime (then again, harem itself...isn\'t very likely to happen in real life, but still much more realistic than most others). It\'s much more deep and portrays how complicated a human can be. The story is played very well, the events that happened can really affect the audience emotionally. Mostly made you grief, rage, or angry, but that\'s the point of this series. This was not meant to be those happy-go-lucky anime in the first place. Though this is mostly the reason why this series got less than 7 (by  the time of writing), most people just hate this series because they do not understand it.Art is pretty nice, I loved the character designs. Backgrounds are well drawn. And there are times when the art changes to beautifully drawn pastel color animation. Character\'s thoughts are written in texts on the screen so people can see what is actually going on inside the said person\'s thoughts.Sound is also another plus. Nice VA, there are no annoying voice in this series. Songs are also good, most of the songs has lyrics that actually connects with the story itself. I find that these songs are also affecting me emotionally while listening (reading the karaokes\' actually). I wasn\'t really a fan of Nana Mizuki or Hirano Aya but overall I really liked the songs here.Characters are where many people find this show to be terrible. I disagree, characters are the strong point of this series. Most characters are flawed, either they do things irrationally or some other flaws. Which is what makes many people hate this. Though I say, that makes them more ""human"". We see characters who do things that we wholly disagree. People bash on the characters. But really, are you sure you won\'t do the same when presented with the same situations? White Album is a series that really shows how complicated, weak, foolish, and irrational human beings and human relationships can be. Humans are not perfect beings who always manages to do the right thing 99% of the time. When being pressured, burdened, presented with many problems, most human will do foolish things even if they know themselves that it is wrong. And this aspect is really portrayed very well here.I really enjoyed the series, even if at times I feel angry or mad at some characters, I can\'t never bring myself to hate them, since I know that I myself might do the same when given the same situation.I\'ve said that I dropped many harem anime, the main reason is because most of those are filled with stupid, mindless fanservices that really bores me to death. Fortunately, that kind of thing doesn\'t exist here. There is a few hot kissing scenes, but they are not mindless or played only for comedic effect, they actually contribute to the story and character developments.Overall, this is really underrated series. An deep, complicated, relatively realistic romance harem story that really brings out the human flaws in characters to the best. Though for some people, this is not their cup of tea, which is why it\'s rated low.Flaws are inevitable in human, that\'s precisely why we have the backspace key on our keyboard. isn\'t very likely to happen in real life, but still much more realistic than most others).

I guess a good way to summarize the whole thing is ""It\'s so messed up, it\'s awesome!"", but that wouldn\'t really seem right I guess. That said, the last sequences and then words left at the end of the final episode really emphasized on that whole idea though.The story\'s not over yet, as the second half of the show gets aired on October this year (2009). I\'m looking forward to it already, as I\'m hopelessly reeled in with this mess they\'re in right now. Hopefully things get better later on, but I\'m liking the story as it is right now.I highly recommend this anime to anyone else who likes a more realistic/slice of life approach on the harem romance genre.Some intangibles:Art:- The artwork was very nice for the most part of the series, as it usually changes from time to time according to the situation, switching from pastel drawing animation to sometimes childlike caricatures of the characters, then switching back to the normal animation style.You do notice sometimes that in the normal animation scenes, the characters\' appearances tend to vary from their other appearances on some episodes, but this can be attributed I guess to how constantly shifting their artwork is.Sound:- All the musical pieces sung in the series by Nana Mizuki and Aya Hirano were masterfully presented and performed, from the opening song (""Shinai"" by Nana Mizuki) to the various insert songs they had throughout the series.The background music they used for most of the show were very apt for whatever situation was being presented, and the ending song (""Maiochiru Yuki no Youni"" by Suara) kept the whole feel of the show going even though it already ended.Characters:- Surprisingly, even for a 13-episode series, most of the characters, including most of the minor ones, were very well rounded and had very defined roles. This is even more surprising considering how the story isn\'t done yet, so they still more room to make these characters grow even more.Enjoyment:- Unlike most harem romance anime, White Album is very sparse and reserved on the humor front, as mostly the story is focused on conflicts with handling different types of relationships with people, especially when there is romance involved, and also on the typical weakness or strength of what one\'s will can be.Because of this, there are considered by some as some ""dead"" scenes in the show where there are mostly serious conversations going on. This in turn, may make this show not that enjoyable for anyone looking for a lighthearted romance show. full of raw emotion from the first episode onwards, and seriously answers most of those ""what if"" questions about situations one would usually imagine about.

This in turn, may make this show not that enjoyable for anyone looking for a lighthearted romance show.', ""When we think of the word harem, we think of a oblivious male character along with slapstick humor and filled with perverted scenes that don't really fit in with the story..  White Album takes the harem genre and applies it to a very serious tone.  This is a more realistic version of how a harem situation would be.Story: 6Touya Fuiji is a college student whose girlfriend has started her path on becoming an idol.  The series follows his interactions with his friends as well as the people who work in the same agency as his girlfriend.  Keep in mind that communication...was strictly at home, as cell phones are not in use and using a home phone was the only way to contact people outside of meeting them in real life.  The ending is a great follow through into the second season of this anime.Though this anime is realistic in a way, the lack of suspense and dramatic scenes created a very slow paced story.  People will argue that the pacing is slow because it is not an action anime... but the anime could use more dramatic parts to make things more exciting.  A lot of this story felt like back story or a big flashback to give information on something that will be coming up.Art: 8A very simple art style, it fit really well with the timeline that the students are in.  The animation as well was nice.  I loved the scenes where they switch to a pastel version.  This transition is very smooth and the pastel drawings were just beautiful.With this anime attempting to be realistic, the character designs are very simple and don't really stand out much.  I will agree that these character designs help send this message of realism.  The idol dresses were pretty as well.Sound: 8The sound was a great part of this series.  With an amazing OP, Shin Ai, this song has a very nice beat as well as an amazing first verse.  This song helps give a feeling of nostalgia as it is reminiscent of songs from the early 2000s (Doesn't this song remind you a bit of Shaman King's second OP, Northern Lights by Megumi Hayashibara?)  This nostalgic feeling comes from the use of actual instruments and NO use electronic beats or sounds.  The ED, Maiochiru Yuki no Youni, a super calm and quite piano song that follows with a drum beat.  This song is similar to the OP as it creates a sense of nostalgia.  The insert song was nice, not very idol-like, even though they used it as an idol song.  It was very good and catchy, a great addition to any iTunes.The background music was fine, enjoyed the violin one a lot.  The only problem was the song that sounded like it fit with a depressed circus.  Whenever that songs was used, it never really fit the scene and just felt out of place.Character: 8As I have said before, this anime seems very realistic, and from the art and story, what completes it are the characters.  The characters all felt like they were making decisions that a normal person would make under the same circumstances.  These decisions and realism felt from these characters gave them depth and did not need a back story to separate them and make them memorable.The only problem I had regarding characters was character development.  I am aware that there is a season two and the characters may develop there, but I only saw one character develop and that was Misaki.  Even though Yuki from the very beginning wanted to change, I didn't see any development on her character as well the main character.Enjoyment: 8With such a serious harem, I was scared of how long it would take for me to get adjusted to his.  In turn though, it was very easy to watch and adjust.  One of the best things about this series is the college setting, a setting quite rare in anime, since most anime series are high school setting or a fantasy world setting.  I just wished they had more dramatic scenes, as the pacing was getting very slow and annoying.One thing I enjoyed a lot was the ability to see Touya's thought process and thinking.  When I mean by see, they actually put on screen what Touya is thinking in his brain.  I enjoyed to see him quite even though his brain was screaming out loud!  This also helped this anime gain it's feel of realism, as there are always times where you do something even though your brain tells you not to.Overall: 8A GREAT harem anime with a good set up into a season two. was strictly at home, as cell phones are not in use and using a home phone was the only way to contact people outside of meeting them in real life.  The ending is a great follow through into the second season of this anime.Though this anime is realistic in a way, the lack of suspense and dramatic scenes created a very slow paced story.

A lot of this story felt like back story or a big flashback to give information on something that will be coming up.Art: 8A very simple art style, it fit really well with the timeline that the students are in.  The animation as well was nice.  I loved the scenes where they switch to a pastel version.  This transition is very smooth and the pastel drawings were just beautiful.With this anime attempting to be realistic, the character designs are very simple and don't really stand out much.  I will agree that these character designs help send this message of realism.  The idol dresses were pretty as well.Sound: 8The sound was a great part of this series.  With an amazing OP, Shin Ai, this song has a very nice beat as well as an amazing first verse.  This song helps give a feeling of nostalgia as it is reminiscent of songs from the early 2000s (Doesn't this song remind you a bit of Shaman King's second OP, Northern Lights by Megumi Hayashibara?)  This nostalgic feeling comes from the use of actual instruments and NO use electronic beats or sounds.  The ED, Maiochiru Yuki no Youni, a super calm and quite piano song that follows with a drum beat.  This song is similar to the OP as it creates a sense of nostalgia.  The insert song was nice, not very idol-like, even though they used it as an idol song.  It was very good and catchy, a great addition to any iTunes.The background music was fine, enjoyed the violin one a lot.  The only problem was the song that sounded like it fit with a depressed circus.  Whenever that songs was used, it never really fit the scene and just felt out of place.Character: 8As I have said before, this anime seems very realistic, and from the art and story, what completes it are the characters.  The characters all felt like they were making decisions that a normal person would make under the same circumstances.  These decisions and realism felt from these characters gave them depth and did not need a back story to separate them and make them memorable.The only problem I had regarding characters was character development.  I am aware that there is a season two and the characters may develop there, but I only saw one character develop and that was Misaki.  Even though Yuki from the very beginning wanted to change, I didn't see any development on her character as well the main character.Enjoyment: 8With such a serious harem, I was scared of how long it would take for me to get adjusted to his.  In turn though, it was very easy to watch and adjust.  One of the best things about this series is the college setting, a setting quite rare in anime, since most anime series are high school setting or a fantasy world setting.  I just wished they had more dramatic scenes, as the pacing was getting very slow and annoying.One thing I enjoyed a lot was the ability to see Touya's thought process and thinking.  When I mean by see, they actually put on screen what Touya is thinking in his brain.  I enjoyed to see him quite even though his brain was screaming out loud!  This also helped this anime gain it's feel of realism, as there are always times where you do something even though your brain tells you not to.Overall: 8A GREAT harem anime with a good set up into a season two."", ""If you enjoy pure Romantic-Dramas then this is for you, plain and simple. White Album has next to no comedic elements and focuses primaraly the main characters' relationship with his Girlfriend, which has reasently become strained as she has become an Idol and is growing in popularity.The story itself seems rather dull at first thought but you quickly learn there is much more then meets the eye. The animation is out of this world in that at times your consufed as to if your watching a TV show or a Movie in how seemless and beautiful the charachers move about their enviroment and how detailed...and realistic the backgrounds are. The Music is very nice and helps develope the mood insted of ruin it and fits wonderfully.Overall its a beautiful peice of art and will be enjoyable to a more mature and patent audience. This show has some wonderful potential and I hope you enjoy it for what it is. and realistic the backgrounds are.

Many circumstances among the other characters who has became his ideal person or what he called ""goddess"" or ""every day(the person who has been worth for him)"" person.What is the point of the story?The protagonist has been told that he\'s a hindrance for his girlfriend\'s future, that she has been more popular. One...of the characters had to plan that the protagonist to be pulled off not to contact the heroine. So much circumstances that lead them to sadness and pain.My Review:So I say that, White Album has a relation to our real world on what is all about when the person you know has become popular. The story begins on childhood and discussing their dreams of what to be.

White Album is one anime that had the potential to be both of these things, but unfortunately it doesn\'t live up to that potential. (In my opinion, of course) Well,  I have to admit. The idea of the show is pretty good. I mean the premise showed a lot of potential to show the effects and results in a relationship where work might get in the way. Though, that\'s where the good things end. First problem that plagued the show from the...first episode, is that there\'s too many sub plots. This would be somewhat fine, if the sub plots are tied to the main plot. While some of them are, a there\'s ones that are not needed. This results in scenes that are poorly transitioned into, that don\'t feel connected. Though, that\'s the least of White Album\'s problems. In my opinion, the drama wasn\'t written well. To make me feel and care for the drama on screen, White Album has to make me care for its characters. Frankly, I didn\'t care about most of them. This make certain emotional high points to make my eyes roll, and check how many minutes I\'m in the episode. Combine with the snail pace, makes the whole story of White Album a drag.CHARACTERSAs said before, I didn\'t care for most of the characters. When I said most, I  mean the whole cast, except for one. Well, staring our show, is Touya Fuji. I found him to be a big reason to why this show fails. Touya is a nice guy. Which results in stupid girls falling in love with him, but that\'s the thing. Touya is too nice, and most people would know what he does. Anyway, while I understand why he does these things. I felt like his problems could have been resolved pretty quickly, but the show just drags it on and on. Which makes the show drag on and on. Besides Touya, we have his whores. Most of the girls are unlikable in a way or another, just boring, and I couldn\'t care less about them. Except for one character. Rina Ogata is the only character that I can call well written. She has her flaws as a person, and reasons for what she does. She\'s the type of character that has ulterior motives for what she\'s doing, that you really have to dig deep for. Which is a thing I like, though she gets sidelined for most of the show. In favor of other character sub plots. So her little bits of character development is what make the show tolerable, but doesn\'t save White Album\'s by a long shot.ANIMATIONAnimated by Seven Arcs, the animation is really stiff, all over the place, and just looks flat and grey most of the time. Seven Arcs haven\'t done anything too visually stunning, besides the latest Nanoha movies. Though, I don\'t remember them being this bad. The actually animation (how little there is), runs at a very low frame rate. Which makes certain scenes a dread to look at. They also use a lot of still frames, which aren\'t even pretty! The only note worthy thing, are the almost painted like animation. Which was used to either save money, or for creative reasons. (I\'m betting on the former) While the animation for these small scenes weren\'t good, they were nicer to look at than the ugly regular art. Speaking of the art, the character designs are shallow, and while the girls are suppose to look ""pretty"". I just didn\'t see them as ""pretty"", and they don\'t look good to me. So, yeah, the art and animation is just bad and not pretty at all.SOUNDThe soundtrack consists of a lot of violin pieces, and a lot of dramatic songs to support the scenes, they were used in. Though, while I was watching the show, I can\'t say I remembered the score. (Most likely because I was too busy thinking ""when is the episode going to end?) Anyway, all that\'s left are the insert pop songs. Which by the way, are barely in the show. I liked the songs, and enjoyed listening to them. Sound of Destiny by Nana Mizuki, was a super catchy song, and I liked this version of the song the best. Though, I\'m liked White Album sung by a White Album 2 character much better. So, yeah, the songs are good, but it doesn\'t show up in the show as much as I would liked it to be. Which means, sound won\'t be getting a better grade.OVERALLWhite Album was a real drag to watch. It\'s bogged down by a poor story, unlikable characters, and bad animation. It\'s a real shame too, since White Album had a lot of potential. In the end it fails at what it wanted to do, and it just becomes barely tolerable.

This is season 1 of what I would like to describe as  a very strong and very realistic  anime. I have not seen one  like this since Maison Ikkoku. (Refer to that review to get more of my mind frame for this anime or if u need more of a reference.)I will not go into detail of this anime but I will go into the mindset of why I think this anime is so damned good. The story takes...place in 1986. Ironic enough, Maison Ikkoku also took place in the 80\'s. In additon, both protagonists are looking for part-time jobs and are both going to college. There are similarities but also big differences.In ""White Album"", the protagonist, Fujii Touya already has a girlfriend and she wants to be an idol. He supports her and in the first episode it shows how MUCH he does love her and care for her and how much he wants to spend time with her. They have little texts while they talk (as if so you would know what they are thinking) which gave me a great reminder of Kare Kano (His and her circumstances) which was added in incredibly well.The last thing I will mention is Ogata, Rina. She reminded me of Sheryl Nome from Macross Fronter and had the same strength and comfort as her and at the same time was as ""interesting"" as the \'galactic nymph\'.I gave this anime a 9 because the story kept me into it and once I got done with the first episode I wanted to know how they went along with their daily lives. I usually try to anticipate what is going to happen in most anime that I watch, and thankfully, I was unable to.I give this anime an overall 9. place in 1986.

every single person talks about how underrated this ""Masterpiece"" is.Before i roast this Brown Album, let me say this, i\'m not the hugest fan...of romance genre but there are romance anime where i did actually enjoy so it\'s not like i hate this one because it\'s not some action or psychological show, and i absolutely hate cheating stories if it ends with forgiveness and crap, and there is a lot of cheating in this one so if you search for NTR and stuff like that, you will enjoy this trash, so now that my bias is out let\'s talk about this anime and why it is one of the most Atrocious pieces of art i\'ve ever seen.SPOILERS AHEADStory:story start with MC working in a bar and he is calling her gf every now and then, you later realize that these two are having a long distance relationship and there are these bizarre not answering each other\'s phone (which happens a lot) thing in this anime,from that alone! you realize they are having troubles with this long distance relationship now this sounds like a promising story, how would a bartender and an idol will work things out? this is gonna be awesome except it will notThe characters and their dynamics makes no sense, Yuki and MC don\'t love each other, the MC is  a sack of shit who randomly cheats and Yuki acts around MC as if he is a stranger, there is no intimacy between them so you couldn\'t care about their problems, you see nothing up until later episode that yeah they had sex one time, but their character is so empty that it wouldn\'t matter they used to love each other, i\'m serious the MC is the typical male anime character, he has ZERO depth, he is just a sleazebag who randomly cheats and it the middle of cheating crys and yells ""yuki... i love yuki, gome"" and continues cheating and every female character loves him secretly, and ofc there is a loli in this anime that has literally nothing to do with the plot but #PedosMoneysLivesMatter.whenever there is a long distance relationship anime or movie there is always that dude or girl who is being an obstacle for MC and the girl, to not meet each other, in here we have a milf who is obsessed with Yuki, as obsessed that she licks her boyfriend\'s tears! and sleeps with him.Yuki seems to be a highly ignorant woman as well, it seems like she has no idea what is going on, and she doesn\'t show any emotion, she is just happy throughout the anime and every now and then she picks the phone to call her boyfriend, hasitates for a 2 sec and stops! and moves on to being happy in the next momenther friend doesn\'t make any sense either, after she finds out yuki has a bf, she insist to meet him and tries to seduce him, she succeeds in a second btwand lastly we have that evil looking manager who wants to make Yuki shine or some such nonsenseit\'s one of those anime that has no content, everything is stupid and you will leave with your iq dropped lower, there is no conclusion at the end either, this is just a guilt pleasure and some people are mistaking it for masterpieceEdit: i kinda forgot about a certain main character lol, there is this girl who was born to love the MC and she is a tomboy with bicycle, she is technically a combination of a retard and a yandere, and as you guessed she  serves nothing to the plot, ok now i\'m done with this garbage of romance genre but there are romance anime where i did actually enjoy so it\'s not like i hate this one because it\'s not some action or psychological show, and i absolutely hate cheating stories if it ends with forgiveness and crap, and there is a lot of cheating in this one so if you search for NTR and stuff like that, you will enjoy this trash, so now that my bias is out let\'s talk about this anime and why it is one of the most Atrocious pieces of art i\'ve ever seen.SPOILERS AHEADStory:story start with MC working in a bar and he is calling her gf every now and then, you later realize that these two are having a long distance relationship and there are these bizarre not answering each other\'s phone (which happens a lot) thing in this anime,from that alone!

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Let me get first things straight, I came to watch this anime after ""White Album 2"". White album 2 was really personal, beautiful yet at the same time really depressing. I loved WA2, pretty much everything a bout it. Have even re-watched twice and even then managed to make me depressed and tear up, but in the end I enjoyed it.  It\'s romance/love moral compass was a tad damaged but in a right direction, thus it ended up well.. thus why loved it.Now, about this thing......White Album 1. Oh my god.. how awkward and uneasy it made for me. On top of that characters and the previously mentioned romance moral compass.. is utterly off the rails here.First things first story. Yes, serious drama about a guy and Idol relationship, but it was somewhat presented in a really awkward way. All 4 episodes I managed to somewhat  watch through by clenching my teeth together were atrocious. The whole feel and as well the relationship between the characters felt so awkward, uneasy and absolutely annoying. It reminded me of modern day disgusting relationships where people are in casual relationships, one night stands and one with heavy cheating need modifier. And this anime was definitely moving more and more in this revolting direction I hate regarding love/relationships (this type).  Anyhow, story was moronic, disgusting and awkward. Something full of lies, hiding and cheating (most likely).Art/sound was okay for most part, but last of OST presence felt watching this show really odd and dull.Characters, they were weird in manner I did not enjoy. And somehow almost every character just pissed me off or annoyed the hell out.To sum it up, it\'s this type of drama/romance I detest everywhere. Some people claimed it\'s ""realistic love/sex/relationships"" ,  and I won\'t disagree, most people are in that type of cheap relationships that really revolts me. As vanilla lover with strong sense of emotion  (or moral compass overall) towards love/sex/relationships, this felt as pushing me away from watching this Anime. Maybe this anime wouldn\'t gone in that direction, maybe would. Who knows, all I know for sure, is that I don\'t plan to find out. This anime was plainly annoying, uneasy and just generally not an interesting nor enjoyable experience.Probably the review where I talked the least about content and the most about how I felt about it, but hopefully people with similar mindset will understand this, whilst so called ""normies"" who think this concept is realistic and normal, won\'t understand this.Point being regarding this ""review"". Story was built, but really annoying. Presentation of characters and overall feel was very awkward. OST had little presence, and I absolutely did not enjoy this. White Album 1.

This is the essence of the white album.White album is an anime adaptation of a visual novel released in the late 90s. It was relatively unknown then, and its anime adaptation a decade later still didn’t...manage to shine the light of popularity on the shadow of its obscurity. Its premise is an interesting one; a college student named Touya Fuji is in a relationship with an aspiring idol, Yuki Morikawa.  Yuki’s dedication to her career has begun to put stress on their relationship, creating a rift between them. Touya struggles with his feelings of loneliness and attempts to navigate through the temptations before him.  White Album has the elements of what could’ve been a successful anime: good score, melancholic tone, and some big name voice actors. However, due to some poor story navigation, lack of characterization for supporting characters and a lack of romantic flare, White Album fails to become a successful romance drama.The show starts off introducing us to the main couple, Touya and Yuki. They have been high school sweethearts for some time and have continued their relationship early into college. But, to Touya’s misfortune, Yuki has wanted to become an idol all her life and decides to take initiative to look for a talent agency. She is quickly swooped up and begins her training to become an idol. All the while, Touya is left behind. The beginning was pretty standard fare and did a relatively nice job setting  the stage for the drama. But the show has a tendency to circumvent any scene by focusing on mundane subplots revolving the other female members of the cast. They all have a thing for Touya in one way or another. These subplots detract from the core of what the show is, dealing with distance in a relationship. The problems of these heroines are usually petty and insignificant. The show gives you no reason why you should care about them.I don’t mind multiple female love interests in a romance drama; that typically makes an adventure more exciting. However, one of the biggest problems of White Album is, the show lacks passion. None of the characters have any emotional depth to them, aside from former Idol, Rina Ogata. They are so dull, so boring, so banal, that I could feel the life draining out of me. They didn’t serve a purpose in the overall narrative aside from helping to establish that Touya is the most milquetoast person imaginable. He will do anything anyone asks him to, to his detriment. He doesn’t believe in saying no, and this causes problems for him and other members of the cast.Another issue I have is that lack of focus on Yuki’s side of the story. It would’ve been interesting seeing how arduous it is, becoming an idol. We could have also got a deeper look into Yuki’s feelings and thoughts, but the show seldom focuses on her directly. Other characters will talk about Yuki, but we rarely get to hear it from the horse’s mouth.Let me dive into Touya’s character for a second. He is probably one of the blandest protagonists out there. He lacks any defining characteristics other than ‘he is nice.’ The show has moments where you can see his real feelings written on the screen. This is a very nice effect and adds some emotional depth to his relatively shallow character. What the show truly needs, is moments of introspection where Touya is allowed to think in-depth about his relationship and his actions. It becomes irksome seeing some airheaded guy repeat the same destructive behaviors ad infinitum without some self-awareness. Don’t get me wrong; I don’t mind a protagonist who has self-destructive behaviors, but there has to be some progression. Touya also has issues with his dad that I felt should’ve been explored more as it would’ve added an interesting layer to the show. But we learn nothing about Touya and his dad’s relationship, leaving a gaping hole only to be filled with boredom.There are some moments where the brilliance of White Album shines through. There are subtle moments of emotional confessions that are masterfully understated. What I mean is, feelings are being indirectly conveyed through accidental slips of the tongue. I relished those moments. Alas, they are too far in between the utterly dreadful side arcs with the other girls. If you are going to have multiple love interests, only have at least one or two in addition to the main girl. Having too many love interests causes all relationships to suffer because there won't be enough time to develop all of them in a substantial way.White Album is a show I wish I would’ve liked. Sadly, it is another missed opportunity. Aside from the glum and oppressive atmosphere, it lacks heart and a soul. It lacks the high drama that makes romantic dramas great. Hopefully, the second half of the series will address some of these issues so the show can, at least, be salvaged.

Regardless of what genre you are into, if you begin to watch more then just the first or second episode, you will be reeled into an anime in which the theme is common everyday whereas the setting is however a bit...more rare. What may seem like a harem at first glance is nothing at all as you explore and discover the past and relationship of each and every character.This story is about the trials of a couple deeply involved where the heroine(Morikawa Yuki) is a rising star and the hero(Fujii Touya) is a college student rejected by his father. As they both are faced with dealing with the change of their relationship they both try and keep contact with each other as she slowly rises to stardom. The story is especially intriguing due to the fact that the story reeled me in from the start with its sombre atmosphere and environment of Touya\'s life while being separated from Yuki. The story also keeps you interested throughout without the inserts of pointless fillers thus leaves you hooked after every episode.The musical score of the opening is absolutely amazing for I personally am a fan for orchestrated music. But regardless the opening and inserts as well as the ending adds emphasis on what the general mood of the story is. With that being said the music sets and maintains a proper mood for each situation in the story which is an absolute must for a drama/romance (cant have the music ruin the mood of the story right?).The characters are each very unique and its hard to classify any of the characters as a certain stereotype which brings me to like this anime further. The additional fact that this isnt a harem even though there are a lot of female characters ""attracted to Touya"" makes me like this anime even further and this is because these characters are vital and the relationships between Touya and some of the characters changes other characters who may not be directly related to Touya in any way.Thus with that being said, whatever that may happen in the story, it was breath taking (if i could exaggerate a little here) and was definitely a complete joy to watch, HOWEVER one thing i did wish for when I finished would have to be a better ending to top off an amazing anime, but one minor flaw wont change the overall success of White Album. more rare.

When you start to watch a show, you want to escape reality, not be thrown back in it damn it!Why are the better shows so boring?Because they are a representative of human consciousness, something this...show presents very well. The watercolor blend between actual animation to change the sense of feeling and atmosphere before/mid episode or the actual characters feeling like ACTUAL non-otaku perfect characters, whether it\'d be Rina\'s smooth talking twoards her brother and MC, or Haruka\'s tomboyish attitude and cry for help because the sense of loneliness hits her hard. After all, she\'s just a girl that doesn\'t get any attention.- EVEN EMOTIONS/CHARACTERISTICS REPRESENT SOMETHING MEANINGFUL THAN -Ever wondered what if being too kind be presented in a harem make more than just baits? Just were you ever curious how boring reality is? Well.. _This is for you_.Most anime portray \'realism"" simple and straight forward happiness, families cheering each other or Depressed over the fact someone close to them died, in the most cartoony and unbearable way. When in actuality, reality is much MUCH harsher then what most think. Kindness here is presented as, suffering because it is just that. It is not suppose to be funny, entertaining or happy. Hence the dry presentation in thematics and characters compared to most works, using style and silence over dialogue and narrative. Everything is methodical, thus being slow.There are no inner monologues, just text to present feelings. Characters suffer from identifing themselves as anything else but ""Goddesses"" of the day for the MC, because they\'d help him in some way or form. However, there are certain characters which take advantage, I\'ll explain later. The story telling, as mentioned before is extremely dry. In a sense of characters make the progression, while it is adapted from a Visual Novel, the obvious taking ALL character routes is there, turn off for some. But in retrospec it\'s handled properly, fitting in all character reactions and outcomes to the fullest. They have their fair share of problems, but overall show progression and not cut out with time resets, it\'s not perfect. But it\'s solidly done.Characters & Thematics : The thematics aren\'t special, but they\'re hidden. Through obscure reactions.example : Yuki singing the song ""White Album"" while the text portrays words of sadness and emptiness, she shows her true emotion. And as an added bonus snow falls down on the stage, giving more sadness and emptiness to the scenary. Or when the MC gets fired he runs in despair crying, throwing his angst on a black and white rough sketchy background with 0 to no animation. The watercolor opening/endings present also some spoilers for the series, but they present at the same time alot of character understanding. And their character reaction, emotion.And now for the characters, they\'re pretty simple. But have a weird mindset they\'re never straight with each others, they lie deliberatly to hide themselves from the audience. The characters may suffer at times from an identity crisis. You\'ll just be like GET MARRIED ALREADY JEEZ! When, it\'s not that simple. The characters are in a state of depression and resent themselves and others, so they need something to ""bring"" them together. And that is, those who completely understand each other something that may seem typical. But it\'s hard to execute, because no one have eyes for each other until they realise their mistakes.Our harem Protagonist may seem like a typical VN character, but unlike most of them. He is the polar oppisate, in otherwords he doesn\'t understand at first but gradually gets what the characters mean, what he has to. What he can\'t do, as I stated above, not everyone is kind hearted. There are some characters that want to take advantage of him, they do so. He gets confused, but in the end, he can\'t do anything about it because of his kind personality, the rest of the cast question his sanity and reactions hence he get gets angrier and angrier, even after being told the truth by his boss before getting himself fired, he realizes how bad he messed up. He slowly grows throughout the first season and gets developed.Yuki, the cheerful moeblob tries her best to be with her boyfriend Touya, (The MC) but sadly is forced to become a cold and forget about him so she can succeed, but her innerself wants to be with him. So they are constantly mislead in a game of cards, you never know for what they\'re aiming.Misaki and Akira, they have oppisate way of percieving and doing things. In other words they are the main couple but their personalities are the other way, Akira isn\'t cheerful as Touya, while Misaki is cheerful as Touya and does not do anything outside of being the character to mentally connect Akira and Touya\'s friendship from turning into nothing.Yayoi, oh my this character is the equivalent of oberstein, you can\'t get her motives until the very end, she shows no emotion in her words and actions, and tries to be something more than your typical female, she succeeds. But is on a level of annoying. In the good way of course.Eiji and Rina, Brother and Sister, they have a playful and arrogant way of doing their things, but they are for the most part. A duet, they are the balance between Yuki\'s inner sadness and Touya\'s depression from not knowing how to handle stuff. They affiliate themselves with the MC\'s even if they\'re not directly connected. They strive for being themselves, don\'t try to go beyond that. So far, they are the most playful out of the cast.Sound & Animation/Art : The sound track in WA is beautiful, the piano pieces properly synced with the setting provide maximum level chill and sadness when the time is right, something alot of shows nowadays seem to lack. They\'re used properly, and play little, but when the time is right.Animation is pretty slide show-ish there is little to no animation when characters do something and the scene in EP 13 oh my, the budget completely died there.Most of the time it\'s standstill and basic movements such as talking or sewing nothing substancial and hard to understand.Art design is okay, the designs are basic but do the job, the backgrounds are nice to look at and its over all well polished.Production Values : Very solid. No issues there, hard on the eye sometimes with lacking animation or influence. Overall good, dry, and hard to swallow but its great. show presents very well.

These are my type of show, senien romances; no ecchi, no fanservice, drama packed and a slow maturing storyline.  The story is about our main protagonist Toya who dates an upcoming idol star, as he has to deal with the obstacles, he has to face while dating a rising pop star; throw in a bunch of girls for distraction and that's our plot. But unlike most harems, this isn't for kids. As mentioned above, this is no panty flashing show.The storyline was pretty...interesting. I felt the relationship with our main protagonist believable. Aya Hirano was a great in voicing Yuki, and throughout the show it was interesting to see how Toya had to deal with his relationship with Yuki, as well as the other girls. Despite Toya doing things he shouldn't (wont spoil it). I never hated and felt disgusted for the guy. Sometimes I might have felt frustrated, but his feelings were pretty understandable and in a way, I could relate too, though from my point of view there wasn't a clear distinction between right and wrong in what he did.So what did I learn about the year I was born? Well, I appreciate a mobile phone, even more now. The amount of missed calls in this show is slightly frustrating, but understandable. Mobile phones in that year were bricks, and cost quite a lot. Even answering machines were expensive! Though despite the show being set in the mid 80s, it looked anything but. The show looked great, apart from a few scenes where it's obvious they cut corners. The music was great, and overall it was a pretty enjoyable show. I liked all the characters and really don't have a preference, despite all the female characters involved. One thing I do hate about this show though, is the damn Hiatus. Not sure why they they're airing the next half in autumn when they could have show all 26 episodes. No matter, it's something to look forward to. Overall a very good show. interesting. I felt the relationship with our main protagonist believable.

Lol.White Album is an anime that overuses drama. So much that its probably the main reason why this show\'s rating is so low. However, I don\'t really mind drama and sometimes I do enjoy a sea of toxic substances. Thus I gave this show a 9.I could say that this is the worsened version of White Album 2 ( not talking about the second season. ) or perhaps White Album 2 but with more waifus and...more drama. And that\'s about it.I don\'t really know what to write on this review. I just want to write this review because this anime is so flooded with drama. That is all.I recommend this to everyone who likes extreme drama. That is all. End of review. more drama. And that\'s about it.I don\'t really know what to write on this review. I just want to write this review because this anime is so flooded with drama. That is all.I recommend this to everyone who likes extreme drama. That is all. End of review.', ""Before you go on to read this review, make not that I have not watched the 2nd season and these were my initial impressions. I gave this anime a shot since all of the reviews rated it fairly well. I heard it'd be a harem anime with realistic events and drama, but truly, I wasn't prepared for what I actually experienced.Let me be frank, I like harem anime: reverse or not, they're all fairly fun and I understand the flaws in harem anime. While this does not have the ridiculous situations of your usual harem anime, I don't exactly agree that all of these events...and relationships are possible. There are a lot of girls with no real reason as to why they like the main character aside from his own relationship with Yuki. How often does that happen? I get forbidden fruit is full of temptation, but really, this is too instantaneous.Considering Touya's personality, I would put him on par with School Day's Makoto or Claymore's Raki. What exactly does that mean? I think he's an annoying, sniveling coward who has no morals and grates on my last nerves, though I suppose the other reviewers deny that. Maybe I'm one of the few who took offense, but I do have to say, it takes a great writer to create a plot in which one can be so angered by a character. Touya is not without his good traits, though since he does help out a lot of the girls, but he's so damned shady all of the time, I wonder why none of them get suspicious.I didn't really much care for Yuki. She is the central idea in Touya's mind, but really, I feel like she takes a backseat to pretty much everyone else. She's usually in scenes showing her calling fruitlessly for Touya while he lives his life. While I do think she's sweet, she is your generic helpless heroine who cries a lot and really doesn't seem to have anything outside of her idol life and Touya to talk about.There are various other females as well who actually do have their own pasts with Touya, but they are explained in the most shallow sense. I felt like there was too much plot dumping in some instances, where the writers were being too coy and when it came time for them to add a large part to the plot, they just kind of revealed it without tact, yet still, there wasn't too much explained about other aspects to the plot that I would have preferred answered, though I suppose the 2nd season will hopefully solve those mysteries for me.For an anime about music, there isn't really any good music to boast about. I kind of like the opening, but it doesn't stand out as far as anime openings go. There's a few instances of singing in the anime like other idol anime, but nothing that really catches your attention.I find that I did have a lot of complaints about the anime, but in truth, I kind of enjoyed watching it. It didn't really seem to get me excited like other dramas might or even make me cry, but the anime did a good job getting my emotions fired up, which is good I suppose. I hope to see more character development in the 2nd season as well as some more depth to the characters. This anime has a lot going for it and I suppose I just need to give it more time to fully blossom because I can see it becoming a great drama, although I would prefer a better protagonist. and relationships are possible.

While I do think she's sweet, she is your generic helpless heroine who cries a lot and really doesn't seem to have anything outside of her idol life and Touya to talk about.There are various other females as well who actually do have their own pasts with Touya, but they are explained in the most shallow sense. I felt like there was too much plot dumping in some instances, where the writers were being too coy and when it came time for them to add a large part to the plot, they just kind of revealed it without tact, yet still, there wasn't too much explained about other aspects to the plot that I would have preferred answered, though I suppose the 2nd season will hopefully solve those mysteries for me.For an anime about music, there isn't really any good music to boast about. I kind of like the opening, but it doesn't stand out as far as anime openings go. There's a few instances of singing in the anime like other idol anime, but nothing that really catches your attention.I find that I did have a lot of complaints about the anime, but in truth, I kind of enjoyed watching it. It didn't really seem to get me excited like other dramas might or even make me cry, but the anime did a good job getting my emotions fired up, which is good I suppose. I hope to see more character development in the 2nd season as well as some more depth to the characters. This anime has a lot going for it and I suppose I just need to give it more time to fully blossom because I can see it becoming a great drama, although I would prefer a better protagonist."", ""I went into this show knowing how White Album 2 turned out, the anime I hate the most. So, I was expecting a morally degenerate MC and a bunch of confused girls because of some made up circumstances. But I was completely wrong.White Album is much much more realistic. The scenarios that play out are, while not relatable, unless you have any experience of being in the idol industry or something similar, can be empathized with to an extent and understood. And the main character is also definitely not the shameless wimp that White Album 2's MC is.And the women in this show, have...problems. But they are not made up or trivial or over-dramatized. They all make sense. They were all forcefully tied into the MC, but still that's the way you make an anime - put someone at the center.I'm sure this anime will be a 10/10 on a number of people's list - people who like tragedies.

In about 2 months, he devolves from a confident, smart, helpful student, to a flaky, whiny, spoiler, spoiler.Despite the story being well planned out, there are slow spots with an occasional bizarre turn of events that doesn't seem to make any sense.

A young adult couple that have known each other since high school. Yuki got a shot at being idol. However as time passed it was getting more difficult for Touya to get in touch with Yuki due to her busy schedule. As time passed Touya got wrapped up in helping others and ignoring or forgetting about Yuki even though he worked close to her in the agency she sings at.This is what the story is about. You see a man and a woman growing...apart. One trying to keep in touch despite her busy schedule while the other is to wrapped up in helping others that he ends up going down the wrong path and neglecting his girl friend. As the story goes on you meet more characters who are mainly good on the surface. But with hidden motives or hidden feelings. The result is a man being confused and sad mentally and emotionally.As it goes on. You see him is a good and bad person. Over all flawed and weak at times in face of certain people or situations. There is more relating to other characters but I don't want to spoil too much.Animation/Art 7.5:The art and animation is great for the time it came out. I didn't notice any serious problems. Still good but some images look off.Soundtrack 8:The soundtrack is good whether it be the opening or ending especially the vocals for Rina and Yuki(Which I love).Characters 7:The characters were good even with their faults. However since there are multiple characters some of them don't get as much screen time as others. I feel like Yuki should have gotten a little more screen time even though she is mentioned more then enough.Cons:Not for me but for some people who aren't use to this kind of structure which is the context or how it's written. The dialogue and context are harder to follow in this season(not sure about season 2). Some of it gives you part of the context and then gives you the rest later on in the episodes. Some of the stuff the characters have said took some time getting use to but I understood it. Just pay attention and realize that what ever questions you have will be answered later on in the episodes when it comes to the story or plot.There are a few scenes like that where characters are talking to each other like that. So pay attention and look back if you need to. Like I said earlier some characters have less screen time then others because there are multiple characters. However there is a 2nd season so this isn't a major issue.Overall:It's can be harder to follow but it's good. It's a more down to earth anime that has a serious tone and takes place from the 80's. No comedy, no over the top gags, and no forced humor. Which is a plus in my book since I don't like anime relying too much on humor unless it's a comedy. That might turn people off and who might find this boring but in all honesty it feels more realistic and I take it more seriously that way.Despite it being an anime that has multiple girls as love interest(harem maybe?) It does well and it takes it self seriously. This anime is based off a visual novel, has a manga, and a 2nd series. So I haven't checked out any of them. I almost never make written reviews.But I made this review for this anime because it's much better then the user score dictates(which was probably made by people who didn't finish the anime.) While it is flawed and is not a gem. It's a good anime that deserves more attention. I rate it 7.5-7.8. apart.

The show honestly started off quite well with a similar feel from the art and soundtrack to Chobits, however, close to the end the amount of NTR was just too much for me to handle. If you do not like shows like School Days or NTR in general, avoid this show like...a plague. a plague.', 'To be honest, the anime was quite painful to watch at first. Disregarding reviews and forums I\'ve read about the anime (before having watched it myself), I found the beginning parts to be a convoluted mess of stories. I felt as if I was being thrown into the middle of what was going on, without any proper contextualization or grounding in order to keep me up to speed. Nevertheless, there were several things that kept me watching (although it took weeks before I watched episode 2, after having watched ep 1) despite all these things.Ratings:Story - 7Art - 7Sound - 9Character - 7Enjoyment - 8Overall...- 7(I know that the overall isn\'t mathematically plausible given the rest of the ratings, but then I can\'t give the first season an 8 since the second season was much better)Story: White Album\'s story isn\'t for everyone. Of course, you should be aware of what you\'re getting into in the first place (from the genre and stuff), but then the story is just so convoluted. A lot of things don\'t add up, and realism is basically thrown out of the window, given how implausible some of the relationships and connections are (although Season 2 somehow rectifies this by establishing context). The whole main plot point of the Yuki-Fujii relationship (between a rising idol and a plain guy) isn\'t implausible at all (and has been done quite a lot before), but the other relationships that arise from this focal point can be quite unrealistic. I leave you to discover those for yourself. Nevertheless, I still found it to be pretty entertaining, because it is a very mature story. While I did say that realism was thrown out of the window, this anime should be given props for refusing to subscribe to an overall happy theme: it takes advantage of the darkness of its plot, and uses it to fuel other elements of the anime (music, etc.).Art: I\'m not so much of a good judge of this category, but my rating is based on other animes I\'ve watched, I guess.Sound: It\'s pretty expected for this anime to have good music. Hell, I\'d be disappointed if it didn\'t. White Album is centered on the music industry, so at the very least, its music should be above average. Needless to say, both the OP and ED are pretty good, and the flagship songs (the eponymous White Album and Sound of Destiny) are pretty distinctive, so this anime doesn\'t fall flat in the music department. If anything, its OSTs are one of the saving graces of this anime.Character: The characters are integral to the story, so the failure of the story to deliver also translates to the characters. Fujii-kun is hard to empathize with, and he is not exactly a very lovable character. That, however, is forgivable given his status as the love-interest of the harem. However, his character also lacks a fundamental characteristic (or set of characteristics) that justifies his position as the central character of this harem anime: this failure to establish that makes his other relationships with the other characters improbable (again, this is partially rectified in the Second Season).Enjoyment: Despite all that has been said, I did nejoy this anime (especially towards the latter half). I began to appreciate the depth of this anime, and I felt that it was somehow able to compensate for the acute lack of characterization and context. Luckily, the second season was able to take advantage of this ""depth"" and extend it further as a strength.CAVEAT: I\'ve seen a lot of people comparing this anime to ""White Album 2,"" which is considered a sequel (despite the universe and the soundtracks being the only similarities between the two animes). I feel that both animes are fundamentally different in terms of what they intend to deliver: White Album is intended to be more mature, while White Album 2 is much more similar to the usual animes (being set in a high school setting and all). White Album exposes you to the music industry, power plays between top executives, trysts, and other concepts that are absent from White Album 2. This is not to say that White Album 2 does not deliver anything (in fact, I still enjoyed it more than White Album); it\'s just that I feel that comparing the two animes doesn\'t do justice to the differences between the two of them - 7(I know that the overall isn\'t mathematically plausible given the rest of the ratings, but then I can\'t give the first season an 8 since the second season was much better)Story: White Album\'s story isn\'t for everyone.

The show is a visual novel adaptation, and it feels like we're watching someone playing it making all of the worst choices.But, despite that, and despite the animation that looks like it...was made at least five years before it was, I'm invested enough to carry on, and I'm looking forward to seeing what it's all coming together into. was made at least five years before it was, I'm invested enough to carry on, and I'm looking forward to seeing what it's all coming together into."", 'The first series for ""White Album"" is not only the progenitor to many other harem/cheating sub-genre series, like the infamous ""School Days,"" but it also is a cornerstone in effective, anime drama! It takes a realistic approach to infidelity, the pressure of musical stardom, rivalry in love, prioritizing relationships over work, and grieving over a deceased parent—""White Album"" takes a mature approach to ALL of these issues, even though it flounders a bit towards the end!⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersFirst of all, this series has nothing to do with The Beatles\' ""White Album"" —you can click out of this review if you\'ve lost...interest. The anime ""White Album"" is an interesting character study into a protagonist (Tōya Fuji) that has dependency issues because of the death of his mother and a strained relationship with his father. Because of the trauma from the death of his mother, he\'s kind of a deadbeat—doesn\'t have a stable job, but despite this, he manages to have a really good relationship with his childhood friend, now girlfriend, Yuki Morikawa.Because of his loneliness, Tōya had always expected Yuki to be around, so when she suddenly breaks into the entertainment industry and starts becoming a famous idol, he has a crisis of being. This is illustrated in the strange directing decision employed in the very first episode, the television screen that Yuki is on morphs and it slowly drifts away from Tōya. Yuki is out of his grasp, far away from where he could ever reach her! Despite their sudden separation, Yuki and Tōya attempt to keep in touch over brief telephone chats, but since this takes place in the 1980s, they always miss each other. I mean, Tōya can\'t be hovering over his Dad\'s ※landline forever, waiting for the bustling, Yuki, to give him a ring!※Their relationship probably wouldn\'t have been as stilted, if cellphones or email had been a thing!Yuki\'s sexually desirable manager makes things more difficult by offering her body, in exchange for him cutting contact with Yuki, because she doesn\'t want her talent\'s reputation to be ruined. Tōya, being the jobless nobody with mommy issues, of course chooses to hook up with the manager! And the plot thickens even more when Yuki\'s music composer, Eiji Ogata, has romantic feelings for her. The end of the first cour comes to head when Tōya watches Yuki\'s first concert, and he can barely get in because the venue is so full, and when her talent shines—he realizes that there growing schism between their two worlds! Man, that was such a good scene! Later, the episode shows him: conflicted, guilty, tormented—running through a snowy metropolis! Not only that, but Eiji makes it clear to Tōya that he\'s amorously pursuing her, and it\'s the start of his unhealthy obsession because he refers to her as his muse, so he can basically implant his personality onto her! The same thing he did to his younger sister, Rina Ogata!The second season doesn\'t live up to the intrigue and psychological strain. In the first season, there\'s this great scene in Episode 11: ""Time Does Not Solve the Thorns In Our Heart. It Just Puts A Label of Oblivion On It,"" where Yuki has a nightmare in the car while her manager is driving, where the cord to the landline is cut and when she walks onstage, everything is dim and when she opens her mouth, she can no longer sing! It was a perfect embodiment of her anxiety about both her career and her faltering relationship! The second season isn\'t as good because instead of giving more meaningful conclusions to the the loose threads, it just creates more by having the main character sleep with a few more female characters. Even the ones that he ISN\'T even attracted to! In the anime, he seems genuinely put-off when his other childhood friend, Haruka Kawashima, gets naked in front of him... but, he sleeps with her anyway! Why? ...who really knows...The second part is like a muddy melange of different routes, all dumped into a mystery stew! As one would expect, Eiji\'s insanity comes to a head and he\'s arrested for swindling money from the production company. There\'s this entire subplot with these new characters, where there\'s a performer and her friend, and the uglier one is locked in a room and forced to write and sing songs for the prettier one to lip-sing to; but, it was very difficult to care about this underlying twist, because the audience barely knows the characters involved. I\'m sure that they\'re both more emotionally compelling in the visual novel, but since so much is crammed into the story, it\'s hard to get to know them well. The best part about the second part was the music and a somewhat satisfying conclusion, it\'s like the Christmas tree scene in ""School Days,"" where Makoto Itō apologizes to Katsura Kotonoha. Tōya and Yuki make amends, but Rina\'s story kind of gets shafted in the process.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Aquaplus (original creator), notable works:* Comic Party (series) ✅* Tears to Tiara ✅* To Heart* To Heart 2 ✅* Utawarerumono (series) ✅* White Album 2 ✅Commentary: It\'s rather strange, but a chief director isn\'t credited to the anime adaptation of White Album, there are only episode directors, such as: Tomokazu Tokoro (director of ""Haibane Renmei,"" worked on eps 15, 22), Naokatsu Tsuda (director of ""JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure (TV),"" worked on ep 25),  Tetsuya Watanabe (director of ""Kimi ga Nozomu Eien,"" worked on ep 12), and Yuki Yase (director of ""En\'en no Shōbōtai,"" worked on ep 7).

Rina isn\'t just ""the other woman"" character, like Sekai Saiyonji from ""School Days,"" but the character individually comes across as a powerful and easy-to-symapthize-with personality!

review may contain spoilers.First impressions, way back before I never started reviewing I was chatting to a friend of mine who did a visual novel walkthough  that this anime is based on and recommended me to watch the show.Going into it I didn't have that high hopes or expections,Because I had herd very mixed opinions about the show from some quick research I did.I was kind of thinking at the back of mind ok I watching a show about an idol relationship with this one dude and there is a harem involved so how.The bar was kind of lowed.Quick side note,I will...cover both seasons of this anime,Because for some reason they decided to spit the story into two seasons,So to save me time and you time I am just going to do cover both  seasons at once.Story,6/10The plot of white album starts out with are main character Tōya who is in this relationship with this up and coming idol named yuki.So I was thinking while watching this,This is ether going to probably be about them growing apart more   as time passes by or this is going to do a little bit of criticism about the Japanese idol industry.Because In real life I have herd about some things about the Japanese idol industry and if there true or not it's a little worrisome to say the lest But back on topic.The story kinda dose a bit of both but manly focused  on the first thing  I mentioned.Which is fine,Because it isn't exactly as forced as you think it would be.Because are main character Tōya  ends up getting involved in all these other  girls issues and some of them just want to get really close  to are main protagonist  if you catch my drift.While yuki is working quite hard and doesn't have much time to spend with him.Plus it doesn't help that there setting is in the 1980s when cell phones aren't are main stream as they are now a days or that her not being around and with other chicks kind of sniffing around isn't really the best thing for a relationship.And speaking of girls sniffing around I felt that the harem  aspect was a little forced in some respects.Like I can understand Some of the characters reasons for why they like him,For example yuki or his child hood Friend haruka.Because that makes sense in the context of what there are to each over.But I what really makes me go through a bit of a loop is why exactly dose the manger chick or that other idol who worked for a different company  kinda show interest in him,Like the same friend who told me to check out this show pretty much explained it like this.It because there using him as kinda a escapeism   from life or something like that.Which I can kinda see that.But at the same time it's explained in such a vague way which first time around I didn't really pick and second time around I can see that but I feel there more to it than that or maybe I am just over thinking it.One thing which I thought was interesting is that we get quite a bit of background plots,Like we get a side story about the main character and his relationship with his dad which was sort of interesting.We also get this one dude trying to back mail people and  shit like that and we also have a few scandals here and there.So at lest we have something here that isn't just harem and romance.Which over all I was quite happy this was here.I think my overall pros about the story is that it's handled maturely enough and there some part when there where kinda subtle of what going on,But I feel it could just me confusing subtlety for vagueness.But when I think about it could easily be a mix of both actually.But I guess the quite a few nitpicks That I have is.For one this show try's to build up to things like the black mail and scandal things which  I talked about before.But the problem is that the fizzles away so quickly and I don't think that was the intention  behind it but I feel they didn't know how to capitalize on it ether.Like back for the black mail thing for a bit.One of the people involved basically sold to the person he was black mailing the negatives for the photos  he was using   to back mail her.So basically he sold the only thing he could have used to get more money from her,Especially because after that the photos had been destroyed or something along those lines.Also same thing with the scandal or the main character sleeping with other chicks,Like it hints that something going to happen but doesn't or isn't really handed the way  it should have been.While I am on the drama topic it doesn't leave much of an impact.Which is kind of sad because it seems like they tried.So this story is pretty much we have some ideas but we not going all the way with them.Characters, 5/10Main character toya is kind of bland and basic,The only thing I got from him is that him and his dad have some issues and that he seems to sleep around a bit.Which was a little stand out.But not that interesting or noteworthy.Side characters are kinda basic as well,I thought some of the drama was slightly interesting,Like the girl that the main character is schooling has these issues with her  mother  and the child hood friends who for while couldn't play tennis because she hadn't gotten over her older brother death.Other than that nothing that really got my interest.And I really hate having to say that.The character interactions where fine,But nothing really much to write home about.Art, 6/10The animion  is above average at best,The backgrounds are kinda mah.The art has this very dim and almost depressing look to it.Like most of the scenes looks really dark even when it day time in the those scenes.And also the art style at times changes into this water paint look.Which I quite liked.Character design look pretty average.Sound, 5/10Both the op and ending songs really didn't my interest,Like they sounding quite genetic to me.I guess they sounded nice but it didn't really click with me personally.Even some of songs they actually did when the idol characters where doing a song or somethings like that.It also really doesn't stand out that much.The ost was the better thing out of this,Because it had a nice classical piano tracks that sounded quite nice and fitted quite well with the series.And this is coming from a person who isn't really a big fan of classical music.The ost was done by Fujima, Hitoshi,Who has done music and ost  for dog days if any one herd of that show.Enjoyment, 5/10As far as enjoyment goes this was probably one of more average show enjoyment wise.Like I enjoyed the drama and all that shit.But like a seid before it kinda just fizzles away.Which really put a damper on my enjoyment.But overall it was an ok time passer for me.But I do wonder what I could have just as easily skipped this show for something more enjoyable.Overall, 6/10If you like story's about Japanese idols then maybe you will like this.It isn't exactly bad but it not really amazing ether.You not going to miss much  you skip this show and watch something else.If you don't like these kinda by the books romance shows them probably avoid this at all costs. cover both seasons of this anime,Because for some reason they decided to spit the story into two seasons,So to save me time and you time I am just going to do cover both  seasons at once.Story,6/10The plot of white album starts out with are main character Tōya who is in this relationship with this up and coming idol named yuki.So I was thinking while watching this,This is ether going to probably be about them growing apart more   as time passes by or this is going to do a little bit of criticism about the Japanese idol industry.Because In real life I have herd about some things about the Japanese idol industry and if there true or not it's a little worrisome to say the lest But back on topic.The story kinda dose a bit of both but manly focused  on the first thing  I mentioned.Which is fine,Because it isn't exactly as forced as you think it would be.Because are main character Tōya  ends up getting involved in all these other  girls issues and some of them just want to get really close  to are main protagonist  if you catch my drift.While yuki is working quite hard and doesn't have much time to spend with him.Plus it doesn't help that there setting is in the 1980s when cell phones aren't are main stream as they are now a days or that her not being around and with other chicks kind of sniffing around isn't really the best thing for a relationship.And speaking of girls sniffing around I felt that the harem  aspect was a little forced in some respects.Like I can understand Some of the characters reasons for why they like him,For example yuki or his child hood Friend haruka.Because that makes sense in the context of what there are to each over.But I what really makes me go through a bit of a loop is why exactly dose the manger chick or that other idol who worked for a different company  kinda show interest in him,Like the same friend who told me to check out this show pretty much explained it like this.It because there using him as kinda a escapeism   from life or something like that.Which I can kinda see that.But at the same time it's explained

'About this series (first and second season) - White Album is a creation of an experiment. White Album is an experiment of two strings; a red string and another thin but ductile red string.  These two strings had always been together until one of the strings got mixed up with other strings. The remaining red string was left in the dark; awaiting for its lost partner. Distant relationships aren’t always satisfactory, since they create tensions between both sides.  Affection and devotion isn’t as turns out to be; for it only stays rigid after witnessing mutual beliefs and characteristics.  However, this isn’t seemingly...true. Throughout the anime, we learn that one can keep their ideology of devotion whilst their partner might rebel against this axiom. Even if a person knows that the actions of their rebellious partner, they remain strong and would naively wait for their partner’s acceptance in devotion of love.Story- The overall idea of progression in this anime isn’t the anime’s specialty, for it only confuses the audiences. Every scene seems to head on one direction until it clashes with another contradicting scene. For instance: a case of poisoning, an accident, and a fallacy of a scandal all occur in a single episode. These events have absolutely no relation to each other, thus confusing the audiences by creating unnecessary dreary plot. Instead of concentrating in a precise event and simultaneously giving it more attention, the swirl of different events creates inaccuracy in narration. However, the anime does contain a positive attribute. The overall idea of long relationships can differ in many ways. In this series, we get to witness a heroin that strongly desires passion and fondness from the main protagonist.  The idea of someone to believe that their partner belongs to each other doesn’t always turn out be right. In a few cases, that person would continue to believe a pipe dream as such. Even after being hurt, they would continue to seek affection from the person that didn’t pay attention to their devotion of love.Art- Even though it clearly fits into the setting of 1986-1987, the anime’s art style isn’t quite attention-grabbing. Another way to describe an art of such is plain or ordinary. As similar to having a meal of plain bread; it doesn’t brighten or give a special excitement to the audiences.  Appearances made in the anime can easily be forgotten due to the lack of creativity in the anime. As I brag about the plain art style in my perspective, it is fair to say that it still fits the overall dramatic environment throughout the series.Sound- The soundtrack is the best attribute in this series. The soundtracks are mainly classical, which fits into the category of drama very well. These soundtracks enhance the implantation of each scene throughout the series. It may make us feel guilty or feel bad for a character; this is the anime’s specialty. White album and the second opening describe the heroin’s feelings and thoughts for the main protagonist.Characters- The main protagonist in this series isn’t an ideal protagonist. He often makes clumsy blunders and he is often left with an impression of lacking common sense. His actions are often questionable; he never seems to make the right decision throughout the series. Unfortunately, his actions seem to be affecting the whole anime. Without the main protagonist’s ignorance of comprehending people’s feelings, the whole anime would’ve been affected. The idea of devotion and loyalty would be difficult to prove without his existence. In simple terms, the main protagonist doesn’t quite have a noticeable or appreciative personality or trait but he holds a critical position in the series. The main heroin in this anime is a very dependable person. Despite losing confidence after witnessing the betrayal of the main protagonist, she still continues to adore him. As similar as a goddess, she is forgiving, gentle, and caring. Other characters simply confuse the main character by making him believe that they are the goddess that he seeks.Enjoyment: This anime was fairly good. It had a few good and cringe moments.Overall: This anime isn’t what I had expected it to be from the very start. With very few noticeable or decent scenes that carried out throughout the series, I believe the anime isn’t the greatest or the worst in terms of decency. true.

This is full on heavy drama with very little hints of ecchiness.You should watch this with an open mind and you should have complete control of your rage. If you can watch this, I think you're ready for SCHOOL DAYS.You are dropped off in the middle of nowhere, all you know is your name and you are waiting for some hint of back story. You get none. This will continue until the last few episodes of the second season.People who would like to try it, should have patience. The story is great. Just wait and see. The...story has some School Days elements in it (one of the heroines is like Kotonoha without the violence.) Also, the setting of the story is really something refreshing for me and it adds more to the plot.Please do watch it if you have the chance or if you want something different. story has some School Days elements in it (one of the heroines is like Kotonoha without the violence.)

I feel I could watch it again and again and never realize it\'s full potential. This is the perfect portrayal of unfaithfulness despite trust, and selfishness despite guilt. Totally a sad anime for sure, but I think it was worth my time and philosophy; It touched on every point a romance needs, it kept me intrigued and thinking, and never let me be happy. This is why it\'s a perfect portrayal of relationships in real life, the struggles that come between them, and human desires that exceed the realm of...possibility.(Concerns) I suspected that White Album 2 would be a continuation of this but it is not which saddens me quite a bit... Disregarding the incomplete story many say that WA2 is a masterpiece where as White Album isn\'t, which I won\'t pick to say which is worse as they both are better in some places worse in others, but I think that the original White Album which is set 10 years previous is a masterpiece in it\'s own right.(Extra) The characters besides the ""Main"" heroine(???) and a few sides all have deep personalities and connections that tie them together, which helps make the story more fun to think about and leaves you curious because they never allow you to peer into their true thoughts. The music both opener and ender are great.(Disregarded Thoughts) I\'d like to talk about the MC\'s philosophy... His philosophy is based around the idea that the women around him are what make him; Which despite how it sounds I respect it quite a bit. He has something he calls the goddess of the day which is basically a declaration he makes to the women whom makes the largest impact on him that day, this can be something they do to help him realize, the own fortitude, or a favor done by said person. This doesn\'t explain it, but moving forward disregarding the fact that the MC is a douche, I can\'t blame him. His girlfriend who is supposedly the main heroine has a pretty shallow character besides her facet as an idol, even though she had yet to debut he only saw her a few times a year. possibility.(Concerns) I suspected that White Album 2 would be a continuation of this but it is not which saddens me quite a bit...

The sole purpose for this is because characters have busy schedules, and without cellphones, they keep missing eachother everytime they call and leave voice messages instead.I cannot stress how this is a central point in the show. It feels very frustrating (in a good way), and makes me appreciate the fact we have smartphones today. A lot of the drama and heartbreak could be avoided by talking to your loved one at the right time. They...cant do this here because there is simple no such technology there yet.So characters finding themselves unable to speak with their loved ones at the right time create a lot of drama, misunderstantings etc.- CharactersTouya is a typical harem protagonist. Literally every female character in the show want to bang him.- He basically cucks his gf Yuki with 70% of the female cast.- Other characters are very basic. Only one I liked was yayoi, because she was a mysterious and aloof onee san.- Story-Being a visual novel, it seems they tried to adapt every route, which made for a lot of stuff making no sense.-I always preffered more focused experiencies, I enjoyed a lot of Touyas relationship with yayoi, because they have a sort of mysterious yet toxic vibe to it. But out of nowhere he starts going after all the other girls and it turns into a shitshow. None of them get any proper devolopment and focus.- A amagami SS approach would have made this show better. Or sticking to one route.-Several plot points or context regarding the cast\'s past are not properly explained. I assume they are explored in the vn.-  Music and overall production10/10 for me. No comment.- Closing thoughtsA great adult drama anime. While not relatable, it feels more ""realistic"" and down to earth than other available out there.Unfortunately, due to it not commiting to a single route, the second season goes full retard and horny, and the more interesting relationships do not get enough time imo. cant do this here because there is simple no such technology there yet.So characters finding themselves unable to speak with their loved ones at the right time create a lot of drama, misunderstantings etc.- CharactersTouya is a typical harem protagonist.

Yes I know, I know… it’s an anime and a drama so I shouldn't expect characters acting like functioning adults. My mistake.It’s a romance, harem story about a guy having problems adapting to the reality that his girlfriend is an idol and everything that implies. Yeah… let’s be honest, he’s a fool (not an idiot, it looks like he’s aware of his harem) most of the time but an opportunistic idiot so I have to respect that. There are...moments when he feels bad about what he’s doing but it doesn’t last long. For a reason I just cannot fathom every girl he calls a “Goddess of the day” falls for him.Our main hero is Touya Fujii - a student in his twenties who checks most of the ticks on a list of “generic main characters”. Dead parent? Check. No charisma whatsoever? Check. Living alone? Check. Having a harem of girls ready to date/procreate with him without a legit reason? Check. The only semi-different thing about him is that he has a girlfriend… who she cheats on… Yeah… he’s kind of an asshole. A lot of time he spends either crying, feeling sorry for himself, feeling sorry for someone else or helping one of the girls in his harem achieve their goal. Pretty boring stuff. He’s the worst part of the show. I’m not even talking morally. To be honest I enjoy an amoral main hero. He’s just bland, boring and leaves no impression whatsoever.Every other character in the show is much more enjoyable to watch. Almost all of them have character (yes… for most of them that means having one characteristic (a tomboy, a diva, a smart ass kid, a machiavellian assistant etc.) pumped to 11 but it’s still better than what Fujii got) and apart from interacting with Touya, can almost function like a realistic adult. Except two of them but why spoil the surprise?The main premise isn’t actually bad. A love story using two different worlds as background isn’t new but it is pretty interesting if done right. This one isn’t done right. Touya for most of the show is a passive moron who reacts to everything like a child. The moment’s when he shows some activity are the moment’s when he’s cheating on his girlfriend only to later feel bad about himself… for about 5 seconds.The drama of the plot derives from a lot, and I do mean A LOT of misunderstanding, the inability of characters to get in touch and sheer “the plot demands it” effect.Despite that the show has its charm and I found myself invested in the girls of the show. I still wished truck-kun would take care of Touya but the interactions between the girls themselves are pretty interesting. It’s a pretty middle of the road show. Not terrible but definitely not great. If You like dramas I think You can find enjoyment in it as long as You don’t come in expecting something groundbreaking. moments when he feels bad about what he’s doing but it doesn’t last long.
