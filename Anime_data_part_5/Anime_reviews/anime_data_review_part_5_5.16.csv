Pokemon: Pikachu Tankentai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4792/Pokemon__Pikachu_Tankentai,"[""Time to look at one of the many shorts that come before the Pokemon movies.Story: While it's nothing special, it didn't really have to be. It's a 1-time short that just needed a clear beginning, middle, and end, which it did have. While not very engaging, it accomplished what it needed to do.Art: Considering this comes right before the 2nd Pokemon movie, I'm glad that they didn't try to put a whole lot of focus on making this one look amazing and instead, just went with an art style that makes a lot of things look like they came out of a children's storybook and...also the same art style used for the show. This does work and can actually get some amazing shots, especially when they stumble upon the area where various water Pokemon live and when the giant tree is blowing in the wind.Sound: Most of the sound is just the various Pokemon voices, which is OK. It's not as ear-grating as it could be and actually sounds beautiful at certain points when a lot of them sing together. There's also a few pretty good songs in this short, so that's always a plus.Character: Most of the short is spent showing how all of the different Pokemon can live and work together, which is great to see since the show doesn't do episodes like this that often and it's a rarity to see Pokemon do more in the movies besides just battle.Enjoyment: Taking it at what it is, which is a short about as long as an episode from the show, it's pretty entertaining. While not action packed like the movie that follows, it gets your spirits up before you begin to watch the full length feature. also the same art style used for the show.

There really isn\'t a story, or characters or like anything at all. anyway, good ass movie, 10/10 I like the part where pikachu goes ""pikachu!""Also this review needs more information apparently. what else am i supposed to say. pikachu pikachu. pikapika.Electrons propagating through a magnetic field emit very bright and coherent photon beams via synchrotron radiation.

Piyoko ni Omakase pyo!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1748/Piyoko_ni_Omakase_pyo,"['""Piyoko ni omakase pyo!"" or ""Leave it to Piyoko!"" was a great anime. I finished it in one night because it was very short, but otherwise, very cute.Story: 10Art: 10Sound: 10Characters: 10Overall and Enjoyment: 10I couldn\'t find subs, so I was forced to watch the dubs. But the dubs were actually pretty good. I love Piyoko-chan, she\'s REALLY cute! I liked this anime because it was cute, funny, and overall entertaining. It doesn\'t take a long time to watch, and it\'s really cute, so I think you should watch it! Thanks for reading! ', ""Some of you may recall that one of my earliest reviews was of Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat. I gave it a decent rating saying that it was held back by sub-par voice acting and humour that didn't always work. Leave it to Piyoko is an eight episode OVA involving several of the same characters. Is it as good or better?Leave it to Piyoko has the same absence of story as Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat. The basic premise is that Princess Piyoko, one of the antagonists from Di Gi Charat, accidentally destroys a large portion of her planet and flees to earth with her...Black Gema Gema Gang with the plan of kidnapping Princess Dejiko and holding her for ransom. They then proceed to go through several, incredibly random scenarios, most of which don't even involve their plan. The main difference between Leave it to Piyoko and Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat is that Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat has humour that generally works pretty well and Leave it to Piyoko just relies on complete randomness and the fact that the gang is incompetent. It's not randomness structured in an amusing way, it's just random and the gang being incompetent isn't played up in an amusing way. It's just them being incompetent. There are very few humorous moments in this. The fifteen minute episodes just feel like a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.The characters remain fairly flat. One thing that does work are the interactions between Piyoko and other characters. The way she interacts with her upper level gang members and Princess Dejiko provides some cute moments.The art is lazy and schizophrenic. The tone shifts frequently and with little reason. There isn't a usual method as a result. It creates a unique atmosphere, but that's really not a good thing.The voice acting still tends towards over the top and somewhat grating. They get good people, like Hayashibara Megumi and Sanada Asami, but none of them do their best work, in all likelihood because of the direction. The music is just boring.I'm going to give it a yuri factor of 3/10. There are some moments that could be read as homoerotic, but the characters involved are all of eight and ten years old so I wouldn't read it that way.My final rating is a 3/10. The few charming/humorous moments can't make up for the overall lack of humour. The voice acting is still sub-par and the art is a lot worse in this than it was in Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat. I know that it's intended for children, but I really don't think most children are going to be entertained by it.

The humor is very ridiculous as always and I appreciate that they go deeper into Piyoko's origins and well, we learned at least something about her parents. if you are looking for an anime that follows a plot I must tell you that Di gi charat and all their specials/ovas is not for you since most of them are random episodes intended to entertain us...(and is an anime for children so we shouldn't be harsh about this)Anyways i only recommend this if you are a fan this franchise,nothing more to say (and is an anime for children so we shouldn't be harsh about this)Anyways i only recommend this if you are a fan this franchise,nothing more to say""]"
Sengoku Musou SP: Sanada no Shou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21497/Sengoku_Musou_SP__Sanada_no_Shou,"[""So I just finished watching this movie earlier today and I decided that I should write a review for it so let's start.Note : I am a really big fan of animes in feudal japan regarding the fight for power ( like this one and Sengoku Basara) that have cool battles and stuff so this review might be a bit biased.Story   8 / 10So the takes place in feudal japan where we have the ongoing battle for power between the big houses. The story starts after the deaths of Shingen Takeda and Oda Nobunaga and focuses around the struggles of the Sanada...brothers : Yukimura and Nobuyuki. The story is based on the video game Samurai Warriors 4 and it's pretty linear and standard and tries to follow the historic events . I always like this type of story thus I rated it 8/10 but if I wasn't biased it would probably be around 6/10.Art 7 / 10The art isn't anything out of the ordinary or too extravagant but it is good. The animation is fluid and it really fits this genre of anime. I definetly enjoyed it. All the main and most of the secondary characters have a unique design (like in the games) but I also liked that most foot soldiers weren't just copy paste of the same one, they each had a little bit of something distinctive (a beard , a moustache , a bit of white hair , a scar , a wrinkle , etc).Sound 8/10The music is really cool . They use that inspiring battle music and war music and I love that. As far as it concerns the characters , for most of them the voice fits perfectly. Exceptions would be Nobunaga (omg so wrong...sooo wrong) and Kunoichi ( her voice just annoys me) but they barely appear / talk (at most 3 minutes both of them together) so it's not that bad. You will be able to ignore it.Character 9/10Here you got your stereotipycal Sanada Yukimura !! which I love. He is one of my favourite characters whenever he appears. Nobuyuki is also quite cool. The struggles of the 2 brothers are portrayed quite nicely , as they try to survive and keep their name and honor intact in a world thrown into chaos. The rest of the characters are just secondary or barely appear thus they don't really strike a big impact. But as I said I am a sucker for this type of anime/ characters so 9/10 in my book, if I were not biased maybe a 7/10.Enjoynment 9 / 10I really enjoyed the movie. It was very easy to watch and man that final battle was really cool (made the whole first 2 thirds of the movie worth watching through) . I really mean it was awesome. Because it tried not to become too super-powered sayains (like Sengoku Basara does) for the whole battle. It should the ingenuity of Nobuyuki and the armies clashing. Ofcourse we also have  sanada wrecking shit up Basara style which is always cool. But as I said I love the fact that they did not overuse that.If you are not a fan of this type of anime this is most likely a 6 / 10 for you.Overall 8/10Overall this was a good anime , that stays true to its genre with decent characters and audio, good graphics and an awesome final battle.(if you are not a fan of this genre this anime would probably be around 6/10 for you) brothers : Yukimura and Nobuyuki.

I encountered that game at a convention when the committee running one of the screening rooms had to fall back on their third or fourth option, and still have the memory of that Honda guy jetting around in his steam-powered armor; hysterical!This movie, and the series that it sets up for, do not have any such moments.Have you played Samurai Warriors by Koei? Have you ever walked into a store and saw something that you\'ve seen every time you walked into the store and thought ""Boy is that thing average, but...I guess it\'s nice that it\'s always there? Wait why am I getting comfort from such an empty material thing?""That could be any/all of the Warriors titles; mindless button-mashing that isn\'t bad so long as you don\'t expect anything from it but just that.This movie and it\'s accompanying anime is like playing Samurai warriors, but only getting to watch the cut-scenes.This boils the show (and game really) to overacting, silly representations of historical characters, and painfully paced and predictable plot points.I was trying to hold out watching the anime to see if Yukimura\'s death would rival the end of Return of the King in terms of how drawn out it could be, but this movie and the first two episodes dissuaded me.Yes I didn\'t watch all of the anime.No, I couldn\'t be bothered to write a separate entry.Go buy a used copy of Samurai Warriors and see everything in this movie and the anime, plus cathartic, mind-numbing destruction of pixels with Nobunaga\'s demon light-saber and other fantastic additions.

RDG: Red Data Girl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14921/RDG__Red_Data_Girl,"['Stories aren\'t always about narratives. Sometimes, we can discover more ideas by ourselves if we put our efforts through. And of course, discovery comes from experiences. For a certain shy and dull looking (I think she\'s cute though) girl according to her peers, she\'s about to experience some whole new changes in her life.Her name is Izumiko Suzuhara, the Red Data Girl.RDG: Red Data Girl is an anime series adapted from the light novel of the same name written by Noriko Ogiwara (The Good Witch of the West). Her talent of writing involves in the field of fantasy and supernatural so expect some of those...themes from RDG. Otherwise, P.A. Works handles the production of the series. They are known for their usages of serene visuals and clearly does not disappoint; at least in the art department. However, the experiences I got out of this series is not exactly enthralling or exciting. In fact, it was something quite different.In essence, this series is like a fantasy but takes place in modern times. The time period it takes place seems to be normal and likely perspective to our very own 21st century without high tech gadgets or space cars. Rather, it is a normal and typical school life setting in a modern civilization of development. Suzuhara Izumiko is the main female protagonist in this and she\'s always been shy. Even from the first episode, it\'s easy to pick out from the fact that she has a hard time socializing with others or being part of a group. It\'s not too surprising though by her nature considering the fact that she has been raised in the mountains. Or rather, Suzuhara has been associated with the Tamakura Shrine and along with her miko outfit, we can consider her to be a shrine maiden.The series spells out some confusion and mystery. For example, Suzuhara seems to have a strange power that lies dominant in her and these powers are let out when she is near technology. This is proven when electronic gadgets she comes in contact with results in destruction. Additionally, her glasses when removed seems to gave her visions of the supernatural, or otherworldly beings. From an initial standpoint, it\'s hard to tell anything by how these powers came to be. For one thing, we know that it\'s some sort of ability and very likely has a connection with Suzuhara\'s origins. It spells out mystery and the viewers\' curiousity may peak from some of these aspects; at least I know I did. Regardless of her strange abilties though, Suzuhara enrolls to Hōjō High School in Tokyo where her life becomes more normal. At least, that\'s what she originally hoped.Then on the opposite of the globe is Miyuki Sagara. This guy is essentially introduced as a prick. His attitude is literally a bully by the way he talks to Suzuhara and behaves around her. For whatever reason, Miyuki seems Suzuhara as a nuisance and more so because he is assigned to be her protector. Luckily though, their relationship seems to get better and possibly even go on the road of romance. It\'s at least not in the friend zone section but the two definitely has some engaging moments. These moments are captured by their dialogues and some development, especially after a certain event that reveals an even deeper secret of Suzuhara.The secrets in this series also reveals some other aspects with the character cast. Take example, Mayura Sōda who is known as a cherry girl with friendly demeanor. However, she has more secrets and particularly gets caught in a rivalry among the school grounds. Among other factors, perhaps the biggest secret revolves again with Suzuhara. We learn that there\'s a supernatural vessel within her. It could be something related to a divinity or a goddess. We don\'t know too much about it but it has connections with her origins and the mysterious powers that she possesses. Unfortunately for her, she knows little about her origins herself or those powers. She does have a knight in shining armor though. But even so, Suzuhara still can\'t live the normal life a young teenage girl. With the ability to destroy electronic devices through an unintentional or intentional touch, she won\'t ever be able to use iphones, listen to ipods, or watching anime on a computer like most people. Damn, shame.Among other factors, there\'s the serene like atmosphere that is constantly present in the show. The mountain atmosphere gives off a fresh scent of the settings and brings out a sense of realism in Tokyo that makes you feel right at home. The way some of the structures are designed as well to fit within the traditional Japanese ways. Needless to say, it presents its Shinto themes in the right direction. After all, Shinto is considered a spirituality and in Tokyo, there are many practices that establishes connections between them. In RDG, we can see some of the way the characters are dressed, the monuments, the festivals, the clear mountains, and shrines that are all over the place. The school itself is traditional and consists more of the modern atmosphere rather than anything too out of place.Unfortunately, the show is hard to grasp and connect together. There\'s a lot of confusion among the characters and what\'s there. The plot itself is also a bit loose and I find it dull at various occasions. The Shinto atmosphere might also not fit well for target audiences. In fact, RDG is more the type of the show where we have to expect the pace to start off slow, flow smoothly, and hopefully wrap up in a tolerable way. However, I find the pacing to be a bit intolerable. At many occasions, I find that the plot itself to be just too dull. It tries to present its story with a mythical narrative that plays along influences of the Japanese culture. At the same time, the way it executes it is not so exciting. Unless of course you\'re really interested in the Asian culture along with Japanese traditions, Red Data Girl may not be for you. However, there are instances though that I find the series to be interesting. The title character Suzuhara keeps her innocent outlook and seems to be on the side of a \'coming of age\' drama. She is the \'miko\' and host of a powerful divinity.But for some things to care, there are the visuals. P.A Works handles the production of this series and the artwork gives a definition of beauty. As mentioned before, the artwork aesthetics gives the details to the surrounding atmosphere as well as the nature of the series. There\'s the mountain, the shrines, the outfits, and even spirits to match traditional Japanese ethnics. Of course, Suzuhara herself is drawn as a plain girl with the nerdy glasses and braids to match her statue. For one, I am pleased that P.A. Works is involved in this as it gave me a nostologia of Hanasaku Iroha and Tari Tari; at least in terms of visuals.As for the soundtrack, the series maintains a balanced rhythm. It\'s nothing too special to take notice of as most of the time, the OST remains smooth and light. There\'s no intense beats or rock. Rather, there\'s this linear pace of natural sound. The OP song ""Small worldrop"" by Annabel is sung with a smooth voice and at the same time shows some possible foreshadowing. Then, there are the ED songs that plays off the traditional themes again. In the song itself, we can see that Suzuhara is walking as in a possible reference to her development in a modern coming of age/fantasy story.Ultimately, I\'d say this series is a gamble to watch. Some people may like the serene backgrounds along with the spiritual vibe that gives off while watching the show. Then of course, there are others who may be bored out of their lives of trying to figure out what is going on. Then, there are the folks who watches the show to pass time. It\'s a tough gamble but I hope it\'ll play well for you. Now, phew that was a lot of data to absorb, or rather info. themes from RDG. Otherwise, P.A. Works handles the production of the series.

She is the \'miko\' and host of a powerful divinity.But for some things to care, there are the visuals. P.A Works handles the production of this series and the artwork gives a definition of beauty. As mentioned before, the artwork aesthetics gives the details to the surrounding atmosphere as well as the nature of the series. There\'s the mountain, the shrines, the outfits, and even spirits to match traditional Japanese ethnics. Of course, Suzuhara herself is drawn as a plain girl with the nerdy glasses and braids to match her statue. For one, I am pleased that P.A. Works is involved in this as it gave me a nostologia of Hanasaku Iroha and Tari Tari; at least in terms of visuals.As for the soundtrack, the series maintains a balanced rhythm. It\'s nothing too special to take notice of as most of the time, the OST remains smooth and light. There\'s no intense beats or rock. Rather, there\'s this linear pace of natural sound. The OP song ""Small worldrop"" by Annabel is sung with a smooth voice and at the same time shows some possible foreshadowing. Then, there are the ED songs that plays off the traditional themes again. In the song itself, we can see that Suzuhara is walking as in a possible reference to her development in a modern coming of age/fantasy story.Ultimately, I\'d say this series is a gamble to watch. Some people may like the serene backgrounds along with the spiritual vibe that gives off while watching the show. Then of course, there are others who may be bored out of their lives of trying to figure out what is going on. Then, there are the folks who watches the show to pass time. It\'s a tough gamble but I hope it\'ll play well for you. Now, phew that was a lot of data to absorb, or rather info.', 'I was really excited to try out this new anime this season. I saw its description on this website, and I thought ""okay, that sounds really interesting. A romance between a goddess girl who can\'t touch electricity and her servant protector of sorts."" I even liked the first episode and thought the main character could become one of my favourites eventually. My only complaint was that I couldn\'t make much sense of the anime. But I figured that they would end up explaining things eventually, as it\'s only a 12 episode anime. 7 episodes in, and I have no idea what the hell is going...on.I really don\'t know what\'s going on. All I can understand is that some privileged high school kids with some awesome spiritual powers get to go to the best high school ever and have some weird disputes that I just don\'t understand. There hasn\'t been a single answered question so far even though we\'re more than half way in; in fact, they\'re just making us ask more and more questions every episode. Who the hell is Izumiko\'s mother? Why is Miyuki so weak? Why does the anime go from one crappy plot point to another without explaining anything? Who is Takanagi or whatever? Who are Mayura and Manatsu? What the hell is Masumi? Why do they care about a dying horse so much? Why do they fight? What the hell is up with spirits? Why is there a fan club for Mayuri? Who was that weird guy that asked Izumiko\'s to dance for him? Who is Miyuki\'s father? Who is Izumiko\'s father? Why is the anime named Red Data Girl? I just can\'t make any sense at all of this anime.Art: This is the only good thing I have to say about this anime. The art is good, one of the best I\'ve ever seen. Though I have no idea why the characters except the main two look so bland and unmemorable.Characters: the main character seems like she could be interesting, but she\'s barely in the plot at all. She barely does anything. Miyuki seems like he could be interesting but he just turns out to be a bland boring typical stern anime character. What the hell is up with Masumi, Takanagi (is this how you spell it?), the person who asked Izumiko for a dance, and Wamiya? Why are the Souda siblings so important? Manatsu is just bland and boring. Mayuri is too to the same extent, but she\'s also a bland boring moody brat. There\'s nothing likeable about anyone here.Plot: As I pointed out earlier, the plot doesn\'t make sense. It just jumps from one thing to another without explaining anything. It just is plain bad writing. Worthless.Overall: probably the worst anime I have ever seen--more than even Aku no Hana. 2/10 for good art. on.I really don\'t know what\'s going on.

It's surprising 'cause I'm easily influenced by the reviews here on MAL. Before I watch an anime or read a manga, I always check MAL and read the reviews so as to see if it the said anime/manga is worth it.But before I read the reviews on RDG, I watched a few episodes of it. And well, I really liked it. I think the best factor that got me hooked into the anime was the art (and maybe Miyuki /shot xD) and also the...theme. I always loved Japan and since the theme was about Japanese culture, I got myself interested.Then around the middle of the anime, I got confused. (Yes, just like all of you who watched) Everything was going too fast and nobody was explaining things at all. So, just in case I wasn't the only one, I checked the MAL reviews on this anime. I wasn't surprised to see negative reviews everywhere. All complaining about the same thing I was complaining about.  I was a bit discouraged to watch after reading all of the reviews, but when the next episode came out, I still watched it and even finished. :DSure there were so many unanswered questions but I think the anime was good enough. Although, it should've had more episodes so they could've at least explained some stuff.Okay, let's talk about the characters now.I really liked Miyuki's character development. (And I also really like Miyuki X3) He started of as the lean and mean bully who seemed to hate the world so much he'd rather jump of a cliff. But around the end of the anime, he started to warm up to Suzuhara. (*squeals*) xDThe other characters were okay, but nothing out of the ordinary. Suzuhara was the typical shy girl who struggles to become stronger in the end. Mayura, Manatsu and Masumi were cute, but again, they weren't very interesting. (Masumi got my attention a little bit tho. HE WAS SO CUTE IN THE END)Music was good. I'm not good with critiquing sounds lol but I really liked the bg music and also the music when Suzuhara dances. :3Okay so overall, I really liked RDG and if you're into Japanese culture, fantasy and the likes, then this is the anime for you. ;)But if you're an impatient person and if you don't like getting confused, then I don't think you'll like this anime at all. theme.

Works anime. After creating some wildly successful series like Angel Beats and Another, I had reason to believe that P.A. Works could be developing into a strong production company. Unfortunately, I have to chalk RDG up as a dud in their repertoire. I thought with the plot that this series had, it had to the potential to be really good but fell flat in the two biggest aspects...it\'s story and it\'s characters.The biggest problem with this series is...it tried to tackle way too many sub-plots with not nearly enough episodes to work with. It causes some extremely choppy pacing as well as several unresolved plot points. I found it\'s ""ending"" to be rather ironic since I was feeling the same way Miyuki was when I completed this series. For all the sub-plots going on in this series, it sure did find a way to bore me to sleep. Going back to the limited episodes, this series seemed to set itself up for a sequel and that could be the reason for unresolved plot points. However, I still feel P.A. Works left too many open. This series didn\'t have the closure it should\'ve had, even for a series that would plan on continuing.I found the characters to be another huge weakness to this series. Their actions and lack of development left a lot to be desired. Still, I do believe the lack of character development does span from this series trying to introduce a ton of sub-plots. Really, the best way I can describe it is that this series suffered from an identity crisis. It couldn\'t decide if it wanted to be a plot-driven story or a character-driven story and as a result, it ended up being neither. I found it difficult to get invested in Izumiko and her ""plot"" because it was so damn confusing. It seemed like even the writers were having difficulty trying to figure it out. That\'s not to say it wasn\'t ""good"" because I found some aspects of it to be interesting. However, its progression and explanation is so choppy and so poorly explained that it strongly detracted from the overall quality of this series. Miyuki was one character I really got a bit of a laugh at because there was one episode later on in the series where I called him a male tsundere. You just don\'t see that in anime very often. I can\'t say it really did anything for the series, because the development between him and Izumiko was so hacked that I just couldn\'t become invested in their relationship (if you can even call it that). For the most part, the characters are fairly forgettable. I can\'t say there is one memorable character at all in this series. Maybe Masumi, but even that\'s a stretch.While I did find the story and the characters to be big weaknesses, there were some things the series did rather well. I really loved the artwork as well as it\'s traditional Japanese themes. The one thing I\'ll give P.A. Works is that they are very good with their animation and artistic design. While I did rip this series for having so many sub-plots, that\'s not to say it didn\'t have good ones. I did think the main plot was interesting albeit confusing, but it just seemed so rushed and choppy due to having so many sub-plots. I did find the sub-plot revolving around Masumi to be interesting as well as the one behind Wamiya. The sub-plots in themselves were ""good"" but suffered from choppy pacing and lack of strong progression due to having way too much going on in way too little amount of time. The atmosphere for this series was REALLY good and was what had me coming back week-after-week.All-in-all, it\'s such a shame to see this series fall flat. P.A. Works is one of my favorite smaller animation companies and they\'ve produced some really good anime in the past. However, much like it\'s most popular series (Angel Beats), this needed to be 24-26 episodes in the worst way. It had a good plot and good sub-plots, but it was so overly ambitious with how much this series tried to accomplish. It didn\'t have a smooth-flowing narrative and that in itself, caused some VERY underdeveloped characters. That\'s not to say I didn\'t enjoy watching this series because I did. It\'s just that after it was all said and done, it left a bitter taste in my mouth. I knew P.A. Works had something good going with this series but got overambitious with it. They tried to make it bigger and deeper than it had to be. It needed more of a focus on it\'s main plot and developing its main characters with that plot. It\'s extremely sad that I thought the Souda siblings got more development than the series\' lead characters. I would only recommend this series to those with an interest in ancient Japanese traditions and lore. I found those aspects to be pretty good for this series. However, if you\'re looking for an anime with an excellent story and well-developed characters, it just simply doesn\'t have it and I\'d say give this a pass if this is what you\'re looking for. Even if you\'re looking for a good romance series, this series is poorly advertised in that regard and doesn\'t have a good romance in the least. In the end, I feel its time P.A. Works really starts putting more of a focus on making bigger anime series because the 12 episode format is just not quite getting it done anymore, especially when it came to RDG: Red Data Girl. it tried to tackle way too many sub-plots with not nearly enough episodes to work with.

The story starts out clear enough (Izumiko is to be the new vessel for the Himegami, a mysterious and powerful goddess that could destroy the world, and Miyuki is her reluctant protector… together they must find a way to overcome their differences and figure out the mystery of the Himegami, etc.), but then descends into a mire of seemingly irrelevant side stories and confusing plot points involving clingy triplets, a sick horse, school festivals, student rankings, traditional dancing, and something called...the “World Heritage”.I found that the series had quite a lot of exposition – only it was all about things that were seemingly extraneous to the main story and often longwinded, such as the relationship between the triplets, or the reason why Mayura is so focused on beating Takayanagi. Episode 9 had the most informative exposition about the origins of the Himegami, but even so, there was really not enough action to really give substance to it all. With so little of the main plot is actually explained, and a lot of poor pacing, I was left wondering what the point of it all was.As for the characters, they felt mostly static the entire time, with the exception of Izumiko, who at least actually made some visible effort to change herself. Miyuki seems to have some development in his feelings towards Izumiko, especially in the last 3 episodes, with his growing concern about her, but he’s mostly petulant, and it’s not quite enough to get me to care at all. I can’t say that I felt much attachment to any one in this anime, which is disappointing since there was a lot of potential in the first 2 episodes.The one area in which this anime shines, however, is in the visuals. The backgrounds are really lovely, and the dance sequences and depictions of Izumiko’s kimonos look beautiful. Character design was good but not outstanding. Unfortunately, visuals alone are not enough to carry a series.In the end, the show does pick up just slightly around episode 9, but the ending is inconclusive and dissatisfying – probably a byproduct of having too much source material (6 novels!) and not enough episodes to really develop the world or the characters. The ending is left open and nothing is resolved, suggesting the possibility of a second season. I liked the premise, but this series really needed to have more than 12 episodes dedicated to telling the entire story in a cohesive and comprehensive way, instead of cramming everything into one season with hopes of resolving the confused narrative if a second season was green lit.Final impressions: Started out with a lot of potential, mired by a host of side stories in the middle, and ends with its head just barely above water.Verdict: Source-material syndrome combined with an ailment in pacing. the “World Heritage”.I found that the series had quite a lot of exposition – only it was all about things that were seemingly extraneous to the main story and often longwinded, such as the relationship between the triplets, or the reason why Mayura is so focused on beating Takayanagi.

However, for whatever reasons, that show does not fare well in execution, ending up either forgettable or just plain disappointing. The Spring 2013 season was no exception to this, having a few flops in and of itself. However, personally, one show perfectly encapsulates this idea: P.A. Works' offering, Red Data Girl....Red Data Girl's premise is a hard one to describe without spoiling the first few episodes, leading to a synopsis that does not fully communicate what the show is actually about. The show does actually change locations entirely at the end of the third episode, with Izumiko going to high school in Tokyo and the plot shifting to a larger school conflict. The show itself is filled to the brim with charming, if somewhat generic, characters and the makings of a truly tense school drama. It all sounds fine on paper, but the execution makes Red Data Girl come off as inconsequential instead of truly interesting.What Red Data Girl does right is incorporate many different aspects of traditional Buddhist and Shinto mysticism into the show's own structure, creating a very strange set of circumstances surrounding Izumiko and the rest of the cast. The dense amount of material to take in never feels rushed, with everything happening for an exact reason, abilities and limitations being discussed, and being overall accessible to those with very little background into either spiritual practice. As someone who is enchanted by Eastern spiritualism, seeing how they work with the bits and pieces brought up made me adore this aspect of the series. What I found particularly interesting was the nature of Izumiko's spiritual abilities, and what is later revealed about the spirit residing inside of her. When details about that are finally revealed, they do end up being quite intriguing when you put the pieces together.The execution of the show, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The major problem here is the lack of focus placed on the main plot, which comes across as a wholly-serious popularity contest. The show executes this idea in a way that does not make it sound completely stupid, but it still does not resonate due to the fact that the results of this ongoing major plot are never on screen. Given the context it has with Izumiko and her inner conflict (which is barely any at all), it could have been better-integrated by being executed on-screen instead of just being discussed through dialogue. The dilemma surrounding Izumiko given the spiritual forces inside of her that may potentially bring about the world could have managed to meld into the seemingly mundane main plot to form something meaningful, but instead comes across as trying to do too much and not showing enough of what gets a primary focus. Even then, one element of the basic premise is barely explored, which is Izumiko's strange relationship with technology. It is brought up only once after the first three episodes after being brought up in the premise of the show.There is a basic tenant in visual media: show, don't tell. Given the fact that the source material is a light novel, the overly narrative nature is to be expected, but this is where the magic of animation comes into play. Why constantly mention something happen in the background when you can show a shot of the event? It would be quite easy to do. However, this show refuses to put forward a potentially interesting plot by sticking it within dialogue only. The overall result makes the show feel insignificant and inconsequential.The cast itself is filled with typical moe tropes, but each character definitely feels unique and consistent. Izumiko is your standard shy, glasses-wearing wallflower who wishes to be more out there and make more decisions in his life. Miyuki is a male tsundere but is tolerable despite the fact that he is a jackass in the beginning. Mayura and Manatsu can have some potentially great scenes together, due to Manatsu's ditzy behavior. The characters meant to be seen as villains, though, have very little in the way of characterization or personality, particularly in the case of Takayanagi. The motivation is consistently unclear with him, along with Yukimasa's true motivations, and the show does not do a good job of clarifying either of these.P.A. Works and Studio Easter handled the animation and background art work on Red Data Girl, and just like all of their efforts in recent memory, impress more often than not. This project is no exception in the slightest, boasting a delicate style to its animation that is quite fluid and devoted to making the most out of its supernatural focus. When the show goes into its more spiritual focus, the effects compensate by having either eerily dark, vaguely humanoid shadows or by having grand, immaculately-designed yokai when called for. The background work is also the best yet from Easter, fitting the scenes perfectly and being gorgeous enough to just admire on their own. The opening is rather generic, going through a visual novel-like visual of each of the characters, with their names and everything scrolling by. The ending is walking animation, but yet again, the background art is so beautiful that it can be forgiven. The art and animation are definitely the strongest aspects of the show, despite typical P.A. Works character designs, which can be eerily doll-like.The sound of this show can be a bit of a mixed bag. The score itself is not particularly memorable, but it is effective when utilized. Moments of tension feel tense due to the eerie score, and moments of true supernatural beauty have the score take on this sweeping orchestral sound with folk instrument accompaniment, feeling opulent and beautiful in nature. The opener is particularly generic, being yet another Annabel song that is pleasant to listen to without being too memorable. The Masumi Itou ending theme is also pleasant and not too memorable on its own sans the chorus, but there is just something about the way it is utilized with the ending that makes it feel much more delicate and vulnerable than it actually is. On the voice work side of things, we do get a rather solid set of performances all around, especially from Saori Hayami as Izumiko. Many other big name voice talent shows up every so often, as well (including Romi Park, Rie Kugimiya, and Jun Fukuyama), who always sound great.Overall, Red Data Girl was a show that had plenty of promise. The supernatural Buddhist/Shinto topics have been frequently explored in anime (especially recently), but the way Red Data Girl presented them felt like they could have been fresh and inviting. Instead, the show fumbles its execution by deciding to not show any of what is actually important in favor of events only tangentially related to what is going on. What could have been something fantastic ends up inconsequential and pedestrian.--BREAKDOWN--Story - 5Art - 9Sound - 6Character - 6Enjoyment - 5Overall - 6 Red Data Girl's premise is a hard one to describe without spoiling the first few episodes, leading to a synopsis that does not fully communicate what the show is actually about.

The dilemma surrounding Izumiko given the spiritual forces inside of her that may potentially bring about the world could have managed to meld into the seemingly mundane main plot to form something meaningful, but instead comes across as trying to do too much and not showing enough of what gets a primary focus. Even then, one element of the basic premise is barely explored, which is Izumiko's strange relationship with technology. It is brought up only once after the first three episodes after being brought up in the premise of the show.There is a basic tenant in visual media: show, don't tell. Given the fact that the source material is a light novel, the overly narrative nature is to be expected, but this is where the magic of animation comes into play. Why constantly mention something happen in the background when you can show a shot of the event? It would be quite easy to do. However, this show refuses to put forward a potentially interesting plot by sticking it within dialogue only. The overall result makes the show feel insignificant and inconsequential.The cast itself is filled with typical moe tropes, but each character definitely feels unique and consistent. Izumiko is your standard shy, glasses-wearing wallflower who wishes to be more out there and make more decisions in his life. Miyuki is a male tsundere but is tolerable despite the fact that he is a jackass in the beginning. Mayura and Manatsu can have some potentially great scenes together, due to Manatsu's ditzy behavior. The characters meant to be seen as villains, though, have very little in the way of characterization or personality, particularly in the case of Takayanagi. The motivation is consistently unclear with him, along with Yukimasa's true motivations, and the show does not do a good job of clarifying either of these.P.A. Works and Studio Easter handled the animation and background art work on Red Data Girl, and just like all of their efforts in recent memory, impress more often than not. This project is no exception in the slightest, boasting a delicate style to its animation that is quite fluid and devoted to making the most out of its supernatural focus. When the show goes into its more spiritual focus, the effects compensate by having either eerily dark, vaguely humanoid shadows or by having grand, immaculately-designed yokai when called for. The background work is also the best yet from Easter, fitting the scenes perfectly and being gorgeous enough to just admire on their own. The opening is rather generic, going through a visual novel-like visual of each of the characters, with their names and everything scrolling by. The ending is walking animation, but yet again, the background art is so beautiful that it can be forgiven. The art and animation are definitely the strongest aspects of the show, despite typical P.A. Works character designs, which can be eerily doll-like.The sound of this show can be a bit of a mixed bag. The score itself is not particularly memorable, but it is effective when utilized. Moments of tension feel tense due to the eerie score, and moments of true supernatural beauty have the score take on this sweeping orchestral sound with folk instrument accompaniment, feeling opulent and beautiful in nature. The opener is particularly generic, being yet another Annabel song that is pleasant to listen to without being too memorable. The Masumi Itou ending theme is also pleasant and not too memorable on its own sans the chorus, but there is just something about the way it is utilized with the ending that makes it feel much more delicate and vulnerable than it actually is. On the voice work side of things, we do get a rather solid set of performances all around, especially from Saori Hayami as Izumiko. Many other big name voice talent shows up every so often, as well (including Romi Park, Rie Kugimiya, and Jun Fukuyama), who always sound great.Overall, Red Data Girl was a show that had plenty of promise. The supernatural Buddhist/Shinto topics have been frequently explored in anime (especially recently), but the way Red Data Girl presented them felt like they could have been fresh and inviting. Instead, the show fumbles its execution by deciding to not show any of what is actually important in favor of events only tangentially related to what is going on. What could have been something fantastic ends up inconsequential and pedestrian.--BREAKDOWN--Story - 5Art - 9Sound - 6Character - 6Enjoyment - 5Overall - 6"", ""It's been years since I first reviewed this, so I want to change my review a bit! When I first watched it, I didn't quite understand the context and the culture surrounding it. However, I always find myself returning to this anime as I am personally attached to it for many reasons. It is truly a hidden gem.---------------------------------------------STORY 8/10: It starts off at the Kumano Shrine in the Kii Mountains where Izumiko Suzuhara lives. She lacks self-confidence and does not feel like a normal girl. Any technology she touches stops working. (Spoiler I guess?) -> It is soon learned that she is the next...vessel for the Himegami, a powerful goddess which causes many struggles for her. This is why Miyuki Sagara is sent to protect her from people who want her powers.(Non-spoiler) So it's a nice concept based off of a book series, which I have not read. Everything seemed to flow smoothly until around episode 4. Things start to get confusing and many things are unexplained (or rush through explanations). I think they were trying to fit several volumes of the book into this short anime, not sure that it would succeed for another season. So some of the conflict was not very clear the first time I watched it and I didn't feel like there was much danger when it came to the threats at school. Other than this, it is a great coming of age story about a girl wanting to grow up normally but must bare the burden of the Himegami. It's very centered around Shintoism and Buddhism, which is very interesting.ART 10/10: I was quite impressed with the artwork in the anime, especially the setting. The backgrounds/scenery were gorgeous and set a perfect mood for a Japanese culture-based anime. My favorite background art would probably be when they were in the Kii Mountains, surrounded by nature, or the spirit dimension/plane. The style of the characters were also well done! It had soft, neutral colors and lighting. The clothing design also really fit into nature-centric feel of the anime. I especially love Izumiko and Miyuki's designs. The cover art for the anime is gorgeous.SOUND 10/10: First, the music is wonderful. It is one of my TOP soundtracks PERIOD. It was very masterfully done with so much emotion and set the mood perfectly in each scene. This is also one of the things that kept my interest because of how dramatic it sounded. I suggest anyone who likes instrumental music to look up this soundtrack and just listen to it on a pretty day. The opening song was also good, but I prefer the closing song the most. It's a very cute song (I memorized the lyrics, I love it that much). Aside from the music, I love the voice acting in this anime (Japanese). Izumiko's voice is so gentle and soft, yet has a hint of maturity and strength.CHARACTER 9/10: The two main characters are mostly the reason that I enjoyed this anime so much. I'm sorry to say that the other characters didn't mean as much to me. I did like the triplets, but it was more like icing on the cake. The triplets weren't that interesting or unique as far as personality in my opinion. Izumiko and Miyuki were great, though, with so much development from beginning to end. Izumiko starts off as very shy and lacks self-confidence, but she becomes a lot more confident and strong after going through her struggles. Miyuki starts off hating Izumiko and hating who he was, but in the end, he becomes protective of her. Their relationship is what I love most in the whole anime and it literally made me cry. I like both of their backgrounds which were probably the most carefully explained thing in this series.ENJOYMENT 9/10: The first time I watched this anime, I had trouble following a lot of the information in the story. As I said, they sometimes either don't explain enough, or explain too much that it's too hard to keep up with. I recommend researching a bit about the World Heritage Sites, Shinto legends, etc. to understand some things. I have been to Japan since the first time I watched this and I have watched it 3 times, and I have to say, the last time was much more enjoyable because I understood much more. I especially enjoyed watching the interactions between Izumiko and Miyuki because it gradually changes each time.OVERALL 10/10: I may be biased since this anime has a special place in my heart. Maybe it was just not written to it's full potential because they were unsure if they could make another season so it had to be condensed. I think that the art, music, cultural factors, and concept were very creative and different than I have seen in any other anime. I feel attached to it because of this and that the main characters influence me in my own writing and artwork very much. I recommend it to people who like romance, Japanese culture, and fantasy. People who are impatient with story progression or prefer more action would most-likely not find this anime amusing.I plan to read the novels someday because I am a huge fan of the anime, and even bought the DVD. vessel for the Himegami, a powerful goddess which causes many struggles for her.

It looks good but somehow parts of it fall off and it's a waste.Story:The start was really good, even the synopsis which is why I expected a lot from this anime, expecting it to be one of the best this season even but somehow even with the cute romance part between Izumiko and Miyuki, the end really failed to leave a satisfying ending.There's a lot of confusion in my part maybe because I haven't read the LN but that just makes it more reason that the story should be properly explained...especially to non-readers. Some parts left me confused: Why did this happen? What is the reason for this? Who is this person? The end was disappointing. It did not leave the feeling of completeness to the series and failed to shed some light on some things. It's like it left a lot of holes and nothing to fill it with.I like the concept of it but it failed to deliver. 6/10Art:The art was the one thing that's holding me to this series. That and the fact that I don't drop series even if they are on hold for so long already. Art is one of the strongest points, not a surprise since this is from P.A. works. Sceneries are good, character art is also good. *cough*Miyuki*Cough*9/10Sound: OP is catchy, I don't watch the ED much and the sounds when Izumiko is dancing is also good. 8/10Character:7/10Izumiko and Miyuki develops at the end. The triplets somehow make a development but at the same time I feel like there's something lacking. I just don't like the part where the characters aren't properly explained. For example, what is seriously the deal with her mother. I don't know why technology doesn't work. (or maybe I failed to catch on). Why does Wamiya and Takayanagi look the same? (Or maybe I failed to catch on that too) I don't even get the gist of the judges thing. Nevertheless, the story fails to expound more on characters, their decisions and even on the triplets.Enjoyment:Not gonna lie, even if the story did fail to deliver, I was still somehow kind of hooked on the plot with all the goddess thing and during the times Izumiko does great things inspite of her insecurities. One thing that I really enjoyed was Miyuki and Izumiko. I love their end, but not THE END itself. Although I would have really loved it to see them kiss at the end. :C But like I said, too much confusion so 7/10.Overall:6/10Even though I love those fleeting moments with Miyuki and Izumiko and the art, the story is still an important point and I feel like it's meant a 6 (Fine) rather than a 7 (good).I wish they had more episodes so that it wouldn't feel so fast paced and won't leave that much confusion to the watchers part.So much potential for this to become a good anime but 12 episodes butchered it or maybe it was the story board, who knows.A sandwich is still a sandwich and it's still fine. especially to non-readers.

The triplets somehow make a development but at the same time I feel like there's something lacking. I just don't like the part where the characters aren't properly explained. For example, what is seriously the deal with her mother. I don't know why technology doesn't work. (or maybe I failed to catch on). Why does Wamiya and Takayanagi look the same? (Or maybe I failed to catch on that too) I don't even get the gist of the judges thing. Nevertheless, the story fails to expound more on characters, their decisions and even on the triplets.Enjoyment:Not gonna lie, even if the story did fail to deliver, I was still somehow kind of hooked on the plot with all the goddess thing and during the times Izumiko does great things inspite of her insecurities. One thing that I really enjoyed was Miyuki and Izumiko. I love their end, but not THE END itself. Although I would have really loved it to see them kiss at the end. :C But like I said, too much confusion so 7/10.Overall:6/10Even though I love those fleeting moments with Miyuki and Izumiko and the art, the story is still an important point and I feel like it's meant a 6 (Fine) rather than a 7 (good).I wish they had more episodes so that it wouldn't feel so fast paced and won't leave that much confusion to the watchers part.So much potential for this to become a good anime but 12 episodes butchered it or maybe it was the story board, who knows.A sandwich is still a sandwich and it's still fine."", ""Red Data Girl was the anime of the season that seemed like it was a filler. While it looked nice and was quite visually appealing in terms of animation, its plot and characters did not own up to the nice treatment the animators did in the studio.Story wise, this anime seemed like something that needed a full 26 episode season to convey what they tried to convey in 13. The plot had many major holes, and the story seemed rushed throughout the majority of this series.This is certainly not an anime to watch for the story, and if anything it was just something to...watch because it looked pretty. I believe you can find better out there.Now to go over the major sections:--Characters and Story-- 4/10In summary: Relatively close to current time, there is a girl in the mountains of Japan that cannot touch technology because of what she is. She is a vessel for a shinto spirit goddess, and has really long hair to channel the goddesses power. Suddenly she is assigned a protector mountain monk named Miyuki to prevent evil spirits from doing her harm. Eventually they end up going to a school in Tokyo, they make friends and live happily together for the rest of their school lives after rejecting a lonely spirit.Izumiko is a girl that basically cannot mesh with technology. She touches anything electronic and it breaks, which is caused by her being a yorishiro, that is a vessel for a kami, a shinto spirit god. In terms of her character she is completely helpless in a modern society, and throughout parts of the series she looses control of herself to the kami goddess within her who is the exact opposite of how she is in real life.This reverse mirroring carries onto the male lead character, Miyuki in an inverse sense. Miyuki is a mountain monk, and even though he has completed his training for dealing with spirits and sorcerers, he is practically useless in fighting them. He excels at everyday things, but throughout the series he feels burdened for having to protect Izumiko from society, and those who want to take advantage of her power.And the rest of the characters are extras that don't really make sense and don't seem to fit into what this story became too well.Plot wise, as you may guess Miyuki's feelings of burden slowly transform into love, which makes this story that had so much potential, go completely cliche. And because this story needed to develop into a love story, it completely ruined the epic spirits story that was going on at first.--Animation and Sound-- 8/10The studios that made this did a good job on this at least, so visually speaking you won't be disappointed. The characters faces are kinda flat, but that's about it. I have no real complaints.-- Entertainment Value -- 6/10I always stick bad animes out to the end, and though it was bad, it was still a decent watch.

"", ""Red Data Girl is a series that will not be to everyone's liking, but for those that can appreciate a quiet, contemplative coming of age story with a heavy focus on Shinto spirituality and storytelling through metaphor, this will be one of the best animes you will ever see.First, a bit of advice for watching.  Don't try to follow the plot literally.  Some happenings in this story are meant as metaphor and don't hold up to close scrutiny when interpreted literally.  However, everything that happens makes perfect sense when viewed as a metaphor for the characters, their relationships, and their growth as...people.  Watch those scenes with that interpretation in mind, rather than trying to make literal sense of what is happening.  In the end, this is a series primarily about Izumiko and Miyuki, their growth as people, and their relationship with each other.  The magic and spiritual elements exist to illustrate these things.For all of the fantasy and fairy tale like elements in this series, its focus is all on the characters, and they're very well done and show significant progression throughout the series as they face different challenges and meet new people.  Izumiko and Miyuki both start off as somewhat unlikeable characters, Miyuki moreso than Izumiko, but the show's core is their evolution and growth as individuals.  The Miyuki and Izumiko at the end of the series are almost unrecognizable compared to how they are in episode 1, and all of that growth is well-earned throughout the series.The real highlight of this series however, is the artistic craftsmanship of everything in it.  The artwork and animation is phenomenal, as is the sound, music and voice acting.  There is a scene of Izumiko dancing near the end of episode 3 that is so genuinely beautiful that it caused me to tear up.  It's can't-miss for the gorgeous artwork alone.This is certainly a slower paced series, and those expecting fantasy action or a series that is more focused on its plot and mystery elements than its characters may find it boring or unsatisfying, but this is a real gem of a show for those with the patience to savor its generally serene atmosphere and dig into its many layers of metaphor.  The artwork will absolutely blow you away, and the characters are likable and dynamic.  Do not sleep on this show, especially if you enjoy slower and more intellectual material. people.

The show started off slow paced, it focused more on character development between Izumiko and Miyuki, which really helped develop their relationship, but after that there really wasn\'t much time for the plot.In the end Miyuki is the only character to get true character development, going from a jerk to a decent guy, if RDG did anything right it\'s Miyuki, but that\'s where the good part ends.**********SPOILERS**********As I said the plot progresses slow, leaving the ending incomplete with a scene in the theme...song the never happened(Miyuki and Izumiko\'s kiss) and a plot line left unsolved(Mayura and Miyuki\'s ""marriage arrangement"").When I saw the first episode, even when I read the description, it intrigued me.

More like Red Filler Girl, because that\'s what the entire anime is about -- fillers, and tons of them, that has nothing to do with the main core of the anime.Izumuki Suzahara is a foruteen years-old teenager who, ever since she could remember, has been living in a rather secluded woods area, away from most people\'s sight. She is called the Red Data Girl, or like the opening explains it, ""A girl in danger of going inextinct."" She is apparently carrying some sort of goddess with her, whom appears at random times when she wishes to say or do something important. Otherwise,...Izumuki is a girl secluded from the world in order to keep herself safe from people that would want to hurt her and use her powers for the bad. Along her joins Miyuki, a teenager of the same age that was chosen to manservice the goddess for the rest of his life.RDG is mostly based upon Japanese culture and folklore, history and symbols which might be confusing to one person, but the main issues that lies within the anime isn\'t the heavy lean towards cultural characteristics, but the really bad storytelling done throughout the entire anime. There are many issues discussed, that -- to the the very last episode -- you wouldn\'t understand, and couldn\'t pick on on your own. Even if you tried, you\'d still have no idea what was going.Characters are likeable, though no very important, and sometimes just really shady and odd. They would act very friendly and the next episode, go crazy and dramatically serious for no reason. This confused me more often than not, and honestly brought me to avoid liking ANY of them.Art is extremely good, scenery looks great and I personally also really liked the ending songs. Synthetically, this anime is perfect to anyone that likes pretty faces.Overall, I kept watching since I was excited about Miyuki-kun, considering that he was the only hot character there, and in a sense -- the voice of reason.

RDGs problem is that it plays with quite a few interesting elements. Elements, which are then essentially abandoned or ignored. This is a very low stakes show. Even in times of apparent ""danger"" never do we really feel the characters are at risk. This is a show about a girl whom serves as a vessel of sorts for a hime-gami goddess. And yet at no point does the hime-gami have any major role in the show. It is a show about a girl whose powers interfere with...electrical devices. Yet that also never has a major role nor point in the show. It introduces these interesting elements, then spends most of the episodes off doing other things.To particularly appreciate the show, it essentially has to be treated as a slice-of-life. Simply watch, feel, and listen, without thinking about what the show isn\'t showing. The music, sound, and art is generally excellent. The characters grow on you. Though to be honest near the start they were terrible. The major problem with this show is that it is quite obviously demonstrates its novel roots.

There\'s absolutely nothing to complain about. it gave off a really relaxing feeling.The sound was really awesome. I liked all the OSTs and the opening and ending was awesome.

I have been meaning to watch a anime with less fanservice content or over-the-top-forced-on-yourself plot. I was tempted to the series because of the Poster I saw online. Unlike a typical Shoujo Series (like Code-E etc) the male lead, Miyuki Sagara as we know, looked well mature. Izumiko has a timid and fragile built. So it was evident for first goers to predict the storyline.So it is true. The first episode starts off Izumiko not wanting to accept herself as the vessel for the Goddess Himegami. She is introduced with Miyuki Sagara who becomes horribly rude...to Izumiko. But what it struck me the most that the main lead, our Izumiko was just a fragile girl. So, I inevitably had in the back of my mind that the Production team wants us to learn more about Izumiko's story and her relationship with her alter ego. So I stuck to the series to know more about her.I am not disappointed at all by Izumiku's character development. At least she did not weep most the time. In fact it all made sense when we get into to the ending of series we get to know more about her Alter ego, or the Goddess Himegami possessing her using Izumiko as a vessel.[spoiler]After Izumiko, I loved how incomplete Miyuki's character was. The series starts off with the strong male lead but it only in the middle of series we see him openly confessing that he doubts himself whether being suited for the job that he is chosen for. He says that he doesn't know how to protect her as he doesn't know how to protect his own self. Somehow, it did make sense because at times of our lives, we do become in-confident about decisions and the role given to us.What breaks my heart the most is that the series did not magnify Izumiko and Miyuki's growing closeness. Since as being an ardent Shoujo Manga reader I would expect more of romance. It is only in the few ending episodes we understand that Miyuki thought no longer of her as a burden. Although, the relationship between them grew maturely over the series keeping in mind that they were exposed to wonderful quests that reminded of their of their destiny. It did not give much growth to Miyuki's display of love for Izumiko.[/spoiler]I felt that the Souda siblings arc got more focus than the main plot. Yet, Mayuri, Manatsu and Masumi has a great impact of both of our leads. It was obvious that Masumi, Mayuri and Manatsu's spirit, wanted Izumiko all to himself since she was the one to see him other than his siblings.As obvious as it seems, the series just concluded open ended leaving the fans needing for more. Leaving most of our questions unanswered. Definitely hinting us to read the Original Novel. (It has a manga adaption as well but it is still ongoing. Sadness.)Red Data Girl is a wonderful watch if you wish to know more about Japanese Culture. If you are looking for a mild period series, this series is a recommendation. The scenery is breathtaking. The pace is good. You won't feel being rushed. The information is poured to you bit by bit. A kind of anime that I have been looking for. to Izumiko.

It is very interesting but between episodes seem to be a time gap. It doesn\'t leave any explanation and basically leaves it it up to the viewers assumptions. To the very end I still have no idea what the heck \'The World Heritage Girl\' is. I am very confused but I went with the flow and finished it to the end. I guess I\'m satisfied with the ending but they leave out a LOT...of answers and many holes.

I do however \'ship\' the main characters together.In the end, I give this anime a 7 because even though the concept and art is amazing I still don\'t even know what this anime is about.', ""Story - 4/10In a word: rushed. What is happening in this story? Well, who can really say, out of your typical audience? In the end, I was still just barely able to follow what was happening, but that doesn't mean I was without any sort of confusion. Even if the plot WAS followable (barely), that does not excuse how poorly put together it seemed. Watching this series from beginning to end, it's hard to even accept this as a comprehensive narrative. It does not flow as it should and left me often feeling the pacing was completely off. It wasn't absolutely terrible, and the concepts...themselves could have made for a good story - but the execution was poor. Perhaps with a longer series, this could have been avoided, but as it was it felt very disjointed and rushed.Art/Animation - 9/10The art and animation in this series is honestly beautiful. There's no distracting or over the top effects or filters, either - just some genuinely good art. Overall very enjoyable to watch - not the absolute best it could ever be, art wise, but still pretty damn good. At the very least, where other parts of this series might have seemed dull or disappointing, the art outshone everything and at the very least made up for some of the show's shortcomings.Sound - 6/10To be fair, I watched the dub (not usually my first choice, but it's what was available to me), so I'm not sure how much I can comment on this in general - but it was okay overall. Sometimes the songs seemed overplayed or 'played up' so to speak - their attempts to tell the story through the score sometimes seemed to fall flat simply by way of being too over-exaggerated. Still, generally it was okay.Characters - 7/10The characters in this are overall fairly nice and developed just enough not to leave me with any serious issues, partially perhaps because the true focus is on so few characters in the first place. At the very least, the main characters (Izumiko, Miyuki, Mayara, and Manatsu) were generally okay and I did find myself connecting with them at least on the slightest of levels, which is more than some anime can say. I did feel for the characters and their relationships with each other, but overall the side / minor characters seemed to distract from the story as a whole some, as it wasn't clear just how much emphasis was being placed on them and they did not truly get enough fleshing out for me to care about them or understand them at all. The balance of character focus also seemed to be off in a way that I can't really place; it simply came off as weird overall, especially when sometimes it felt as if the true main character, Izumiko, would often fall to the wayside for focus on characters the audience likely didn't really have any reason to care about.Enjoyment - 7/10It was good and I enjoyed it as a whole, though many parts left me with more questions than answers and some of it (especially the first half) had some clear writing issues and pacing issues et cetera. Still, an enjoyable anime. I may rewatch this and I may not - it isn't something I'm rushing to watch again, but I don't think I'd say no to doing so some day either. And who knows - maybe it will make more sense on a second go. One can only hope.Overall - 7/10 themselves could have made for a good story - but the execution was poor.

I needed something new to watch, and it looked interesting, so I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Then I went on MAL and read all of the reviews complaining about it and decided to write down my opinion.Subtlety is an underrated thing in anime (actually, in storytelling generally, but I'm going to focus on anime). There are too many shows that explain everything that appears on screen, bashing people over the head with long monologues explaining exactly what just happened, or barely disguised exposition...to catch you up to the situation. And it's not just the bad shows that do this; even something as great as Madoka Magica can get bogged down by explanations.However, I personally enjoy when a show does not go to lengths to keep me perfectly informed. I prefer it when I'm just given the clues and I'm allowed to draw my own conclusions. For example, Manatsu and Mayura are not necessarily the most original characters, but Mayura at least allowed some room to develop and deepen because of a number of things about her and her situation that are not explained. It is because I am forced to draw my own conclusions about her that she becomes an interesting character.Of course, that's not the lack of explanation that people are complaining about with this show. People are complaining about the plot. They're complaining about the school and the judges and all of those other little things that are mentioned but never given any explanation. I would agree that those things probably should have been a little more explained. However, at the same time, it's the coyness of the show that keeps it original. If the power struggles, the rules, the goals, and the players were all well known, then this show would not be any different to any other highschool anime. What's unique about this show is that it gives you the clues to figure out the show without handing you the answer.To prevent too much of a rant, I'll leave it at this; RDG doesn't make it easy for you, and, not only does that not make it a bad show, it is also one of the reasons that I liked the show. It's not something I would like if all shows did it, but in RDG's lack of explanation is a welcome relief from the overabundance of overexplained anime. to catch you up to the situation.

While the story wasn't as good as Kekkaiishi, this doesn't mean it was unenjoyable or bad.The plot had a lot of potential, but it wasn't capitalized on. There was an opportunity to go far into the world of spirits, but in a puzzling turn of events, they seem to have gone more slice of life style.Now while slice of life with spiritual elements isn't bad, its the way this anime tried it that...subtracted from the experience. It seemed like the story types were jaggedly cut and attempted to be placed back together to try and form a coherent puzzle.It went from spirits/culture, right into school/life, and back and forth. It felt like the genres were playing tug of war to see which had the right to be on screen more than the other. This caused the story and enjoyment in watching to suffer in turn.The characters archetypes are rather basic, though I do like the lead and her personality for the most part. subtracted from the experience.

There are numerous aspects of it seem as if it tried to create a world much bigger than its run time actually allowed for. Notably, the story constantly feels lost in trying to explain the complex nuances of the universe constructed. This exposition for the viewer is necessary; I won't pretend that whatever rules and customs associated with this ethereal culture is common knowledge to everyone, least of all me. It is disappointing then, that the short run of the series effectively limits the intricately developed world to show...a satisfying and coherent story. If there's anything to say about it, the overarching story is weakly connected by several subplots and vice versa resulting in a vicious cycle of unsatisfying storytelling. I couldn't tell you if there were any loose ends (it certainly felt that way) just because of how upset I was with the handling of the plot.This series should be enjoyed for its art style and aesthetic, with colour schemes and character designs that allow the spiritual nature of the story to shine through. I can't speak on the authenticity of the religion involved, but the outfits, architecture, and general design promote a clean look that seamlessly blends the real and surreal aspects presented; no outfit, demon or spiritual being that appeared looked out of place. I especially appreciated that the music complemented this whole style without ever feeling out of place; especially the opening theme's opening verse with those tastefully dissonant clustered chords. That really sealed the deal and set the tone for the exotic nature of the series.All things considered, this series will be hit-or-miss.

I would suggest this anime to someone who is looking for a short satisfying anime to watch while in between other anime or is just looking for something to do for a short while. I liked this anime because the art was fantastic it reminded me of a watercolor painting (Especially when the characters are in the mountains!) The music that went along with Red Data Girl fit very well. They were very calming and traditional sounds. The characters were fair. When I mean by that is that they weren't very iconic or such but they...were not bad, at all means, they still had some diverse personality characteristics and some very enjoyable moments and as you continue to watch the anime you eventually connect more with the characters and begin to like them. The story itself was fairly good and had interesting twists along with a mysterious vibe.

Even though the episodes may continue at times while explaining things. The story still takes some decoding and moments to review what just happened so that you may gain some what of an understanding of what is actually happening within the story. Even though Red Data Girl may take some time to understand and to notice the hints that the characters give off, it is still a very cute and enjoyable anime to watch. Personally I may even consider re-watching Red Data Girl to fully understand the concept and to put more pieces together in the story. It also makes it easy that the anime is only twelve episodes long.

I want to say there was a plot and plot twists, but I really don\'t understand what happened enough to really say anything about that.Suzuhara is the Red Data Girl, and the story is basically how she balances being special with being normal.

I\'m not really sure about that since the show not only seemed incomplete but also slow, and confusing due to how the show was put together and not because of any constraints.

The characters did not get the same treatment. Many times it felt heartbreaking to see a weirdly drawn character against such beautiful settings. Usually, it is just the main girl who looks weird...but no one else wrote about this so might be a personal taste. Even with the art being beautiful most of the characters look unattractive except the guy who became a crow.The soundtrack felt non-existent because I skipped over the openings and endings and the dances within the show. When Izumiko sings it\'s pretty annoying but it doesn\'t hurt the overall enjoyability. A sign of a good soundtrack is that no one will notice it so it\'s probably done well but I was too immersed in the story to really notice that.One of the worst aspects of ""Red Data Girl"" is its character development. Izumiko starts off as a pathetic loser who one might feel violent hatred for until they introduce her to the worst guy that ever lived who can\'t deal with how weak and pathetic he is himself. This was pretty realistic of them because most normal human relationships probably work like this.That guy, Sagara was supposed to be her love interest(??) everyone in the series teases them and there are signs or something. Sagara basically only hangs around doing his duties to Miyuki out of obligation. Eventually, anything that can be called ""romance"" comes from Sagara wanting to fuck Izumiko\'s goddess alter-ego.Throughout the series, there is a sense of wanting to root for Izumiko who is obsessed with changing from her pathetic demeanor. Her ""change"" only appears as she lashes out at some people towards the end. She\'s pretty much always pathetic and is overthinking because people around her refuse to loop her in and she also never asks questions.

Shadow Skill (1996),https://myanimelist.net/anime/679/Shadow_Skill_1996,"[""Overall/Enjoyment:This was alright. A little slow, but enough to maybe get you interested in watching the TV series. Since this is a fighting show, you have to take it for what it is. The thing I probably like most about Shadow Skill is how the fights take place. I like the use of (Shinto?) card magic in this series, particularly the fact that they give little speeches of their abilities, almost as if they are actual partners. The special techniques (i.e. Shadow Skills) used are similarly interesting.Story:A very rough image of the world is painted and the conflicts and situations are certainly more involved/interesting....A common problem with shonen shows like this however is that they seem to have some trouble developing the non-action segments. Exposition usually comes in the form of inexplicably detailed dialogue, often with strangers, sometimes while fighting, and/or as some kind of inner monologue. This can be a bit annoying (and silly), especially if what is being said is uninteresting or uninformative.Characters:You do get a better sense of the characters and their friends in this one.  Some of the characters names are pretty silly though.Art:The art in this one is different than the previous OVA. It's more solid, colorful and fluid, but also uses some really thick lines and pretty strange designs. Of course it still retains that same weird, old, &quot;perpetually hazy,&quot; look.Sound:The music was ok I guess. I don't remember it evoking too much of a sense of excitement, certainly not very often. The dubbing on the other hand is comically terrible. So much so you may enjoy this show more if you find that kind of thing funny, and have the stomach to sit through some of the worst voice acting possible.

Kidou Senshi Gundam MS IGLOO 2: Juuryoku Sensen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4232/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_MS_IGLOO_2__Juuryoku_Sensen,"['As a fan of MS Igloo I was excited to finally see this in its entirety and was not disappointed.Story and CharactersThe year is Universial Century 0079 at the start of the war when Zeon has just landed on earth. These 3 OVAs are the stories of 3 common soldiers, their weaponary and revenge as their motivation in fighting for the Earth Forces during the period.OVA1\'s protagonist is the conflicted Ben Barberry, notorious as a death god for sucking the life out of his unit but somehow surviving. At the start of the war, Zeon\'s Zaku\'s held the tactical advantage and Ben\'s anti tank...unit is hastily renamed the anti Mobile Suit unit with their weapon of choice being a modified bazooka that fires (larger) anti Mobile suit missiles. Ben and his new unit of fresh recruits are sent to hunt Zaku\'s while providing cover for the Earth Forces Retreat - in other words, a suicide mission.OVA 1 was reminiscent of world war 2 movies where everything is in black and white - the color, the landscape, good/bad, right/wrong, strong/weak. You felt like you were there with Ben struggling to survive and keep his men alive, and if nothing else it drove home 2 messages for me. First, it SUCKS to be ground troops against Mobile Suits. Second, technological superiority DOES matter.OVA 2 had the most tactics as it was a cat and mouse game between two old enemies. Earth Forces tank Ace Herman Yardell survived against the Zaku ace Elmer Snell, the ""White Ogre"" and has sought revenge since. Both men have somewhat of a bushido code, wanting to fight only the best, and go to great lengths to achieve it, including feigning mechanical failure to get out of ""Boring"" fights.At this stage in the war, earth forces tank has clearly somewhat bridged the technological gap to the Zakus and it is a pleasure to watch the genius Yardell (who is nuts) fight.OVA 3 is the story of Arleen Nozen, a technical lieutenant unjustly imprisoned for leaking information to Zeon on the RTX-440 Ground Assault type Guntank. Arleen lives for revenge against the true informant, her ex (lover) because he not only betrayed her but the information leak resulted in her guntank program\'s development being halted with only 3 being produced. The Evil General offers a chance of amnesty to 3 prisoners in exchange for fighting in the battle of Odessa - Arleen accepts. By Odessa, the earth forces now have their own mobile suits so Odessa is the battle to push Zeon back into space.Of the 3 OVA, this one had the best weapon. I thought the Guntank was phenomenal in it\'s flexibility! It had awesome maneuverability, high speed, ability to transform into 3 form factors and a TON of armaments to boot! Oh my god, information on this is truly worth stealing. If development continued this would surely have become a Mobile Armor. This OVA as a standalone would deserve a 9 because of the beautiful plot twist at the end.All 3 ovas had easily identifiable and likeable characters developed in a short period of time, one could even consider their weapons as characters which grow in importance from OVA 1 to 3. The OVAs succeeded in making me cry. However, I felt like the death god theme was misplaced or could have been left out and the story would have been much better. The death god certinly wasn\'t ""needed"" and it seemed like it was put in just to showcase the beautiful animation of this character.Art/AnimationThe Animation was incredible from a technical standpoint (10) but weak in characterization (6) for an average score of 8.One thing that cannot be denied is CGI has made great strides in a short time. I am continually amazed by the level of detail rendered - you can see individual strands of hair, eyelashes/eyebrows, even the pores on the skin of an individual\'s face! Compared to MS Igloo I they\'ve also made great improvements in movement and explosions, these no longer look chunky/block/fake but are instead smoother, rounder and more realistic.The problem is with characterization. The shots of a character acting surprised by widening/opening their eyes bigger is overused and looks artificial. Cel drawings don\'t have the same issue as we are accustomed to exaggerated facial reactions. Igloo 2 suffers from this problem because the art is so good you tend to compare it with what real life people would do and if it isn\'t a realistic reaction or expression in live action it looks artificial in CGI. Now, the women are rendered very lovingly and their expressions are for the most part realistic, but not so for the men in OVA1 and OVA2.SoundIgloo 2 has no OP, but 3 different EDs, all of which tie to their stories so I thought this was inventive and clever. The voice acting wasn\'t as good as I hoped, some of the voices just didn\'t seem to mesh with the character personalities.Enjoyment and OverallI loved how realistic this was. Each OVA was a look through the eyes of a small common soldier, but the overarching theme is Earth eventually caught up with Zeon\'s technological superiority and the entire course of the war changed. All things being said I really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to anyone. I hope to see more MS Igloo. unit is hastily renamed the anti Mobile Suit unit with their weapon of choice being a modified bazooka that fires (larger) anti Mobile suit missiles.

Komadori Movie: Komaneko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7547/Komadori_Movie__Komaneko,"['Komaneko: The Curious Cat is a simple, quiet, and charming stop motion film comprised of a few short stories that revolve around a kitten who enjoys arts and crafts and recording things with his camera.  There is no dialogue, aside from Komaneko\'s occasional ""nyaa!"", it\'s just cute music and adorable animation with cute stories that are mainly about friendship.The main reason why I like this film so much is because it used stop motion animation, which is my favorite, and because there is no dialogue.  The quiet and slow pacing makes it relaxing to watch, and at times very much like...watching an ASMR video, if you are familiar with that.  I actually didn\'t get through this hour long film the first time I watched it because it put me to sleep, but then again it was very late and I had initially put it on to amuse my son, who was wired and refused to lie down.  Komaneko did the trick.  As soon as he saw the kitten moving about on screen he calmed down and within moments leaned his head onto my chest and that was it.  I could have simply shut it off but I was getting into it, until I eventually dozed off myself.I\'d say Komaneko is suitable for quiet movie time.  It actually reminded me of the old stop motion Christmas Specials I used to watch every year on TV, like Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and A Year Without A Santa Clause.  So if you like quiet stop motion shorts that will make your kids shut up so you can get some rest, this may be a good choice. watching an ASMR video, if you are familiar with that.

Kuromi goes around in her flying vehicle and does some random stuff that is sometimes related to whatever the land is most known for. Going to america? She\'s in a broadway show. Going to china?

These people are infused with specific animal DNA resulting in them being able to turn into their animal forms. Okay not the best story wise but the fighting is what really drew me into this anime. Okay I would be lying if it was 100% the fighting, a large portion of it revolved around the amount of HEAVY fan-service in this anime. Which can always boot the enjoyment of an anime as well.The art and animation was really well done. LIDENFILMS has yet to disappoint me when it comes to high quality art and animation.The opening...and ending were so good. The ending was a good head banger/ running song and the op was really entertaining. The music during the show fit it perfectly as well A lot of heavy metal is a great thing when it came down to it.The characters were fantastic. Really i felt only one character did match their animals when it came to personality, each basically fit their characters perfectly.When it came to enjoyment I really loved it. The fights were better then most fights I have seen in DBZ, Naruto, Bleach etc. They were unpredictable and very well animated.Overall this was actually a decent anime to watch. I can see why the score would be swayed either high or low because of peoples tastes, but overall I think this show deserves a little more praise. and ending were so good. The ending was a good head banger/ running song and the op was really entertaining. The music during the show fit it perfectly as well A lot of heavy metal is a great thing when it came down to it.The characters were fantastic. Really i felt only one character did match their animals when it came to personality, each basically fit their characters perfectly.When it came to enjoyment I really loved it.

This could be the best worst anime of 2018.I seriously was waiting for this anime, even though i knew it won't be something humanity wants to remember in the future.This show is utter trash and i love it.If you want to have a good time just watching boobs and people killing each other, then you are in for a hell of a ride....The Story is unimportant and just a framework for the explosive action and eroticism.The music rocks. I have to say, the music is really good, the heavy metal tunes are awesome.The fights rock. You can see them actually fighting instead of talking for half an hour.And the anime is actually funny, i didn't expect that but i had to laugh really hard a lot of times.I really enjoyed the anime.The anime is good in its own way, and shouldn't be judged bad only because it doesn't suit your taste.Don't expect anything great.

""That\'s what Killing Bites is""The story begins when an average college student, Yuuya Nomoto, agrees to go pick up girls with his newly made acquaintances. Little did he know that by picking up they meant kidnapping and attempting a rape. Things don\'t go as planned, though, because Hitomi aka Ratel, the girl they try to mess with, turns out to be a real beast. That all leads to Nomoto getting mixed up in the world of therianthropes and their deadly fights.It\'s easy to understand what Killing Bites is like....Don\'t expect deep and thought provoking story from this show. It is still good at what it wants to be, though. The plot does progress throughout the show, some of the events I have found surprising and the anime was overally engaging and pretty exciting to watch.That is mostly because of fights which are well animated and interesting. The therianthropes\' moves correspond to each animal\'s actual abilities (which are explained during the educational scenes accompanied by some heavy music, a lovely combo). Thanks to that, every character\'s fighting style is different and the outcomes aren\'t always predictable. The show is also full of violence and blood, but it fits its nature and is something I\'ve never found unfitting in this case. Things can also get lewd during the battles but it\'s not the usual, glorified kind of lewd we most frequently see in ecchi shows. It\'s more brutal and won\'t be to everyone\'s liking.The characters are another good point of Killing Bites and aren\'t as shallow as one could expect. Each of them has their own past, reasons and ambitions. Some of the relationships might also get pretty complicated as shown in the last episode. I also like how each therianthrope\'s respective animal corresponds to their personality.I\'m also satified with both visuals and music. The artstyle is nice and the animation is of good quality. I liked the character designs and found them fitting the character\'s personalities. The heavy tones are great and fresh and go well with what we see. The opening song is no different from most of fripSide\'s songs (which is not necessarily a con if you like their style) and the ending song is fresh and catchy. I don\'t have any complaints about the voice acting either and I must admit I kind of fell in love with Youko\'s voice.In spite of minor flaws, the only thing that actually bothers me is the open ending. I doubt there is going to be another season, so people that don\'t follow the manga are left guessing what happens next.All in all Killing Bites is an entertaining and action packed anime that is far from being anything groundbreaking but can be very enjoyable if you accept it for what it is. It\'s well made and I find it worth giving a try. If you simply want some cool action accompanied by (pretty brutal) fanservice, go for it and embrace it as the good quality simple fun it is.

You have been warned!One nights encounter with a beast girl that changed the life of a mediocre student and introduces him to a hidden world of bloody beast fights.Based on a popular manga of the same name Killing bites is an action based anime that also feature elements of sci-fi and ecchi Killing Bites gives us the opportunity to see what exactly would happen...if beneath the hustle of bustle of modern day Japan there exists a hidden fighting arena where some of the societies largest and most well-known corporations and companies have formed vast power blocks that compete with each other via the use of bloody fights between human-beast hybrids called brutes in bloody matches called Killing Bites. Victory on the field will bring the corporations called Zaibatsu’s great fame and the countless rich people that bet on these matches great fortune and delight, but defeat will only result in your cold carcass being carted off as the next match takes over in a never-ending series of blood matches whose only job is to satisfy the rich.Taking place in the modern world the overall story for Killing Bites follows the life of Yuuya Nomoto a somewhat mediocre university student that whether through luck or design has had nothing but an uneventful life where it seems no matter what he does he cannot be successful in it. One night a casual acquaintance of his rings him up asking him to help in picking up girls to which he decides to readily help for friendship's sake. But never in his wildest dreams would Yuuya once imagine that doing would not only result in his friends being ripped to shreds but also introduce him to not just the curious beast girl Hitomi but also introduce him to the hidden world of the killing bite arena’s where not everything is as straightforward as society is. Joining Yuuya in his foray into the world of the ferocious world of killing bites is the direct but unexpectedly kind Hitomi, the cheerful and teasing Eruza and the elegant but arrogant Yoko.Yuuya NomotoYuuya Nomoto voiced by veteran voice actor Wataru Hatano of Fairy Tail and Nogizaka Haruka no himitsu fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A second-year university student initially Yuuya was someone that can be said to be the very definition of mediocrity having until the start of the series been living a life that had been dictated by society. A kind, caring and understanding person by nature Yuuya is someone that can be said to be someone that prefers to stay in the background and not draw attention to himself as he navigates the path called life a fact that he manages to accomplish for the most part thanks to his quiet and calm nature. In the beginning of the series Yuuya was noted to be someone that got scared of the unknown rather easily which is somewhat understandable if you were to see either beast human hybrids fight against each other or your so-called friends being torn into shreds. However, while certainly a mediocre person at first it can be seen that beneath this side of his Yuuya is someone that is responsible and logical and is someone that cares deeply about people whether they are his friends or merely allies something that may seem absurd by the other zaibatsu’s but not so for Yuuya.As the series goes on and Yuuya gets to see more about what the killing bites involves and the true nature of the brutes Yuuya’s attitude gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series Yuuya had a most unfortunate of first encounters with Hitomi and as a result, viewed her as something akin to an unwelcome intruder into his life though not something that he can easily say to her in person. However, as the series progresses and Yuuya and Hitomi interact more this sense of seeing her as a threat gradually disappears as Yuuya starts seeing Hitomi and the other hybrids as lifeforms and not monsters as the other zaibatsu’s have treated them. Because of this Yuuya also developed a determination and desire to save and protect Hitomi from not just the games played by the various zaibatsu’s outside of the killing bites but also inside them as well. As the series goes on this feeling of wanting to protect the hybrids gradually starts to expand as Yuuya gets to see how the other hybrids are treated and viewed by the other zaibatsu which is fuelled by his desire to see them be treated as lifeforms and not tools. While not having much trust in Hitomi in the beginning as the series progresses and as Yuuya and Hitomi overcome challenge after challenge this starts to change as Yuuya begins to place his trust in Hitomi trusting in both her skill and her confidence in navigating the best path to victory. This aspect of trusting Hitomi to make her own decisions on the field rather than issue her commands like other Zaibatsu’s would I felt was a great indication of the trust that was developed between the two. In line with this trust it can also be seen that Yuuya’s personality and attitude also changed with it as for the first time Yuuya was able to make his own decisions that are based on his own reasoning and judgement and for the first time in his life finally take control of his own life and not get caught in the pace of others like he did previously. A change that I thought was well done. The character of Yuuya I felt was an interesting character that while cowardly and unreliable at first gradually got stronger and more determined as the series went on as a result of the increasing trust that he had for Hitomi as well as his desire to be a better person as well. I felt that his voice actor Wataru Hatano did an excellent job at portraying the character of Yuuya.HitomiHitomi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Plastic memories fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A high school girl that Yuuya meets at the beginning of the series Hitomi is a confident, intelligent and fast thinking person that prefers action rather than thinking things through. While a calm girl by nature Hitomi is also someone that shows a certain level of arrogance in her actions that comes from the fact that she see’s herself as the strongest hybrid in the killing bites. A fact that she uses to openly taunt her opponents such is the confidence that she has in her own skills. As a result of her desire to want to leap straight into action Hitomi is someone that can be said to have a very direct personality as she see’s anything that’s unrelated to that as worthless and as a result she views things like bonds and friendships with something approaching disdain. While a brave and a tenacious fighter Hitomi is also noted to be someone that’s also merciful and honourable and will not fight opponents that are too heavily injured a trait that she also shares with fellow fighter Tiger. As with all hybrids Hitomi is also someone that also has a human side to her character and in this it can be seen that in this form her attitude is somewhat different being a polite, kind and sweet-natured girl that has a large appetite a personality more benefiting of a high school girl than her usual attitude does.As the series goes on Hitomi’s personality gradually starts to change as she starts getting used to the team up that had been forced on her. At the beginning of the series, Hitomi was someone that exhibited typical loner attributes as she was quiet and preferred to keep to herself at all times even though it will be better to make friends and create a bond with your guardian something that should be important for all brutes. As a result of her unfamiliarity with normal human social culture, Hitomi was also noted to be someone that got embarrassed with the most minor of things, unlike her fellow brute Eruza. While initially distrustful of both Eruza and Yuuya as the series progresses and they overcome challenges together a gradual bond and trust is eventually formed between them. While Eruza’s naturally playful nature in the beginning often got on Hitomi’s nerves as the series progressed Hitomi’s attitude towards this gradually softened and she learned to treat these as just another aspect of her personality. This gradual thawing of Hitomi’s personality as she starts to realise the importance of bonds and friendships I felt was well done as it highlighted the increasing trust that she had towards not just Yuuya her guardian but also the other brutes that she encounters along the way and realising that perhaps there is more to life than combat after all. The character of Hitomi I felt was an interesting character that had some good development as the series went on. I felt that her seiyuu Sora Amamiya did an excellent job of portraying the character of Hitomi.EruzaEruza voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Gate fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Hitomi’s fellow brutes. A member of an opposing Zaibatsu Eruza initially appeared to be a typically hyperactive high school girl that Hitomi and Yuuya encounter in the course of their journey however as events progress this proves to be not the case. Like Hitomi, Eruza is a member of the brutes but in contrast to Hitomi Eruza’s personality is markedly different. A kind, positive and cheerful girl by nature Eruza is also someone that’s teasing and playful by nature and loves to poke fun at other’s traits that I feel suit her hybrid origin pretty well. Unlike Hitomi, Eruza is also someone that’s intelligent and fast thinking able to approach each situation with calmness and cautiousness and makes great use of tactics to fight her battles. While competitive to a degree Eruza is also someone that knows when the tide has turned and would try to retreat when this occurs rather than fight to the last. However, when pressed into a situation where she can’t readily do so Eruza’s tenacious nature would show up that makes her a ferocious opponent.At the beginning of the series Eruza while calm and composed for the most part was also noted to be somewhat overconfident and was someone that had great pride in her abilities as a brute. While not openly pushing away people away from her Eruza was also noted to be someone that didn’t trust easily something that her life as a brute has forged in her. As a result of this while positive and cheerful Eruza was noted to not have many friends that she can rely on though interestingly enough she’s able to blend more into human culture than Hitomi does due to this aspect. As the series progresses and Eruza gradually learns what friends are this starts to gradually change and she starts forging bonds with others and forging friendships with them. The character of Eruza I felt was an interesting one as in addition to being a capable brute in her own right she also served as a great contrast to Hitomi in terms of both attitude and personality and showed that if you have something to fight for that you would fight even harder to protect it.Yoko MitsukadoYoko Mitsukado voiced by veteran seiyuu Megumi Han of Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is the series main villain. The granddaughter of the president of the Mitsukado Zaibatsu Yoko is on the surface a calm, elegant and composed young woman that is also intelligent, rational and logical. A very determined and haughty person Yoko is someone that is shown to be both very loyal to her grandfather as well as to the Zaibatsu and exhibits great pride in her belief that her zaibatsu is one of the strongest ones in Japan. Additionally, Yoko is shown to have a great deal of respect in the killing bites and the traditions that it represents. As a result of this Yoko dislikes people that are either not serious about the idea and purpose of the killing bites or are misusing it for their own ends which makes her both an enemy of both Yuuya and Shidoh the latter of which she see’s as her most hated enemy. As someone of such conviction it’s perhaps unsurprising to note that Yoko is also a very adept strategist and is able to prepare for many different situations while at the same time thinking several steps ahead of her opponents in order to achieve her aim. In this she’s shown to be not only ruthless but also someone that doesn’t let rules hinder her showing that as long as her goal is achieved in the end nothing else matters.In the beginning of the series it was noted that Yoko while believing fervently in the main ideas of the killing bites was someone that viewed the hybrids as assets but not lifeforms and as a result of seeing Yuuya and Hitomi’s relationship grow as they grew to trust each other gradually saw him as both a rival that she had to crush and an enemy that stood against everything that she believed to be true from the killing bites. As a result of this Yoko become determined to crush Yuuya and crush what she see’s to be the foolish sentiments that Yuuya has. This, in turn, is reinforced by her view that Yuuya is someone that is not even qualified to be at the same table as she is.  The character of Yoko I felt was an interesting one as in addition to being a rival in the killing bites Yoko was also someone whose views on both the killing bites and on brutes, in particular, were polar opposites to Yuuya. This clash of both personalities and beliefs that were played out in the killing bites I felt was well done and appropriate as it allowed them to settle their differences on something that both are invested in. I felt that her seiyuu Megumi Han did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yoko.AMVIn terms of animation, I thought that the series various locales and settings were well designed and though limited showed a good variety in the types of areas that the fights took place in. The designs for the various characters and especially the brutes I thought was well done and I really appreciated the great variety of animal types that was used as the template to create the brutes. The combat between the brutes which also serves as the series main premise I thought was not just well designed but also well animated and really showed how brutal and gritty such fights would be. In terms of music, I thought that the series OST did a great job at providing the scenes with music that matched the feelings that each scene invoked in us. The series opening and ending themes also did a great job of creating a sense of anticipation for the series as well. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job at voicing their assigned characters with Sora Amamiya, Maaya Uchida and Megumi Han deserving special praise for their portrayal of the characters of Hitomi, Eruza and Yoko.Overall Killing Bites was an interesting anime that I really enjoyed seeing with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, characters, combat scenarios and voice acting.The main premise of Killing bites is, of course, the titular fights between the brutes that are overseen by large and very ancient corporations called Zaibatsu’s. These fights between the brutes that are fielded by the Zaibatsu’s I thought was interesting as while also gritty and brutal it not only gave us the opportunity to see the types of animals that were used to create the hybrids that would fight for the zaibatsu’s when the time came but also look at the way that said zaibatsu’s treated their brutes. In the case of the former the types and identities of the animals that were used as the source of the traits for the hybrids I thought was surprising as not only did it use the more common ones like lions but also rarer ones like the honey badger and the pangolin the latter of which I had to look up as it was a term not seen before. This use of the traits of some of natures most powerful creatures on the brutes that will fight on the Zaibatsu’s behalf I thought was an interesting idea and helped bring into reality the childish dreams that many kids would have about such fights. In the case of the latter which was the Zaibatsu’s treatment of the brutes that serve them, I thought that the series did a great job of showing how the brutes are treated. While the sacrifices that each brute has paid for gaining their new-found power is immense it can be said that this also contrasts with the treatment that each Zaibatsu treats them. While some Zaibatsu’s treat their brutes as careful investments that are to be used carefully others only see them as tools that are to be discarded when they have lived past their usefulness. This mixed view on the brutes that are literally putting their lives on the line for them I thought did a good job at showing just how brutal and gritty the world of the killing bites can be as they must not only do well to enhance the prestige of their zaibatsu but also to ensure that they aren’t put down for being useless.While the brutes can be said to serve as the main contestants for the killing bites it can be said that they are not the only ones that have a stake in the competition whether it’s within the single dual killing bites or the larger destroyal as without someone that can vouch for them and support them a brute no matter how powerful cannot enter the killing bites. As a result, a certain level of bond is needed between a brute and their financier whether that person is a zaibatsu or a single individual as the mc was. This bond between the two I thought was an interesting one as it not only reflected on the trust that exists between the brute and their financier but also shows that in the competition they are in this together. This bond while not always applicable to all zaibatsu’s was I felt used very well when used with the mc and Hitomi and only served to enhance the relationship that the two forges over the course of the series. The feeling that the lives of someone that you have bonded and befriended with has been placed in your hands and can change based on the decisions that you make during the matches I thought only served to reinforce the level of trust that both have for each other in the unforgiving fields of the killing bites.Overall Killing Bites was an anime that while having an interesting premise in the form of the fights between brutes also had a deeper story in the form of the forging of bonds between a brute and their financier that served to improve both as they confronted the harsh and bloody world of the killing bites and was something that I really enjoyed watching. While let down somewhat by underdeveloped characters and some odd pacing issues I thought that the series still did well in showing the brutal fights between human-beast hybrids that are betted upon by rich people in their hundreds while also paring that with a decent story that was populated by some well designed and developed characters. One thing the series I thought the series did well if I might add was its use of unexpected twists in the story which was much more apparent in the latter part of the series.  As a final score, I would give Killing Bites a 7/10. if beneath the hustle of bustle of modern day Japan there exists a hidden fighting arena where some of the societies largest and most well-known corporations and companies have formed vast power blocks that compete with each other via the use of bloody fights between human-beast hybrids called brutes in bloody matches called Killing Bites. Victory on the field will bring the corporations called Zaibatsu’s great fame and the countless rich people that bet on these matches great fortune and delight, but defeat will only result in your cold carcass being carted off as the next match takes over in a never-ending series of blood matches whose only job is to satisfy the rich.Taking place in the modern world the overall story for Killing Bites follows the life of Yuuya Nomoto a somewhat mediocre university student that whether through luck or design has had nothing but an uneventful life where it seems no matter what he does he cannot be successful in it.

The character of Eruza I felt was an interesting one as in addition to being a capable brute in her own right she also served as a great contrast to Hitomi in terms of both attitude and personality and showed that if you have something to fight for that you would fight even harder to protect it.Yoko MitsukadoYoko Mitsukado voiced by veteran seiyuu Megumi Han of Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is the series main villain. The granddaughter of the president of the Mitsukado Zaibatsu Yoko is on the surface a calm, elegant and composed young woman that is also intelligent, rational and logical. A very determined and haughty person Yoko is someone that is shown to be both very loyal to her grandfather as well as to the Zaibatsu and exhibits great pride in her belief that her zaibatsu is one of the strongest ones in Japan. Additionally, Yoko is shown to have a great deal of respect in the killing bites and the traditions that it represents. As a result of this Yoko dislikes people that are either not serious about the idea and purpose of the killing bites or are misusing it for their own ends which makes her both an enemy of both Yuuya and Shidoh the latter of which she see’s as her most hated enemy. As someone of such conviction it’s perhaps unsurprising to note that Yoko is also a very adept strategist and is able to prepare for many different situations while at the same time thinking several steps ahead of her opponents in order to achieve her aim. In this she’s shown to be not only ruthless but also someone that doesn’t let rules hinder her showing that as long as her goal is achieved in the end nothing else matters.In the beginning of the series it was noted that Yoko while believing fervently in the main ideas of the killing bites was someone that viewed the hybrids as assets but not lifeforms and as a result of seeing Yuuya and Hitomi’s relationship grow as they grew to trust each other gradually saw him as both a rival that she had to crush and an enemy that stood against everything that she believed to be true from the killing bites. As a result of this Yoko become determined to crush Yuuya and crush what she see’s to be the foolish sentiments that Yuuya has. This, in turn, is reinforced by her view that Yuuya is someone that is not even qualified to be at the same table as she is.  The character of Yoko I felt was an interesting one as in addition to being a rival in the killing bites Yoko was also someone whose views on both the killing bites and on brutes, in particular, were polar opposites to Yuuya. This clash of both personalities and beliefs that were played out in the killing bites I felt was well done and appropriate as it allowed them to settle their differences on something that both are invested in. I felt that her seiyuu Megumi Han did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yoko.AMVIn terms of animation, I thought that the series various locales and settings were well designed and though limited showed a good variety in the types of areas that the fights took place in. The designs for the various characters and especially the brutes I thought was well done and I really appreciated the great variety of animal types that was used as the template to create the brutes. The combat between the brutes which also serves as the series main premise I thought was not just well designed but also well animated and really showed how brutal and gritty such fights would be. In terms of music, I thought that the series OST did a great job at providing the scenes with music that matched the feelings that each scene invoked in us. The series opening and ending themes also did a great job of creating a sense of anticipation for the series as well. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job at voicing their assigned characters with Sora Amamiya, Maaya Uchida and Megumi Han deserving special praise for their portrayal of the characters of Hitomi, Eruza and Yoko.Overall Killing Bites was an interesting anime that I really enjoyed seeing with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, characters, combat scenarios and voice acting.The main premise of Killing bites is, of course, the titular fights between the brutes that are overseen by large and very ancient corporations called Zaibatsu’s. These fights between the brutes that are fielded by the Zaibatsu’s I thought was interesting as while also gritty and brutal it not only gave us the opportunity to see the types of animals that were used to create the hybrids that would fight for the zaibatsu’s when the time came but also look at the way that said zaibatsu’s treated their brutes. In the case of the former the types and identities of the animals that were used as the source of the traits for the hybrids I thought was surprising as not only did it use the more common ones like lions but also rarer ones like the honey badger and the pangolin the latter of which I had to look up as it was a term not seen before. This use of the traits of some of natures most powerful creatures on the brutes that will fight on the Zaibatsu’s behalf I thought was an interesting idea and helped bring into reality the childish dreams that many kids would have about such fights. In the case of the latter which was the Zaibatsu’s treatment of the brutes that serve them, I thought that the series did a great job of showing how the brutes are treated. While the sacrifices that each brute has paid for gaining their new-found power is immense it can be said that this also contrasts with the treatment that each Zaibatsu treats them. While some Zaibatsu’s treat their brutes as careful investments that are to be used carefully others only see them as tools that are to be discarded when they have lived past their usefulness. This mixed view on the brutes that are literally putting their lives on the line for them I thought did a good job at showing just how brutal and gritty the world of the killing bites can be as they must not only do well to enhance the prestige of their zaibatsu but also to ensure that they aren’t put down for being useless.While the brutes can be said to serve as the main contestants for the killing bites it can be said that they are not the only ones that have a stake in the competition whether it’s within the single dual killing bites or the larger destroyal as without someone that can vouch for them and support them a brute no matter how powerful cannot enter the killing bites. As a result, a certain level of bond is needed between a brute and their financier whether that person is a zaibatsu or a single individual as the mc was. This bond between the two I thought was an interesting one as it not only reflected on the trust that exists between the brute and their financier but also shows that in the competition they are in this together. This bond while not always applicable to all zaibatsu’s was I felt used very well when used with the mc and Hitomi and only served to enhance the relationship that the two forges over the course of the series. The feeling that the lives of someone that you have bonded and befriended with has been placed in your hands and can change based on the decisions that you make during the matches I thought only served to reinforce the level of trust that both have for each other in the unforgiving fields of the killing bites.Overall Killing Bites was an anime that while having an interesting premise in the form of the fights between brutes also had a deeper story in the form of the forging of bonds between a brute and their financier that served to improve both as they confronted the harsh and bloody world of the killing bites and was something that I really enjoyed watching. While let down somewhat by underdeveloped characters and some odd pacing issues I thought that the series still did well in showing the brutal fights between human-beast hybrids that are betted upon by rich people in their hundreds while also paring that with a decent story that was populated by some well designed and developed characters. One thing the series I thought the series did well if I might add was its use of unexpected twists in the story which was much more apparent in the latter part of the series.  As a final score, I would give Killing Bites a 7/10."", ""To keep it short.Too much rape. Pretty grim stuff, a couple of people are raped and Cheetah gets aggressively molested. Main male protagonist is pretty much background noise in a cafe, not important one bit. Hitomi is rather sexy with a severe dad complex. Usagi Chan was a cutey, would protect. That ending was, well... bad.A bizarre animal-human hybrid dystopia? alrighty then.It's not a nice world this takes place in. It is a very sad place. Everyone has an ulterior motive, people get killed for no real purpose, the people who should die, don't, rape is common sight. This does not make me happy.

That\'s what Killing Bites is."" Your gonna hear that ALOT in this anime.Killing Bites REALLY isn\'t for everyone, it\'s for what LA would say is like one of those 90\'s violent schlock animes...that somehow sprung into the Winter of 2018. Well by violent schlock LA can say that Killing Bites has gory uncensored action, attempted rape, sadistic and unmoral characters and hell even the core concept of this anime is essentially a battle royale animorphism cockfighting and you know what...LA kinda loved it for all it\'s violent schlockiness.Killing Bites has some character developments towards the plot which focuses...on the before and during the Destroyal (aka. team battle royale). The two major character developments goes to our useless main male protagonist who was thrusted into the Killing Bites Yuuya Nomoto voiced by Wataru Hatano, who is Hitomi Uzaki\'s pushover minder. For such a bland main male protagonist, he DOES develop in the case of his life always being told what to do and him coming out in making his own path by the end of the series. The more interesting character however is the one that ALWAYS says the quote above, Hitomi Uzaki, an animorphic ratel/honey badger. She\'s self-centered, abrasive as all hell and doesn\'t give a crap besides fighting. She herself is given some sense of a backstory and why she is who she is for majority of the anime and even though Killing Bites has no ""tact"", Hitomi\'s backstory gives at least a bit of levity to Hitomi\'s situation in the first place.As for minor characters, for the most part, we do get to see the backstories of many of Hitomi\'s opponents as well as their animorphism before their gruesome demises by the end of it. Some of Hitomi\'s teammates has some small backstories like Ui Inaba (Rabbit) voiced by Sumire Uesaka, always the scared character has some weird ending as to why she\'s here to why Ichinosuke Okajima voiced by Toru Okawa is participating in the Destroyal and heck even some of Hitomi\'s buddy-rivalry with Eruza Nakanishi voiced by Maaya Uchida has plenty of screentime with her as well as Youko Mikado voiced by Megumi Han, a player in the Destroyal as well as her reasoning in competing in it.Now for a battle royale setup of an anime your expecting that Hitomi has ALL the plot armour and to that yes and no, yes as she does have plot armour disguised as Hitomi\'s animorphic trait kicking in to save herself but she gets beaten up pretty badly later down the anime and STILL survive a probable fatal wound. But the ""no"" definitely comes up in at the end result of the entire Destroyal but LA wouldn\'t spoil you on THAT outcome.Killing Bites has also some actual factual things concerning the animals in question, some LA didn\'t even know existed, but the most focused on is the Ratel (or Honey Badger). Now Killing Bites does tend to exaggerate the honey badger for the sake of the plot and Hitomi\'s physical and mental prowess as a fighter but Killing Bites does it and it\'s actually is oddly informative about the animal in question, like the rabbit, cobra, gecko, tiger, lion and crocodile and how the animal traits and factors are used in battle, especially with the over exaggerated narrator Junichi Sawabe makes it synergically interesting to watch animal essentially cockfighting while information about them is given to us and us connecting the dots to the fight much easier.And finally before getting into the technicals, Killing Bites always end the segment with Oshie Nodoguro voiced by Sayaka Harada who ""acts"" like a honeyguide animorphic however isn\'t one and she mainly interacts with Hitomi in some comedic skits with her and she\'s pretty funny all things considered.In terms of animation done by LIDENFILMS.......this is LIDENFILMS bread and butter in terms of gritty atmosphere and gruesome battles, LIDENFILMS by all accounts know how to make these bleak atmospheric yet exhilarating battles and it\'s as bloody or gory as all hell. LA would give props to the character designs in both the human and animorphic aspect to them (as they have the entire human form is similar to their animal form). The battles are uncensored gory messes and yes the fanservice by all means is there and shown in rather detailed and sometimes intentionally fan-DIService manner, but yeah it\'s LIDENFILMS, they do this kind of stuff and this was what LA expected from LIDENFILMS. It just has all the hallmarks of their work and detail in violently detailed animation with gritty atmosphere (see Schwarzesmarken).As for voice acting, well LA has seen a bit of Sora Amamiya playing up the abrasive type and she goes all out as Hitomi. From voice actors like Maaya Uchida and Sumire Uesaka did pretty well but Megumi Han as Youko Mikado was pretty interesting as well (though at first LA mistook her for Shizuka Ito) as Megumi Han goes apeshit hammy in this role (and no that\'s NOT a pun), kinda makes sense due to the nature of Killing Bites but still. The voice cast overall is hammy most of the time with some interesting casting here and there but the best voice actors for LA would be a tie between Megumi Han and Sora Amamiya just for some of the overtop craziness they displayed.Killing Bites does have some vague themes on corruption which does concern the Destroyal itself and the founders and it\'s companies that are betting on the winner without a care in the world for those who have DIED in the Destroyal with the best counterpoint link to this being Youko Mikado herself and her reasoning in participating however Killing Bites is obviously blatantly showing us of human\'s greed is everywhere and what lengths of corruption for them to keep their greed to the point of death and their scummy ways time and again by even having the Destroyal in the first place but *ahem* vague themes...Killing Bites is by far LA\'s guiltiest pleasure anime of Winter 2018 in all it\'s violent schlock, narm in it\'s more dramatic moments and being informative about animals all under the umbrella of a battle royal animorphic cock-fighting show, it\'s one batshit crazy concept and Killing Bites just takes and runs with it without a care in the world what anyone thinks because Killing Bites has no tact in keeping things innocent. Killing Bites just doesn\'t give a shit and LA doesn\'t think it really doesn\'t care WHO it offends and LA frickin\' loved it for having that atmosphere about it. Mind you, LA was initially put off by Killing Bites at first but grew on LA as LA got to know Killing Bites a bit more and as it went into the Destroyal, LA\'s attention was all in for the violent madness that unfolded.

I may have watch this all the way through purely out of appreciation for the Honeybadger meme...that and the T&A.I\'m fairly certain that anyone who has watched even one season of anime will recognise this for what it is. Ecchi battle anime. Surprisingly, there\'s even the semblance of a story too...just don\'t expect much.All of the characters, and I do mean ALL, are very one dimensional, the artwork and animation is average, the music is rather forgettable but, in terms of Ecchi, it\'s actually pretty decent. They do manage to make several of the female characters believable and sexy while making...them appear capable of the kind of fighting depicted in the anime (there\'s more than a few pairs of ""muscular Thighs""). That rather surprised me. I was also surprised by how the final episode panned out...they clearly intend to make more of this.One additional little treat is the end credits sequence, I got one or two solid laughs out of it. them appear capable of the kind of fighting depicted in the anime (there\'s more than a few pairs of ""muscular Thighs"").

Honestly, it has a decent bgm and the plot had something going (yeah not anymore) but, but it reeks of unnecessary fan service and eroticism. Which pretty much overshadow its very few redeeming qualities.Hitomi, our main female protagonist is basically a craze-fighting lunatic, who has a fetish for a heartless mad scientist and is a free ticket to jail (as despite her appearance she is in high school fighting in a game for adults). Which pretty much put our other main protagonist in danger of being...sent to jail, as he is a freakin' college student.Well, no worry because it wouldn't be a concern to our main hero, as there is little to no development between any of the characters, except for a few perverted antics for our pleasure-seeking brethren.Aside from all the unnecessary fan service and eroticism and almost zero characters development, this train-wreck of an anime provided me. I can't put help feel annoyed whenever I hear Hitomi yell out her retarded one-liner in every freakin' fight she gets herself into.

No joke.The story is admittedly quite slow but after the first 4 episodes there's enough madness to keep you interested and as the show...creeps to its conclusion it's easy to doubt that there will be much of a spectacular ending to the show, after all most anime don't venture very far from conventional story telling. However, death is very much a big part of the show, don't let the personalities of the characters fool you.  If they seem too carefree it's due to their mafioso outlook towards the world.The combat covers every conceivable outcome, from thrilling second to second brawls to 10 second borefests.  But you might wonder why I score this show so high and that's due to its UNPREDICTABILITY.  The best fights aren't always between the predictable characters and some built up fight end up very standard mainly due to how animal fighting styles differ or are so similar between the combatants.Admittedly, it's pretty safe to assume that the smaller the animal is that the fighter's animal is based on, the more dangerous the fighter, but again UNPREDICTABLE.   Even if it feels standard at first, just enjoy the cheesiness and wonder about every possible way the show could go, because you will almost certainly be wrong.The characters aren't deep but it's obvious that this show is starting from the ground and building the characters up.  The ost is just all around enjoyable with its guitar riffs and very much above average OP and ED.  Art wise I never so anything bad, sure it could be better but as far as an adaptation goes, it was no more and no less than 100% accurate.I pray for a second season to unfurl some time in the future, but honestly the ending of this makes me wonder whether a sequel could surpass the hype that this first season was able to create. creeps to its conclusion it's easy to doubt that there will be much of a spectacular ending to the show, after all most anime don't venture very far from conventional story telling.

You have a great time, but in finishing up after your session, you make the realization that you just so thoroughly enjoyed the last several minutes and it makes you disgusted–both with the content, and with yourself. Dejectedly tucking your shrinking chub into a more comfortable position, you expel a knowing sigh. You\'ll be back for more.Killing Bites is degenerate, cheesy, over-the-top trash.

Yes I would.', 'I have to say, I started up with this anime because I saw it on Amazon. Watched a few episodes and thought that the little bit of information the show gave on the different animals was actually interesting and helped provide an understanding to the characters actions.At the start the anime seemed like it was going to be 90% about the fan service, but the actual fights were interesting and decently well thought out, pulling in the characteristics of real animals and the way they would likely interact in the wild was pretty good. I liked both the main and sub-main characters as they fit...into their roles pretty well. Both Hitomi and Nomoto progressed and developed throughout the season.So I decided to look for the manga and after a binge session of that I returned to the anime to watch it the rest of the way through just to give it the fair shake and see how everything was done in the anime.Let me just say, there is a reason why I gave this a 7/10 for overall and 7/10 for character and story. They go through this drawn out process of explaining the characters back story, which was good, I enjoy exposition because it actually allows us to relate to the characters on a more human level; but then after establishing that there was an extremely high bond of trust (not only though dialogue out lout but also internal dialogue), they make their main character completely betray that bond. This is not only breaking the few character rules they set up through the story but also the rules they established for the animalistic side of the character.And for those whom haven’t read the manga and know what is coming in Season 2, skip over the next two paragraphs, but this is very essential for those that have watched through to episode 12 and are as pissed off about the ending as I am…I read to that part of the manga and was disgusted with this choice in the story; it’s lazy, it’s poor character development and it defeats the ability to identify with either of the main characters from that point on. Hitomi’s character through the show is established to not care about killing that which is not a challenge to her. She thirsts to be the strongest among the beasts and then they turn around and have her basically assassinate the character she was established to have trusted, completely and totally out of the blue.Then they turn around and make Nomoto into a pseudo bad guy; planning his revenge against a person whom he had developed feelings of adoration towards. They would have been better off to not have her attack him at all and tell him to run away, to never show his face again, but him to return to help her break free of the corporations control and free from her bond with Reiichi Shido. Overall this plot line detracts from the series and I feel it was a very flawed design that will turn many people off of wanting to watch more if the anime is completed through a second season.If you skipped the above you can read the rest without worry...As for the rest of the scores, the actual animation was well done, a mix of mediums which works very well together along with organized and well placed ambient music tracks that only serve to add to the drama on screen. I liked the overall character designs and the concepts of the fights and how they worked out. I am a bit confused as to how Hitomi’s arm was reattached but I’m just going to write that off on science fiction DNA mumbo-jumbo and give it a pass.Up until the last episode of the first season, the story was well done; (if only they could ret-con the end of episode 12, we’d be great), but overall the show hit where it should for the audience it was written for. Would I tell my friends it’s worth watching? Yes; but with the caveat of informing them there was an extremely bad, and poorly written plot twist at the end.This could have been a 9 or 10/10 show, but poor writing for the end of the season destroys what could have been great and turns it into any other poorly written anime/manga series that will likely die in its second season. into their roles pretty well.

There\'s quite a lot to unpack with Killing Bites and it\'s got me worried I\'ve bitten off more than I can chew. Nonetheless I\'ll just go right ahead and sink my teeth into this one (okay no more puns).Killing Bites is a death game anime based on the manga of the same name. This particular flavor of the genre is that the four corporations that rule...over Japan\'s economy hold a recurring battle royale to redistribute power using genetically modified animal/human hybrids. Now my personal experience with these sorts of anime are currently limited to Fate:Zero, Fate:Stay/Night, and now Killing Bites and I\'m beginning to find some fundamental problems that inhibit my enjoyment of the genre. That being said I had an absolute blast watching Killing Bites despite it\'s many flaws.Our main character Hitomi is a Hybrid based on a Ratel, or the Honey Badger as the internet would call it. Hitomi\'s personality sculpted to reflect that of an animal that just could not give a shit about anything or anyone is a fun take on the full of themselves protagonist commonly found in these sorts of shows. On that note most of the Hybrids in the show having personalities and fighting techniques centered around their specific animals traits are what brought a lot of charm to the table. Unlike the Fate franchise and it\'s habit of breaking immersion with world-shattering plot twists pulled out of thin air; if you have watched a healthy amount of the Discovery Channel you can get a grip on how a lot of the fights in the show will play out.As far as death game plots go I found this one handled the usual questions of ""Why are the fighters okay with this? Why are these people so terrible? Wouldn\'t it be easier to do X instead?"" being reasonably explained by the shows world building and plot particularly close to the end of the show. The show handles it\'s setting fairly well as billionaire government controlling entities being totally cool with pitching their experiments against each other in battles to the death for more funding for more experiments being pretty believable.Our throwaway self insert soft bellied male protagonist, Nomoto, had me very worried his blandness would reflect poorly on the show looking back on it and it to tell the truth it did, however by the end of the season I really enjoyed what he contributed to the plot.Sound design was... mostly bland with most of the tracks for the show feeling bare-bones enough to fit the mood with nothing standing out as really jamming or hype building. I loved the OP and the ED however so a lot of points were picked back up there.Probably the biggest glaring issue with Killing Bites was its art direction. The show really struggled with the bigboi enemies who have complicated movements or a lot of parts (like scales) presenting a dilemma. What do you do when you have to animate a bunch of moving parts and intricate lines for multiple episode long fights? Sadly that answer is almost always cheap CG. We\'re talking almost Kemono Friends or Berserk 2016 levels of bad here which makes me wonder what could have been. Generally character designs were interesting, hilarious, or just generally fun with enjoyable fight scenes but the two CG heavy offenders I feel will really put a nasty taste in how people will look back on the show.Overall, despite the absolutely insane amount of fan-service littered throughout the show if you asked me if Killing Bites is just another Fur-bait ridden garbage fire I would say no. Despite Hitomi\'s catchphrase making me audibly chuckle the other half of those times I felt pretty hyped up. Despite fight scenes being half horrendous CG the other half was rad animal fact fueled shenanigans. Despite only being interested enough in the plot to stay for the whole show and ready to shelve it as a one off experience Killing Bites reeled me back in so hard with it\'s last 5 minute reveals and plot twists that I HAVE to see how this shitstorm plays out in the manga.I laughed, I smiled, I enjoyed myself, and that\'s all I can ask for right?""It\'s not about who won AotS. The one with the sharpest fangs wins! That\'s what Killing Bites is!""Edit Extra Note: I cannot wrap my head around why the scummiest characters in these stories always get to live. Characters like Shinji Matou and an character in Killing Bites. Other characters dies no problem, these stories don\'t shy away from killing off characters but for some reason the MC will take pity on these characters that had they gotten their way would have literally murder raped them. Generally the scumbag goes through some painful ordeal and that seems to be deemed by the author as enough penance for being a murder-rapist with no actual justice dealt. The character may be presented as reformed but it reeks of a toxic perception being given to individuals that should be at the minimum locked away for life.

You might find it interesting, but it just depend on you if you like it or not. Might be a little spoiler but I'll try not to.Story (7/10): The story was alright. Lots of fighting and lots of fan service (which is good). I think in episode 11 or 12 I found it interesting and also feel horrible at the same time. The ending on episode 12 really was unpredictable but was predictable as the same time too because I already knew something was up when... (STOP I can't spoil this sorry).Art...(10/10): Nothing to be concern about this.Sound (10/10): It's great.Characters (6.5/10): Okay now this might be a little rough and sad but tell me tell you why because what you about to watch is nothing like before. Let's start with the character name Yuya Nomoto. He's a university student who got caught up in the battle between animals or should I say he was actually forced to be in it by Reiichi Shido (who I don't like him). Nomoto is not what you think he is when you watch the anime because he is mostly useless in the rest of the story. Hitomi Uzaki is a Honey Badger hybrid. Hitomi is Shido's guardian but he left her with Nomoto so she can participate in the game. Basically, Nomoto is just a tool used to let Hitmi to get in since Shido can't do it himself. Hitomi ONLY follows Shido's orders which pretty sad since Hitomi can't even make her own decision. My favorite part (not character) is a character named Yoko Mitsukado. She doesn't like Shido (like me) but she is also careless during the battle which lead to an unexpected turn of event. In that event I saw something incredible which I might have foreseen whiling watching the anime. It was so surprising (for me). I really can't believe it happen but I wish they would show me more about what happen after that. Hopefully they should it in the next season.Enjoyment (7/10): Pretty good. I like it.Overall (7/10): Good it's not bad but I wish Nomoto would become something better in the next season if it really happen. Would I recommend this? Well, if you can't watch something ecchi I won't but if you can then yes. Do you like battles? This is you. Do you like humans with the power to transform into an animal then yes this is you. At the end of the story, Shido really pisses me off on how he changed the society and the humans. You know what I mean when you watching the end. (10/10): Nothing to be concern about this.Sound (10/10): It's great.Characters (6.5/10): Okay now this might be a little rough and sad but tell me tell you why because what you about to watch is nothing like before.

I saw so many reviews about where basically the rates were high because of the erotic scenes. As someone who consumes pornography, I prefer to masturbate for something more explicit than for an ecchi. There are also some reviews that say the anime is very good for those who want to see action and battles with a lot of blood. The concept of anthropomorphic beings fighting is interesting, but it is poorly explored with battles that, even for those who simply want to see action, don't even look cool.The characters have no depth at all and the problem becomes even more...latent when the protagonists are as superficial as the supportive characters.The use of suggestive scenes has no purpose for this anime. Many animes use them to draw attention to a particular genre or story that could not stand out. An example being Shougeki no Souma. The fan service calls your attention to, what would otherwise be, a boring anime about cooking. On the other hand, shougeki's plot and characters are really good and maybe you may even forget the suggestive scenes, becoming more attracted to the anime plot and character development.Killing bites is the other way around. The scenes are for pure fan service and, honestly, if it is eroticism you want to, look for a hentai at once.The animation, the plot concept, background music, all of it is wasted mainly because of it's uninteresting characters. latent when the protagonists are as superficial as the supportive characters.The use of suggestive scenes has no purpose for this anime.

Well it has definitely some qualities which wouldn't fit into this category, finishing this series I finally can see why it is. Sharpen your fang and try to not get kinks, this is my review of Killing Bites.Story: 6/10 [MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT]This story, as you saw with my opening joke, is a combination of Dragon Ball, Fire Emblem and Battle. Or mor specifically, the game that...is Killing Bites. The main story on the other hand has a bit of a backseat. In the first few episodes it is only main story, but after that it is only the game Killing Bites. I have two massive problems with this story: First, the story is way too much filled with the tournament and too less with character development and interaction. It is the focus in the first few episodes, then it is just straight up forgot about and then suddenly in the end it comes back. That's also my second problem: The End. What was that downer of an ending? I am not saying that there never should be a bad ending, but why do it in this way? Why let one of the losers get raped? Why get one of the main characters just suddenly get killed? What is the point of that? Should we be like ''NOOOO DONT DO THAT'', but rather I am just confused and angry. This anime could've been way more benifitted of a 24 episodes season, but they didn't and the story clearly suffers from that.Art: 7/10It's pretty okay for an action series. The animations are fluid and the artstyle is appealing. There only one bad thing about the animatino: CG. Oh yeah, get ready for lots of CG cars and snakes!Sound: 6/10I like me some guitar music, but this just feels like trying to hard to be edgy. Scratch that, this whole anime just tries to be edgy but also still tries to be appealing to the everyday anime fan. Go all out or not, there is not inbetween!Character: 6/10The main cast consist of Hitomi, a stuck up powerful bitch, and Yuuya, a coward. There are also some side characters, but the only real interesting one is Ui, a even bigger coward. The cast isn't that bad, but the anime again suffers of lack of character development and interactions.Enjoyment: 7/10I rather enjoyed this anime (except the ending). It was funny and had some good moments. Sometimes I liked Ironically, sometimes I liked it genuinely. Also, there is a huge focus on R+ stuff, but I watched Monster Musume and Eromanga Sensei so I didn't mind it that much.Overall: 6/10A great story idea but suffered from lack of character development/interactions and too small of a running time. Not even close to the worst I've watched, but still a damn dissapointing one. is Killing Bites. The main story on the other hand has a bit of a backseat.

I do however feel that the animes appeal would be towards newer fans of anime or individuals that are looking...for a good ecchi series and are bored with the usual series that we've seen to this date. the manga is drawn very well is really staticky pleasing, sadly I do not feel the same for the anime though it has its moments of awe and shock at its visual recreations of the manga. the sounds used for the action scenes closely resemble that of a bullet being fired or rocks being smashed which to some extent can carry that extra punch feeling, though it has proven to also become quite rhetorical as the show progresses. the same could not be said for the opening song of the anime. the opening song really does set the tone for the anime by utilising heavy rock beats and beautiful vocals to go with it. its adrenaline, its power, its a total takeover, the opening song fully engulfs its listeners which have compelled me many times to come back each week for it. characters are really nothing to scoth at in the slightest. you have the main character who is the lowest of the low, weak and highly dependent on others, meets a beast girl named Hitomi by chance and thus their extremely brutal and dangerous partnership begins. I feel as though many of the characters are just not fleshed out enough for the audience to really start caring about them but then again this isn't that type of anime.Despite all this, the show is still quite enjoyable, not for the story or the characters but more so because of the combination of all the mediocre things that have really made this show stand out as something to try for everyone. I would recommend this anime to anyone that can at least stand hearing the baseline of the anime in each episode because damn when you have that kind of baseline why not abuse it? all in all its a must watch the show in my view but it's one I recommend going in with zero expectations and an open mind. for a good ecchi series and are bored with the usual series that we've seen to this date. the manga is drawn very well is really staticky pleasing, sadly I do not feel the same for the anime though it has its moments of awe and shock at its visual recreations of the manga. the sounds used for the action scenes closely resemble that of a bullet being fired or rocks being smashed which to some extent can carry that extra punch feeling, though it has proven to also become quite rhetorical as the show progresses. the same could not be said for the opening song of the anime. the opening song really does set the tone for the anime by utilising heavy rock beats and beautiful vocals to go with it. its adrenaline, its power, its a total takeover, the opening song fully engulfs its listeners which have compelled me many times to come back each week for it. characters are really nothing to scoth at in the slightest. you have the main character who is the lowest of the low, weak and highly dependent on others, meets a beast girl named Hitomi by chance and thus their extremely brutal and dangerous partnership begins.

The storyline is mediocre.  It's nothing more than another battle royal survival anime.  The animation is mediocre and when it comes to character design, downright atrocious.  (I.E.: The character design of Leo, whose upper body was just ridiculously disproportionate to his lower body.).  Even the score is a mediocre blend of 90's grunge rock and what sounds like royalty free audio tracks.However, the Main Character, Ratel aka Hitomi, is such an awesome character...that she drives the story forward.  She's a character on the order of Revy from Black Lagoon.  She's rough, crass, violent and kind of sexy.  She's the kind of female lead that animes could use more of.  Unfortunately, outside of her and Ui (The Rabbit) all of the rest of the characters were pretty mediocre and cliched.I will say that the ending was a plus that will probably want to make at least 60% of the people who finished this anime, want to see the second season if there ever is one. (It's an obviously low budget anime, that I doubt will have enough popularity to automatically green light S2) But, even in watching that second season, most will probably think it's mediocre or outright garbage, too.If you have nothing better to watch (and odds are you will always have something better to watch) then Killing Bites is a decent waste of time on a weekend binge.

After I watched it I started to read the manga since there is no season 2.Story: Nomoto agrees to become a driver for his mates and they abduct a girl named Hitomi. Which later turn out to be a Human animal hybrid. Then for some reason Nomoto has been made into Hitomis caretaker even though its the opposite. Later on Nomoto has been forced into joining a battle royale where Hitomi competes. The ""caretakers"" move the players around the map like playing chess.Characters: Nomoto is this college kid who is kinda relatable. He is funny and kind. Hitomi...is this human who can transform into a honeybadger. She is very badass and funny in a sense. There are also many other competitors who are super strong and badass.The ost is fucking amazing.Animation is very smooth and cool looking.I do recommend this anime to everyone. This show also tells about the animals in which they can transform. That is why Honebadgers are my favourite animals. is this human who can transform into a honeybadger.

That is why Honebadgers are my favourite animals.', 'Killing bites is a fighting anime, the story centers around a tournament called the Destroyal. In this tournament he have four teams of three, each person on each team has a sponsor. The job of the sponsor is both in financial backing, and the ability to move their fighter like a chess piece on the tournament grounds. This story is one that follows Hitomi, the main fighter, and Nomoto her hostage / sponsor. The over all fights are okay, but the show does rely a lot on fan service to survive.It\'s a little hard to go into much on what happens, but that can...be common in a fighting anime. I think this show misses in one of the larger points though, that point being. Why am I caring? Hitomi is a strong fighter, but she basically is someone who will do anything that Shidou will tell her to do. Shidou is pretty much the figure in the dark who is masterminding the whole deal. Then we have Nomo, who as stated before, is basically their hostage. He met Hitomi in a gang rape gone wrong. He was spineless driver in the whole thing, but yea. Now under the threat of death he is the sponsor for Hitomi, using money given to him by Shidou which he must not use or else. He\'s of course totally fine with this since Hitomi is really cute.I would have liked more interactions, to show them forming some sort of bond, but the show wastes no time in jumping into the bulk of the fighting. I understand, since we have 12 episodes and the tournament itself is pretty big. This might be a case of a show needing a full 24 to really flesh everything out. Of course if that did happen I\'d be subjected to another 12 episodes of someone (Usually Hitomi) Pointing out that ""The one with the sharpest fangs win. That\'s what killing bites is."" In literally every episode apart from number 11 that exact quote, word for word is said at least once. Which means in a couple of them, we get it another time. That for me was a huge problem. Can you imagine the writers of the show needing to come up with a reason for someone to give that exact tagline every episode? It hurts me.Taste: I mean, it didn\'t taste bad. The forced tagline leaves a bitter after taste but the fights were okay. I feel like the latest meta in fighting anime is to just have someone have overwhelming power. It kills the tension in a lot of fights I think. I wouldn\'t say the show is one note, it\'s more like it\'s lacking ingredients. We have a nice steak of characters that needed a little more seasoning. We have a world that\'s been built, but needs a good sauce. We have some side dish characters, but they just kinda got added onto the plate. I\'ll give it a 4 out of 10Presentation:  The art isn\'t lazy. The characters are reasonably done. Nothing sticks out as far as the music goes. As for the fan service. I think there are two ways of doing something like that in a anime. In one way. It just happens to be there. Like. Oh we just happen to have something tear just right, and in these cases I don\'t think it takes away from a show in general. The other way is of course how Killing Bites goes which is basically just having someone\'s ass hang out. There are shows that do it worse! But in this case it brings it down a little. For example in one fight we have a person with the ability to release pheromones, so we have Hitomi and Eruza basically take a break to get their freak on. Neither fighter is really punished for this, which might be the only reason why such an ability would be handy in a fighting tournament, but instead everyone just kinda takes a break to you know.. Watch.. Presentation gets a 2 out of 5Originality: I mean, what we\'re getting is a fighting anime, with its core being a tournament. So in this what you really want to look at is how they get there, and the decided curveballs in how the tournament is presented. It all basically jumps into the tournament, but I think how it\'s presented is nifty. First the characters are all animal hybrids. So they have neat animal powers in a way. Eruza is a cheetah, so she\'s very fast. We have Inaba who is a bunny, so she has great hearing. And so forth. Next the sponsor idea is nifty in that there\'s a strategy in how characters are moved around. I think the idea was great, but they missed a little on the execution. But I\'ll give a 4 out of 5 on this one.In conclusion killing bites is a fan service-y fighting anime. There\'s certainly a lot more too the story that is not gotten into, so it probably needs another season or two. If it\'ll get those? I can\'t really say. Might have to pick up the manga.

Think of it as the catalyst for the plot armor to activate.\xa0 I wish I was kidding.Story:Four powerful companies fight for power and control over each other.\xa0 In order to settle their feuds, the four companies have put funding towards therianthropes, people who\'ve had their genetic code infused with that of an animal that allows them to transform into the biological weapons of the animal of their choice called Brutes (cause that\'s totally how genetic engineering works), participating in cockfights...called \'Killing Bites\', where the Brutes fight one another and the winner gets dominance over the other three companies as a result.\xa0 And so we find ourselves with Brute Ratel, a fairly unknown fighter who throws a wrench in the Killing Bites...and the guy who I guess is the main protagonist.Alright, not gonna sugarcoat this; Killing Bites is a glorified dick measuring contest disguised as a giant cockfight with the politics and warring powers who sponsor and host the Killing Bites acting as a backdrop to the whole thing and don\'t really matter.\xa0 The story features only one official ""Killing Bites"" match, featuring twelve participants who gloat so much about their supposed dominance to the point that when the show decides to give them each a pitiful excuse for a backstory to explain how and why these Brutes even went through with the therianthropy

about them is-""I AM THIS ANIMAL.\xa0 I CAN DO THIS.\xa0 YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME BECAUSE I CAN DO THE THING THAT THIS ANIMAL CAN DO.""\xa0 Which doesn\'t really count for much cause you lose your impact when everyone fucking does this.Because of how the show\'s structured, the story is mostly style over substance, utilizing the egos of Brute Ratel (Hitomi as she\'s called), the other Brutes, the members of each company...basically everyone but the one guy who\'s supposed to be the male protagonist of the show to enhance the viewing experience of the savage battle royale to make it feel exciting.\xa0 Which honestly kind of works, if only to make the show dumb fun.\xa0 Every aspect of the show is exasperated to the point that everything is so bullshit that it\'s more funny than anything, especially because the show has a dedicated narrator who explains animal facts like the Animal Planet so that the viewer is aware of each animal\'s parameters and why/how they\'re able to pull off the bullshit that they do, which isn\'t hard because the amount of things the show tries to get away with with is so out there that not even suspension of disbelief alone will get you very far.As a show, Killing Bites is a show whose entire identity lies in how brutal its fights can be and how big of a dick everyone has from showing off their strength and proving that they\'re better than everyone else.\xa0 I\'ll give credit where credit is due, the show\'s actually pretty brutal.\xa0 And though from a narrative standpoint the show flops because the entire narrative is just a backdrop, it\'s at least fun enough to watch just to see the kind of bullshit that they\'ll do, cause bullshit can be fun if you\'re in the mood for it.\xa0 There\'re also a few weird tone shifts in the beginning episodes, and a major twist at the end of the series that\'s pretty ""What the fuck?!"", so watch out for those.Overview:+ Savage as the box said it is+/- Lots of things require suspension of belief-\xa0 Gloating gets really old, really fastCharacters:""The one with the sharpest fangs wins.\xa0 That is what Killing Bites is.""\xa0\xa0Yeah, even if you\'re sick of it, it\'s not gonna stop her from saying it all the fucking time.\xa0 Hitomi, or Brute Ratel, is a character that in four words, ""Doesn\'t give a fuck"".\xa0 As a human/ratel, or as it\'s more commonly known, the honey badger, Hitomi\'s defining trait is to get what she wants, pick fights with anyone who doesn\'t agree with her, and threatens to kill said person who doesn\'t agree with her.\xa0 She is the human embodiment of the honey badger, which as amusing as it is, makes her a terrible character.\xa0 Though her personality doesn\'t come into play so much as the amount of plot armor that she has, which weirdly enough is validated enough that I feel does get a pass in the realm of bullshit.\xa0 Cause honey badgers are basically nature\'s middle finger, capable of fighting predators many times larger than itself, shrug off cobra venom, and survive gunshots if shot in the wrong place, which only makes them angrier.\xa0 It is because of this quality that makes Hitomi such a weirdly polarizing character, in that everything does make enough sense when put in context, but it\'s still bullshit.Nomoto however is one of those characters you really can\'t make a positive case for.\xa0 The guy\'s spineless and just ends up being dragged through everything that happens in the show, having little to no impact to the overall plot cause he quite frankly doesn\'t want to be in the world of illegal human/animal cockfighting and doesn\'t really make much of an effort to escape or man up, which in the one scene he tries to make an effort ends up getting shot down cause the show always wants him to play the beta male, which becomes even stranger with the weird buildup at the end where he\'s put into the spotlight which, prior to that, was someone who had almost no reason to be in this show in the first place.Other characters don\'t really matter.\xa0 The Brutes themselves all have a pretty simple and self-explanatory backstory that you probably won\'t care about cause they take all but five to ten minutes to explain with very little impact to your feelings towards them because half of the time they\'re gloating about how strong the cobra, the tiger, the alligator, (insert another animal here) is before getting an arm or a leg chopped off because they didn\'t pay enough attention in zoology class to know that their opponent\'s animal is capable of doing such a thing.\xa0 In the same vein as that, the company heads don\'t matter in the slightest and their power war is basically irrelevant.\xa0 The only other character I would say matters in this show is Dr. Shidoh, Hitomi\'s guardian who acts more like a plot device cause despite what everyone in the show says, he doesn\'t actually do anything and only serves to advance the plot vaguely towards a penultimate thing that leads into the next arc that we\'ll probably never see unless we get a sequel.Overview+ Characters are...entertaining-\xa0 Male MC is pretty useless the way throughArt:On the topic of art, what Lidenfilms ended up producing is honestly not all that interesting to look at.\xa0 The show at most looks average, and the quality of the show itself is far from anything strikingly appealing to look at.\xa0 It also doesn\'t help the fact that most of the show takes place at night, so that in and of itself makes everything that much harder to see, especially because about half of the fights take place in near darkness, and seeing only the glowing eyes of the characters isn\'t great.The fight scenes however were honestly what I expected, and then some.\xa0 The fights are very messy and brutal in nature, constantly filled with injuries and bloodshed from the savagery of these people fighting which honestly was the best part of the entire series.\xa0 Cutting off limbs, pouring out pools of

that.\xa0 A seventy power a hundred accuracy move is not cool a enough name to say when you\'re cutting some poor fucker\'s arm off.I also find it weird, but not at all surprised that the designs of the Brutes are what they are.\xa0 Because this is Japan, the girls end up looking like Kemonomimis primarily looking human with a few animal parts when transformed, while the guys pull off a complete transformation and look like a bipedal version of the animal of their choice.\xa0 And Hitomi fights wearing a white tank and her underwear.\xa0 Truly this show would not be complete without its fanservice.\xa0 Clearly.\xa0 It\'s also worth noting that two brutes in the series are rendered in CG in, which is glaringly obvious when they show up on screen.\xa0 Thankfully it\'s not overly jarring, so it\'s at least acceptable to an extent.Overview:+\xa0 Gruesomely good fight scenes+/- Fanservice designs?-\xa0 Terrible attack namesSound:Fripside\'s ""Killing Bites"" is really what you would expect from the band.\xa0 Most of their work is very samey sounding, and listening back to both Clockwork Planet and Black Bullet gives me the same feeling as I get from listening to the other two, though personally I prefer those two to what Fripside has done here, so I regard this OP as inferior in comparison.Kitsunetsuki\'s ""Kedamono Damono"" on the other hand is a pretty generic rock song with a numerous amount of guitar rifts to give it flair between the lyrics.\xa0 I\'m not really feeling this one either, and the entire OST by itself is not really all that exciting if you ask me.Personal Enjoyment:Honestly I think I enjoyed this show a hell of a lot more than I ever should have.\xa0 I partially blame this on the fact that I generally go with the flow on things, and since everything here was a big case of ""Just go along with it"", I think that\'s the reason why I\'m able to sit here and say that I liked the show simply for its dumb fun.\xa0 And that\'s saying something with the amount of crap they try to pull with the amount of abuse any of these animals can take without dying, cause some of those \'nonfatal\' wounds are very clearly fatal, especially from the blood loss of severed limbs.I also want to point out that they have a character who looks like fat Wolverine with a puckered butthole for a mouth.\xa0 Which that to me is hilarious cause I could not go one scene without laughing with him in the picture and take what he was saying seriously.\xa0 Not like I was doing that in the first place, but you get my point.\xa0 (No his animal is not a wolverine, no matter how great that would\'ve been.)Now the question is...should you watch this show?\xa0 Personally...no.\xa0 I mean unless you want to kill some time and watch something stupid, then no.\xa0 There\'s honestly nothing of value to be had watching this show aside from dumb fun.\xa0 I just watched it out of morbid curiosity and I ended up having way too much fun with it cause I\'ve reached the point in my life where anything can get a laugh out of me.\xa0 I guess another reason would be...if you want to watch a nature show but you also want to watch anime, this could be that niche you\'re looking for.\xa0 A very odd niche, but one I\'m sure exists...somewhere. called \'Killing Bites\', where the Brutes fight one another and the winner gets dominance over the other three companies as a result.\xa0 And so we find ourselves with Brute Ratel, a fairly unknown fighter who throws a wrench in the Killing Bites...and the guy who I guess is the main protagonist.Alright, not gonna sugarcoat this; Killing Bites is a glorified dick measuring contest disguised as a giant cockfight with the politics and warring powers who sponsor and host the Killing Bites acting as a backdrop to the whole thing and don\'t really matter.\xa0 The story features only one official ""Killing Bites"" match, featuring twelve participants who gloat so much about their supposed dominance to the point that when the show decides to give them each a pitiful excuse for a backstory to explain how and why these Brutes even went through with the therianthropy treatment to become the human/animal hybrids that they are.\xa0 Something that you end up not caring about cause it doesn\'t matter anyway considering prior to this knowledge, much of what you know about them is-""I AM THIS ANIMAL.\xa0 I CAN DO THIS.\xa0 YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME BECAUSE I CAN DO THE THING THAT THIS ANIMAL CAN DO.""\xa0 Which doesn\'t really count for much cause you lose your impact when everyone fucking does

Yet, if you strip away all the fan service, you’re still left with an above average action show about people transforming into animals and duking it out in a battle royale. As such, if borderline hentai isn’t your thing, then it’s probably best to skip this one.Even though everything other than the action and fan-service shouldn’t be taken too seriously, a story still needs to exist. Brutes, humans genetically altered to be half-animal, are used by a group of business corporations (zaibatsus) to settle their dispute over control of the Japanese economy by fighting in...Killing Bites, a battle royale showdown. Although this scenario is decent, it’s quite forgettable in execution. I never cared for any of the zaibatsu’s political storylines, and I found the constant cutting back to them during fights to get annoying. They also tried to make the battle royale more strategic by having the leaders move their Brutes around the map like chess pieces, which didn’t really work out. One thing I can praise is how the Brutes themselves were shown off. Whenever an animal-related move or ability would be used, an extremely enthusiastic Japanese David Attenborough would give an animal fact to explain what just happened. The best example would be when Hitomi survived a volley of porcupine quills. It is then explained this is due to a Honey Badger’s extra tough skin (which she has the characteristics of). At first I thought this was over exaggerated, but, to my surprise, a quick Wikipedia read states that their skin can indeed withstand the likes of spears and arrows. These bits of information are used throughout to justify pretty much everything, from the fights to the fan-service.Speaking of fan-service, I feel the show stumbled a bit here. There was one pointless scene of nudity early on that didn’t have any reason to be there, and that was it for the rest of the series. It felt like cheap bait, and personally I believe that the series should have picked between having no nudity at all and going all out with it. Other than that, there’s a bit of everything here, from yuri to almost-pseudo-tentacle-rape. Even the ED consists almost entirely of stills of every female character in increasing states of undress. The character designs are good overall, Hitomi in particular (although this is personal preference).Character development is obviously sparse, although I must bring up ‘main’ character Yuya. While many series have used a blank male lead for audience self-insertion, Yuuya takes this to new heights. From his incredibly forced introduction into the story, he is utterly useless and does nothing throughout. Which is a shame since there is a single good moment of character for him (that is predictably never referenced again). The rest of the cast are mostly interesting to watch, especially Kido, who was the biggest surprise of the series for me. In such a short amount of time, he was not only introduced and built up, but also got his own equally short yet effective and engaging backstory. Coupled with his unique personality and fighting style, he was a short-lived yet welcome addition. The only other character who got a backstory was actual main character Hitomi. My problem here is that her backstory is basically an elaborate excuse for her insane plot armor towards the end. The amount of damage she takes while still getting back up time after time is insane. My only other character problem was Inui, who existed solely for comic relief but which fell flat more times than it hit.Briefly with regards to sound, the sound effects here are almost as insane as the plot armor. Every movement and every impact ranges from sounding like a bass-boosted meme to a jet breaking the sound barrier. It’s loud, it’s over the top, and it’s perfect for the series. The soundtrack consists of heavy rock that fit the tone and was generally good, but was never memorable for me.Now onto the animation. In particular, the fights. For a series that revolves around fights, the art and animation did a pretty good job. The fights were exciting and engaging, mainly due to the uniqueness of each fighters and their animal characteristics. Other than the cuts back to the zaibatsu’s politicking, the action is constant. Although I wouldn’t say there’s anything overly special about it, it does its job well enough, even if I felt there were a few too many stills, probably due to budget. The series does incorporate some CGI for a few characters which, apart from standing out, didn’t detract from the fighting.Fan-service and fighting.

Just to make about this anime"", ""Anime battle royaye is good, the first chapters are very entertaining, after that, as a team begins to assemble for the final tournament, the series begins to decline, it begins to be much slower and it takes away the rhythm it had. Worst of all is the ending, a trashy reverend you can't make such a bad ending. I realized that the protagonist is identical, his design to that of Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu, taking that out at the end they appear as two new protagonists and one looks a lot like Uraraka from Boku no hero. Curious data. Speaking with spoilers, the ending sucks...because they kill the protagonist and kill him as if nothing of the kind cries a little, but on top of that, the worst thing is that later you see him alive. It's like what?En español:Anime battle royaye esta bueno los primeros capitos son muy entretenidos, después de eso como se comienza a armar un equipo para el torneo definitivo ahí comienza a decaer la serie comienza a ser mucho mas lenta y le saca el ritmo que tenia. Lo peor de todo es el final una reverenda basura no podes hacer un final tan malo. Me di cuenta de que el protagonista es idéntico, su diseño al de Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu, sacando eso al final aparecen como dos nuevas protagonista y una se parece un montón a Uraraka de Boku no hero. Datos curios. Hablando con spoilers el final es una mierda porque matan al protagonista y lo matan como si nada tipo llora un poco pero encima lo peor es que después lo ves vivo.

It was then when realization came to me. This show is nothing more than hype train without wheels.

After that something else will be repeated. We'll see 30 seconds of a well thought out fight but then it will be interrupted to show a room...full of geezers talking about random stuff and doing basically nothing interesting while behaving like no human ever would.Art is actually good looking. Music is great. Voice actors are good as well. It's just direction and story that suck. There's another sin of bad anime which is tournament of some sort. Here it's some stupid games on some stupid island. They explained rules and how everything works but it never plays any role. It's just bullshit. Apparently players are suppose to make strategic moves with their pieces but that idea is abandoned very next episode when pieces decide to do whatever they feel like.Main character is simple and for the most part annoying. She keeps repeating same sentence over and over again, multiple times per episode. Other main character is a cuck and does absolutely nothing other than scream and obey and he even sucks at that. Overall it's a bad show. Entertaining for fan service which is abundant and blatant but that's about it.

After the MC litterally gets forced into this the story seems to drift for a bit before suddenly a big tournament starts. Normally this would take a few episodes and then afterwards the story would move on but the tournament takes up the rest...of the anime which makes it feel like not all that much was accomplished in the end.Characters:The MC is complete trash.

He exists mostly to just scream and cry and be the average male viewers self insert because he's seriously so bland.On the other hand the main Heroine is fun. She's not especially unique but she's definitely a spirited character that has the kind of energy that's hard to hate. her existence pretty much saves the series from being a disaster.As for the rest of the cast they are mostly mediocre and at best satisfy the roles they were given in the plot without being too good or bad.Art/animation:The animation is good. Nothing special or unique but it gets the job done and with the exception of some pretty half assed CGI at a couple points it makes for some good fight scenes. If you like beautiful animation this won't do it for you but if you just want something that makes the fight scenes feel alive then this does it and the fights don't feel too stiff or dull.Overall:If you like battle royal anime then you'll like this.

The premise of it sounds cool, animal/human hybrids put into a death battle tournament. But, the way it's executed is very poor.In short, imagine the characters from Terra Formars, only they're all Sekirei characters (with some overly muscular men thrown into the mix) and they fight each other with no character development at all.It's furry fan service with fights every now and then.So, if you're looking to whack it off to scantily clad animalistic girls duking it out, this is the perfect anime for you. Otherwise, I'd...give this anime a pass. give this anime a pass."", 'Spoilers ahead.Are you a furry and want to watch an anime with cute girls who can mutate into half-animals? Do you want to watch an anime with no story line, characters that only talk in exposition and an anime that has ridiculous amounts of fan-service? If you answered yes to any of these questions, look no more because Killing Bites is exactly that.I am honestly a fan of the survival/battle royale genre but I have yet to see an anime that actually succeeds in those genres. There are plenty of anime titles out there that have a battle royale esq story-line but I cannot say...that any of them have executed any of the elements that make that genre great well. I\'ve recently watched Darwin\'s Game and some years prior that I watched that god-awful ""Me and 23 slaves"" title. The problem I have with these titles is that they very quickly lose control over their story and succumb to sheer edginess instead. I am aware that ""Me and 23 slaves"" is not exactly a battle royale anime but it does have elements that resemble that genre.Killing Bites is unique to say the very least; a dense and ""your typical anime"" protagonist is one day forced into a situation that will forever change his life as he has to now partake in the Killing Bites survival game where cute half-animal half-girl mutants fight with each other controlled by greedy corporations who only care about reputation and money. Uniqueness, however, does not always mean good. It is unfortunate because it could have been a decent title, if there was any kind of direction and an actual storyline that you could follow. Instead, the show quickly establishes itself as a driven-less anime without any actual story and just events that take place after each other. Nothing is explained in Killing Bites either, things happen to move the plot forward.It is unclear as to why the main character did not get killed after he witnessed a Killing Bites duel between two of the mutants. It is unclear as to why they chose him to partake in the survival battle of Killing Bites. The main character is by no means special. As stated before, he\'s your average anime protagonist without any sort of talent or motivation. He\'s blank and really nothing makes him stand out. The protagonist is just another self-insert character. This is however a common trope in most of these garbage anime titles so it comes as no surprise really.What really makes this anime ""stand out"" though is Uzaki Hitomi. Uzaki Hitomi is also a main character and perhaps one of the most annoying ones I\'ve seen in quite some time now. The anime takes literally no time to introduce any of their main characters properly. What they do instead is have random events occur one after the other which then lead to a result. This can be applied in literally every episode of the show. Let\'s talk a little bit more about how you establish main characters in a show and how Killing Bites does it. The way Killing Bites decides to introduce Uzaki Hitomi and Nomoto Yuuya is rather hilarious. Instead of giving any of these characters any sort of inner dialogue or at least one scene for themselves, the anime decides to introduce them right away and probably in the most pretentious way possible. Hitomi is walking a late night all by herself until a van filled with rapists kidnaps her. And that\'s literally how they meet. Yuuya is driving the van and his friends decide to rape Hitomi which they unfortunately do not succeed in because she\'s a mutant, she kills them almost immediately. Hitomi then commands our main rapist to drive the car to an unknown location. Once they show up, a battle takes place. That\'s how they meet. And in those 20 something minutes, you really can\'t care less about anything happening. I was looking at my phone for most of the time being because this setup is ridiculous. Why should we care for Hitomi or Yuuya when the authors clearly didn\'t care about making a proper introduction for their main characters.This is a constant problem in this anime. The introduction of new characters is almost always a ""gotcha"" moment. What\'s more of a ""gotcha"" moment though is whenever a fight between mutants take place and one side is almost always losing until ""hurdedur that was not even 1% of my power"". That\'s the best way I can describe Hitomi and that\'s exactly what happens in every scene where she fights imaginable. The other mutants always seem to underestimate Hitomi, even after they know she\'s clearly one of the most powerful mutants. Another thing that pissed me off is the amount of times our main female lead Hitomi decides to say her catchphrase. And every time she says her catchphrase, she obviously wins the battle. Every character in this show seems to lack common sense, maybe it\'s because they are half mutants or whatever.So what are these mutants? Well, it\'s difficult to describe you see. They\'re actually not called mutants, they\'re called therianthropes. Therianthropes are humans who have willfully undergone a surgery that makes them half-animal half-human. They have the capability of mutating to their respective animal at the power of their will. These therianthropes seem to have extraordinary animal powers but more on that later. These therianthropes were created by the elite society and huge conglomerates/corporations for the sole purpose of fighting to death. Has anyone heard this story before? Evil elite society does bad things? I wonder where I\'ve heard about that. But yeah, as you could have already guessed not much is explained about this society apart from them having a long history of battle for money and power. It\'s a pathetic and laughable attempt at a story which the authors fail to explain anyway. Everything about this society and who these people are remains a mystery and up to your imagination. They\'re as one-dimensional as they get. I wonder why almost every author has to include something about an evil underground society who fights for money and power but never does anything to show how bad or evil they actually are.It\'s time to talk about the abilities some of these therianthropes possess. It\'s funny because the powers are rather inconsistent in a way. Uzaki Hitomi has the ability of turning into a hot anime girl with big tiddies and cat ears. She has insane reflexes and is practically immune to any attack done to her. This kills any sort of suspense that this anime had for it. Not once, not even once, is it shown that she\'s in danger. There are at times where you think she might be in danger but the author decides to quickly take a shit in your face and Hitomi manages quickly to regain all her powers. Even when she\'s poisoned by a cobra. You might think, yes we get it, Hitomi has plot armor and there\'s nothing you can do about it except for crying. And to that I completely agree. We also have a snake rapist, a cheetah, a tiger, a crocodile and a monkey. They seem to have variations and different powers but most of it actually boils down to just raw power and who can deal the finishing hit the hardest. Boring and pathetic.The author clearly has no idea how the animal kingdom works but even so, he decided to base of all the characters of the show that have these animal like abilities. It would be rather funny to see a crocodile fight a monkey and a hippo, it\'s quite obvious who\'d win the fight. What I mean by inconsistency though is that while sure they do have these animal-like powers and abilities but at some points, these powers go too far. Sometimes these powers do nothing but sometimes they defy all laws of physics. These powers usually come with a plot twist. Intentional or unintentional, some episodes are structured in a way where you think a particular character will lose against the enemy. This is quickly turned around and it turns out that the character wasn\'t being serious or didn\'t transform to his final form. This is the type of stuff you have to see on an episode-basis and trust me or not but you do get used to it. It\'s really predictable and gets boring quite fast.What you will most frequently see in this anime is poorly written dialog. This show completely fails at the ""show, don\'t tell"" as it heavily relies on exposition. There is tonnes of exposition. Some of the characters only talk in exposition. Nothing is shown to us. We\'re constantly being told that things are the way they are. However, at points, we never see anything of it. We\'re constantly being told and see therianthropes, yet we don\'t know anything about them apart from their abilities that sometimes defy logic. How is a therianthrope created? We\'re only told that a human has to go through a surgery in order to become a therianthrope. Can anyone become a therianthrope? Are there some sort of limitations as to who can be one? If so, why isn\'t everyone a therianthrope? Therianthropes are clearly more superior than humans in terms of their agility and extraordinary abilities. These types of question will constantly pop up as you\'re slowly progressing through the anime and you won\'t ever get any explanation for it.Let\'s talk about the worst offender of this show though. Fan-service. When going into this show, I did expect quite some fan-service due to it being in the ecchi genre. Not all fan-service is necessarily bad, it\'s just a matter of execution. But this show fails even at that. I do enjoy fan-service, don\'t get me wrong. I\'ve grown used to the typical ""oopsie daisy fell off the stairs and touched a booby"" type of scene but this show is just on another level. From the very first episode we get to see Hitomi just in panties and this remains true for rest of the show. There are some scenes where Yuuya ""accidentally"" gropes Hitomi. Not a deal-breaker to be fair. The shit I hate is the forced rape-attempt scenes and utterly obnoxious characters. At one point, this show turns into a tentacle hentai where one of the mutants is a snake and is also a rapist. He tries to rape both Hitomi and Eruza. How is this fan-service? How on earth did this get in the show? Why? No one knows and no one cares to be frank. In my honest opinion, it\'s just done for the shock value and to show big tiddie anime girls having a snake tail in their mouths. Very pleasant indeed. They take it on another level where the snake rapist decides to shove both of his phallus organs in Hitomi. Fan-service my ass. There\'s even a lesbian scene in episode 7 where Hitomi and Eruza start to kiss and do yuri things which was honestly what made me write the review. Nothing makes any sense and doesn\'t even try to make any sense. This is the type of show where you have to either have a low IQ or be mentally inept to enjoy anything this show has to offer in the slightest manner. I have become the latter due to watching this anime so I will be sending the author my hospital bill.So what exactly made me want to watch this show? Boredom I guess. This show has absolutely nothing to it. The fight scenes are decent I suppose, and the animation is top notch. The soundtracks and sound design were also surprisingly decent. Everything apart from the shitty characters and the lack of story was good which is what I enjoyed in this show the most. This show really tries too hard, it takes itself way too serious. With such a pretentious narrative that has been done to death and has been done better time after time, why does Killing Bites take itself so seriously. In all honesty, the amount of ridiculous fan-service could have easily turned this into some sort of comedy anime. Killing Bites would in fact have gotten better ratings if it established itself as a dramedy, short for comedy-drama. Instead of the pretentious written story, have it even more ridiculous. Make the main character stand out a bit. Have him be the ""cocky"" type instead. The problem with most anime nowadays is that most of the main characters have nothing going for them, they\'re self-insert. In my opinion, a great character needs to be a character, he needs to have certain charisma that can make him distinguishable from rest of the cast. He needs to have certain traits that are relatable with the viewer. By creating a self-insert main character, you completely fail at character writing and their inner growth as humans. Self-inserts never have any sort of development or inner growth, they\'re exactly the same in the end as they were in the beginning. This kills any sort of story. Considering Killing Bites is a story-driven anime, not a character-driven anime, this show completely fails at being one because there is no clear story established. that any of them have executed any of the elements that make that genre great well. I\'ve recently watched Darwin\'s Game and some years prior that I watched that god-awful ""Me and 23 slaves"" title. The problem I have with these titles is that they very quickly lose control over their story and succumb to sheer edginess instead.

They take it on another level where the snake rapist decides to shove both of his phallus organs in Hitomi. Fan-service my ass. There\'s even a lesbian scene in episode 7 where Hitomi and Eruza start to kiss and do yuri things which was honestly what made me write the review. Nothing makes any sense and doesn\'t even try to make any sense. This is the type of show where you have to either have a low IQ or be mentally inept to enjoy anything this show has to offer in the slightest manner. I have become the latter due to watching this anime so I will be sending the author my hospital bill.So what exactly made me want to watch this show? Boredom I guess. This show has absolutely nothing to it. The fight scenes are decent I suppose, and the animation is top notch. The soundtracks and sound design were also surprisingly decent. Everything apart from the shitty characters and the lack of story was good which is what I enjoyed in this show the most. This show really tries too hard, it takes itself way too serious. With such a pretentious narrative that has been done to death and has been done better time after time, why does Killing Bites take itself so seriously. In all honesty, the amount of ridiculous fan-service could have easily turned this into some sort of comedy anime. Killing Bites would in fact have gotten better ratings if it established itself as a dramedy, short for comedy-drama. Instead of the pretentious written story, have it even more ridiculous. Make the main character stand out a bit. Have him be the ""cocky"" type instead. The problem with most anime nowadays is that most of the main characters have nothing going for them, they\'re self-insert. In my opinion, a great character needs to be a character, he needs to have certain charisma that can make him distinguishable from rest of the cast. He needs to have certain traits that are relatable with the viewer. By creating a self-insert main character, you completely fail at character writing and their inner growth as humans. Self-inserts never have any sort of development or inner growth, they\'re exactly the same in the end as they were in the beginning. This kills any sort of story. Considering Killing Bites is a story-driven anime, not a character-driven anime, this show completely fails at being one because there is no clear story established.', 'This show was utter garbage relying on pseudoscientific tales to counter common misconceptions. LMAOThe ""tactics"" and ""fights""that are supposed to fill out the story are laughable- the story itself has a certain charme of mediocreness to it though.It\'s still a joke of an Anime and one no one would laugh at at that, but it actually wasn\'t too cringy to endure.What could have made it worthwhile watching then?The Fanservice -ngl that part actually was cringy af so noThe artstyle -if you excuse the messed up proportions and ""transformations"" that look like bad fursuits ...than it\'s still mediocre at best (the cg didn\'t help either).The characters...apart from design were also -still extremely plain,but admittedly pulled off in the best way possible.The concept behind the story was just poorly thought out so the execution still seems acceptable overall.The end really hit it though and then actually left me waiting for a season 2.It wasn\'t terribly enough for me to not recommend it as a timekiller.Might try the Manga and see if that\'s any better... apart from design

""TL;DR:Trash show that's still really fun trash for Edgy-Mc-I want a lame Ecchi heavy battle shonen.So not gonna lie this was a surprise of the season just in sheer terms of being something that turned out to be way more amusing than I expected and now that I finished it all I can say is that it was trash....but it's very fun trash.Story:Battle Royal with animal folks and a lot of shallow worthless characters that don't serve a whole lot but do their thing and some fairly amusing fight scenes that don't go on longer than they need to....You get a few things here and there that could entertain the kind of edge-lord anime fan who wants some needlessly violent and sexual anime to make them feel all adult and cool but overall you're not sticking around to see if it gets any better but rather just how bad things are although I'll give them credit the entire second half kept me going and the last episode was a solid series of events that leave you wondering somewhat as to where the results of this tournament go.3/10Art:EH I like the characters designs and animal forms but the use of 3D is horrible and most of the real effort went into the odd animal profile scenes when the characters transform which seems odd.5/10Sound:The intro is very EHHHH but it's a rock song in an anime which I can fully appreciate and the announcer guy when they talk about the animals is actually very very amusing but the majority of my score is going to the fact that I really like the end theme because it's a pretty damn solid hard rocking tune that get's me pumped and makes the best part of the show even better.8/10Character:I like the Inaba chick a whole lot because she's amusingly worthless but beyond that everybody else is just bodies to move a plot and they took wayyyyyyyyyy too god damn long to expand on the main chick and why you should care for her.Really the only use is you have new characters to lewd out for when you and your friends want to do monster girl Monday's in your image forums.4/10Enjoyment:This show held my interest for all 12 episodes and I liked it's quick pace they made the show a lot less cringe inducing and the last episode was a solid way to wrap it all up although I'd be lying if I didn't say that the best part of the whole show was the 30 second sub story about the chick who's obsessed with Hitomi just for how unimportant and funny it is in comparison to the rest of the show and coupled with the fact that the end theme kicks ass that made this something that was probably my surprise of 2018.7/10Overall:This show is hot garbage disguised as an ecchi heavy battle shonen that any self respecting person would stop watching after 3 episodes but since I'm a trash person with trash taste I managed to finish and enjoy it to some capacity but if we're being real it don't matter how much lewdness get's thrown your way you can't stop a bad show from being bad and this show is most certainly bad not so bad that it deserves a low score but not something I'll recommend to non action movie watching, Mountain Dew Chugging, Linking Park loving, Edgelord supreme's if you know what I mean.6/10 You get a few things here and there that could

anime. It\'s just that the series itself is flawed with problems that will be mentioned below.Story 4/10: It\'s the weakest subject by far. It\'s horribly paced. It touches on far too many subjects and backstories/sidestories to be properly discussed in any real way, while also detracting from the supposedly \'main\'  story too. It\'s a thinly diluted attempt to make an intriguing world and story potential that falls flat on its own face. It also decides to swing wildly between ""moods"", in that sometimes it will have action-based sequences abruptly cut to people talking to...eachother with overly exaggerated fashions and emotions crammed in there. It also drags itself down with some tropes/stereotypes that don\'t even feel properly done, if not just feeling completely out of place.This isn\'t even necessarily a problem with the anime itself, because this is just an adaption of something that already suffered from this ""problem"". It wasn\'t so much a problem for the manga from a longtime readers side of the argument, because it was a drip-fed series and having the story be quickly paced to make up for gaps in publication schedules was reasonable. But for newcomers and anime viewers, it is very awkward to see something hint so much potential but never really explore it in favour of quickly moving forward.Art 7/10: Nothing special, so to speak. How pretty a show looks isn\'t the be-all-end-all of a series quality. The animation studio was well-picked for this and they did their part well in refining and displaying the anime adaption. Even going so far as to emphasize muscle-shape via better shading and ""texture"" detail that can\'t be done exceptionally well in black/white manga.Sound 7/10: Pretty standard, but I found myself liking the OP/Intro music.Characters 5/10: Very bland and one-dimensional. The only characters with depth to them are pretty much unexplored or figuratively ""ran-over"" by rampant -edge- in the story.Enjoyment 5/10: As someone who either wants depth or ""mindless entertainment"", I found it hard to enjoy much of anything except the work of the animation studio and the effort they put into it. It would be just mindless entertainment, but it keeps trying to be more than that, and keeps trying to force this idea very heavily at seemingly random intervals.Overall 6/10: It\'s a very decent looking show with decent sound design and intro-music, but it trips over itself constantly. This wouldn\'t even be an issue if they spaced the contrasting elements out from eachother, but they decided to interlace everything in a very messy way. eachother with overly exaggerated fashions and emotions crammed in there.

I had high hopes that this anime would bring something to the table but I was mistaken. The anime is full of fan service and fights which can be great in small doses but not the way Killing Bites utilizes it. The story was not worth noting either. If you have seen any show where the pit people against one another, then you've seen this before.If a second season comes out, I might watch it just to see what happens with the universe with that they build.

I have been busy with work, but I\'ve mainly been putting this anime on hold because I just wasn\'t that interested in it as much as I wanted to be. Let\'s get right into the anime basics.Story; You get thrown into this world by almost witnessing a high school girl get kidnapped and r***ed in a van by a bunch of dudes. The main character, Yuuya Nomoto, who did not want to partake in this sort of thing grows balls for two seconds and stops the van and turn around and witness...that the high school girl has killed all his ""friends"" in the back. You then get thrown into a weird adventure of half Therianthrope fights left, right and centre. no real reason to these fights except wanting power, money and to show off who is the strongest of all the Therianthropes. Honestly... this whole anime was just weirdly twisted, never gave enough explanation about anything and was only good for the ecchi half-animal girls. I also have so many questions that I know will only be answered by me reading the manga, but I won\'t be touching it anytime soon. Art; I always appreciate all anime styles. I love how simple the animation was, and how cleaning they transformed the characters from human to Therianthropes. Sound; The OST was okay... didn\'t really spark anything in me to make me want to listen/watch it over and over again. Character; ***SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON*** THEY WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE... You knew some characters were related to each-other and just didn\'t know how, and you\'d have to fill in the lines yourself in the middle of watching the anime. Hitomi\'s background still doesn\'t make sense to me, Nomoto death at the end WAS NOT EXPLAINED besides saying ""He would be a pain in the neck"", and are we not going to be told WHY Therianthropes exist in the first place? Is it really just crazy science experience, do the rich REALLY just want more money and way\'s to gamble?Overall, this anime was painful for me to watch. All I\'m going to remember from this anime in three years time is ""The one with sharpest fangs win"", an unexpected death of Nomoto that might not actually be dead and half-animal girls with big tits.Maybe I\'ll pick up the manga one day, but for now I\'m okay with not enjoying this anime. that the high school girl has killed all his ""friends"" in the back.

A story about humans that can morph into animals did sound interesting, but the execution of it was pretty bad.Story (5/10)The story starts when Nomoto Yuuya encounters a girl called Hitomi Uzaki, who has the animalistic powers of a Honey Badger. After being saved by her Nomoto has been assigned to stay close to her, for his own protection.The show starts off pretty boring, as we get introduced to the characters whilst also having a few fights with...other people with these powers. We do get an explanation for what these people are used for, which is for a battle royale type tournament where 4 separate houses use their therianthrope's to battle it out till someone wins.Pretty much from episode 4 till the very end, the show concentrates on the tournament. I did like how the game worked, it had a mixture between chess and battleships although it was pretty annoying how the show started forgetting it's own rules as the tournament went on.I thought the fights were pretty cool, but they were quite short and were often interrupted by some other character until the final fight which was the highlight of the show for me.There was also a lot of info on the animals the characters possessed, I'm unsure if all the info is true (probably not), but it was still interesting to know the strengths and weaknesses of these animals.When it came to the ending, I didn't know whether to be surprised or angry, because it turns out that there was a coup going on the entire time so a bunch of the higher people died, but not only that Nomoto ends up getting the short end of the stick at the end too which surprised me too and then we end on a cliffhanger for whenever a second season will come out.Yeah the ending just didn't feel deserved after the tedious trek to get there.Characters (5/10)The characters weren't anything special, they just had the usual cliched tropes I've seen a bunch of times although there were a few good moments with them.Hitomi is kinda your typical bloodthirsty type Tsundere, who will pretty much get pissed off if you question her even a little bit unless you give her something honey related then she'll become  a sweet girl. She is very determined when it comes to fighting against her opponents and never gives up, even if she loses an arm, but it gets kinda annoying when she says her catchphrase every goddamn episode sure every so often is fine, but every episode just makes the catchphrase boring. She can be a curious person too when she experiences new things and despite being a bloodthirsty Honey Badger she does spare a few lives sometimes.Nomoto is probably one of the most unnecessary MC's I've ever seen, I thought Harem MC's were boring, but this guy is right up there with therm. He really had nothing interesting about him, other than that he cowered in fear most of the time, then again considering the mess he was dragged into I wouldn't blame him. Even though I say he is a boring character I still think he didn't deserve what happened to him at the end.Eruza is a cheetah of a rival house, she was a playful character and quickly grew to like Hitomi despite being enemies. Other than being a badass fighter she really didn't have much to show when it came to characterisation.Ui is a rabbit, who ends up getting caught up in this mess much like Nomoto, surprisingly enough she is my favourite character, then again that could be due to her cuteness factor and considering the situation the urge to protect the cuteness was strong with this one. She isn't strong when it comes to fighting and all she can do is either dig or run, but her luck in the whole tournament is extraordinary since she is the one who wins the whole thing which actually made me happy as the weakest character won the whole thing.Art (4/10)Killing Bites is not a good looking show and it really shows too in certain scenes. That doesn't mean all of it is bad though, the different forms of the therianthrope's looked pretty good and there was a wide variety of choice for the animal powers they had. It's just kinda boring how must of the show is set in one location that consisted mainly of 2-3 areas, hell we were in that area with deserted buildings for like the entire second half, it got very boring looking at the same place for a while.I also have to mention the atrocious CGI, it looked nasty, but luckily it was only used for specific characters and wasn't around often.The characters looked pretty generic too, I mean considering how many anime's there is it's going to be difficult thinking up new looks for characters, but I got nothing from these guys. Also the way Hitomi's hips looked were pretty ugly too, not sure if it's just me, but her hips just didn't look right.Sound (6/10)The sound is actually one of the better parts of the show, the OP was generic as hell, but the ED and the ost was actually ok. The rock based music actually fitted well for animalistic tone the show was going for and it made the battles much more fun to watch.Extras:Since this was mainly a battle royale type show, there was a lot of action in it. I thought the action was pretty good especially during the final battle which was actually quite tense, but a lot of the earlier battles felt a little quick while some just dragged on because of other characters interrupting the current fight. However this show definitely fits the right areas for someone who loves watching action and will probably come out of this happy.Ecchi has started to become something that needs to be used in the right way whenever it appears in the show, this is one of those times where it made me feel both uncomfortable for certain scenes and kinda aroused for others. The amount of forced rape moments was pretty high and made me feel very uneasy especially when one of the characters couldn't escape from it, but the moment between Hitomi and Eruza when they were influenced by a hormonal gas was pretty steamy, yet the amount of nudity was very low despite the revealing outfits for the female characters, there was actually only one scene throughout the whole thing where we saw bare breasts and that was very early on, so the amount of Ecchi despite being mixed for me was actually a lot lower than I expected.Enjoyment (4/10)Aside from the battles and a few characters I was more bored than excited with this show, plus the ending felt more annoying than an actual decent payoff.Overall (5/10)True this isn't the worst thing from 2018 I've seen (that goes to A.I.C.O), but it isn't far off. At least the action wasn't disappointing to the point where I felt like dropping it, but if this does miraculously get a second season then hopefully it will be better than what we got. other people with these powers.

This show is basically making fun of other generic animes for being ridiculous, and they made the anime ridiculous in their own way.This show has a big, big flaw.

The fights were decent to watch but its 99% superficial as its impossible to emotionally invest in what's going on. Pretty damn awful. This series has the occasional peak but its mainly a poor, uninspired load of nothingness. As mentioned before there is lots of sexual violence in this anime,...for no good reason, none of it advances the plot in anyway which specifically required such violence or attempted violence and it only serves to make the main characters totally dislikeable, also the fact these attempts are never followed through means that any threat or intensity that such extreme violence should inspire out of me are utterly lacking. for no good reason, none of it advances the plot in anyway which specifically required such violence or attempted violence and it only serves to make the main characters totally dislikeable, also the fact these attempts are never followed through means that any threat or intensity that such extreme violence should inspire out of me are utterly lacking."", 'I think the sound and art are nice, nothing really insane but nice, the reason why I\'m rating this so low is because I seriously dislike the main characters.

Not to mention she is mindlessly overpowered, the first time where she ever got \'hurt\' is when she got her arm cut off. Which in response she just goes, ""no biggy"" and throws it to kill her opponent. This is some kind of clown stuff right here.The other protaginist, Yuuya, is literally just a innocent...dummy who has no idea whats even happening.

In addition to this, both MCs were insufferable, especially Hitomi. The show constantly put her on a pedestal. It was so bad you knew what was gonna happen next.Moreover, I'm not one to complain about sexual themes in anime especially when they're done right, but this anime clearly didn't care. It was all eye candy. From clothes ripping, panty shots, and even rape-related scenes. I may be asking too much, but if the show spent half the time developing the female...cast instead of sexualizing them I might have hated it a little less.I wasn't lying when I said I wanted to like this show.

The animation for the most part was good. And despite lacking tactics and finesse the fights for the most part were entertaining. If it weren't for the fights I honestly don't think I'd finished this show. At times it's so bad that it's good.

But the single worst thing about the anime is this: As it is so often in anime our MC (by that I mean Yuuya) is written as a straight up fool.And by that I mean that he is unable to critically think, unable to analyze the situations sourrounding him, unable to stand up for himself. Overly naive.And that is something that is recognizable throughout the entire series which is frustrating. Frustration is like the worst thing a viewer can feel when watching something.Yuuya is intended to be...an average person but I think this goes beyond being an average person....As stated before nothing really is special about the anime. Story is ok, the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but especially our two MCs if you want to call them that. (Like seriously, Hitomi is nearly exactly the same at the end of the series compared to the start).I personally don't care about the fanservice.The way they connected the animal world with the fighting is watchable but it's not even close to being innovative. an average person but I think this goes beyond being an average person....As stated before nothing really is special about the anime.

It would be better if the characters were a little more interesting. The main guy is your typical anime protagonist and while the silver-haired girl was kinda fun, she doesn’t make up for the lack of character anyone else has. There have only been three fights so far and they all ended really quickly, so it doesn’t even have that going for it. I found the fanservice laughable, but I can see how it could get on someone's nerves. Overall, good for a cheap laugh but not much...else. else."", ""Honestly I really enjoyed it.

I really enjoyed Hitomi as a character, I did't really care for Nomoto for most of the show but he got better as it went on. Over all I think it is a good watch. Especially if you are into fan service...and action. and action."", 'tl;dr: An anime centered around flashiness and craziness over consistency or actual depth, but that does a pretty good job of it.Killing Bites was a very strange anime. How I would describe it is as an anime made in the style of Bloody Roar that feels a lot like professional wrestling, the latter of which I am basing on WWE but am assuming applies to Japanese professional wrestling as well. What I mean by it being like Bloody Roar, is that it primarily features fights between human animal hybrids called therianthropes and has a very similar feel to the combatants.What I mean by it being...like professional wrestling is that it has incredibly distinct characters, both in terms of personality and visual identity, but they’re also incredibly shallow. The plot is also incredibly simple and underdeveloped to the point that everything that happens feels both completely random and not built up to at all but also kind of like it fits since it’s not like there’s much for any sort of crazy twist to go against. The heel turns especially felt very professional wrestling like. The combat also has an announcer that commentates each match in very enthusiastic detail that reminds me of professional wrestling in terms of how everything that happens is framed as being super important and exciting. It’s also the the type of show you watch with your brain turned off, completely forget about for a while, and then come back to really easily because it’s so simplistic and overtly explains everything and thus the pacing will feel terrible if you marathon it.To put it simply, it has a lot of the same energy. I think it is important to note that this anime is far more edgy than Bloody Roar or any professional wrestling that I’ve ever seen, having lots of sex, sexual violence, though surprisingly not that much actual nudity, and lots of blood and gore as well. Also, most character’s don’t have specific catch phrases as they do in professional wrestling, but a phrase that’s something to the extent of “the sharpest fang wins, that’s what Killing Bites is” is said incredibly often by one of the main characters. I think it may well have been a rule that she says it at least one time per manga chapter, and the anime adapts multiple manga chapters per episode so she ends up saying it multiple times per episodes which results in it originally seeming cool, getting kind of annoying after it gets repeated so much, but then seeming kind of cool again once you get used to how it’s just going to be repeated so often.The anime also seems to have multiple layers of commentary, wherein in addition to the person in the anime commentating the matches in the world itself like professional wrestling, there’s also a narrator explaining things directly to the anime viewer in an excited manner, though not as excited as the in world match commentator, mainly how the moves that characters are doing match up to traits of the animal they’re based on in real life. In terms of everything described so far, I think it manages to do a pretty decent job. If you like stuff like that, I think you’ll be able to get some solid enjoyment from this anime.Beyond these aspects though, it’s somewhat of a mess. There’s this larger overarching plot going on about how the therianthropes are made and how four zaibatsu, basically Japanese megacorps, are controlling them and using them in games where they basically gamble control of the Japanese economy. There’s also a couple characters that could be thought of as the main characters, the extremely arrogant Uzaki Hitomi and the man she essentially forces to be her player, the completely normal college student Nomoto Yuuya. The anime seems to be centered around them, their connection to each other, and the connections they form with others. However, these aspects are pretty much dropped once the combat really gets going, only to return at the end with a bunch of crazy twists that turn everything into a complete garbage fire.There’s a very definite purpose to all of this, in that this entire season is basically just an origin story setting things up to have all sorts of crazy characters and action beyond it. However, it very clearly isn’t worth getting invested in anything this season because it really doesn’t matter beyond providing context for the action and the narrative has shown it’s very clearly completely willing to flip the board and destroy everything for the sake of that action. Another example of how action trumps everything else, is that the majority of battles in the anime are part of a large scale battle called Destroyal where players are apparently rolling die to move their partnered therianthropes across an island. However, the battles that actually occur don’t make a lick of sense as coming from the rules of the game as originally stated, and it doesn’t seem to even try to pretend that they do. So, this very much is a moment to moment style over substance anime, take it or leave it.In terms of production values, it was mostly decent, but had some pretty major drop in some areas at times. The designs for characters were very much a mixed bag ranging the spectrum from great to terrible pretty evenly. The art style wasn’t great, but fit well enough most of the time. The art and animation were mostly solid and worked well with what it was trying to convey, but there was some downright noticeably awful CG at times. The soundtrack felt like it only had a few tracks, but the tracks that it played the most felt like they fit incredibly well even with how often they were played, even if they were somewhat generic. The OP is solid enough in terms of visuals and audio. The ED’s song is only decent and it’s basically just a slide show of pinups, but they work very well off each other so the ED feels really solid too. like professional wrestling is that it has incredibly distinct characters, both in terms of personality and visual identity, but they’re also incredibly shallow.

Não são muito engraçadas essas cenas mas também não chegam a incomodar por serem bem breves.Como personagem marcante eu só posso listar...Uzaki Hitomi, sendo a protagonista do anime e personagem com disparado o maior tempo de tela estando envolvida em 87% das cenas de ação. (Não gosto de chutar números múltiplos de 5) e Nakanishi Eruza por ser ao meu ver a personagem mais atraente em questão de beleza e personalidade.Os traços dos personagens não são feios e a escolha da paleta de cores escura é facilmente notada mesmo em ambientes que teriam muita iluminação, sempre procurando o preto e dando um clima ainda mais sangrento nas batalhas, apesar de vermos somente sangue com poucos órgãos dilacerados por exemplo. (que por sinal esse sangue é bem medíocre e sempre aparece).Enquanto a maioria dos personagens masculinos podem se transformar em versões humanóides do animal de seus respectivos genes por completo, as personagens femininas sempre possuem alguma parte do corpo não visualmente transformada como coxas, braços, rosto e todo o tronco, muito provavelmente por conta do fan-service.Não prestei muita atenção na trilha musical dessa vez, só lembro de uma que é tocada na maioria das batalhas que envolve Hitomi mas não sei só existe uma para todas as lutas portanto nâo vou opinar. No entanto, os sons dos golpes eram sempre sons de corte com lâminas e notáveis sons de tiros para os mais pesados, o que normalmente não me incomoda se usados em poucos momentos... que não é o caso, então pra mim não funcionou bem e era impossível não notar que certos sons eram incompatíveis com certos golpes.Para finalizar, o último episódio do anime (até então), deixou espaço para uma continuação que provavelmente não ocorrerá tão cedo já que aparentemente o número de vendas no Japão não atingiu o esperado, mas o mangá continua, e pretendo um dia acompanhar mesmo não estando tão animado.O que mais me chocou foi que mesmo com tanto clichê, lutas ""mais ou menos"" e nada tão impressionante que atraia alguém a assistir, o episódio final foi com certeza a melhor coisa dos 12 episódios e ainda assim muita gente odiou o anime justamente por esse ""final"" (que é só o começo).Aparentemente as pessoas preferem ver sempre mais do mesmo e quando aparece algo novo que não estão acostumadas, um acontecimento importante e inesperado mesmo que faça sentido, elas odeiam e pedem que seja como em outras obras parecidas. (na minha visão isso costuma perder a graça). Uzaki Hitomi, sendo a protagonista do anime e personagem com disparado o maior tempo de tela estando envolvida em 87% das cenas de ação.

No entanto, os sons dos golpes eram sempre sons de corte com lâminas e notáveis sons de tiros para os mais pesados, o que normalmente não me incomoda se usados em poucos momentos... que não é o caso, então pra mim não funcionou bem e era impossível não notar que certos sons eram incompatíveis com certos golpes.Para finalizar, o último episódio do anime (até então), deixou espaço para uma continuação que provavelmente não ocorrerá tão cedo já que aparentemente o número de vendas no Japão não atingiu o esperado, mas o mangá continua, e pretendo um dia acompanhar mesmo não estando tão animado.O que mais me chocou foi que mesmo com tanto clichê, lutas ""mais ou menos"" e nada tão impressionante que atraia alguém a assistir, o episódio final foi com certeza a melhor coisa dos 12 episódios e ainda assim muita gente odiou o anime justamente por esse ""final"" (que é só o começo).Aparentemente as pessoas preferem ver sempre mais do mesmo e quando aparece algo novo que não estão acostumadas, um acontecimento importante e inesperado mesmo que faça sentido, elas odeiam e pedem que seja como em outras obras parecidas. (na minha visão isso costuma perder a graça).']"

It does give the some characters, particularly Ai, more screen time, and it makes up for the not-so-great jokes in the original show.Unfortunately, the episodes did get worse and worse. The first was the best, the second one not so great, the third... well, in one abbreviation: WTF?!The...art was quite nice, especially when the female characters are doing the dance, it feels almost 3D.Overall, while it doesn't contribute much to the original anime, it was still fun to watch with some cute moments as well as weird moments. art was quite nice, especially when the female characters are doing the dance, it feels almost 3D.Overall, while it doesn't contribute much to the original anime, it was still fun to watch with some cute moments as well as weird moments.""]"

Mahou no Princess Minky Momo: Yume no Naka no Rondo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2272/Mahou_no_Princess_Minky_Momo__Yume_no_Naka_no_Rondo,"[""This anime was of favourite of my little sister and I for a number of years and having recently re-watched it I was happy to find that it was still just as charming, interesting and FUNNY as it was when I was young. In fact I found there were new jokes and puns I hadn't known about as a girl because I was too young for them.If you're looking for a new magical girl series or other shōjo related material then Gigi and the Fountain of Youth will be right up your alley. It's cute enough that younger kids will like it, but...the pace, story line and humor will probably keep adult viewers happy also. And while the plot won't carry the depth of say, Sailor Moon, it does have a nice, albeit simple story line with a nice message and no more romantic aspects than say Peter Pan would.I would highly recommend it for those who enough anime such as Little Snow Fairy Sugar, Tokyo Mew Mew, Nurse Angel Ririka or Sailor Moon. I personally gave it an 8 because of my ability to re-watch it so frequently, but for an overall grade I would probably give it a 7.For those of you who aren't used to it please keep in mind that this is definitely an 80's anime (the hair alone will clue you in), so the art style might be a little dated for you. Personally I love older animation styles, so this was no problem for me but I realize that in this day and age many of the viewers just don't have the patience for anime that isn't flawless somehow.The music in this movie was a little campy at times, but overall I felt it was exactly appropriate for the style and mood of the anime. I am particularly happy with the ominous fighting sequences and the cute song from Gigi's dream.When you get down to it Gigi is a fantastic example of what makes a wonderful shōjo anime, particularly the dubbed version. Usually I find that English voice actors, or seiyuu, don't put a great deal of thought or imagination behind their characters which often makes for a flat or completely misguided character. However I didn't find that to be the case here, in fact even many of the side characters became favourites of mine because of their voice actors ability to give them a soul. I love the character of Fuzzy!Overall I found this to be a lovely, enjoyable show that I could watch as many times as I was asked to, which isn't often the case with anime of this genre. So, whether you're watching the sub or dubbed version of this anime it makes for a wildly entertaining show. the pace, story line and humor will probably keep adult viewers happy also.

For years, Production Reed’s Minky Momo (1982) duked it out against Studio Pierrot’s rival mahō shōjo series, Creamy Mami (1983). The original series for Minky Momo was sixty-three episodes and later, got reimagined as Mahō no Princess Minky Momo: Yume wo Dakishimete (1991)—leaving a legacy of magical girl hijinks for fans of the series to enjoy!This review contains spoilers for Mahō Princess Minky Momo: Yume no Naka no Rondo (1985)! You have been warned!—Story/CharactersThe story begins with Momo’s parents suddenly winning tickets to visit the...South Pole, so they leave Momo to to watch the house, that doubles as a veterinary clinic, while they go on vacation. Momo realizes that she’s useless at menial labor, finds out that her parents’ airplane has gone missing, and then decides to get into her magical girl helicopter to go find her mother and father. She finds out that they have been spirited away from their passenger flight, near a mysterious island that seems to be uninhibited.When she arrives at the island she runs into some conspicuous figures, including: Arsène Lupin and his son, members of the Italian mafia, and a spoof of James Bond. Soon after, everyone discovers that an aboriginal-run vacation resort is on the uninhibited island, where the natives charge a ridiculous amount of money for foreign spies to explore their land.NOTE: There are some funny visual gags, like a group of polar bears doing radio calisthenics on an iceberg.This is where things get really weird: it is revealed that the Bermuda Triangle is actually *Neverland and Peter Pan uses talking dragons to spray the island explorers with a manufactured, chemical gas that turns adults *into children forever, and then abducts them, so that they can always be innocent. An additional reveal is that the Pied Piper of Hamelin from folklore is actually none other than another incarnation of Peter Pan!*In this film, Neverland is a giant, magical orb in the sky. There’s actually an Arsène Lupin tale, La Demoiselle aux yeux verts, where Lupin discovers The Fountain of Youth.In the search for her parents, it turns out that Peter Pan is intentionally letting Momo’s mother and father remain adults, so that they can be the parents to the children of Neverland. Peter Pan offers Momo to stay as well, but she feels apprehensive about never being able to grow up—despite being a child herself.NOTE: In the scene on the balcony, when Peter Pan explains the futility of growing up—there was some excellent body language. Momo looks at him melancholically and he responds with an impetuous smirk, like he doesn’t understand her distress and then she just looks at him blankly. The end of this scene really establishes the lack of understanding between their two ideals.Even though all of the spies have lost all of their inhibition as small children, they are bugged with microscopic cameras, revealing the truth about Neverland to foreign embassies and so, the greedy embassies send armies out to steal the secrets of immortality from Neverland, so that they can make deathless soldiers.Neverland gets nuked by fighter jets and Momo concocts the idea to use the gas to turn the enemy soldiers into children, so they lose their will to fight. So, the residents of Neverland and Momo’s parents spread the gas around and they eventually beat their attackers. In the end, Peter Pan decides to leave the island since his secret location has been discovered and flies with his dragons through space.From that description, you can probably gather that it was a pretty weird movie. I personally thought the accolades for Yume no Naka no Rondo is more deserving on behalf of the visual presentation, rather than the story. The story felt as though the writers cobbled way too many ideas together to fit in a feature film. I don’t know their role in the television series but the king and queen of Fenarinarsa were useless, despite having magical powers. Apparently, their magic is not even strong enough to fix a broken television set.The dinosaur girl, Lei, was really awesome… her army of Tyrannosauruses flipping over military tanks and the pterodactyls taking down fighter jets were among the best scenes of the film! I haven’t seen the TV show yet, so I don’t know, but the movie acted as if Lei was a reoccurring character—based on her and Momo’s familiarity.NOTE: Momo also hijacks a jet and destroys the island’s resort… I have questions about how an elementary schooler knows how to pilot a fighter jet. Also, there are some pretty solid references to Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove in this film!The weakest part of Yume no Naka no Rondo are the moments when the pacing seems to drag, like in the scenes with Momo exploring Neverland and her conversations with Peter Pan. I’m sure that their dialogues were only boring to me because I am VERY familiar with the character of Peter Pan—I’m sure that the long explanation of his existence was meant for small children.—TechnicalThe visuals in this film were very reminiscent of Ghibli’s work in Porco Rosso (1992)—it makes me wonder if Hayao Miyazaki took inspiration from this movie. Many of the character designs have a Akira Toriyama ‘cartoon realism’ type of visual aesthetic. The main director on this series was Hiroshi Watanabe, notably the director of Majutsushi Orphen, Ō Dorobō Jing, and Yume de Aetera. All of his other series have similar pacing issues but are beautiful to look at. The other director was the chief director of the Minky Momo TV series, Kunihiko Yuyama; he is most famous for his work on *Pokémon, Genmu Senki Leda, and Windaria.*Kunihiko Yuyuma has directed nearly every Pokémon series and movie to date.The only seiyū credited on the film is Momo’s actress: Mami Koyama. Her other roles include:•\tBalalaika—Black Lagoon•\tVermouth—Detective Conan•\tArale Norimaki—Dr. Slump•\tLunch—Dragon Ball•\tJessica Edwards—Ginga Eiyū Densetsu•\tKycilia Zabi—Mobile Suit Gundam•\tFukiko Ichinomiya—Oniisama e...•\tShaina Ophiuchus—Saint Seiya•\tChiyoko Fujiwara—Millennium Actress•\tRyōko Mendō—Urusei YatsuraNOTE: It’s kind of weird that she once voiced one of the most serendipitous little girls in anime but, other than that, she is mainly type-cast as evil women.Overall, while the film did have its points of contention, it did make me want to watch the television series to find out more about Momo and and her entourage. I mean, how many girls, in the existing mahō shōjo series, actually own a magical helicopter? I would recommend this film to those who are fans of other classic magical girl series, like Cutey Honey (1973), and rate this film a 6/10 for its sense of childish wonder!

Mahoutsukai Sally 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3875/Mahoutsukai_Sally_2,"[""I assume everyone is already familiar with the series, premise and characters  and what makes them great when it comes to Mahoutsukai Sally as this is the reboot/sequel series. So I'll be talking about what stands out when compared to the original series.Firstly the most noticeable difference is the art, the original series had the 60s art and animation where the movement was emphasised at points. This series on the other hand shares the 80s darker visual atmosphere with softer character design and overall strokes are smoother. I'd say that the darker visual atmosphere is visually better looking though the characters have different emphasis...when compared to original. I wouldn't call that bad or good necessarily its just different.Now the voice acting definitely is not as good as it was in the original Sally in particular feeling lot more soft and matured as far as her voice is concerned, the cheeky vibe is also toned down and her voice has this kind vibe instead. I enjoyed the og interpretation of her character more personally but the new one is not bad necessarily it's just different. Same kind of changes can be observed from other characters too though those changes didn't impact me as much.It is not just the voice that was toned down feels like Sally as a character was kinda toned down, her magic was not as all powerful as in og some new rules were introduced in this series which I think made the concept of magic that was interesting in the original series not as interesting in this series. Though overall I'd say that it didn't impact my enjoyment much as the interaction between characters  and the character dynamics that made the original series one of my favorites didn't change that much considering that Sally and some others felt bit toned down.Overall ompared to the original series I'd say that it is visually impressive series with great visual atmosphere doing those aspects arguably better than the original, but falling bit short on some other areas. when compared to original.

Pastel Life,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37778/Pastel_Life,"[""Pastel Life is the first attempt at a comedic BanG Dream short series. It's a bit rough around the edges, but still enjoyable for BanG Dream fans. It's also easily accessible, since it's available on Youtube for free, complete with english subtitles.Every episode is about something funny and/or weird that happens to the members of Pastel Palettes, one of the BanG Dream bands. Each episode is more or less focused on one of the members. I thought the plots were entertaining, but nothing too great or memorable.The characters are all faithfully translated from the game to the anime and the humour is basically the same....The characters designs are exactly the same as the chibi versions of the characters from the mobile game and all the music is also from the game, so it feels very familiar if you've played it.The animation is quite limited, but it serves its purpose well enough.It's a cute little series I can't say anything bad about, even though it's nothing special either, but I'm sure BanG Dream fans will enjoy it, while everyone else can skip it. The future of BanG Dream shorts is bright, though, with BanG Dream! Garupa☆Pico coming up.But that's a story for a different review.

Onimusha,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53150/Onimusha,"[""I am beyond surprised that Capcom actually gave Onimusha to a team that cares about the source material that they are adapting. This, in my opinion, is an amazing adaptation with superbly choreographed fight scenes and plenty of likable character moments.The only shred of hope I had for this adaptation came from the fact that Takashi Miike was at the helm of the production as director and he is most likely the reason why action scenes look as amazing as they do. I think on its own, the show is still good, but as an adaptation of Onimusha, it is great.Animation:To start...it off I don't think a lot of people will be fond of the CGI. I had no problem with it because the hand-drawn backgrounds looked amazing and so did all of the fights. There are so many genuinely epic shots and camera angles used here, both in and out of action sequences.Also, the art style is just super on point, there are some areas where the color grading straight made me feel like I was watching a video of one of the games, especially when it comes to the backgrounds.Story:The story is fairly basic, it just follows Musashi and his companions while they go on an adventure and face various foes along the way. I think many people would rather love to see an adaptation focusing on Samanosuke or Jubei, but what we have here is genuinely good and can be treated as its own “game” because it perfectly fits into the Onimusha franchise.Character:As I briefly mentioned earlier, the anime focuses on Musashi traveling with a bunch of other characters as they go on an adventure. All of these characters get a lot of time to shine and akin to most of the games all of these are very memorable; I would argue that the show even has some of the best characters in the series.Conclusion:Amazing action sequences, really likable characters, respect for the source material, & stellar choreography all make this an easy 8/10 for me and as a Capcom adaptation this is like a 9/10 lol, because they never give their IPs to people who care. it off I don't think a lot of people will be fond of the CGI.

One second, it's a samurai drama, and the next, it's Sephiroth vs Goku: cheesy one-liner edition.I'd like to joke that the first half was written by someone...with a large amount of talent who, due to a lack of funding, could not be hired to finish the script, so they just fed what he/she wrote into an AI and let it scrape together the rest.

The plot and the ending were better than I expected. I don't know about the games and I only watched it because it was an anime. I definitely recommend it. It's a historical anime set in the Edo period and it has Miyamoto Mushashi and Sasaki Kojiro.

Patalliro! Stardust Keikaku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12663/Patalliro_Stardust_Keikaku,"[""I felt like this anime needed another review. I'll try to keep my fanboying down to a minimum but bear in mind that I love this show.It's hard to describe Patalliro to those who haven't seen it. It was absolutely ground-breaking for its time for being the first ever shounen-ai on Japanese TV. I would say it's a psychedelic adventure involving a Japanese, gay James Bond and a wacky, time-travelling ‘Scrappy-Doo type’ prankster dictator who solve apocalyptic diamond theft mysteries. It is very Japanese, there is a lot of surreal humour involving puns that you likely won't get unless you speak the language but...even if you don't, the antics are often entertaining.The movie Patalliro Stardust Keikaku is actually a great installment of this franchise. Given the score of the film being so low, I expected it to be like a bad episode but I would say this is one of the stronger episodes of Patalliro for several reasons:1. “Junior” is a great antagonist. Partly because he’s pretty fabulous - He has poison lipstick and he throws a rose before he tries to kill you, which is a bit of a giveaway but very stylish. But also, he’s a catalyst for friction between Bancoran and Maraich, which means the film is more focused on their relationship - which I love.2. All the main characters are great and have fantastic chemistry. I love Bancoran, his bishounen-killer ways and his almost violent but playful disdain for Patalliro is really funny to me. We also get to see some inner conflict for him in this film. Maraich’s jealous love for him is entertaining. Patalliro is a very acquired taste. I used to find him annoying but now I find his antics fun and silly (one reason why it’s probably best to watch the TV show first).3. My favourite thing about this film is the ending, which I won’t spoil but it was rather beautifully melancholic. The stardust and diamond aesthetic was gorgeous to look at.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s wacky and the “space science” doesn’t really make sense but the villain’s plan to end the world through the falling frozen diamond satellite causing mass extreme hail was really interesting.4. The plot felt tight in the best way. I'm pretty astounded that some people have found this movie to have no plot mostly because the plot is very evident, it’s totally wacky but it’s also totally there. If anything, there’s too much plot because a lot happens in this short runtime. There’s just enough comedic relief. The romance is well-woven in so that it’s pertinent to the story line. The denouement right at the end was honestly pretty unexpected.Here’s one caveat: I personally think you need to have seen the TV show to really appreciate it. It’s similar to the Revolutionary Girl Utena movie in that it’s intended to be standalone but if you know the characters, their motives and the basic set-up for the plot then it definitely helps. I would imagine that I would have been completely bewildered by several moments in the film if I hadn’t seen the TV show.For me, one of the main reasons for watching this is the art. This is very subjective, I would imagine that most people will hate the art style because it’s very unique and very dated but in a way that’s endlessly charming rather than jarring in my opinion. The backgrounds are stunning and the psychedelic colour scheme is so vibrant. It’s very stylised. It looks graphic and ornate and it reminds me of an Aubrey Beardsley painting or an Erte fashion drawing. I love the art style but it’s probably not for most people.The sound might be called cheesy or dated by some and it is but it’s also perfectly suited to the style of the show. It reminds me of those old seventies detective shows like Charlie’s Angels or classic Bond films. I think it’s fun, vintage and charming. For those fans of the show, much of the OST is reused (you’ll be pleased to know that the “Who Killed Cock Robin?” song makes an appearance) but there are also some fun new additions.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I think it’s really fun, weird and a great watch. I also think it’s unique and original with a great art style. That said, I’m not sure if I would recommend it to most people, it has so many things about it that people dislike, for example: it’s old, it’s shounen-ai, it’s very weird, it’s full of very japanese references and the animation is dated. If you can get past all that then you’ll probably love this film but it’s certainly not for everyone. even if you don't, the antics are often entertaining.The movie Patalliro Stardust Keikaku is actually a great installment of this franchise.

Where can you start with the absurdness that is thePatalliro anime? In a flurry of quick hitting gags and 70s gay (?) drama you realize one thing-If you are not Japanese, you will never be able to pin down half the cultural references. And an interesting relationship with Nazi imagery can ruin the series for some. For sure a movie for the seasoned anime viewer and being familiar with who the characters are, I'd say not seeing the whole TV show won't take away from seeing this uh...48 minute special.Will you forget the opening...scene half way through reminding you that there was some type of space setting? yes. Will the theme song make you pause the movie just so you can go and look it up? Yes. Will it be confusing because you remeber oh yeah Maraich gets PREGNANT in the source material?

Norn9: Norn+Nonet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31452/Norn9__Norn_Nonet,"['Hmmm...Did you read that synopsis for Norn9 ? If you didn\'t, read it and come back....Good? Ok. Now you can erase it from your mind because that synopsis is a lie. Did I ruin your hopes and dreams for this show yet? Edit 2021: This part was written when the synopsis only stated the story would be about Sorata which was a blatant lie. I see somebody on MAL now changed the synopsis so this joke doesn\'t work anymore, but I\'m gonna keep it because I find myself funny! ;)Story - 4I am serious, what the synopsis says is not even a quarter of what\'s...really going on. If it would have indeed focused on the story from Sorata\'s eyes from episode 1 to the end, maybe we could have gotten a decent sci-fi story, but nope. The kid arrives around episode 3 or 4 and gets ignored for most of the show in favor for the romance, till when he was needed in the ending for whatever reason he was brought from the future for, which seriously, felt more like a need for emotional impact rather than anything else. And yes, I am fully aware this is an otome game adaptation and as such it\'s only normal to focus on the ""otoge"" fanservice more, but do I ask for the impossible when I expect a nice story with it too? (Excepting those that really have only romance as main point. ex: basic highschool otoges) Even having a bunch of people coping up with their supernatural powers would have been great! I\'m not even asking for much.The worst is that Norn9 has all the cards set to make a solid base for a good FF Type-0*coughs* fantasy/time-travelling story, it just didn\'t know how to stuff it all up in 12 episodes (13, if we count the summary episode too, which I question even the existence of; was it too hard to give it one more story-episode instead of a summary ? It really felt like they needed to be SURE we REALLY understood the plot, which made me fairly suspicious. Was it trying to tell me that the story is actually worth it enough to understand? That makes me feel even more sorry for the wasted potential, instead of feeling enlightened. It makes me feel like it was supposed to be so much more.)Was it the fault of the 12 episodes being way too short for such a story? Personally, I don\'t think so. A good chunk of the fault goes to whoever directed/wrote this. Their choice to focus more on Kakeru and Sakura-...wait, what? Her name is not Sakura? Well, I don\'t care, Fire- bender Pink Missy? (I must have insulted all Fire Benders of the Avatar realm, ImsosorryZuko!) - only turned the show duller rather than help it. Why them? Why her? Why not Cool-Ojousama or Miss Kuudere  which were by far more interesting? No. Why focusing so much on one pairing at all? The story could have completed itself so much better if it was told from 3 perspectives instead, which sounds like too much, but believe me, it is not, seeing the complexity of the story that they wanted to present here. Yet it all felt so...distant...and done for the heck of it. Chaotic. All over the place.Plus, there\'s that deus ex machina 100% convenient and 100% foreseeable ending (for the main couple). I would have been ready to raise my rating for it if it wouldn\'t have turned out in such a foreseeable manner.Characters - 3God have mercy on my soul. Okay, no, that was an exaggeration, but God have mercy on my soul when it comes to Kakeru and ...*checks for her name properly now* Koharu! RIGHT. If any of you watched Kamigami no Asobi just please put Kakeru next to Apollon and then tell me what you think. Comparison done? Great! They\'re awfully similar, aren\'t they? Just that, while I could ...kinda...understand Apollon\'s pain to a greater extent (and I put emphasis on ""kinda""), Kakeru just managed to make me want to hit myself. I could never manage to put my finger on him and the overall chaotic storytelling didn\'t really help me care either. No, I\'ll go even further. I\'ve seen so many Kakeru\'s that I can\'t help but go cold when I\'m able to realize all his issues from the first glance. It\'s just that simple.It all goes so slow, but then so fast. All these characters seem to not care all that much, only to care later on for no apparent reason. Koharu was another one of those dull heroines that\'s there to just make the guys look better, always in need of saving, always in need of reassuring and not able to do anything without her man; and to top all that, she\'s selfish, because her happiness with Kakeru is more important than the whole world, and I don\'t care otome games need a happy ending. I do not even remotely agree and it simply frustrated me more. Rant over.Fortunately, the other two heroines were really fun and if they were given a better chance, the anime wouldn\'t have been such a pile of mess (but unfortunately, they weren\'t). Mikoto was the strong-willed, sometimes rough girl, trying to find a path that fit her ideals, then there\'s Shiranui (who really looks like Echo from Pandora Hearts to me) who couldn\'t forgive herself for a sin she made in the past. Yeah, Koharu fitted into the main story better than the other two, but seeing how she\'s almost a blank sheet of paper, I would have went around it somehow...The other guys...Welp, must not lie, I didn\'t particularly like anybody. Sure, there was Natsuhiko, Senri, Itsuki, Shukuri and Sakuya who are types that I usually tend to like, but in this case, I didn\'t really have much of a reason to just fawn over them.(*coughs* besides when Shukuri got the wolf ears *coughs*). Sure, they\'re all pretty guys and those that I mentioned actually have some sort of backstory and some thoughts of their own, but they didn\'t hit me as characters; too little, too little time. Some of them can barely even categorize as characters. They\'re just...there. And there\'s Ron. I really, REALLY think that Ron is an underrated character and the way the anime treats him is only obvious. There was always that type of mystery around him, but we never found out anything about him, he was just there when it was convenient, then disappeared when he was no longer needed. And I find that a shame because I was really interested in him, no matter how much some people that played the otome game tend to dislike him. (or so I hear)Is this enough? ....No, you say? Oh right, I forgot the villain. Welp, he\'s not an original one and not even remotely unique in any way. We\'ve seen his type of characters many times and done way better. By the time he came in, I just wanted it all to end.Animation & OST - 6.5I was pretty happy with the animation for the most part as well for the character designs though some of them are clearly overused, but it\'s ok, it\'s nothing particularly fancy. There are very brilliant and vibrant colors throughout the entirety of the show and the animation got particularly better in the last 2-3 episodes and all through the climax. I also remember some scenes of the dream episode and the flashbacks which were really pretty. Must be honest that some other parts were more flashy than actually good, though.As for the OST, decent. I really loved the opening and ending themes and Aion\'s song was really pretty. Nothing outstanding though.Conclusion - 4Welp, could have went way better. Just a note though, I did not play the Norn9 otome game so I don\'t know how they deal with it there; I also make no parallels to the game and if I disliked the execution of the anime, it doesn\'t mean that I also dislike the otome game or Norn9 in its entirety. I really don\'t. I\'m just salty about the potential that it had. Edit 2021: I played the otome game. It\'s one of the best otome games I\'ve ever played 100% recommend!Do I recommend it? I guess I do, but only to the people that already played the game or to people that just want to stare at some handsome bishies. Want a good story? Look somewhere else. really going on. If it would have indeed focused on the story from Sorata\'s eyes from episode 1 to the end, maybe we could have gotten a decent sci-fi story, but nope. The kid arrives around episode 3 or 4 and gets ignored for most of the show in favor for the romance, till when he was needed in the ending for whatever reason he was brought from the future for, which seriously, felt more like a need for emotional impact rather than anything else. And yes, I am fully aware this is an otome game adaptation and as such it\'s only normal to focus on the ""otoge"" fanservice more, but do I ask for the impossible when I expect a nice story with it too? (Excepting those that really have only romance as main point. ex: basic highschool otoges) Even having a bunch of people coping up with their supernatural powers would have been great! I\'m not even asking for much.The worst is that Norn9 has all the cards set to make a solid base for a good FF Type-0*coughs* fantasy/time-travelling story, it just didn\'t know how to stuff it all up in 12 episodes (13, if we count the summary episode too, which I question even the existence of; was it too hard to give it one more story-episode instead of a summary ? It really felt like they needed to be SURE we REALLY understood the plot, which made me fairly suspicious. Was it trying to tell me that the story is actually worth it enough to understand? That makes me feel even more sorry for the wasted potential, instead of feeling enlightened. It makes me feel like it was supposed to be so much more.)Was it the fault of the 12 episodes being way too short for such a story? Personally, I don\'t think so. A good chunk of the fault goes to whoever directed/wrote this. Their choice to focus more on Kakeru and Sakura-...wait, what? Her name is not Sakura? Well, I don\'t care, Fire- bender Pink Missy? (I must have insulted all Fire Benders of the Avatar realm, ImsosorryZuko!) - only turned the show duller rather than help it. Why them? Why her? Why not Cool-Ojousama or Miss Kuudere  which were by far more interesting? No. Why focusing so much on one pairing at all? The story could have completed itself so much better if it was told from 3 perspectives instead, which sounds like too much, but believe me, it is not, seeing the complexity of the story that they wanted to present here. Yet it all felt so...distant...and done for the heck of it. Chaotic. All over the place.Plus, there\'s that deus ex machina 100% convenient and 100% foreseeable ending (for the main couple). I would have been ready to raise my rating for it if it wouldn\'t have turned out in such a foreseeable manner.Characters - 3God have mercy on my soul. Okay, no, that was an exaggeration, but God have mercy on my soul when it comes to Kakeru and ...*checks for her name properly now* Koharu! RIGHT. If any of you watched Kamigami no Asobi just please put Kakeru next to Apollon and then tell me what you think. Comparison done? Great! They\'re awfully similar, aren\'t they? Just that, while I could ...kinda...understand Apollon\'s pain to a greater extent (and I put emphasis on ""kinda""), Kakeru just managed to make me want to hit myself. I could never manage to put my finger on him and the overall chaotic storytelling didn\'t really help me care either. No, I\'ll go even further. I\'ve seen so many Kakeru\'s that I can\'t help but go cold when I\'m able to realize all his issues from the first glance. It\'s just that simple.It all goes so slow, but then so fast. All these characters seem to not care all that much, only to care later on for no apparent reason. Koharu was another one of those dull heroines that\'s there to just make the guys look better, always in need of saving, always in need of reassuring and not able to do anything without her man; and to top all that, she\'s selfish, because her happiness with Kakeru is more important than the whole world, and I don\'t care otome games need a happy ending. I do not even remotely agree and it simply frustrated me more.

Look somewhere else.', ""Rather than a review, this is more of a forewarning.Having played and thoroughly enjoyed the visual novel/ game version of this anime adaptation, I sort of began watching this show with the expectation that there would be a ton of missing content, and I could almost smell the disappointment and confusion of new viewers.A fact: the plot for Norn9 makes zero sense being told just once. From the get-go it has a complicated world and story line, with each characters' individual stories having huge effects on others'.Logistically it's pretty impossible to cram hours and hours and hours of character development and backstory...into a measly 13 episodes. So what you end up with is a sort of commendable mish-mash of scenes from the directors/ writers desperate attempts to somehow get it all to work. To be honest I was expecting this anime to be a train wreck, but i was pleasantly surprised as it seemed like a some key plot elements were decently conveyed, and there was just enough random fluff, romance, and light humor to bring some balance.I would recommend watching this anime if you've got time to kill. Expect to be casually entertained, something to lift your mood with.

I'm not sure if it was that I missed something, but the logic in this is just confusing and makes no sense. It also makes me wonder why everything is as it is.

Adoptions from Visual Novels, especially Otome-Games are more or less the same. The female main-character is 'weak', teary and credulous. Koharu is exaggerated like this. The story is okay, but long-winded and foreseeable. The tension is often really short and not that special. Unfortunatly the story is facile, also the characters and whose past.Short: Not a good anime. I like and watch other animes, which are adaptions from VN, but not one anime, was like that horrible including the main-character.But -> Watch it, and build your own opinion! (: "", ""Norn9 is a series with two distinct personalities.On the one hand it's a very shoujo styled drama with lots of time spent focusing on romance and the relationships of all the main characters. In this regard the show is solid which is to be expected given the show is an adaption of a visual novel. Now while some of the drama that unfolds is melodramatic and similarly unoriginal it is at least compelling. Or to me it was, I was never bored with this aspect of the show.Now on the other hand Norn9 is also a sci-fi drama, the setting is aboard the...'ship' Norn is visually very interesting helped alot by the solid visuals in the show. But the Sci-Fi plot is the weaker side of the series and what ultimately for me at least held it back. This is because for most of the shows 12 episodes beyond the location of the Norn itself not very much time is given to explaining just what on earth is going on. We are presented with somewhat of a mystery and yet we are given very few clues for at least half the show and while the layers do eventually begin to unwrap it takes too long in doing so. Once it has though you'd be forgiven for not caring as the show rarely seems to either, the same could definitely be said for the characters also.I would argue that the shows visual novel roots are to blame here, in a visual novel the characters are the story and are notorious for dolling out their plots slowly in favor of character development. Also much like a visual novel tends to do once the show decides it's Sci-Fi time it really goes for it, it's actually quite jarring how bait and switch it is. We go from light romance melodrama to full on Science Fiction with a bunch of ideas being thrown out at you and it becomes very hard to keep up at times.For me Norn9 is a show with bags of potential that was just poorly handled. I like the setting, the characters while typical of their otome Visual Novel roots are likable and interesting and and the Sci-Fi plot, while again somewhat typical of the genre is still quite ambitious and interesting but ultimately the two sides of this show just don't blend well enough to be satisfactory. They are both fighting against each other and neither have really enough time to breath in just 12 episodes.So finally I would like to say that if the synopsis strikes your fancy then give the show a try but just hold expectations in check becauses chances are the show will struggle to meet them.

The 3 love stories vary depending on your anime stereotypes and some are either too cliched or underdeveloped in many ways. Let\'s look at LA\'s favourite character Mikoto Kuga voiced by \'\'Ayahi Takagaki\'\' relationship with Sakuya Nijou voiced by \'\'Mitsuki Saiga\'\', as Sakuya has a ""protector"" status on Mikoto and they are actually childhood friends, however as much as this anime plays around with this kind of relationship,...it\'s cliched and repetitive especially on Sakuya\'s part of being overly protective, thus Mikoto was LA\'s favourite character as she had the voice of reason and leadership in the Norn ship.The next relationship is probably the most level-headed developed one, Nanami Shiranui voiced by \'\'Asami Seto\'\' and Akito Shukuri voiced by \'\'Noria Sugiyama\'\' as they at first were polar opposites but their development seems the most functional and less annoying by the end of it, not to mention making Akito a straight up tsundere with Nanami being the deadpan is somewhat a nice relationship dynamic.Finally the MOST annoying an done of the core focus of this anime relationship of Koharu voiced by \'\'Ayumi Fujimura\'\' and Kakeru Yuiga voiced by \'\'Yuki Kaji\'\' as Koharu has ""female protagonist in an anime otome game adaptation syndrome"" along with her incessant dialogue of having ""Kakeru"" was rather annoying, yes this relationship develops immensely but all the way through it\'s cheesy and annoying throughout, we see these three relationship throughout the bulk of anime and considering there were only one of the three relationships LA liked, this could end badly if not for the B plot coming in making this anime a little bit tolerable. Ohh before LA forgets, the rest of the 6 guys in the main cast are nothing but support characters or a ""plot catalyst"".The B plot answers what LA questioned about these characters and the floating world of Norn LA was saying earlier and that was a least tolerable due to how these relationships work into this B plot, however with the one core exception being Koharu and Kakeru\'s annoying puppy-love relationship driving the entire B Plot along. The B Plot by all means helped the plot but it came rather late.This anime has terrible pacing issues, as much as they do character development for these relationships which is a plus, it\'s excruciatingly slow for the first half of the series with most of the cast members loafing around until a plotline demands that certain characters do certain things and once the B plot picks up, they RUSH it to no end as well as rush 2 relationships plotlines and put the major focus on Kakeru and Koharu\'s relationship which once again annoyed LA.The animation by Kinema Citrus is actually very decent, crisp character designs to heck beautiful background work, even some of the battles and short-winded as they are does look decent on the eyes with the bigger battle set pieces for LA seeing that Kinema Citrus didn\'t slack.The ending well LA will keep it short, it ended almost abruptly TOO well, like EVERY PLOTLINE was resolved too perfectly.Norn9: Norn+Nonet DOES have potential as 3 loves stories, however is bogged down by terrible pacing issues, doing multiple plotlines at the same time, half the cast that were nothing but support characters and just bringing in filler episodes where it REALLY wasn\'t needed for any, heck LA will say as annoying as Kakeru and Koharu\'s relationship is, it was plot-driven and tied into the B Plot so that least was enough for LA to carry on watching it, but with all the faults LA said it\'s ""tolerable"" at best, it could have some sense of structure if the plot and characters were just THIS bloated with ideas.""Keep it simple"" could have easily made this anime better. This anime isn\'t an outright clusterfuck of rushed ideas, it was definitely close to it, however if it wasn\'t for some semblance of focus from the B Plot and some characters/character relationship LA liked throughout this anime, it could have been much worse. it\'s cliched and repetitive especially on Sakuya\'s part of being overly protective, thus Mikoto was LA\'s favourite character as she had the voice of reason and leadership in the Norn ship.The next relationship is probably the most level-headed developed one, Nanami Shiranui voiced by \'\'Asami Seto\'\' and Akito Shukuri voiced by \'\'Noria Sugiyama\'\' as they at first were polar opposites but their development seems the most functional and less annoying by the end of it, not to mention making Akito a straight up tsundere with Nanami being the deadpan is somewhat a nice relationship dynamic.Finally the MOST annoying an done of the core focus of this anime relationship of Koharu voiced by \'\'Ayumi Fujimura\'\' and Kakeru Yuiga voiced by \'\'Yuki Kaji\'\' as Koharu has ""female protagonist in an anime otome game adaptation syndrome"" along with her incessant dialogue of having ""Kakeru"" was rather annoying, yes this relationship develops immensely but all the way through it\'s cheesy and annoying throughout, we see these three relationship throughout the bulk of anime and considering there were only one of the three relationships LA liked, this could end badly if not for the B plot coming in making this anime a little bit tolerable.

The B Plot by all means helped the plot but it came rather late.This anime has terrible pacing issues, as much as they do character development for these relationships which is a plus, it\'s excruciatingly slow for the first half of the series with most of the cast members loafing around until a plotline demands that certain characters do certain things and once the B plot picks up, they RUSH it to no end as well as rush 2 relationships plotlines and put the major focus on Kakeru and Koharu\'s relationship which once again annoyed LA.The animation by Kinema Citrus is actually very decent, crisp character designs to heck beautiful background work, even some of the battles and short-winded as they are does look decent on the eyes with the bigger battle set pieces for LA seeing that Kinema Citrus didn\'t slack.The ending well LA will keep it short, it ended almost abruptly TOO well, like EVERY PLOTLINE was resolved too perfectly.Norn9: Norn+Nonet DOES have potential as 3 loves stories, however is bogged down by terrible pacing issues, doing multiple plotlines at the same time, half the cast that were nothing but support characters and just bringing in filler episodes where it REALLY wasn\'t needed for any, heck LA will say as annoying as Kakeru and Koharu\'s relationship is, it was plot-driven and tied into the B Plot so that least was enough for LA to carry on watching it, but with all the faults LA said it\'s ""tolerable"" at best, it could have some sense of structure if the plot and characters were just THIS bloated with ideas.""Keep it simple"" could have easily made this anime better. This anime isn\'t an outright clusterfuck of rushed ideas, it was definitely close to it, however if it wasn\'t for some semblance of focus from the B Plot and some characters/character relationship LA liked throughout this anime, it could have been much worse.', ""I really enjoyed Norn9. It was an interesting concept that I hadn't seen before.I was originally drawn into this series because it was in the romance genre and had a really good looking art style which I would have to say is visually stunning which always left a good impression going into the anime.All of the characters were interesting in their own way and the many romances within the story allowed me to be engaged in more than one story simultaneously. Each romance also came with good progression and really helped with the romance atmosphere of the series. I did think that there was some...vagueness with some of the characters motivations but it didn't effect my overall enjoyment of the series.I really liked the main character Koharu as she's a great character and has been given a good backstory to further develop the relationships between characters. This followed by the amazing art style created one of my favourite characters from anime.The soundtrack was absolutely amazing and really helped the setting of the series being unforgettable. It also helped for individual scenes and creating certain emotions dependent on that particular scene which I haven't seen a soundtrack like that in a long while.Overall I would have to say this series is definitely worth a watch not only because of its visual appeal but also its main characters being that lovable you'll want to support them till the end. vagueness with some of the characters motivations but it didn't effect my overall enjoyment of the series.I really liked the main character Koharu as she's a great character and has been given a good backstory to further develop the relationships between characters.

I really recommend it!"", 'I went back to this to understand why I gave it such a low rating when I first watched it, since I usually remember details about shows even when they\'re bad. But BOY was my past self right about this show. One might argue that it\'s only expected of something based on an otome, but I\'d disagree. There are mediocre shows based on otomes, sure, but this goes beyond that: it\'s plain bad. A couple of episodes brought all the suppressed memories back, and after a while I had to skip parts of the show because I couldn\'t bear to watch them again. I can...assure you, unless you\'re here for the bishies, you won\'t go far with this.What is this show about? I\'d like to know as well, because it completely lacks focus. It tries its best to be character driven, as expected of an otome, but it fails miserably as all the characters are generic and have essentially no depth. The writing is painfully poor. Some scenes dragged for way too long, yet towards the end they realized they managed time horribly, and rushed everything, inevitably resulting into a horrible mess. But even then, as the viewer, you probably won\'t care enough to try and understand what\'s going on, in fact if you have any self respect you\'ll probably skip through it or drop it altogether and go watch something actually good. The ending is predictable and overdone, just your usual happily ever after. Not much else to say.The art is fine, but nothing outstanding. The character designs are generic as can be, much like their personalities, but I swear I have seen all of these characters in plenty of other anime, and chances are, you have too. As for the backgrounds, they\'re fine, but sometimes the colors are somewhat washed out, which shouldn\'t be the case in a fantasy/romance anime that *tries* to set the lovey-dovey mood it does. The only thing that saves it is that they will occasionally include a scene that\'s pleasant to the eye, and the opening fits into  that.The soundtrack is okay, in fact I quite like the opening, and to be honest they did do music right. You can find a few pieces here and there that are nice. They\'re not anything memorable, but you don\'t want to cut your ears off when they\'re playing, I\'d actually argue that they\'re quite pleasant.Now here comes the worst part: the characters. I couldn\'t care for a single one of them, because they\'re literally characters you\'ll find in every otome ever, done badly. There\'s the perfect dude with no flaws that gets to your nerves, the tragic siblings, the serious quiet guy, the cute one etc. The MC is generic so that ""you can relate"", but how can you relate to a character with no common sense that is unable to make any choice for herself, and whose only trait is being into that guy. The other two girls are walking stereotypes of anime girls, overdone as everything in this show. As for character development, don\'t even ask. It\'s not like that was unexpected though. They can\'t even do the basics in this, you can\'t expect character development. The saddest thing is, this was supposed to be chatacter focused. If they couldn\'t do the story right, they should at least have tried to make the characters stand out, have some depth, some development, something. But it seems we\'re asking for too much here.As you can probably tell, I didn\'t enjoy this show the tiniest bit. Its only redeeming quality is its music, yet I can easily go listen to that without losing braincells over watching 12 episodes of this atrocity. I believe this show is objectively bad, because it did everything wrong in terms of its story and characters alike.Would I recommend this to anyone? Maybe, MAYBE to those bishie loving fangirls with too much time on their hands, but even then you\'ll probably find it mediocre at best. There are many shows in the genre that are leagues above Norn9. Even though there is no shame in enjoying the things you do, Norn included, you have to agree that from a strictly objective standpoint, this anime is not even close to being the best one out there. If you truly have as much time in your hands as to watch this, go ahead, but otherwise maybe save your time and go watch something better. assure you, unless you\'re here for the bishies, you won\'t go far with this.What is this show about?

Not as a standalone anime review but rather a mixture.First of all, the story is a bit derailed so to say, since I\'m speaking from game to anime. In the game, you\'re actually the 3 heroines, Koharu, Mikoto and Nanami. The second part is this was based on a Visual Novel so you have the various routes, good and bad endings. Keep that in mind, because they can\'t cover all the male characters into the anime, so they\'ve basically...stuck to their main pairing for the anime. You won\'t notice this much in the anime as a standalone though.Story, small minor changes happens so that the story line can be made, I might have said it was derailed but nonetheless, there is a story line, you just need to patch it here and there a lot in the game. The anime pretty much compact everything so it\'s a nutshell, less brain-work.Art/animation, I have nothing to say, the only thing that might have tripped me off is how they decided to execute their ""powers"", the game showed it a bit differently but otherwise as a standalone factor, you wouldn\'t noticed that.Sound, it was pretty similar to the game but of course, the anime has more time duration so there\'s more tracks. I think it suits the scenes so it gets my thumbs up. Either way, I\'d say it\'s very pretty and touching. I think I\'m being a bit prejudice but either way, as a standalone factor, it does work well.[Update: Going through the entire anime soundtracks and not just relying on listening from the anime itself, it\'s very good, majestic and yet very pretty.]Character, this was lowest part of all, in the game & anime, they made a very quick sum up for each of the characters except maybe some (in game) but the anime skipped this out. You really wouldn\'t get why the story happened until the end of the anime, and it\'s still pretty shady because of this. This also ties in with my ""Story"" rating factor, I wanted to give the story rating to a 7 but the characters did drag it down to a 6, for these reasons.Koharu\'s part, they messed it up in the first episode. And in the end, Kakeru goes all Spider-man for her. I can go on with this and the way Ron just did that toss..., the physics were defied (game kept the physic logic intact). So this was a bad part of the anime. And the pairings were really bad, despite the main pairing, it mainly focused on Koharu and somewhat of Nanami, barely Mikoto. So much for 3 heroines in the anime, more like 2/3 (lol).Enjoyment, I did enjoy it out of anticipating for the anime when I finished the game, but I did have quite the ""wtf in a bad way"" moments.Overall...yes, long story short, if you\'ve played the game, this might be a real trainwreck but, IT DID do a better job than the other otome anime adaptions, just better but not great. But gamers, let\'s keep this in mind, the visual novel WAS beyond the length of a simple one cour anime, so ease up on the full cannon materials here, it\'s not possible.As a standalone anime, this is definitely watchable, if you haven\'t played the game, it\'s definitely passable, you won\'t really have a struggle at all.I stand by what I\'ve said and my overall is definitely a 7, with my review as a combination of the game and the anime, and somewhat prejudice view. stuck to their main pairing for the anime.

Guilty Crown, Star Driver).CHARACTER: 6I assumed from the start that all of the characters were placed there for a reason since the art and the synopsis gives off an impression that by the end of the anime all of their purpose will be revealed and will fit each other like a puzzle but I was disappointed. Some characters were simply placed there for the sake of completing the passenger count. Aside from the 3 couples formed in the anime, the rest were extras. There was no character development for the others and most of them are only there when the scene calls for their abilities. The main couple was also a generic pairing. Why does the main heroine, who possesses far better and stronger power than the male lead, always need to be saved? Why can’t she save herself when she’s capable of doing it?

Also, I have only watched the show and not played the game.I was extremely confused by the ending since it made no logical sense and the storyline was basically crammed in the last few episodes. The girl stops the bad guy from being selfish....just to be equally selfish! It was mind-baffling since her selfishness wasn\'t for a greater cause.I also hated the ending for multiple reasons:1. The ending events occur because she falls in love with a person she...has only known for a brief period of time >.> NO DEVELOPMENT = NO SYMPATHY from me2. The girl is stupid (has like the IQ of a bird, though the birds in this show are smarter than her), has no substantial thoughts and doesn\'t think for herself or for the world, makes no logical decisions, only acts based on other\'s commands or suggestions, and mainly acts based on how she\'s ""feeling"" or ""what her heart tells her.""Now for my rant - WARNING!

Yes, it was hard to follow at first and as with most stories that have too many characters not enough was explained. However, it really did keep me on my toes about what the hell was going on and for the most part it reminded me a lot of final fantasy. I didn't read any background into the game before watching this, which to my awesome surprise had music created by the famous final fantasy composer. I love FF so this was perfect for me. Honestly, I was just looking to watch a reverse harem (turns out...it really wasn't) romance anime at first and most of the time these have little meaning in them. I could spend days analyzing everything about this story such as the meaning behind their chosen powers, war, love, individuality, friendship, beliefs, etc. It's these themes that make the anime special. Plus the music is AWESOME. I wish it had more eps to dive deeper into the stories of the other characters and as with most anime the ending left me with a WTF, but like eh okay...I guess so. ultimately, i was still satisfied with a really good watch. I give this a 9 because of the story and the deeper meanings behind each theme in the story. it really wasn't) romance anime at first and most of the time these have little meaning in them.

Visually, the anime appears low budget and sloppy. Sometimes the background setting looks good, but the character animations themselves are consistently poor. Art style and colour palette are also fairly bland. Character designs are okay. There are occasionally some scenes where the visuals are nice, but the anime is very inconsistent, and on average weak, in this regard.Fantastic soundtrack. Truly exceptional. I actually started listening to the OST long before I watched the anime itself. I even put it on my portable music device. It has some...amazing tracks. The OST is by Kevin Penkin, who more recently made the wonderful Made in Abyss soundtrack. Voice acting is okay -- the three lead female characters all do a good job.Interesting sort-of-steampunk sci-fi setting with sky ships and things of that nature. Very little is explained but it's still lightyears better than your typical school environment.The main character, for lack of a better phrase, is a complete autist. She is very awkward, shy, naive, and has zero social skills. Some people might find this tiresome but I thought it was kind of endearing. I'm so used to seeing males as the socially unskilled character that it's refreshing to have a female lead character fill that role. Actually there was a general trend within the entire cast of the female characters being introverted or strange in some way, whereas the male characters were comparatively more normal. Otome media typically focus on one main female character, but in Norn9 there were multiple female characters each of whom had their own character arc; I quite liked this aspect of the show, although I think a longer runtime was needed to comfortably accommodate each character arc.Both the plot as a whole and the scene-by-scene drama felt ham-fisted to me. This is a common quality among VN adaptations. It's not necessarily a bad thing; it can be enjoyable as long as you expect it. That said, from early in the series it felt like a ton of plot strings and individual character arcs were introduced at once, and this made the viewing experience somewhat perplexing, particularly during the earlier episodes. Similarly, although character development is implemented frequently, it's not enough to compensate for such a large cast of characters, most of whom were introduced early in the series. However, character development among the core main characters was handled alright.Romance is a strong aspect of the show, despite it sometimes being as ham-fisted as everything else. Most episodes have at least one decent romantic scene. There are also multiple romantic pairings that are developed, which is something I enjoy in romance-focused series. The use of multiple different couples among a unique set of characters creates variety in terms of character interaction and the chemistry of the romance itself. This anime really delivered on the romance front, in my opinion. It frequently made me feel warm fuzzies within myself while viewing.My overall rating: 7/10I enjoyed watching it, but it would have been much better if it wasn't so unpolished. It was good, however there was still a lot of unrealized potential. Norn9 does romance really well, has an amazing soundtrack and a unique setting. However, it also has serious direction problems.I really want to rate this higher but I can't ignore the fact that I spent a considerable amount of the viewing time feeling confused about what was happening. I'm not sure if the intended audience for the anime was someone already acquainted with the VN. Apparently the VN is way longer and more elaborate than the content of this adaptation. I have not read the VN and my critique does not apply to the VN. I would like to read it though, and then rewatch this anime with a better understanding of the story. I wish the anime itself was much longer because there is clearly so much more to the story than was included in this single cour. In fact, trying to adapt the VN into a mere 12 episodes is probably a major cause of this anime's problems. Someone truly interested in this franchise is probably better off reading the VN before watching the anime.I would only recommend watching this to someone who enjoys shoujo-ish romance, or to someone interested in seeing an otome story implemented in a sci-fi setting. However, even if this anime doesn't appeal to you, the soundtrack itself is worth a listen.

Sadly, it wasn't able to fulfill these ideas with great execution.With just twelve episodes, Norn9 suffers from poor pacing.

Nevertheless, I...can say I enjoyed it.Sure, it has some of the features I wrote up there, such as some little plot holes, not too deep characters, and a complicated story, but considering the overall, it was as if the story took over the whole show, captivating entirely the public's attention, making it forget about all the little issues seen mostly in the first episodes.The story itself is brilliant, indeed perfect for a game, but too big for a 12 episode anime (one of the main reasons these shows all have a low score).I'll be honest, after watching Norn9 I had to look for some more information, to add some missing details and understand better what happened, but it's also true that the most important thing the anime shows (the reset) is unexpectedly well explained.In conclusion I believe that this anime compared to the other game based ones is a bit better, maybe not a masterpiece but neither trash. :) can say I enjoyed it.Sure, it has some of the features I wrote up there, such as some little plot holes, not too deep characters, and a complicated story, but considering the overall, it was as if the story took over the whole show, captivating entirely the public's attention, making it forget about all the little issues seen mostly in the first episodes.The story itself is brilliant, indeed perfect for a game, but too big for a 12 episode anime (one of the main reasons these shows all have a low score).I'll be honest, after watching Norn9 I had to look for some more information, to add some missing details and understand better what happened, but it's also true that the most important thing the anime shows (the reset) is unexpectedly well explained.In conclusion I believe that this anime compared to the other game based ones is a bit better, maybe not a masterpiece but neither trash. :)"", 'Let me first tell you that I absolutely love the visual novel game Norn9 (despite its flaws it’s one of my favorite games, specifically for the atmosphere and music). So my rating is entirely based on how well it is adapted into an anime (Spoiler alert: it isn’t!).Story 2/10It’s been a while since I watched this so I don’t remember all the details but since I know the story well let me start with the aspect I actually enjoyed… which was seeing the Norn and the beautiful setting in animated/in action. That’s basically everything to like about it. And while I see people...criticizing even the game’s writing because of some flaws, it never bothered me because personally I like the world-building (and I know it’s further explained in the fandisk). But since we are talking about the anime… The writing is completely all over the place. If I would have watched this without knowledge about the lore I’d have drop it after the first half. What bothers me the most, however, is how dirty they did some of the characters (or rather their storyline – like for real?!).Characters 4/10(Note: for once I’m not rating the characters themselves but rather their representation in this anime. Except for Kakeru. He’ll always be a 0/10 for me).I’m a huge fan of Natsuhiko’s character (in the game). In fact, after the first episode of this anime (which was promising to be honest) I low-key put this anime on-hold until after I finished playing and bought the game just BECAUSE OF HIM (yes, I admit the anime adaptation is the reason I played the game) – and I still ended up liking him but somehow Sakuya’s character won me over. That’s why I feel personally attacked how much they screwed up both with their half-baked writing. While the other MCs got their hand-picked LIs, the writers decided it would be a good idea to mix them. Starting with Sakuya’s route just for Mikoto to end up falling in love with Natsuhiko. Are you kidding me? I’d have been the last person to mind if they would have picked Natsuhiko as her love interest right from the start and making it clear to Mikoto Sakuya is just her childhood friend. Because like I said, I still love Natsuhiko. But the fact they had to mess with my boy Sakuya just makes me feel insanely mad and frustrated. He didn’t deserve this! Not to mention how they took one specific scene of Sakuya’s route and didn’t manage to explain it which made his character seem unlikable to some extent. What’s wrong with the writers here? Among the MCs Mikoto is my favorite. Unfortunately, the way it was written in the anime it just seems like she was developing feelings for Sakuya until she suddenly loved Natsuhiko. Great. That’s the problem with most otome game adaptations because most of the time the writers want to include multiple romances at once but that’s the result. I’d rather have them focusing on one of the characters as romantic interest (even if it’s not my personal favorite). 8And yes, the opening made it pretty clear but it was still a horrible writing decision).They choose just one LI each for both of the other MCs and I was pretty happy they choose Nanami and Akito to pair up together. Which might have been the best aspect when it comes to characters and relationships. However, that they had to put Koharu as MC in focus was a decision I wasn’t fond of either. I don’t dislike her character but to me she’s the most stereotype MC among the three. So I would have preferred one of the other two. I would have been happy if they would have ended up using Nanami as MC because we don’t get many MCs like her in animes. But nope, they decided for the most dreadful pairing and if I say “dreadful” it’s an understatement because Kakeru is very high on my list of most disliked characters of all time (even in the game). I just can’t stand him so the fact they had most screentime almost made it insufferable to watch.Animation 4/10The setting looked very neat but the character design was rather bad (says the person who bought the game after seeing Natsuhiko’s character design). Let’s just say some of the characters were better than others.Music 8/10That’s the one thing they did pretty good. And you can’t do anything wrong with Nagi Yanagi for the opening and even as Aion’s voice. Also the OST is amazing (I already loved the OST from the game and it might be my favorite). But the reason the music isn’t a 10/10 is simply because I couldn’t enjoy it as much when there were so many other things bothering me about this anime.Overall 3/10Unfortunately it’s among the worst visual novel game adaptations I’ve ever watched and I wish it would have been different because I have so much love and nostalgia for this game. Especially since I think they have the tsundere MC but done right (plus childhood friend trope done perfectly right). If this anime did one thing I’d need to be grateful for, it’s  for the fact it made me play the game. But other than this it’s an awful adaptation, not even coming close to its source material. And while in the game there are aspects I don’t like either, it’s overall much, much better. Regardless of whether someone played the game or not it’s an anime I wouldn’t recommend.

More than that, by any reasonable definition it\'s pretty awful. It\'s basically an Overlord rip-off, playing on the same themes of an experienced player being sucked into a dying MMO, having to adapt to the new world and the ridiculous persona/gameworld elements he created for himself. It\'s animated and produced very cheaply, not being even close as colourless and pathetic as Isekai Cheat Magician, but still pretty damn bad.On the other hand, it\'s extremely self-aware and genuinely hysterical with how purposefully dumb and juvenile it is. I think one thing people completely miss is the...middle-school-level fantasy of the protagonist\'s persona and the things he encounters after being ""isekai\'ed"" are not something the show is trying to sell as cool. Much of it is straight-up the protagonist\'s misguided creation, made exactly when he was a dumb, edgy teenager – a planet-size embarrassment that he now has to live through.

A burning trainwreck you just can\'t get your eyes off despite all your better instincts.I\'m not sure if this series will produce an actual plot or stakes. I\'m not sure if I even want it to.

The only reason I managed to reach the final episode of the season is unyielding stubbornness, and I deeply regret not giving up sooner.The plot goes absolutely nowhere for every single episode. The main character wanders about aimlessly, finds people who are jobbing to monsters or ""powerful"" opponents, and defeats them effortlessly so people can worship him. When he\'s not doing that, he\'s collecting a loli harem and doing poor, meandering world-building that doesn\'t really teach you anything about the world itself (I assume this...is to encourage reading of the light novels, a common tactic of LN-to-anime adaptations, but that doesn\'t help the anime\'s score at all). The plot is just an overall mess where not one significant event occurs for the entire run.The only things I\'d give it credit for are interesting character designs (visually, anyway, development-wise they\'re all generic and boring) and a semi-decent OST that\'s relaxing to listen to but ultimately unmemorable.Even if you were to take it as parody (which is a hilariously bad take), it\'s still horrible even then. I want the hours I spent on this garbage back. is to encourage reading of the light novels, a common tactic of LN-to-anime adaptations, but that doesn\'t help the anime\'s score at all).

I want the hours I spent on this garbage back.', 'The floodgate of isekai anime continues to remain open and from it, more and more isekai gets introduced every year. The latest entry to join this long list is Maou-sama Retry! (Demon Lord, Retry!) Let me just say that the fantasy and adventure genre seems to have some sort of marriage relationship with isekai. Almost every one of these tends to drop a protagonist into some unknown world and we follow their adventure. The idea of that world being connected to an MMROPG is recycled idea used over and over again.At first glance, this show may evoke some memories for those who are familiar...with the Overlord franchise or that ridiculous ecchi show called “Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu” from Summer 2018. What do all three have in common? The lead protagonist becomes a “Demon Lord” in their world where their fame is recognized. Furthermore, it’s easy to see how powerful they are when dealing with enemies and conflicts. Considering the fact that Akira Oono (aka Hakuto Kunai) made the MMORPG that he gets sucked into, this should come to no surprise to anyone. Simply put, Hakuto is the Demon Lord who retains his human personality of being sarcastic, sociable, and somewhat arrogant. Yet, he does show a kind side to those he bonds with in particular Aku and Luna Elegant. Displaying impressive abilities, Hakuto earns himself admirers but finds difficult in expressing himself towards women. You get the picture here? The guy is pretty much your badass protagonist (complete with a mafia-like coat and cool hair). His weakness is women and it seems the show is rather aware of it. To justify the humor, we have episodes that gets him into compromising positions with women. And given his inexperience with socializing with the opposite sex, the show pokes fun of his personality at every chance it gets. Talk about a show with an awkward sit-com sensation.Still, Hakuto is an acceptable protagonist. He isn’t whiny or portrayed as some immature high school student. In fact, he gives off a level of charisma that I even find appealing at times. This is a bit contrary to some of the characters he meets such as Aku, the girl he saved in the first episode. As a 13 year old girl, she relies on Hakuto like a father. They form a daughter/parent-like relationship that explores both characters’ personalities. Their relationship is a major focus that shows Hakuto’s human side as a character. Similarly, Aku behaves exactly like a girl of her own age. Because isekai series tends to add all sort of personalities, we meet Luna Elegant, the tsundere holy maiden who develops a sister-like relationship with Aku. It doesn’t stop there though as evidence quickly reveals that she seems to have grown fond of Hakuto as well, to the point of jealousy. This is starting to get a bit into a harem category, huh? Fortunately, that’s not entirely the case as we meet Killer Queen. With a vulgar and aggressive personality, she actually falls for Zero Kirisame, an alternate character Akira created in his MMORPG. The show depicts their relationship as a one-sided with Killer Queen constantly trying to woo Zero. Their type of character chemistry is pretty much a joke, one that is over the top and filled with absolute absurdity. The show can’t seem to get enough of its comedy so it also adds Yu Kirino, a 22-year old mad scientist with a sadism for younger males. To make fun of her character, the anime decides to let Kirino to experience orgasm whenever she gets complimented by Hakuto. If you’ve ever seen the popular fantasy anime Konosuba, there’s this character named Darkness who displays similar traits. God, I miss Konosuba the more I think about it now.Maou-sama Retry tries to find a balance into the story despite its oversaturated isekai tropes. At the heart of the show, there’s no denying that there’s a charming character relationship between Hakuto and Aku. While most isekai anime these days adheres to wish fulfilling fantasies and harem-esque shenanigans, Maou-sama Retry actually manages to be more than that. It manages to keep me guessing how far the show plans to develop Hakuto and Aku’s relationship. In MMORPG, there’s an invisible rule when players first log in. It’s the fact that people engage in social activities and build relationships. Hakuto and Aku reminds me of old school MMORPG where two players meet as strangers but over time, they form a powerful bond. At its best, this show brings a feeling similar to what a relationship is like from a MMORPG game. As for the rest of the cast, they are unfortunately less relevant although some gets the occasional memorable spotlight; just not on the same level as Hakuto and Aku.Does anyone remember what Ekachi Epilka’s first anime project was? No? Me either. I had to google this and it turned out to be some short from Spring 2018 called Crossing Time. In other words, this is their first project as a full length show. The animation style honestly looks like it had a limited budget in terms of its character designs. However, the show does commit on making its main cast stand out such as Hakuto, Aku, Killer Queen, Angel White, Luna, and Kirino. Each of them look distinctively unique with Hakuto’s mafia style clothes, Angel White’s pure white dress, or Kirino’s lab coat. Others such as the bunny girls (Kyon and Momo) are thrown it for the sake of fan service. While it doesn’t fully blow up the show, you can definitely expect to be serviced with sexy bunny suits, long leg camera shots, and oh who can forget, Aku in the baths. Unfortunately, the world fiction overall sags around the half way mark. Isekai anime like this had potential to expand more into its world but it ended up being creatively disappointing.Watching Maou-sama Retry was actually not entirely a sour experience in the end, at least compared to some other garbage like Isekai Cheat Magician this season. Hell, at least we had a character duo to keep an eye on and a protagonist with an actual personality. However, that doesn’t cover the endgame of the show being mediocre. Its overused humor and storytelling made little effort to improve itself and left a good chunk of the cast in the dust. But with just 12 episodes, you could probably get through this without tearing your hair out.

It's the typical isekai that combined different aspects from other similar animes.For example, servants that are in Maou-sama are pretty similar to Overlord (Another isekai) but with the fact that the mc needs points to call them.

It is basically 11 episodes (on the time of this review) of girls clinging to MC because...he is the MC. Godawful, uninspired writing. The story is basically non-existent.

It actually gets really good. It's worth watching. I personally enjoyed it immensely.Did you give up on this anime when you realised it was an amalgamation of just about every other Isekai out there? Or maybe you had enough of it when you saw how piss-poor the backgrounds were. Or maybe even the sound. Or the poor animation.I almost did. I'm so glad I kept watching. Yeah, this anime does feel like it copied a lot of its content from other Isekai such as Overlord and Konosuba,...and yes, it does almost feel like a poor parody of those. However... I'm still so glad I kept watching.It's actually GOOD! It's good BECAUSE it reminds me of those series. Anyway, I'll get to the meat of the review.Story: Very Good! - The story is surprisingly heavy. There are a lot of underlying plots waiting to surface, and while at first, it seemed like Demon Lord, Retry was a straight forward self-service anime meant to capitalise on the boom that is Isekai, it becomes fairly intricate later down the line! I haven't even finished the series yet, I'm 11 episodes in as I write the review, yet I can't wait to find out what happens next!!Art: Decent. - The first few episodes or so do NOT have decent art at all. I'd say the art was downright dreadful. The backgrounds looked lazy and poorly done. Like someone just smudged green around for forests, and brown for desert. However, at a certain point, the artwork improves significantly. Not only the character animation but the backgrounds as well. So, just get past the first three episodes or so and you might see what a delight this series actually is.Sound: Good. - In the beginning, I had a poor opinion of the sound. The voice acting was fine but the background music seemed lazy and repetitive. Strangely, though, the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me. I started thinking 'Wow, this is actually pretty good. It makes the anime more fun, even if it sounds like a 12-year-old is playing their recorder to impress their parents. Haha, no, seriously, I think you'll enjoy the sound after a while.Characters: Very Good! - The characters enhance the plot, and the plot enhances the characters. Demon Lord, Retry seems to be able to make all its characters interesting. Kunai's apparent harem has cute and funny characters, but they all actually have an interesting backstory. They're not just thrown into it. And even better is that the anime has a diverse cast and gives screentime to lots of characters, not just the main one.Enjoyment: Great!! - Yep. Loved it. Kept me up nearly until daylight hours from the night because I just couldn't stop watching this one.Overall: Very Good! - Okay, it has its flaws but I personally loved it. It could be seen as your temporary fix until Overlord Season 4 comes out or another Konosuba, or you can appreciate it for what it is and acknowledge it as its own show. That's what I'm doing. I think it's good enough. Really looking forward to more of this show! I sincerely hope it's a 24~ episode length series, and I hope even more that it has more than one season. It certainly seems to have enough groundwork for multiple seasons!-Update: I've now seen all 12 episodes. I worry that this anime might not be well received and probably won't get a second season. I really hope it does though, I really enjoyed it!!! and yes, it does almost feel like a poor parody of those. However... I'm still so glad I kept watching.It's actually GOOD! It's good BECAUSE it reminds me of those series. Anyway, I'll get to the meat of the review.Story: Very Good! - The story is surprisingly heavy. There are a lot of underlying plots waiting to surface, and while at first, it seemed like Demon Lord, Retry was a straight forward self-service anime meant to capitalise on the boom that is Isekai, it becomes fairly intricate later down the line! I haven't even finished the series yet, I'm 11 episodes in as I write the review, yet I can't wait to find out what happens next!!Art: Decent. - The first few episodes or so do NOT have decent art at all. I'd say the art was downright dreadful. The backgrounds looked lazy and poorly done. Like someone just smudged green around for forests, and brown for desert. However, at a certain point, the artwork improves significantly. Not only the character animation but the backgrounds as well. So, just get past the first three episodes or so and you might see what a delight this series actually is.Sound: Good. - In the beginning, I had a poor opinion of the sound. The voice acting was fine but the background music seemed lazy and repetitive. Strangely, though, the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me. I started thinking 'Wow, this is actually pretty good. It makes the anime more fun, even if it sounds like a 12-year-old is playing their recorder to impress their parents. Haha, no, seriously, I think you'll enjoy the sound after a while.Characters: Very Good! - The characters enhance the plot, and the plot enhances the characters. Demon Lord, Retry seems to be able to make all its characters interesting. Kunai's apparent harem has cute and funny characters, but they all actually have an interesting backstory. They're not just thrown into it. And even better is that the anime has a diverse cast and gives screentime to lots of characters, not just the main one.Enjoyment: Great!! - Yep. Loved it. Kept me up nearly until daylight hours from the night because I just couldn't stop watching this one.Overall: Very Good! - Okay, it has its flaws but I personally loved it.

This Anime takes a step back from seriousness within its genre and adds a nice touch of both Comedy, and Wholesomeness. It's not focused on a certain objective that the protagonist wants to achieve therefore it opens up potential for Funny travels and Adventures with the characters Hakuto the Demon Lord meets. I think this is a good show to watch because it allows you enjoy a simple setting without demanding much from it. If you enjoy shows with funny situations and good values then this Anime deserves a try. "", ""So basically it's not that bad an anime I have seen worse and also Most Isekai I watch are pretty generic yeh this one is kinda different in a sense also I recommend you watch itIt is pretty funny like most of it I laughed till my gut hurt Sometimes It may look and kinda sound generic and some parts of it are yes butMan I have watched a lot of isekai and out of the bunch this is a pretty generic anime Title but some isekai are literally garbage and out of Most of them I have watched this is one of...the best so I recommend watching it the best so I recommend watching it"", 'The first episode exists as a foundation for the rest of the show, setting the premise, rules and introducing characters. There\'s not much to be said here and it\'s easy to get a bad impression because of the below average art. The second episode is where we start to see the real valuable goods on offer and what to expect later. The comedy. The subversion of expectations. The bland pastry of the isekai premise is encrusted with the caramel jewels of witty writing and excellent voice acting.The art is moderate, varying passable/good at key points and the main characters and their designs to below average...for support characters. What really lets the show down however is its absolutely abysmal animation anywhere that\'s more dynamic than people taking a light stroll or bending down. Needless to say the combat scenes are disappointingly awful which is a real surprise considering the execution and timing of the jokes is done so well.The show is funny, it\'s even funnier if you get the references to the isekai meta jokes, mocking the common tropes and subverting them by making typical herione types obnoxious or the MC utterly indifferent. The voice acting is brilliant and the art is passable even though the animation leaves a lot to be desired. The characters are sort of shallow, but I get the feeling this is because there will be a lot of them and they are kinda rushed so they feel a little bit too familiar with each other when talking/annotating.Additional Commentary For Context: Post TL;DRIsekai anime are becoming dime-a-dozen at this point and garnering something of a reputation for being unimaginative, bottom of the barrel content, not least of all because of how often they devolve into harems as well (the very bottom of the bottom of the barrel for stimulation from story telling). It\'s too easy for these shows to rely on the various forms of service available to cover for bad writing. It got so bad that we were starting to be presented with run of the mill cooking shows shows with an Isekai twist (Restaurant To Another World) which offered even less story than what we were afforded before. But there\'s something to be had here, guilty pleasures or otherwise.Isekai developed their own tropes relatively quickly and with the success of predecessor shows like Overlord they set a standard for fantasy character archetypes. Eventually, after (good) shows like Log Horizon and (bad shows) like Sword Art Online which took themselves too seriously started to lose cultural relevance a meta began to emerge in the genre, a kind of maturation which resulted in titles like ""Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo"" or ""Konosuba"" for short. Currently ranked #347 on MAL with a score of 8.19; creating a renaissance almost immediately after the genre began to die off with only a hand full of titles to its name.Konosuba was to Isekai what One Punch Man was to Dragon Ball Z and the action genre, although without a cream of the crop studio like Madhouse behind the animation (in fact, intentionally or not the quirky animation only adds to the comedic and satirical value of the show). But what am i trying to get at here? Maou-sama, Retry! Ticks enough of the isekai trope boxes to make your eyes roll to the back of your head and back to the front again. It\'s a fantasy world (this is almost inherent, but sometimes it is sci-fi), based on a game system (again, the RPG element is practically a given in all isekai titles, but its purveyance exists on a spectrum from minor nods to adventurer class systems to full blown working user interfaces), the MC was an admin/Dungeon Master, developer or prominent figure like a guild master or ""number 1 player"" (Death March, Log Horizon, Sword Art Online, Overlord, etc), the MC is over powered or has some kind of cheat (very occasionally it is actually a natural talent like above average smarts). The user exploits previous/home reality knowledge to boost abilities in the current/new world (Knights & Magic, The Philosopher\'s Grandson, Isekai Cheat Magician, Gate, No Game No Life, That Time I Was Reincarnated As A Slime (i\'ve seen so many they\'re all blurring into one now)); and the worst offending trope is probably the down beaten ""loli"" who becomes infatuated with the MC because they showed basic human kindness in a world filled with corruption (this one irks me the most).So really all we\'re left with as a distinguishing feature is the level of self-awareness a show has about its flaws in lieu of innovation/originality.

One small cute, perhaps even overly timid loli. Mean and crappy villagers.Some things I like about this anime? How they depicted the development of the protaganist, Oono Akira in just a single episode. At first, Akira is viewed to be a grumpy old man, who seems to be like the kind of elderly neighbour that glares at you from his backyard when you make too much noise. Not a surprise since Akira is the manager of a certain MMORPG. The kind of guy that has a business-like personality and is no-nonsense. In just one episode, he transforms from a delinquent...squat into a nice wholesome guy who protects young girls from their pitiful fates. Comes along in the forest is our blonde fairy, Aku. Yes, her name is Aku. I wonder what were the producers high on to come up with such a pathetic name for an adorable character design such as her. Aku is the dumpster of her ungrateful village people. Treated like waste. Born into a cruel world, Aku works jobs that most will refrain from volunteering to do so. Best part? The villagers want to get rid of her after she helped them clean their crap. Literally. I will not spoil the first episode. Just know that there are two notable characters to look out for. Akira and Aku. The Double AA batteries.Other side projects you would want to observe? Just some bitchy villagers and a dubious looking idol. No, not your IdolM@s or Love Live. The statue that ancient people worship to. Well, one says that ""If the producers make characters that you already start to detest, they are doing a fine job!"" Yea, what a fine job. A fine job to bully a poor village girl. Haha, so funny.Overall, apart from those idiot villagers, the two characters seem to hit it off quite well. Middle-aged Oni san saves loli from her own tragic fate. So far, I like how gentlemanly Akira is towards the young girl, even (beep. Sorry, you must watch the anime for the wholesomeness.)When you start to enjoy satire and memes, you will also experience these feelings of scepticism and trust me, it is not nice to see a group of villagers picking on a poor girl. Worse still, you need an old man, a total stranger from another universe, to interfere into your domestic affairs.

However, by doing this, the creator/owner of the game character get pulled in with it.---------------------You could really say this anime is almost a carbon copy of ""How Not To Summon A Demon Lord"", there are so many similarities in the plot.So, what is the plot... well, I\'ve basically just explained the premise, although I guess this is where the ""Overlord"" reference comes in; so far, it seems Maou-Sama is trying to create an empire in this new world.Of course, this is Isekai, there is a harem forming, with an extreme likelihood of a trap being included in there (called a ""girly boy"" in the anime), who constantly makes fan-servicy jokes; also lots of girls bathing, with the typical ""mist censor"" and the MC also spanks one.---------------------Art:Oh Dear.This has some of THE WORST background design, character design, details and animation I have seen in an anime. This makes trash such as ""In A New World With My Smartphone"" look decent/good.Now, when the characters are focused on / full-frame, the details are passable.

Holy cow, they are AWFUL!Very little action is shown on screen, which makes me think they can\'t actually animate action properly; you see the MC throw a punch, then it cuts to guys flying about, without seeing the punch hit or anything in between.---------------------Characters:So far, so decent.The MC acts a lot like the MCs from Overlord and How Not To [...] (putting on a persona).There\'s a cute little loli girl, who most people say is ""Rem 2.0"".There\'s a girl that reminds me slightly of Darkness from Konosuba, constantly saying MC is a perv and etc.There\'s a yandere scientist (as of ep.4).Those are the main ones so far, although there is the trap that I mentioned earlier and his party member, a big brute woman in armour befitting of an asian mmo (ofc that\'s the case, right).---------------------The main selling point for me is the script.It\'s full of sass and they obviously aren\'t taking themselves seriously, which is honestly a boon for an anime like this.

This one.  That alone makes it more appealing IMO.  However, beyond that it takes a minimal look at the battle-type isekai and instead focuses on micro and macro-management.  Rather than destroying and dominating by force the MC wants to establish a rapport and build.I find it enjoyable and I...am a little surprised by such a harsh reception.

The MC has a less than stellar core personality, but the OP video game character he becomes is quite the definition of cool, calm, and collected. Which is very enjoyable.Secondary characters are largely walking tropes, such as his loli harem. Though a few, like his personal aides, are more personable.All in all, there's not much to rub you the wrong way, and the MC carries the cast quite nicely.---Total - 7/10---While not bringing anything particularly noteworthy to the table, I quite like the idea of a less established Overlord who's neither locked into being evil, nor as focused on matters of global importance.Ultimately though, this first season doesn't cover a lot of material and it's unlikely a season 2 will ever be made. ------------------------------------------I quite enjoy the opening song which is catchy, and the MC's voice has an enjoyable quality to it in Japanese, but other than that it's pretty regular stuff.Story - 6/10-------------Video Game designer gets somehow Isekai'd into a whole other world as his most OP character.

The MC has a less than stellar core personality, but the OP video game character he becomes is quite the definition of cool, calm, and collected. Which is very enjoyable.Secondary characters are largely walking tropes, such as his loli harem. Though a few, like his personal aides, are more personable.All in all, there's not much to rub you the wrong way, and the MC carries the cast quite nicely.---Total - 7/10---While not bringing anything particularly noteworthy to the table, I quite like the idea of a less established Overlord who's neither locked into being evil, nor as focused on matters of global importance.Ultimately though, this first season doesn't cover a lot of material and it's unlikely a season 2 will ever be made."", 'I ran out of stuff to watch so I randomly found this. All the ratings made it sound trash but I get wet from isekai so I still decided to watch. Best decision ever. All the characters and events are very similar to every other isekai but different enough to be entertaining. Every episode managed to make me smile, ridiculous stuff happening all the time. Art is good enough and animations are completely fine. Sound is well done: background music has been picked to suit the comedic mood of the show.  Honestly this anime is trash but so am I and if you are...too you will also like it. too you will also like it.', ""this is one of the best Isekai anime I have ever watched, completely worth the watch.

But I\'m not here to talk about my personal preference since this review is for the general audience.There\'s not much to say about the storyline. The MC\'s approach of the isekai world is very practical and analyzed to the min-max which makes it kind of boring. There\'s not much conflict either that may put the MC into the edge, although I would wish to expect that on Season 2. There are some nice concepts of the show though that I would like to address such as...the function ""aid summon"" which is a function where you can summon a companion with the exchange of some mana-like currency called ""skill points"".Though the character designs are very beautiful together with the VAs for the character it is wasted by its mediocre animation. The animation is very stiff, the movements are just not fluid. Though there\'s one thing I probably can\'t forget about the series and it\'s the dandy sounding bgm/ost played during the title screen in the beginning and in some moments during an episode.Although this may just be only an introduction for a large scale isekai series, I still don\'t feel the heat of its flame.So do I recommend this one?No, the show is easily forgettable and you can even just sleep on this show.

Just putting it out there, the MC\'s persona of this show gives me Yakuza vibes and it\'s hilarious. Putting that aside, this show\'s story is right up my alley.

Funny enough, it reminds me a bit...of Goro Majima from the Yakuza 0.This anime feels like someone wanted to make a Yakuza anime but gave up after making the characters and decided to just make an Isekai.

The OP was alright as I\'ve got to give credit where credit is due.Honestly, after watching this can anyone tell me what the plot is?...The last episode was a bunch of fan-service with no connection what so ever.

The main character was the only one I could relate to as you could even tell by his voice acting, he didn\'t want to be there.The Enjoyment was a meh.

Also it is definitely not sure what it is supposed to be about, as by the end of the season it doesn\'t get anywhere.Yet it is still for some reason enjoyable. It is a huge mess, but has some sort of appeal despite that.The highlight of the series, interestingly is its music. Whoever was writing the soundtrack had a blast doing that and...it is probably the main reason why it is even interesting. There\'s amazing short metal tune right in the episode, and past that point there\'s sort of interesting tune that plays out all the time and sorta feels like a western. But it the music is of much higher quality compared to everything else.Story: 4/10.Largely nonsensical and irrelevant.

This is proof that is is no god. There is no higher power, however evil or good that would allow this abomination to come into existence. I don't understand how anyone can rate this anything above a 3. This show is a crime against humanity. Every aspect about it is awful, the writing, the animation, the music, the characters, the opening is especially horrid. I am truly baffled that this show was animated or even considered for animation. This can barley even be considered animation with how awful it is. "", ""The story is about Hakuto Kunai. A player and creator of the Infinity Game. It's an action-adventure game similar to Grand Theft Auto.The majority of the anime community is getting bored with the Isekai genre since it's becoming dull.However, I enjoyed the anime because it has a similar vibe as Overlord and The Rising of the Shield Hero.The protagonist retains his overpowered skills but has some restrictions on it before he can unlock it.The father-daughter relationship of the Hakuto Kunai and Aku is always refreshing to see from time to time.In summary, the anime is excellent if you prefer the Isekai genre.

The art is so simple and the redesign seem's totally odd to me as why is Kunai's hair so long, why does Zero look so generic, why are these characters so rigid....The background is so weird as well, not following that the world that they are in is a fantasy isekai which have woods, stones, and buildings from medieval times but some of those backgrounds are so generic and so modern and don't mesh well with the timeline.Some scenes I can barely register and the combat and character movements are so stale that I am a little upset. The movement of the characters do have some weight to them but it's barely there and some scenes wave principle for animation is really odd, there are a couple cute scenes here and there but the combat is so stiff that I just forget it after I watched it.The story however is good and I do enjoy how it is playing out. The Maou is someone who is heading to the other world but actually takes combat seriously and I do enjoy his interactions with the characters. It's sort of like Overlord in that he is OP and has a split personality on the outside and inside of his persona. The setting is different though and I do enjoy the fact that he actually fights and does his best for what he thinks is the correct choice for him. Along wit the fact that he has a pretty fun way of interacting with others.Overall I like the story of this series but I do not like the animation nor it's art style. I think this anime would have done much better if they just put in more time into their background and not make such a drastic character redesign. The anime story was okay but it's missing some critical details or not adding more emphasis on the characters interaction with each other which make the story more entertaining and some details which could have made a bigger impact on the story are missing.I would give the story of the MANGA AND NOVEL an 8, the art and character design of the ANIME I would give a 3. Over all I just give it a 5 for the anime. I'll just stick to the manga and novel versions.

honesty its just decent its not bad its a good watch if you don't have a stick up your ass for fine detail now i must say i liked the characters in general they did a good job for the stuff they had available i understand that a reveiw can be however they like but at least bring up some good points and moments that they did well and others they need...work on be constructive the makers of the anime will see them and if you want to see a change be objective about it but thats just my pet peeve now on to the reviewnow i must say that the characters did a good job when it came to establising a atmosphere for the area around them but the areas need a little work towards making them fit in more by staying in an area longer then they do in the anime and manga because if you set something up follow through with it like for example they should have allowed you to see more of the area around them and the towns they went too also they should have more character development towards making the characters more like people cause they use too much of the features you will see in overlord if they change it slightly it would make the characters easier to understand and root for in conclusion do a little more towards showing more of the hardships that they could face make the fights a little more active and longernext is my opinion on the art style it does need some work with a littler polish they could be awesome and very well done the episodes need to be a little more filled with moments of clarity and peace so one can get a good feel for the environment other than that i say that the art is decent not bad just decent  there is work to be done in order to make it seem more in setting and well thought out in conclusion needs a little work but overall well donei enjoyed this anime for the simple reason of its unique yet not unique at the same time it does show a little self awareness and does have some cliches but if you can look past all that its  overall good for enjoyment of the anime it does have some rough spots but its still fairly new and if it gets a second season they can improve the things it needs to to make it more enjoyable in conclusion its  ok to have some flaws but you dont need to bash it or say its not worth it is good let them decide how it is on their own you should not let your bias to anything  be in this be constructive and give it a try it can be hard to give something try but its good to be open to things even if they are a bit roughso i do suggest this to anyone who can take things as if they are ok with being objective towards the

has good vibe, manages to move the viewers to enjoy the Isekai cliche pretty well. the only downside the characters are built fragile in nature with no depth to speak off. All in All a good Anime to just enjoy nothing more nothing less as hard day of work with fantasy script. the Budget is Problem i guess with one hit action sequence also not a clear action to describe how much the character is OP atall. The original plot is  enjoyful  but the art, sound and characters are all pretty Glassy....The art looks nice at first but when fight scenes or just about any other scene that doesnt involve standing and talking come up it fails to deliver. The music is very repetitive and doesnt fit the mood a lot of times, it just ends suddenly or it goes on for too long. Pretty Much all the  characters are all pretty bland.

Pretty Much all the  characters are all pretty bland.', 'A Chimera of isekai elements...but is it itself a good isekai?A chimera though?..well yeah the starting premise is from Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku, the main character starting premise is like Overlord, Aku is a blonde Rem, hmmm the main protagonist Hakuto Kunai wanting to ""take over the world"" through his original non-reincarnated self\'s knowledge take ANY isekai with that one, his goals of taking over the world is misinterpret through his companions...Overlord again.Well does this chimera of an isekai have anything new of worth?, well actually yes.Maou-sama Retry!\'s does give our main character Hakuto a double personality or mor elike his ""old avatar""...in the game setting this anime is in and it\'s a chunni thus he doesn\'t want to release him alot but when he does, he much like..well his other self is OP but it works as Killer Queen voiced by Haruka Tomatsu a brash ""Holy Maiden"" HATES Hakuto for being the demon lord but LOVES his old avatar of Zero so it\'s funny in a ways. The other thing is it seems Maou-sama Retry! took cues from Overlord mainly in what would happen if a human goes into the game world (the reverse of Overlord but stay with LA) but his take over the world scheme...isn\'t a ""take over the world"", it\'s only shown through his companions but he just wants Aku voiced by Kanon Takao, the first person Hakuto met, to be happy and he uses Luna Elegant voiced by Kaori Ishihara another Holy Maiden that at first is a brat and thinks she can defeat ""the demon lord"", she latter grows on Hakuto though in the tsundere-state, anyways Hakuto uses Luna to rejuvenate a demi-hume village by getting itself a hot springs and hospital and pretty much Hakuto wants to uproot the high-class society and uses both the hospital and hot springs as bait, so Hakuto basically helps both Aku in being happy and helps Luna in her social standings, so the ""take over the world"" is more delusional than anything else.So does all these plot elements makes Maou-sama Retry!\'s any good?, well good more like moderately acceptable. Like all the isekai cliches are all there with a few new things to shake things up and whenever the cliches appear in clear blatant view, it\'s eye-rolling but whenever anything new shows up it\'s a ""bit"" refreshing at the very least. What LA is saying through all this is that it\'s a balance and Maou-sama Retry!\'s somehow does it but to average to almost above average mediocrity of it all, not horrible or lazy as hell nor great and amazing for isekai standards. It\'s just down the middle whilst trying to do something with the cliches here and there.Maou-sama Retry!\'s characters are all mostly quirky and Maou-sama Retry! runs with it, from Hakuto\'s split personality whilst trying to be stoic and badass yet being the exact opposite with his actions, Aku being the pure, shy character, Luna being tsundere at the demon lord, Killer Queen having dual personalities from the brash personality while being an absolute deredere whenever she thinks about Zero or when Zero appears. Angel White voiced by Aki Toyosaki the voice of reason of the 3 Holy Maidens and trying to make sense of all the antics the entire cast goes through to Yuu Kirino voiced by Rina Sato the stoic, almost yandere doctor but latter on becomes extremely smitten with Hakuto and loosens her yandereness.The animation done by EKACHI EPILKA did a decent job, from the character designs to the decent fights though the backgrounding was probably one of the weaker points. Nonetheless with some crisp moe character designs with some decently ok fights, the animation was overall decent...not great but not horrible.And same goes for the voice cast, like LA could say that the entire cast did good but it\'s not like they didn\'t go all out either. Some standouts from all this is Rina Sato as Yuu as the yandere-tsun personality did actually crack LA a few times and Haruka Tomatsu as Killer Queen was a bit of a surprise as LA thought Shizuka Ishigami voiced her instead. Nonetheless a decently good voice cast to back up this decently made isekai anime.Yes LA said it, Maou-sama Retry! indeed isn\'t actually all that bad, yes first impressions as well as the overabundance of isekai cliche and tropes we\'ve seen time and again and again, Maou-sama Retry!\'s isn\'t that bad. Sure from the foundation isekai cliches that\'s been seen in every other isekai animes but Maou-sama Retry! does do some new things with those cliches, more or less re-purpose it to do it\'s own thing (Heck LA thinks this is essentially the reverse Overlord with how much Maou-sama Retry! takes from it) and it runs with it making it\'s own thing. Maou-sama Retry! may seem like another lazy isekai amalgamating many elements of previous isekai\'s but Maou-sama Retry! almost feels like a parody or taking the mickey out of isekai animes whilst being it\'s own thing in the process...not KonoSuba levels, it\'s more or less teetering between being a parody and being mediocrely cliche.So to answer LA\'s question at the start of this review, is Maou-sama Retry! a good isekai or a ""good chimera""...ehh it\'s an ok chimera if anything, nothing more nothing less, even if LA was defending this isekai in many aspects...an ok isekai chimera. in the game setting this anime is in and it\'s a chunni thus he doesn\'t want to release him alot but when he does, he much like..well his other self is OP but it works as Killer Queen voiced by Haruka Tomatsu a brash ""Holy Maiden"" HATES Hakuto for being the demon lord but LOVES his old avatar of Zero so it\'s funny in a ways.

The anime seems to speed through this though so it's not very good either.For comedy and characters, not enough animation is put into facial expressions or body movements for these to look that good either.

However a certain scene 13 minutes into the first episode caused me to stick around.  Why?  Why would I submit myself to a genre I generally avoid?  This is because 13 minutes into the show, Maou carries a girl named Aku on his back and proceeds to run to their destination.

It effectively has no plot, but it isn\'t boring.Honestly. It starts fairly strong but the action ends pretty quickly. Aside from getting isekai\'d as the demon lord and absolutely dunking on a few enemies, most of the series is just running a hot spring resort and screwing around.Well, I suppose to say that it has ""no"" plot wouldn\'t necessarily be right. It does have one, sort of. They just make incredibly poor use of the time they have in a 12 episode span. It\'s kind of like 8/12 episodes are collectively mostly spa resort filler. Things do...move along, a bit. But pretty slowly.The few fights that do take place seem so relatively inconsequential that they didn\'t even matter. And not just because the MC is so OP - there\'s isekai anime that do that fairly well like Overlord, Reincarnated as a Slime, and Misfit of Demon King Academy. They were just inconsequential because they just randomly came up and randomly went away so quickly that they didn\'t even matter whatsoever to the plot.Bottom line? It seems kind of almost like they were trying to do a sort of Overlord kind of theme, even summoning some of the Demon Lord\'s servants, and establishing themselves in the new world they find themselves in. But whereas Overlord did it in epic fashion with actually good storytelling, in this one... they pretty much just make a resort, manage said resort, and that\'s pretty much the extent of their plan. Just to make some money.It\'s incredibly odd, honestly. The guy seems to avoid all the actual evil people that would actually follow the Demon Lord and instead associate nigh exclusively with the holy maidens who should want to eliminate the Demon Lord. Well, them and poor helpless girls we should feel sorry for. But of course in typical harem fashion every female this guy meets inexplicably instantly falls in love with him. Hot, loli, trap, insane, or otherwise.About the largest actually logical plot point is the guy wants to try to find some items that could help against his major weakness in the new world. But that doesn\'t even take place in season 1 (and the chances of season 2 are close to zero given the show\'s reception). But why, I don\'t really know considering the guy\'s literally dunked on the strongest beings in the world like it\'s nothing.I don\'t think the show really knew what it wanted to be in the end or what they really wanted to do with the plot and it suffered for that.Though that said there\'s a lot of absolutely terrible isekai out there and this one\'s at least entertaining and watchable. A lot of them I can\'t even stand to finish. Kind of a low bar, I suppose. But this anime is only around a 6-7, and absolutely nothing more than that. So if you just go into it knowing that, well, it is what it is I suppose. move along, a bit.

Just to make some money.It\'s incredibly odd, honestly. The guy seems to avoid all the actual evil people that would actually follow the Demon Lord and instead associate nigh exclusively with the holy maidens who should want to eliminate the Demon Lord. Well, them and poor helpless girls we should feel sorry for. But of course in typical harem fashion every female this guy meets inexplicably instantly falls in love with him. Hot, loli, trap, insane, or otherwise.About the largest actually logical plot point is the guy wants to try to find some items that could help against his major weakness in the new world. But that doesn\'t even take place in season 1 (and the chances of season 2 are close to zero given the show\'s reception). But why, I don\'t really know considering the guy\'s literally dunked on the strongest beings in the world like it\'s nothing.I don\'t think the show really knew what it wanted to be in the end or what they really wanted to do with the plot and it suffered for that.Though that said there\'s a lot of absolutely terrible isekai out there and this one\'s at least entertaining and watchable. A lot of them I can\'t even stand to finish. Kind of a low bar, I suppose. But this anime is only around a 6-7, and absolutely nothing more than that. So if you just go into it knowing that, well, it is what it is I suppose.', ""Well this anime certainly not comparable to other top isekai anime like overlord, re zero or tensei slime. This anime is meant to be more like comedic isekai that does not have heavy plot like konosuba, although maou sama will never ever top konosuba. Maou sama retry  could be entertaining if the animation was better. the story is not really interesting. I also noticed that there are some differences in characters design compared to the manga. I preferred  read the manga since the character design in the manga is more to my liking and there is no crappy animation to deal with.but...still it's the best isekai anime this season in my opinion. this just show how bad other isekai anime this season. still it's the best isekai anime this season in my opinion. this just show how bad other isekai anime this season."", 'When watching Maou-Sama, Retry!, I kept asking myself a question. What does this show bring to the table, and the answer was quite obvious by the end; This show brings nothing new to the table. It is unoriginal and a victim of the surge of isekai that we have seen in recent years. The show cannot boast good animation or a compelling story. Although it is a comedy, most of the jokes failed to actually hit home. The voice acting was anywhere from generic to amateur. But, none of these things were so horrible as to make me drop the show altogether. While it is...true the show is unoriginal, not every show has to be a home run.  I for one quite enjoy having something between great shows, and that is why I feel that we still need shows like this. If you are looking for your next bombshell, this is not it, but if you are looking for something to watch while looking for that bombshell, look no further. and besides, some character relationships in the show can provide a bit of warmth. Thank you, I hope this was helpful. true the show is unoriginal, not every show has to be a home run.

Thank you, I hope this was helpful.', 'Okay, so before I get into everything let me just say this: if you are looking for an anime with an interesting plot you aren\'t really gonna find that here. To put it bluntly, this is like a fairly okay remake of a bunch of other Isekai anime shoved into one package; and believe me, I mean that in the best possible way. Although this anime doesn\'t really do anything that is out of the ordinary for the genre, I certainly appreciate how it draws inspiration and details from other Isekai animes and brings them together in a good way.Story:The story is pretty alright. It\'s...basically the same crap but the characters at least have some background to them and it\'s not just a generic waifu material fest. Although most of the time the story is mediocre at best, it still is alright enough for you to not really care if this is the type of thing you are looking for.Art:What can I say really, it\'s better than some other OP MC Isekai\'s but it\'s still pretty generic. There aren\'t really a lot of interesting visuals, but in my opinion, that isn\'t what you watch this show for if you watch it.Sound:The opening theme to this anime, tempest, is an absolute banger. pretty generic sound for the rest of it, but I bump it up to a 6 just for that opening theme.Character:You\'ve got everything you want from your generic Isekai. You have your loli\'s your traps, and pretty much all of the other bases covered. I like that this show doesn\'t get overly harem-y and the dynamic that the MC has with the rest of the cast of characters is pretty much that of a concerned parent and not that of a lolicon pedo that the fbi would cross world boundaries to go and arrest. That being said, there are still some parts where it\'s like ""yeah ok turn it down a notch"" but not many.Enjoyment:It\'s a generic ride, but that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be good. If people can rewatch the same shows over and over again and still get that little bit of excitement welled up inside of them, then in my opinion it isn\'t right to judge a show just on it\'s generic-ness and how it follows the usual tropes. This show is pretty enjoyable from beginning to end. The cast is just so fun and them building a ""that time I was reincarnated as a slime"" esque village while also trying to find their way in this world is pretty nice. The worldbuilding is minimal but you never get a large exposition dump like you do in other Isekais.Overall, this show is alright, I gave it a 7, based souly on the fact that I enjoyed it regardless of its flaws. It isn\'t bad, so I don\'t think it deserves a low rating, but it certainly isn\'t anything ground breaking, so I feel a 7 fits it. The characters are lovable but generic, the mash-ups of common character traits and the roots of each character that you can see definitely came with inspiration from more popular series makes it really fun to see what kind of weird character mash-ups will come next.

I do reccommend ignoring people who bash it simply because its isekai.Story:Guy gets pulled into game world he created and becomes his avatar, the demon lord. There he saves young girl from demon and decides to help her as well as find a way home, but also to live well in this world.Basically it can be described as what if Ains Ool Gown had taken good alignment route. But real good bit of this story is how everything is approached from characters to world. Now, story can be bit...messy if you look at it first glance and frankly anime kinda powers it further as it does seem to be ""long play"" story that sadly cuts off half way (although cut off point is actually decent). Its hard to say without spoilers why i like its story and characters, but its worth giving it a chanceArt and animation:sadly it didnt get lot of funds and it does show, but at same time i do believe they did their best with what they had. It is still quite watchable and at least it doesnt try to fill caps with cheap GCI *glares at antifureta* messy if you look at it first glance and frankly anime kinda powers it further as it does seem to be ""long play"" story that sadly cuts off half way (although cut off point is actually decent).

This is a poor mans Overlord? The resemblance to overlord was uncanny, from day one, just in terms of how the story kicked off, all the way down to the mini harem he had going (including a girlish boy, as the character describes himself) I felt like the show as a whole, was pretty lackluster, and the writing was pretty juvenile in many cases (a lot of conversations about butts.)Story: Well, the story kicks off with a gamer taking over the roll of his character(s) in game. Shortly after...being teleported into the game world, he runs across a young, dirty, homeless girl, named Aku. From there, their adventure begins, picking up new characters as part of his crew along the way, although, there wasn't necessarily any real goal in mind, until probably half way through the season.Art: The art was far from perfect, but not awful, same goes for the animation. The characters did have their distinct traits, but nothing stood out a ton in regards to them.Sound: Again, I enjoyed the opening for this, it was solid, the rest of the score, was hit or miss. There were certain songs that fit in, and others, that just felt out of place. The voice acting seemed fine, and I didn't have anything that really left me bothered in the department.Characters: Like I said earlier, the characters were distinct enough to have you remember who they were or what their purpose was, but, there generally speaking, wasn't anything too flashy or crazy about their looks, or character developments.Enjoyment: I'm possibly being a little harsh with this review, just because, I've SEEN Overlord, and can't help but compare this to it, and it just doesn't hold a candle to Overlord in my mind. I'm convinced, I would have enjoyed this anime more if I had seen it before Overlord, but that wasn't the case. I never found myself excited to watch Maou Sama Retry, as harsh as that sounds, not that it was the only show this season that I felt that way about.Overall: I give it a 5/10. I think, they took an approach to close to Overlord- and just didn't have the same pizzazz that it did. Like I said, if I had seen it before Overlord, or they had taken a slightly different approach, I might not have been as critical as I am with this one. They did leave the door open for a 2nd season, and, I'll watch that, if they do make it.

This anime just didn't do a whole lot for me personally."", '""Maou-sama, Retry!"" is a bit of an infamous isekai (transported to another world) anime this season. I just had to try it out of morbid curiosity, and after 4 episodes I can already tell you that I am dropping this hot garbage. I was so bored! Enjoyment is a 2/10. This anime is so derivative and trope-y that it basically is to isekai anime what Black Clover is to shonen anime. The Maou-sama is your generic OP/badass isekai protagonist. This anime starts basically the same as Overlord does, where the protagonist gets sucked into this MMO on the very night where the mods are shutting...down the game servers for good. The only difference is Maou is the creator of said game, which gives him all sorts of OP administrator privileges: the ability to hold infinite items, the ability to summon items or even buildings to stay in, a magic shield that instantly blocks attacks from any character who isn\'t max level, etc. What I didn\'t like is that *apparently* even when Maou is about to lose a fight, he can just ""change character"" into an even more powerful character!? He can\'t lose! Even Kirito from SAO (who just had an edge as a beta tester of his game) doesn\'t seem nearly as OP by comparison.In stereotypical isekai fashion, the protagonist runs into several cute girls who all instantly fall in love with him, including a pink-haired Holy Maiden who turns out to be textbook tsundere. The female lead Aku is your typical demure, little-sister-type anime girl. Her tragic past is designed to force you to sympathize with her. The show goes so far as to have her literally cleaning up shit and then villagers throw rocks at her!? Too much! I was also a bit uncomfortable with her and Maou\'s relationship, considering she is maybe 14 and he is obviously middle aged, and what I assumed was a father-daughter relationship seems to be heading in a romantic one (yikes!). You know what I HATED about Aku though? This show straight up plagiarized Rem\'s design from Re:Zero! Seriously, Aku is literally a blonde Rem. What\'s worse is I looked it up and Aku doesn\'t even look like that in the LN/manga!? So they copied a much more popular isekai anime in a desperate attempt to get people on board for the anime version? Despicable! One of the 3 Holy Maidens even looks a bit like Satella from Re:Zero! Sorry, I know I\'ve been mentioning a lot of other shows when this is a review of ""Maou-sama, Retry!"" but this really is one of those unoriginal shows where you can\'t watch it without thinking of like 5 other shows. I\'m giving story and character 4/10 for being so damn stereotypical and bland.Studio Ekachi Epilka animated this show and I am giving their poor effort a 3/10. This is a relatively new studio, and looking them up I see that their only other show was about people having conversations at railroad tracks? From this information I can gather that the studio simply wasn\'t suited for an action-oriented anime, because their action scenes in ""Maou-sama, Retry!"" totally suck. The ""fight scenes"" amount to a still image of a character punching or kicking the air while everyone else flies backwards, with no actual movement or bodily contact. The sound was also terrible (3/10), as they used pieces of music at almost random times, and the music would stop just as suddenly as it started, which distracted me from what was going on.It\'s entirely possible that this show may pick up later on, or that the studio is saving their animation budget for later in the season. But based on these 4 episodes I don\'t see anything here worthwhile. This is a bland, copycat isekai that you should drop in favor of pretty much any other isekai show. Hell, even Sword Art Online had good animation and fight scenes, right? down the game servers for good.

If you think In Another World with My Smartphone was a terrible anime than you will not enjoy this show. If our someone who’s ok likes to watch generic isekai for the fun of it or to see just how generic it can be this show may appeal to you in that way. I won\'t waste people\'s time and tell you my rating for this show is a 5/10.Demon Lord, Retry is to be frank a basic teleported to another world anime with the...twist being that the main protagonist is a mafia boss referred to in the show by everyone in the new world including the title ""Demon Lord"" which i find humorous considering the english dubs voice actors voice doesn\'t match the characters look whatsoever so he tries to sound more gruff and it\'s like a teenager poorly propping as an adult going to the convenience store to buy a 12 pack of beer. The best part is that Josh Grelle is the voice of both him and the MC of In Another World with My Smartphone Touya Mochizuki so it makes for a humorous experience like a 5th graders trying to perform hamlet.Regardless let’s move on to the cookie cutter plot of our isekai tale. Akira is an adult who managed a MMO similar to the world he gets teleported into but different in terms of magic and finds himself transported to this other world where he meets up with redux-Rem (i call her this because she is a shy carbon copy lookalike of Rem from Re;Zero) who has been thrown out of her crappy village where she literally shoveled peoples crap and was treated badly for some fucking reason thats generic and cliche to get you to have sympathy for her to be a sacrifice for a high level demon for everyone else but not our main protagonist of course cause he kills the demon quite easily. After saving the girl he finds a holy place or something where demon worshipers are all dead inside and out and a statue woman is slowly crumbling away after granting the demon worshipers the request to summon a demon lord (of which is our main protagonist BTW in case the title didn\'t tip you off) and she doesn\'t have enough power to grant a wish to bring him back to his world, but at least gives him a ring that seems demonic and only seems to serve to make him think evil thoughts so he ignores it while heading to redux-Rems village to return her unknowing of her TrAgIc story. After seeing the other villagers treat her badly he casually burns down their village and brings along redux-Rem on his adventures while she dreams of banging him like every girl in one of these generic shows does with our main hero (who they made middle aged this time, tOtAlLy DiFfErEnT...)Along the way he meets a slew of trope character whose concepts were taking from some other show like the angry brutish girl, the self-centered tsundere, the trap, the megumin/chuunibyou character, the crude hardcore girl who turns to jello when a big hunking man comes along and saves her, the ""pure"" older sister, the nice merchant, the one masochist guy, the smart girl who also wants to bang the protagonist for reasons even she questions, the friendly barkeep, the asshole for the sake of being asshole nobles, a demon girl, sorry HALF-demon girl, demi humans who are just humans with animal features, ext. The show only runs for 12 episode and introduces so many characters that they constantly show a name caption above a characters head that hasn\'t been on screen long enough when they\'re back on screen of which is a TERRIBLE decision and i hope they didn\'t think they were gonna continue cause this show is really not good enough to continue honestly but hey, they gave other generic Isekai 24 episodes so what do i know...I tried to write the summary of this in a short manner but i just couldn\'t do it... Basically he establishes a base of operations via ""insta-construction"" bullshit and wants to make money in the new world to help him return home    of which he needs to talk to the god of that world to do, or something... The rest makes little to no difference and i\'m telling you now to just go into this and not think hard about it, that’s why i called it junk food, its trope central in this show and rip-offs like redux-Rem are a plenty.Let’s just get on with the MAL ratings that i redid in a table here:I don\'t like MALs take on ratings and how it doesn\'t have .5 ratings so here my take on it.10:Masterpiece9.5:Incredible9:Awesome8.5:Great8:Very Good7.5:Good7:Alright6.5:Fine6:Ok5.5:Average5:Medicure4.5:Boring4:Bad3.5:Very Bad3:Terrible2.5:Horrible2:Appealing1.5:Painful1:TrashStory: 2.5/10 or 3/10 by MALs scoring. Remember soul eater and how it used unoriginal concepts and made them amazing? This show does the exact opposite and uses them in the blandest possible sense and it makes even thinking about its plot or trying to summarize it painful for me which is terrible but not 1.5 level of it cause that would be reserved for a show that tried to be serious of which this show doesn\'t really try to do that so it gets off the hook a bit.Art: The art is your chip in your junk food but only just one, and if you\'ve ever had a single chip you know how annoying that is and makes it not worth eating if you don\'t have more and this show certainly didn\'t have more. Bland, uninspired, pathetic and doesn\'t really try. On a plus note i suppose it tried to add more detail with how it shaded its characters but it wasn\'t good enough, 4.5/10 or 4/10 for MAL scoring.Sound: There wasn\'t anything standoutish and the voice acting was maybe 3/5th properly sounding/done decently enough, however the intro isn\'t god awful so there\'s that at least? 5/10.Characters: Too many, all generic or ripped off, nothing really unique, almost no REAL character building, but the designs weren\'t eye bleeding so 4.5/10 or 4/10 for MAL for MAL scoring.Enjoyment: Like a said initially this show is junk food and in its own bad way it wasn\'t so terrible to that i had to bleach my eyes but it was something i guarantee i\'ll forget, thus 4.5/10 or 5/10 for MAL scoring.Overall: You need to go into this show expecting nothing of value and just laugh at the stupid tropey crap to get a semblance of joy out of it. I don\'t recommend this show, i would never tell you to buy it or tell you it’s a must watch. If you wanna forget about this show that’s for the best in my opinion cause it wasn\'t worth valuing, but like i said if you wanna just have a junk food to watch this won\'t hurt you to simply view once. 4.5/10 or 5/10 for MAL scoring. twist being that the main protagonist is a mafia boss referred to in the show by everyone in the new world including the title ""Demon Lord"" which i find humorous considering the english dubs voice actors voice doesn\'t match the characters look whatsoever so he tries to sound more gruff and it\'s like a teenager poorly propping as an adult going to the convenience store to buy a 12 pack of beer.

On a plus note i suppose it tried to add more detail with how it shaded its characters but it wasn\'t good enough, 4.5/10 or 4/10 for MAL scoring.Sound: There wasn\'t anything standoutish and the voice acting was maybe 3/5th properly sounding/done decently enough, however the intro isn\'t god awful so there\'s that at least? 5/10.Characters: Too many, all generic or ripped off, nothing really unique, almost no REAL character building, but the designs weren\'t eye bleeding so 4.5/10 or 4/10 for MAL for MAL scoring.Enjoyment: Like a said initially this show is junk food and in its own bad way it wasn\'t so terrible to that i had to bleach my eyes but it was something i guarantee i\'ll forget, thus 4.5/10 or 5/10 for MAL scoring.Overall: You need to go into this show expecting nothing of value and just laugh at the stupid tropey crap to get a semblance of joy out of it. I don\'t recommend this show, i would never tell you to buy it or tell you it’s a must watch. If you wanna forget about this show that’s for the best in my opinion cause it wasn\'t worth valuing, but like i said if you wanna just have a junk food to watch this won\'t hurt you to simply view once. 4.5/10 or 5/10 for MAL scoring.', ""If you're acquainted with the isekai genre, you know about its repetitive nature. Many shows have the same premise and lack originality in terms of the progression of characters and the story. This show is different.Instead of being simply a show about a guy being trapped in another world as an overpowered character, it takes the approach of Overlord, and makes the main character be more interested in the growth and development of his settlement. I appreciated the effort for this show to limit the confrontation the main character was engrossed in, to avoid making this show simply a power fantasy. The rest of...the cast was likeable too. They did a great job of humanizing the cohorts of the main character, which added to the overall performance of the narrative.It's not one of those shows that will overshadow everything else from an anime season. It's not one of those shows that will have tons of fanfare. It's just a good show that you can find yourself binging and finishing very quickly. This was easily my fave show of its season.

It has a huge mix of both good and bad things, and I will try to explain how it works.Story & Characters: The story follows a very known, and perhaps worn out, trope of isekai(other world) story telling. The main character gets transported to a fantasy world as a game they were connected to shut down their servers (Log Horizon) and has to find their place in this new world. The story has a weak objective (finding a way back to the real world) and severely lack any kind of tension, as the MC is so OP...that there's never anything to worry about. There are some interesting characters, but there's almost never any development for any of them(except for Luna whom goes from a selfish and violent person to becoming a loving and kind one).Art & Sound: The sound design is pretty standard, but suffers, possibly on purpose, from some cringy sounds and music from time to time. The art is also pretty standard, but the animations are pretty bad, especially the combat animation, which mostly consists of people standing in place, uttering some stupid line, and flinging a mediocre projectile over a detail-less     background, and their enemy falling over.Overall: The show is pretty mediocre and cringy, without a lot of obvious positives, but at the same time it is a pretty entertaining show.

What can be said about that anime? To be honest,i am going to explain it in many categories.Let's talk about story first. Player called Akira Ono gets transported to another world,inside the game in his game character,Kunai Hakuto for many unknown reasons. Once he saved a Rem-looking girl named Aku from demon Greole,he gone with Aku on adventure to find out why was he summoned in this world and who summoned him and to find a way to be invincible against some magic attacks. Many things happened,from Maou-sama slapping Luna Elegant's butt to him transforming into his alter ego character,Zero Kirisame. Story is...uuuhhh,whatever. 6/10As for art and animation,it's pretty solid for isekai anime. Art for characters is little bit lazy and generic. Aku somewhat looks like Rem or Ram from Re:Zero,Killer Queen looks like she is cosplaying Saber from Fate/Stay Night,Luna Elegant's and Angel White's color of eyes and hair kinda reminds me of Mine from Akame Ga Kill. Other character's art look somewhat original,especially Kunai's. As for animation,it's looks decent,nothing special or bad to talk about it. Art and animation are decent. 6.5/10Now we go for soundtrack,music and voice acting. Soundtrack have a very nice jazz fusion vibe when they are not fighting against someone until it's get ruined by weird battle music or something like that. As for OP and ED songs,they are pretty good,but forgettable. Anime's opening would be good if it's had better animation without using cutscenes from Episode 1 and 2,that's all i can say for music. Voice acting is,without doubt,not bad at all. I like that Kunai's voice actor spoke with mature when Kunai and calm and collected and how he sounded serious when slapping Luna's butt,lol. Only ones that were familiar to me were Yu Kirino's,Killer Queen's and Angel White's voice actresses,Rina Satou (Mikoto Misaka,Vert,Ryou Machiko),Haruka Tomatsu (Lala Deviluke,Asuna Yuuki) and Aki Toyosaki. (Yui Hirasawa,Momo Deviluke) Overall,it's pretty good. 7/10Did i enjoy it? Yes,i did. Why is so fun to watch,despite how flawed is it? Because it's have some nice stuff to offer that you don't see in every anime,such as seeing protagonist slapping girl's butt. I really liked shocked faces of shopkeepers when Kunai offered a gold coins,it's was priceless. Plus fight scenes were pretty good. I really enjoyed almost everything. 9/10Here is it,now i'll talk about characters. Let's start with protagonist,Kunai Hakuto,also known as Demon Lord. His looks,the way he is dressed,it's surprising. Also,his personality is something unique. He was so hilarious when he was punishing Luna by slapping her butt and sometimes funny when Yukikaze flirted with him. Unlike other protagonists,he is calm and collected when there is naked girl in front of him and he acts like gentleman,giving them towel or clothes to cover themselves and he is open minded and honest towards them. It's very rare to see that kind of protagonist,i am impressed.As for main cast of girls,some of them are cute and some of them should be waifu materials,some of them not. Supporting characters are all right,but not worth mentioning,they are nothing special. Villains are generic and very poorly developed,thought,they are only thing i don't like about this anime. Characters are decent,expect villains. 6.7/10Overall:6.8/10This anime is not bad neither good. It's just plain,enjoyable show made for isekai fans who do not mind flaws that this anime have and other critical problems that only anime fans with high standards care about. If you are tired of protagonists with generic and bland looks and personalities and you don't care about middle flaws,then this is for you. This is also good to anyone who want to see protagonist slapping girl's butt. I know,i know,i mentioned it like 4 times. Like i said,it's very rare to see protagonists doing such stuff.

There are events that lead to new characters coming into contact with the main cast, and they sometimes tag along, but there's no overarching plot and a goal only takes form towards the end. The mix of slice-of-life, fantasy, and action/drama was badly done. The pacing, tone, and stakes have some issues as well, and there's nothing really compelling about the story.Art: 6There are some moments where the art or the animation looks particularly good, but for...the most part, it's average. The character designs, locations, and backgrounds are generally well done, but there are some low-effort moments that are very noticeable.Sound: 9The voice actors/actresses did a fantastic job of adding emotion to everything the characters said, and the lines themselves are great as well. The OP is kind of catchy but it gets annoying after hearing it a few times. The ED is much better and is still enjoyable time after time.

Not sure how it\'s passed me by until now; in hindsight I\'ve watched plenty of anime that fits squarely into the category, including favorites like Sword Art Online and Kyo Kara Maoh!. And Sword Art points to an increasingly common tack for the isekai genre: The other world that the protagonist gets stuck in is a video game.Such is the case with Demon Lord, Retry, which has a strong Overlord whiff to it. I had multiple feelings of deja vu while watching this, particularly by way of Overlord\'s first season. But while the whiffs...are there, the actual tones between the two series are quite opposite. Demon Lord, Retry is lighthearted and frivolous, lacking any kind of real plot, and seems to exist mostly so our insert protagonist can encounter a ton of women who become desperately attached to him.It\'s surface-level entertaining as a mindless piece of television to while away half hour chunks of time. But it\'s not the sort of entertaining that will linger in your mind; if you start skipping this in your anime rotation, it\'ll be hard to remember to pick it back up. (Which is why it took me, like, three months to watch this 12ep series, lol.)Episode 12 ends with an optimistic \'To be Continued,\' but at this point I\'d be shocked any more is made. Even if the series was paused to allow the original light novels to provide more content, this just isn\'t good enough that a studio is likely to want to sink more money into. That said, despite my poor scores, if they did continue it I\'d be curious to check more episodes out—and probably regret it—because there\'s just enough groundwork laid here that I\'d want to see what becomes of it. are there, the actual tones between the two series are quite opposite.

Here are some of it's pros:Overpowered badass MC(Main Character), great voice actors, good dialogues, great comedic timing, diverse characters with unique personalities, well written storyline, isekai combining modern tech with magic world.What I did not like about the anime was: animation quality was average & fight scenes were pretty simple/not involving any strategy (hopefully this should improve as the MC goes to dungeon/meets stronger opponents).I heard that a new studio animated it & hence the animation/fight scenes were pretty average.Why I'd really like a Season...2:Immense potential in the storyline, with a huge reveal in the last episode regarding the origin of MC. The MC will go to dungeons so there's a chance of character building as well. The story has so many elements (Demons, devils, angels, gods, races like demihumans, devilkins, dwarves), with the isekai element combining both modern tech with magical world. Not once did I feel bored watching it. And the characters are very diverse, likeable and cute as well.I hope a good studio decides to proceed with nice animation for S2 since there's a lot left in the Light Novels. 2:Immense potential in the storyline, with a huge reveal in the last episode regarding the origin of MC.

This is rather similar to other anime\'s of the same genre and style, and I personally feel like it falls similar to ""How Not to Summon a Demon Lord"" but less lewd.The story, cliche as is, does have its own twist and turns that make it stand out. An Isekai anime about travel from game to new world is rather common, but having the protagonist be the main programmer/creator of said game opens many doors that aid with managing an overpowered MC.The character lineup makes it seem like he\'s a father rather than the center of a harem,...as he has more of a father figure feel to him. I prefer this instead, as I feel like it benefits this anime more. It gives the characters a sense of connection while keeping them all unique on their own.The animation isn\'t anything to go crazy for, but it\'s good (the worst animation I\'ve seen is the recent Seven Deadly Sins seasons, so compared to this, Demon Lord, Retry! is an animation masterpiece.) The environments are sometimes iffy, but most of the time it\'s good.

The main character's inner dialogue writing is really clever, and I like him a lot, but there's still not enough meat in the show to overcome the dryness of him being overpowered and too many side characters...that degenerate in personality.

After comparing the art of the manga to the anime I really felt that they failed to capture the essence of some of the characters. Like Kunai and Yuu could have been drawn to be more scary looking (And yes I...know that the animating a whole anime takes a lot more effort than drawing a manga but I still feel like it could have been done better) and the facial expressions could have been done better. Voice Acting was good no complaints and the story was fine, but the sound tracks were terrible. I don't remember when exactly but in the first episode where Kunai and Aku were talking there was just this really loud obnoxious sound track playing over their conversation that just really didn't fit (and this was not the only time a sound track just really didn't fit). Overall I give this a 5/10, the manga was really enjoyable but the anime was mediocre.

I just barely tolerated the compulsive lying from 80,000 gold\'s MC. I won\'t tolerate it a second time. More and more of the episodes seem to be dedicated to the girl spinning an unnecessary web and explaining it all away. Dropped, which is an automatic 3 for me.If you watched the author\'s other work, ""Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for my Retirement"", and felt the work would have been better served by making the main character a listless, wandering bum, then look no further than this beautiful masterpiece. The story is simple, and episodic: FMC shows up in...town, pops a potion or two, gets everyone to fawn over her for having magic potions, and being super mega smart and awesome, then when a noble shows up, it\'s time for her to skedaddle on to the next destination to do it all over again. She will never, under any circumstances so far, settle down anywhere, to do anything. Her motivations are an enigma, and three episodes in, the closest we\'ve gotten is ""I want to start my own business""... which is promptly ignored for a random plot about undercover charity work that didn\'t get enough setup because the anime skipped content.Every time, and I do mean Every, and then Time, that an adult noble meets her, they try to take her for themselves. First it\'s an annoying fat guy, then it\'s the crown prince trying to stalk her into marriage. The first time, she swaps places with a maid that needed to be her size for no logical reason, given that she can make potions that do ANYTHING. The second time, she gets tired of being stalked by the prince, so when he invites her to  a party, she shows up, changes into a maid outfit, pretends she was too stupid to know she also got a package with the invitation, shouts about how life as a noble sucks until everyone cries, then cuts her face and runs away.To add to that second event, a random guard at the exit to the town buys a stupid lie that she angered a noble, and not only lets her go, but also gives her money and supplies for no reason.I could go on about every little thing wrong with this, but you get the idea.Still, I\'m not dropping it yet, so it\'s clearly not a 3 on my book. town, pops a potion or two, gets everyone to fawn over her for having magic potions, and being super mega smart and awesome, then when a noble shows up, it\'s time for her to skedaddle on to the next destination to do it all over again.

NOPE, this trend has finally ended here...If you\'ve been on the anime bandwagon for about 4-5 years now, you might have seen this Fall 2019 show called Watashi, Nouryoku wa Heikinchi de tte Itta yo ne! a.k.a Didn\'t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!. Despite the rather lackluster premise and subpar production, it was a show where the simplicity of the fantasy Isekai reincarnation OP genre, by meandering away from many of its contemporaries at the time, it was a...solid show that was created by the pseudonym novelist FUNA.But within the span of a year, the author\'s 2 remaining LNs were adapted...and they were absolute stinkers at best. Winter\'s Rougo ni Sonaete Isekai de 8-manmai no Kinka wo Tamemasu a.k.a Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for my Retirement (which was said to be the best, but I didn\'t buy that crap and found it just decent), and now Fall\'s Potion-danomi de Ikinobimasu! a.k.a I Shall Survive Using Potions!, which is just a side-story-ish shell of Rougo 8-man and a ""perfect"" backup for inching the former series being inferior over the other as the worst series of the author\'s biography. Oh, did I mention that both LNs were released just a month apart from each other? That\'s how you know that FUNA did think of an idea to run two simultaneous series at once: one about money and the other about potions, and to spice the story up, interchange story mechanics between both works, so neither will ever be the wiser. Hello, we are NOT idiots who can\'t tell the difference between this and the other.If you\'re familiar with either NouKin or Rougo 8-man, Potion-danomi de Ikinobimasu!\'s story elements are so predictable that you can tell straight away: someone dies unexpectedly in real life, only to be Isekai reincarnated into the fantasy world where the gods or goddesses bless the MC with what she wants to have in her new second life. And in this show, for an office secretary turned 15-year-old girl by the name of Kaoru Nagase, this is her new life now: meeting the world\'s goddess Celestine to get blessed by her with the ability to make potions of her choice, along with an infinite Item Box to supplement with it, and much more.Right away, when you put Potion-danomi and Rougo 8-man side by side, it\'s the same goddamn story progression with a different purpose and outcome, and even the characters exhibit the same goddamn personality: Kaoru is NO different from Mitsuha Yamano, being smart young girls who can defend themselves with their vast knowledge (until they need assistance from the world\'s authorities to protect their back). Of course, if you\'re new to either series, I won\'t relent as much, but after having watched all 3 FUNA-adapted LNs, it\'s safe to say that while the author\'s marketing was done quite well and had some traction in Japan, over in the West, we don\'t care for the same copy-pasted blurb each and every time, as is the case for both shows (NouKin IS the exception that the author attempted and was fairly well received with the anime).Back to Potion-danomi, Kaoru\'s goal is not just potions alone, but to find love and have her descendants spread out in the world...hey, just like Rougo 8-manmai in terms of money! But being a commoner, she does not know of the cultures of the various places she goes and has to rely on two groups of people: the nobility (aided by Francette, Roland, and Alan) and the orphans (Emile, Belle, and the rest of the many abandoned children) that they dub the Goddess cult, given Kaoru\'s close friendship with Celestine. That\'s fine and all for the community that said girl is seeking to create to better the lives of everyone, but I can\'t help thinking that this goody-two-shoes formula has been replicated twice in a row and that Kaoru seems to be a subset of Mitsuha in her own good and bad ways.Somewhat expectedly, for the worst show in FUNA\'s lineup, you have one of the most unknown support studios out there to be assigned to adapt this work. Jumondo as a studio, they\'re easily seen as worse than 3rd-rate, starting from their Spring 2022 show, Kono Healer, Mendokusai a.k.a Don\'t Hurt Me, My Healer!, whose low-tier production actually suited the show quite appropriately. Next to come would be the production of Satoshi Mizukami\'s Hoshi no Samadare a.k.a Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer for Summer and Fall, and it easily looked like garbage. This brings us today to Potion-danomi, and FUNA\'s rather simplistic art, once again, suits the production being just a lower-than-average show. Honestly, there is just nothing great about the animation.The music fares even worse. katagiri and harmoe\'s OP and ED songs were subpar to decent, but just not that memorable, and it sure sounds cheery...provided if you just listen once and skip it the next time.On this basis, I can shout: THANK F***ING GOD!...that FUNA\'s LNs have all been adapted into anime, so we won\'t have to suffer anymore from mediocre to subpar writing, especially with this and Rougo 8-manmai.

All solutions she presents to problems in the show are immediately accepted by would-be antagonists with gaping mouths and claims of how smart she is and how they never could have thought of that on their own.The show offends its audience by assuming the viewer doesn't have enough intelligence to understand what's going on the show and it must therefore explain everything through exposition.

Having watched almost the entire thing and giving it the benefit of the doubt has no use at all, because you\'re blueballing yourself by thinking ""let me give it 2 more episodes"", please save those 40 minutes doing ANYTHING else unless you\'re a trashman watcher (like me).The Anime gives you the impression it\'s gonna be something soft and witty, as we watch our snide MC troll the entire world. And trolling she does (not enough), especially...in the first episodes where the buildup for getting a great payoff starts, but it becomes an abysmal watch when you see this anime trying anything else especially something that\'s serious or emotional, and the payoff turned out to be the most abhorrent part of this show as some of the other people that reviewed this mentioned (Episode 6). The Time we usually have is precious, but not to this series as you waste away, having the corners of your lips smile a little only every now and then, and you genuinely feel like Kaoru has not only trolled those random citizens with her bullshit powers of creating whatever whenever she wants but also you the watcher.Going into the lack of focus, Kaoru starts out as Snide and Selfish but having ultimately the valiant goal of living seemingly peacefully without trouble as she implies, becoming worried that she\'ll become too popular due to her mystical overly balance breaking power that the most pathetic and dumbest goddess would just randomly give because she accidentally sniped the MC. The Power is basically a loophole of creating anything you want, as long as it has some liquid inside it of your choosing. From a MC that doesn\'t want to stand out, and some random mildly concerning stalker / pedophile prince trying to force her into a marriage, she moves countries to all of a sudden decide to become a saintly grace to sickly children because she felt sorry for them.That\'s nice and all, but the transition to it was something that was completely appalling and I found weird to do, from a thieving kid that pick pocketed a bag of her coins to suddenly fade the screen into her becoming ""The Eye of the Goddess"" and becomes a hero, this series loves to confuse us seemingly, as an episode later we happen to find some very bland out of the blue explanation of how we went from Kaoru fled a country to live a peaceful life to hero of the knight with her own child occult that saves everyone with her potions, which wasn\'t even that good and at that point you no longer even cared about that. Awesome 10/10 development, right? Surely we won\'t get some other braindead circus performance where she changes her mind yet again.Then Episode 6 and Episode 7 happen...... well, our great hero Kaoru has decided to assist and join a religious political war, and you will never guess why..... because people took note of her miracle making abilities and wanted to claim her. And in the span of those episodes, we have her drag her own occult of toddlers to war with her. Trying to make it all mushy and sentimental about her sacrificing herself to the battlefields when she damn well knows her omnipotence (being a friend with god and having unlimited restriction to creation manipulation) and the shitshow she has created. Anyways, where this show devolved the absolute most, was the child sacrifice scene in EP6, some unreasonable, illogical and incomprehensible scene where she tried to dehydrate soldiers, and once they found a well with water. The first thought was giving the kid some poison and then jumping in it??? Also, after that happened our totally reasonable and flawless MC decided to break the rule she created of not killing anyone, and decided to pop and create poison within their body. Of course, don\'t worry, after she killed those soldiers she managed to save the kid that killed itself to poison the well. After that we have some niche sentimental crying scene. It didn\'t get much better from there, as later in Episode 7 the most appalling part of the story, we had Kaoru in the nick of time give a maidenly knight known as ""Fearsome Fran"" (i cringed at that) give her a vibration sword to crown her as a holy knight and whatnot, and then with the cutesy loli rainbow artstyle we watch Fearsome Fran literally slice multiple people in half as we get to see the blood spray about..... and it gets covered up with trytoohard cute bs and romance of Side-Character A and Side-Character B(Fearsome Fran)The Highlight is the trolling that isn\'t borderline massacre, mutilation and using Soviet Union Tactics, and the ED song. in the first episodes where the buildup for getting a great payoff starts, but it becomes an abysmal watch when you see this anime trying anything else especially something that\'s serious or emotional, and the payoff turned out to be the most abhorrent part of this show as some of the other people that reviewed this mentioned (Episode 6).
