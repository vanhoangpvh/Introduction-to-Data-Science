Hello! Lady Lynn,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2405/Hello_Lady_Lynn,"[""And so it ended this Candy Candy look-alike saga! Yup, if you didn't notice already from the first series in this franchise, the influence of the failed masterpiece Candy Candy anime from the 70's (failed not because of the content but because of the usual syndication crap about the necessity of making 100+ episodes where the ideas lasted for less than said amount of time, 90 in that specific case) is REALLY HIGH on both Lady Lady!! and Hello! Lady Lynn, in particular in the chara design which is admittedly straight-up copy-and-pasted but also concerning some plot elements. So, both series are mainly targeted to...fans of that one like me myself and I (episode from 91 on excluded) from the get go and if you happen to be one of them you will like them both, even if on the whole the package is not in the same league of the perfection achieved by the first 90 episodes of Candy Candy. Concerning the series that I'm reviewing in this moment, totally useless FOUR recaps at episode 17-18 and episode 35-36 (????) and one atrocious filler permitted it suffers a bit in terms of predictability, meaning the fact that the emotionality of the ending of the first series is a bit toned down because you already know that Lynn is going to win that friggin' lady necklace whatever it was because almost everybody ends totally supporting her, so it's not unsurprising. All said and done, I still give it an 8 rounding up from the 7,5 I thought of giving it because I had a good time and I didn't feel my time was wasted with these two series. I'd recommend you anyway to watch Candy Candy throught the fansubs available online (the only way as of today to do it) before watching both Lady Lady!! and Hello! Lady Lynn if you've never done it. fans of that one like me myself and I (episode from 91 on excluded) from the get go and if you happen to be one of them you will like them both, even if on the whole the package is not in the same league of the perfection achieved by the first 90 episodes of Candy Candy.

Golden Kamuy 2nd Season OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38710/Golden_Kamuy_2nd_Season_OVA,"['Honestly, this OVA answers a lot of loose ends that you might come across watching the first season. The Story is told to us in three parts and there is a bit of a time skip in between some of the parts but for anyone who is watching Golden Kamuy I feel like this OVA is a must watch as it shows us a lot more hilarious scenes with Shiraishi and also goes in on what happened during the horse races. This is a must-watch if I do say so myself and it really lives up to the reputation Golden Kamuy has. ', ""Golden Kamuy is the chef's kiss of historical anime, perfectly balanced with comedy, action, and philosophical depth.  The characters as always are always well-portrayed, and the plotlines are whimsical tangents to the main storyline.  There are no words to describe the catharsis of being that occurs in the third episode of this OVA trilogy.  I would recommend this for anyone who has already watched the first two seasons of Golden Kamuy and enjoyed them a lot.  Especially if you liked the episodes featuring Edogai, because the third episode definitely has humor along those kind of extreme lines.You go, Anehata Shiton....You...you just go. You...you just go.""]"
Fushigi no Umi no Nadia,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1251/Fushigi_no_Umi_no_Nadia,"[""Story: Nadia, the Secret of Blue Water is supposedly based on the novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The truth of the matter is, the plot elements shared by the two can pretty much be counted on one hand. The two stories are practically unconnected. But that's alright. The plot crafted for Nadia &quot;based on&quot; Jules Verne's is actually quite good by its own right. It offers both awesomely epic action and touching emotionality and handles both wonderfully. There are a few nicely executed twists thrown in as well.Of course, no review of Nadia can get around a certain arc in the middle. Episodes 23-34...are directed by a replacement director. The twelve &quot;filler&quot; episodes, in my opinion, aren't horrible, but they ARE horribly mediocre in comparison to the rest. For those twelve episodes (episodes 30 and 31 excepted), the plot comes to a stand still. Life on a deserted island simply doesn't compare to the excitement of the main plot. However, that's not actually the worst part of it. I wouldn't have minded so much if it hadn't also distorted the characterization to a nigh-insulting level. More on that later.So would you be better off skipping the island and Africa arcs? While they have their moments, in my opinion, the answer is yes. The experience would probably be enhanced if you left them out. The director felt only episodes worth keeping from those twelve were 30 and 31 and I'm inclined to agree. Those two are good and should be watched. You won't lose anything by watching the rest unless you're remarkably touchy, but you won't really gain anything either.Art: Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs are as nice as ever, and the animation is generally good. Emotions are portrayed nicely and the complicated technological wonders and battles are quite nuanced and pretty. However, the series IS 20 years old and looking its age.As for the supposed iffishness in part of the animation during the filler arc, I can't say I noticed it. It did, however, suddenly become somewhat more cartoonish than previously (like a character running off a cliff and only falling when he noticed it...) It wasn't very fitting, in my opinion.Sound: The sound of Nadia is good but not notable. I watched the subbed version and the voices were fine. They suited their characters and the performances were good, as far as I can tell. Nothing much to say on this. In any case, the soundtrack was composed by Shirou Sagisu, so you know its good. The action-comedy parts and the epic struggle for the fate of the world are both handled nicely, but Sagisu's tracks for the bittersweet scenes really shine. I can safely say the score greatly enhances the emotions of the last episodes, especially the ending.Character: Nadia's characters are, in a word, great. The leads and supporting cast are all very well developed, but even the minor bit parts aren't left as two-dimensional ciphers. The relationships between them are very carefully crafted and actually change believably over time and with new revelations. I personally rooted for Nadia and Jean's romance.Especially noteworthy is Gargoyle, who is, in truth, a world-class villain and one of the best I've seen in anime. He appears in only about a third of the episodes, but comes off as a true menace who you really learn to hate by the end.The worst offense of the filler arc is probably the messing with characterization. Nadia herself is by far the worst victim of this. While she has a canonically difficult personality, the the filler arc upgrades this to &quot;annoying bitch&quot;. Every flash of likability is negated by another act of irritating stupidity. Especially retarded is her falling in love with some random African kid - a huge slap in the face of the love story that forms the core of the whole series. Thankfully, this and most everything else that happens in the island and Africa arcs is pretty much ignored later on.Enjoyment: While one can certainly like Nadia solely for its artistic competence, it's also damn good fun. It's been a while since I watched a series as engrossing as Nadia. It's humorous moments are amusing and its sad moments are ridiculously touching. I've rarely come as close to crying while watching an anime as during the ending of Nadia. The characters are likable and easy to get into. The series doesn't take itself seriously all the time, but when it does, so do you.Overall: Nadia, the Secret of Blue Water isn't nearly as well-regarded as it should be. I saw a bit of it as a child on television, and expected to at least nostalgically like it when I rewatched it. Instead, the series forced its way into my Top 10 list. It's an undervalued classic that most people have not heard of and possibly never will because of its age. Do yourself a favor and watch it.

One of these concepts was ""Around the World Under the Sea"", based on Jules Verne\'s ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" in which two orphan children pursued by villains team up with Captain Nemo and his mighty submarine, the Nautilus. Although it was never produced, Toho nonetheless kept the rights to the story outline. Miyazaki would reuse elements from his original concept in later projects of his, most notably the terrific action-adventure Castle in...the Sky. Ten years later, in the mid-1980\'s, animation studio Gainax was commissioned to produce an original Anime series to be broadcast on television network NHK. Under the direction of a brilliant but angst-ridden artist known as Hideaki Anno, the studio selected Miyazaki\'s concept, and crafted an engaging story set in a steampunk 1889 France, with interesting characters, amazing animation (for its time), and a mixture of comedy, romance, mystery, and drama. The result was Nadia:  The Secret of Blue Water, which has since become a worldwide fan favorite.The story begins at a Paris World Exposition Fair where Jean, a nerdy but charming and instantly lovable inventor boy of fourteen, becomes smitten with a pretty, dark-skinned girl his own age. The girl, known as Nadia, is an unhappy circus acrobat with no clue about her past other than a jeweled necklace she wears. After rescuing her from a trio of comic bandits (the Grandis Gang) Jean earns Nadia\'s trust. The two set off on an even bigger adventure to find Nadia\'s birthplace, which supposedly lies in Africa. Along the way, they have run-ins with a supercharged submarine commanded by the mysterious Captain Nemo and his pretty but overprotective first officer Electra as well as a shadowy cult of Nazi-like masked soldiers known as Neo-Atlanteans led by the misanthropic, sinister Gargoyle, who wants Nadia\'s pendant at any cost. In the course of their around-the-world adventure, Jean and Nadia adopt an orphaned little girl, Marie, who senses that her new guardians will become more than just close friends. Although Nadia\'s explosive temper poses problems, Jean\'s patience and loyalty keeps their relationship afloat, and her growing love for the boy gradually transforms her as a person.Nadia has all the makings of a classic series: a well-rounded cast of characters, unforgettable sequences, and a long, involving action adventure. There is a distinctive ""Miyazaki-esque"" style to the visual designs of the leads, yet only Jean seems to emerge as a Miyazaki creation. Which is arguably what makes him the most lovable character in the whole show. It\'s easy to see why Nadia finds herself falling for him--who wouldn\'t want to be with a boy as intelligent, genuinely compassionate, and impossibly generous as Jean? While he does display clumsiness in terms of social graces around the opposite sex, it only makes him all the more appealing as a character. Nadia herself, by contrast, is not always lovable. In addition to having serious anger management issues, she also has unbending and irrational principles about killing, eating meat, or trusting grown-ups. She does, however, display courage and, as mentioned, finds herself growing to care for Jean. Actually, Anno has said that he created Jean and Nadia based on his ""light"" and ""dark"" sides.  Shiro Sagisu\'s music is sometimes bland, although some of the later tracks, notably the Neo-Atlantis themes, are memorable.  The opening and ending theme songs as sung by Miho Morikawa are also enjoyable.For all its assets, however, Nadia suffers from one fatal flaw that prevents it from being the classic it aims to be--it doesn\'t always stay afloat throughout its 39-episode count. The first twenty-two episodes are old-fashioned adventure at its best, with humor, young love, traumatic situations which involve death, and compelling, engrossing mysteries as we learn about Nadia, the Nautilus, and the Atlanteans.  The production values in these episodes show their age at times, but frankly, they still exude detail and clarity for an early \'90s series.  In episodes 23-34, however, it devolves into a painfully dull, unengaging, haphazard, incoherent Saturday morning cartoon, with warped characterizations, and even worse scenarios totally devoid of imagination or credibility. Simultaneously, the animation takes a hit in these dozen episodes, with some episodes looking downright sloppy or dreadfully cartoonish.  (In all fairness, these dreadful half-hours weren\'t supposed to have existed; distributor NHK requested that they be made after the show became a smash hit in Japan.) In the final five episodes Nadia does recover in terms of artistry and storytelling, delivering a satisfying finale, but it\'s hard to compensate for the damage that has been done. Simply put, the show would have been far better if it were eleven episodes shorter.For their part, however, ADV Films deserves a shout-out for their work on bringing this series to American audiences. The visual and aural transfers are competently done, but it\'s their translation that really shines. The English dub, provided by Austin-based Monster Island studios, is notable for casting three actual children in the roles of Jean, Nadia, and Marie--Nathan Parsons (12), Meg Bauman (14), and Margaret Cassidy (11), respectively. For inexperienced youngsters, all three do exceptional jobs, and are amply supported by a similarly entertaining cast of adults, particularly Sarah Richardson, Corey Gagne, Martin Blacker (as the Grandis Gang) as well as Jennifer Stuart (Electra).  Ev Lunning Jr. (Nemo) and David Jones (Gargoyle)\'s performances do take a bit longer to find their groove, but when they do, they really shine.  This dub has taken a lot of undeserved flak from critics who have made the mistake of writing it off on account of the sometimes uneven accents (Jean\'s admittingly shaky French dialect in particular takes some getting used to; although Parsons does improve on it as the show goes on).  Despite that and the occasional trepidatious moment in the opening episodes, the end result is still a spirited, energetic, emotionally charged dub that really brings its characters to life. It is most certainly a very commendable effort that deserved better recognition than what it was accorded for back in 2001 and even today.The ADV dub is not the only English track of Nadia to exist.  In the 1990\'s Streamline Pictures attempted a release of the show.  Interestingly, the head of Streamline, Carl Macek, did express interest in paring down the much maligned filler arc.  As his version only got about as far as eight episodes, we probably never may know how it would have turned out.  Having said that, though, I don\'t think the Streamline dub compares favorably to the ADV version.  Wendee Lee and Ardwright Chamberlain are both very credible actors, but both are miscast as Nadia and Jean and unfortunately underwhelm.  Jeff Winkless is a bit less stiff than Ev as Nemo, but even then his turn isn\'t anything amazing.  I did like Edie Mirman as Electra (she ties with Stuart) and the Grandis gang doesn\'t sound too bad, but on the whole I prefer the ADV dub.  It strikes me as the better of the two by far.Out of curiosity, I did sample a few episodes of the Japanese version.  Although some voices are solid (Nemo, Gargoyle, and Sanson), I felt rather indifferent about the others.  Marie\'s voice is the weakest of the bunch; no offense to the late Yuko Mizutani, but I feel Margaret Cassidy does a far better job of bringing out this little girl\'s innocence as opposed to Yuko\'s high-pitched shrieking.  Likewise, despite Yoshino Takamori and Noriko Hidaka\'s solid turns as Jean and Nadia I found myself preferring Bauman and Parsons, if mainly because both characters are supposed to be children.  It just feels more natural to hear them voiced by actors of the appropriate age.  Despite insistence from some long-in-the-tooth fans that this show should only be appreciated in its native language track, I don\'t consider either version better or worse, only different.  Whichever one you prefer is a matter of personal preference.Is Nadia a complete waste of time? Not at all; as mentioned, the characters are fully-realized, and for twenty-two episodes and the final five, the show does indeed deliver an entertaining, consistently engaging adventure story with just the right amount of heart, humor, and drama. It\'s just too bad that it goes downhill in the second half (despite delivering a phenomenal conclusion). Otherwise, this series would truly be worthy of the praise it receives as one of the greats. The best way to appreciate Nadia is to view episodes 1-22, then 31 (the only ""filler"" episode to have any genuine plot development), and finally 35-39. It will provide for a much more pleasing experience. the Sky.

It will provide for a much more pleasing experience.', 'Jean Raltique is a 14 year old, wide eyed inventor living in 1890’s France.  He and his uncle are participating in the Birdman Rally, an event that wouldn’t actually be established until 1970’s England, but we’ll be gracious and ignore that fact.  He falls in love at first sight with an exotic looking circus performer named Nadia, who wants to return to the place of her birth, which...  Due to her dark skin... she believes to be Africa.  They’re attacked by a trio of jewel thieves, and are chased all the way back to Jean’s house, where he smoothly offers to...fly her all the way to her home.  Another encounter with their aggravators leaves them stranded out at sea in a floating plane wreck, until they(and their pursuers) are picked up by a futuristic submarine named The Nautilus.  Grand adventure and intriguing mystery await the five of them as they begin their journey to find Nadia’s birthplace and unlock the secrets of the strange blue jewel that she possesses, in a story that was inspired by two of Jules Vernes’ most famous works, and the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki himself!Well, I say that, but this series wasn’t actually made by Miyazaki...  It was his idea, but after some initial financial controversy, the project was picked up by Studio Gainax, a rising animation studio who recently changed their name from Daikon in order to pursue more high profile titles.  After already having a successful movie and OVA series under their belt, Gainax decided to take Nadia as their first televised series, and it was highly successful...  to a fault, even, but we’ll get to that later.Right from the first few minutes of episode 1, Nadia shows you exactly what it’s animation style is going to be.  We’re shown a few frozen panning shots of people enjoying themselves at a science fair, immediately followed up by the impressive CG effect of an electricity machine.  This is indicative of a well allocated budget, where the bulk of the production money will be spent giving motion to scenes that need it the most, while leaving other shots...  Not all of which will be as unimportant as these opening ones...  High and dry.  Thankfully, the budget is managed well enough that those opening shots are the exception rather than the rule, and for the most part, this show does look very good.While it may look cheap and dated, in terms of it’s visual style, keep in mind that Nadia came out back in 1991, when an anime couldn’t look expensive without actually being expensive, due to the limits of the technology of the time...  High frame rate, Miyazaki quality productions were a rare treat, and the lesser spectacles were given a lot more leeway than they are today.  Having said that, as cheap as Nadia can occasionally look, there are a ton of moments in the series that look like they could have come straight out of Ghibli itself...  The visual of Nadia daringly leaping down from the Eiffel Tower to protect her sacred jewel is only a small taste of this, and it will in no way be the last.While most of the character designs may seem generic at first, they grow on you more and more as the characters in question develop throughout the story, and their backstories begin to become unraveled.  There are only two designs that really stand out right from the start...  One of them is Gargoyle and his sinister cult of Neo Atlanteans, the true villains of the series whose actions are unfortunately wrapped in spoilers too heavy to discuss.  The second one is Nadia’s, as she’s wearing what has to be one of the most iconic outfits in Studio Gainax’s long history.  It works very will with the backstory of her being an acrobat and a utility performer at a circus, but if we’re being honest with ourselves, the reason this design has endured for over twenty years in peoples’ memories is because of how revealing it is.  I’m not going to say this is necessarily a bad thing, as I know that women should wear whatever they want to without feeling ashamed, but it does feel kind of strange when you consider that Nadia was wearing a normal looking european dress when we were first introduced to her, implying that that’s how she likes to dress when she’s off the clock...  But for the rest of the series, she seems to prefer skin baring clothing so much that she’ll tear entire pieces off of any other outfit that’s handed to her.  Again, this wouldn’t bother me if it felt like her decision, and not just that of a horny animator.But that’s not the only thing about her that’s made her such a fixture of Gainax’s history...  She’s also, in general, a very likeable and dynamic character.  She’s cautious around new people...  Who wouldn’t be, after working in the circus for so long...  But she’s willing to give them the benefit of the doubt after she becomes more comfortable with them.  Her convictions and principals are also a very strong part of her character.  She’s a pacifist, who’s adamantly against the idea of people killing each other for any reason, and while this belief isn’t portrayed as strongly as it was in Trigun and Fullmetal Alchemist, she also takes it a step further by being a strict vegetarian...  Yes, she believes that animals and people should both be spared from the wrath of greedy humans, and she’s not afraid to act on those beliefs, even when it may cost her the good graces of her peers.  She can be difficult because of this, but she never seems to cross into the territory of becoming unreasonable, at least not until...  We’ll get to that later.Oh, and her baby albino lion has giant balls.  Because...  Yeah, courage, and stuff.  He\'s awesome.Jean isn’t really as complex as his nimble crush, but that’s not to say he’s some bland self-insert character, either...  The darker tones of the series take their toll on his happy-go-lucky outlook, maturing him just like the rest of the cast.  He also has a very distinct personality, even if other personalities sometimes overshadow his in the story.  He’s very open about his feelings for Nadia, that visibly develop from infatuation to actual interpersonal romantic interest throughout the course of the series.  He’s very passionate about technology, and not just about his own inventions, but about the technology of the anachronistic Nautilus submarine, as well.  He’s fascinated by Nadia and the Nautilus, and will take any given opportunity to learn as much as possible about both, as they respectively become the inspiration and the basis for his future inventions, since only a flying machine can take Nadia to the faraway land she yearns for.  But just because he’s an inventor doesn’t mean he can just whip up deus ex machina devices whenever he needs them...  Unlike that Mary-Sue technology-bender from Big Hero Six, Jean’s inventions are consistent with his familiarity of technology and the materials available at the time, at least until...  Once again, we’ll get to that later.Surprisingly, those two aren’t always the most likeable characters in the cast(YES I KNOW I’M GETTING TO THAT).  I mentioned before that the three villains who attacked Nadia for her jewel go through a heavy amount of development and reveals, and I wasn’t kidding about that...  They have a backstory that will redeem their actions almost immediately after you hear it.  The motivation that led them to the Nautilus changes soon after they take up residence in it, which is a refreshing development compared to the Team Rocket baddies that they almost certainly inspired.  They become more and more relatable as time goes on, and there are points when their roles in the story become even more interesting than that of our two main heroes...  In fact, after one of them pulls off the daring rescue of a young orphan girl named Marie from a Giant Enemy Crab, I could see him instantly becoming a fan favorite.And the English dub, well...  It’s not the worst I’ve ever heard, by far, but it’s also not really up to par with the time period in which it was released.  It was initially dubbed by Streamline Pictures, and if you’re familiar with their work on films like Vampire Hunter D and Wicked city, then you’d probably guess that Nadia is one of their better dubs...  But you\'d be wrong, and being worse than those two titles is saying a lot.  The dub was picked up by ADV films after Streamline put out the first eight episodes, and ADV completely redubbed them, producing much better results...  Mediocre results, yes, but they’re still much better than the awful Streamline dub.  While the ADV version isn’t bad by any means, the only actor that really merits any praise is Meg Bauman in the role of Nadia, who puts forth a much more sincere performance than voice acting heavyweight Wendee Lee.  Actually, that seems to be a common theme of this dub...  A cast full of unknowns who would mostly go on to have very brief careers in the industry did a much better job than a dub full of respected talents and recognized mainstays.It is worth mentioning, though, that Nathan Parsons has gone on to have a moderately successful live action career.  Most recently, he played the role of James in True Blood, which I guess is an interesting bit of trivia.Aside from her, this is a dub that has to grow on you in order to be enjoyed...  There are several characters sporting foreign accents that are fake-sounding, inconsistent and half-committal, with the worst offender being Nathan Parsons in the lead role of Jean.  His attempt at a french accent replaces all of the ‘th’ sounds with ‘s’ and ‘z’ sounds, but aside from that, he barely inflects when he should.  Sanson’s upper-crust accent sounds irritatingly like James from Pokemon(Which makes sense because Grandis sounds like Jessie and Hanson sounds like Meowth, and I don’t think any of this was accidental), and in the role of Elektra, Jennifer Stuart focuses so hard on perfecting her British accent that she barely emotes in the process.  As I said before, it’s not a bad dub, and all the performances do grow on you after a while, but unless you’re a hard core dub fan like I am, there’s really no reason to switch the Japanese version off.So, when I started watching this series, I didn\'t know whether or not I’d be able to review it, and I had Mahoromatic on standby just in case.  The problem was, of course, that there wasn’t really anything to talk about.  It just felt like a really, really well made action adventure/title.  It wasn’t terribly deep, but it was well written, wonderfully paced, and it was able to handle a large, diverse cast while showing respect to all of their differences in background.  There were clashes between the beliefs and ideals of our main characters, especially where Nadia was involved, and there was an admirable level of ambiguity in regards to who was right and who was wrong.  All in all, I didn’t really have anything interesting to say about it, and I was fully ready to review something else...  Until IT happened.  It, which I’ve been putting off until this point in the review.  It, which if you’ve seen the series, you know exactly what It is.See, as the series was airing, it was earning very high ratings...  And deservedly so, all things considered.  Because of this, the network got greedy and hired an entirely new director to extend Nadia’s 26 episode run into a 39 episode run, adding in 12 episodes of filler material just to pad their precious success’s run time.  If you ask any Nadia fans to talk about the series, this story arc will inevitably be one of the first things they bring up, as it’s believed to be the single worst thing about the series.  And having seen it for myself, I can say that this assessment is...  Completely accurate.After some spoiler events occur, Nadia, Jean, Marie and Nadia’s lion cub King wind up stranded on a mysterious island, with no clue where they are, and no hope of summoning any of the ships that they keep seeing out in the distance.  And I’ll say right off the bat that this idea, in and of itself, wasn’t a bad one.  There are a ton of ways this development could have been a great opportunity to further the depth  of the series...  But it wasn’t that at all.  It’s boring, it drags the pace of the series down to a dead crawl, and it does everything in it’s power to rape, dismember and display the remains of everything that was good about the show up until that point.  The animation quality also tanks, looking uglier and cheaper than it ever did before.  No joke...  This show has worse filler material than Naruto and Bleach combined.To be fair, I’m not actually bothered by the fact that this filler arc screws up the original material.  Representing somebody elses work can be an extremely tough thing to do, and I don’t think anybody should ever be vilified for failing to do so.  What bothers me is the outright contempt that the new director, Shinji Higuchi, had for the original material.  You see warning signs right from his first episode, which I believe was 23, when the four children of the series are riding a jettisoned mini-sub to reach the mysterious island.  The sub starts to flood, and Jean drinks all the leaking water, blowing up balloon-like as though he were a freaking Looney Toon, despite the entire series up until that point featuring no such cartoon physics whatsoever.  He then spews the water back up, which in retrospect is pretty good metaphor for the way Higuchi barfed up the rest of Blue Water.Higuchi proclaims early on, loudly and proudly, that he has no respect for the themes and characters that have been unfortunately entrusted to him.  It also becomes clear all too quickly through his treatment of Nadia that he doesn’t possess a very high level of respect or understanding for women or vegetarians, either.  Immediately after setting foot on land, Nadia turns her back on the very idea that her companions may have to eat meat to survive for an extended period of time, as the canned food they brought over with the mini-sub won’t last them very long.  Instead of working this out with him rationally, she dashes off into the jungle like a monkey and goes feral, which ultimately culminates with her stealing his food cans and crushing them under rocks, despite the fact that the island is clearly shown to be covered with fruit bearing trees.  I’m not a vegetarian myself...  Far from it, as the partial pizza I just deposited in my fridge will tell you...  But when I hear Nadia saying things like “I’ll go a week without food and water to prove that I’m a better survivor than you!” it even offends ME.That’s not to say Jean is a whole lot better, though...  With Nadia reaching levels of likeability that make Asuka Langly Soryu look like Belldandy, Jean is left to fill out the role of ‘smug white male,’ a role that would be more subtly played by Seth McFarlane.  It’s Jean’s job in this story arc to be right about everything, sigh and shake his head whenever that angry woman-thing yells at him for no reason, and whip up inventions from the giant piles of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that the island has to offer him in terms of material.And the relationship building that happens between the two is the absolute worst of it.  I don’t consider this much of a spoiler, because it has nothing to do with the plot or ending, so I’m going to describe the moments that begin their relationship in detail...  This is going to be a rough patch, so brace yourself.Nadia finds an old, moldy can of spinach.  She eats it...  Because it looks so much more appealing than any of the plants on the island...  And it gives her a fever.  Not a stomach-ache, but a fever.  She winds up sick in bed with Jean going out to fetch herbal medicine for her...  for the second time in the series, I might add.  But he winds up finding a patch of drug mushrooms, which knock him out, so Marie has to drag him back to the tent.  Later, Nadia wakes up, completely fine, despite receiving no medical care of any kind, and is told by Marie that Jean tried to help her.  She kisses his unconscious lips, and all of a sudden, her attitude completely changes towards him...  All because he tried to nurse her back to health.  Like a fucking pet.Oh, and later, after they finally share a consensual kiss under the stars, she blows up at him for not remembering the kiss she gave him WHILE HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS.In other words, this director has boiled women down to petulant pet dogs...  They bark at you for everything, can’t understand or care about your feelings, and they’ll love you forever if you help them while they’re sick or otherwise vulnerable.  Puke.  Well, at least the relationship development doesn’t wind up mattering, because after they escape the island on a popped balloon that never runs out of air and wind up in Africa, she falls head over heels in love with some sexy African guy, which gives her a new reason to hate Jean.  Like a dog finding a new crotch to smell.  Oh, and then there\'s an episode of music videos.I wish I could just look past this story arc and consider it non-canon, like so many other people do, but I just can’t.  The show does eventually get better, with the animation and writing returning to their former glory around episode 35, but that 12 episode stretch is just unbelievably awful.  I’ve heard people say you should skip most of those episodes, taking the entire viewing experience down to episodes 1-22, 30-31, and 35-39, and while that would successfully cut out all the awful, it doesn’t really improve the experience, it just makes it confusing.  If you follow this list while watching the series for the first time, you’ll wonder about the things happening in those episodes, like ‘when did this character come back,’ ‘how did these characters come to this point,’ and ‘was that material really as bad as I was told?""  Sorry, but those episodes aren’t self contained, and the only way to know how much of an improvement the abridging of the series would be, you’d have to have watched it all the way through at least once...  And by that time, the damage is already done, to both the viewer and the series.Nadia: Secret of Blue Water has been available on VHS in the past, but is currently available on DVD and Blu-ray from Sentai filmworks.  Both sets are available online for quite a bit of money, but at the time of this writing, you can find them as part of the Rightstuf.com holiday sale for 30-40 dollars a piece.  The collection 1 and 2 DVD sets that were put out a few years ago are available for fairly cheap on Ebay, and you could say the same about the individually released DVDs that ADV put out in the early 2000s.  There’s also a series of video games that have never been released stateside, and a movie that I haven’t actually watched yet...  Although I’ve heard some not-too-flattering things about it.  At least I know that it’s a sequel, and not just one of those BS cash grab retellings.I really wanted to give Nadia a high score.  I really, truly did.  If it wasn’t for that filler arc, I’d be calling it one of my favorites of all time with no problem at all.  Without them, Nadia is an exciting adventure title that never slows down or panders to the viewer, offering romance, wonder, and new surprises at every turn.  There’s some sexism at play, but it’s largely innocent, and hits both genders about equally, never turning into straight up misogyny until the dreaded filler arc.  If my initial introduction to this series had been to the episode list that many fans...  And even the original director himself...  considers superior, I may have given this show a 7, but that sadly wasn’t the case.  I can watch it without those episodes, but I can’t review it without those episodes, which is why I’m going to give Nadia: Secret of Blue Water a 5/10. fly her all the way to her home.  Another encounter with their aggravators leaves them stranded out at sea in a floating plane wreck, until they(and their pursuers) are picked up by a futuristic submarine named The Nautilus.  Grand adventure and intriguing mystery await the five of them as they begin their journey to find Nadia’s birthplace and unlock the secrets of the strange blue jewel that she possesses, in a story that was inspired by two of Jules Vernes’ most famous works, and the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki himself!Well, I say that, but this series wasn’t actually made by Miyazaki...  It was his idea, but after some initial financial controversy, the project was picked up by Studio Gainax, a rising animation studio who recently changed their name from Daikon in order to pursue more high profile titles.  After already having a successful movie and OVA series under their belt, Gainax decided to take Nadia as their first televised series, and it was highly successful...  to a fault, even, but we’ll get to that later.Right from the first few minutes of episode 1, Nadia shows you exactly what it’s animation style is going to be.  We’re shown a few frozen panning shots of people enjoying themselves at a science fair, immediately followed up by the impressive CG effect of an electricity machine.  This is indicative of a well allocated budget, where the bulk of the production money will be spent giving motion to scenes that need it the most, while leaving other shots...  Not all of which will be as unimportant as these opening ones...  High and dry.  Thankfully, the budget is managed well enough that those opening shots are the exception rather than the rule, and for the most part, this show does look very good.While it may look cheap and dated, in terms of it’s visual style, keep in mind that Nadia came out back in 1991, when an anime couldn’t look expensive without actually being expensive, due to the limits of the technology of the time...  High frame rate, Miyazaki quality productions were a rare treat, and the lesser spectacles were given a lot more leeway than they are today.  Having said that, as cheap as Nadia can occasionally look, there are a ton of moments in the series that look like they could have come straight out of Ghibli itself...  The visual of Nadia daringly leaping down from the Eiffel Tower to protect her sacred jewel is only a small taste of this, and it will in no way be the last.While most of the character designs may seem generic at first, they grow on you more and more as the characters in question develop throughout the story, and their backstories begin to become unraveled.  There are only two designs that really stand out right from the start...  One of them is Gargoyle and his sinister cult of Neo Atlanteans, the true villains of the series whose actions are unfortunately wrapped in spoilers too heavy to discuss.  The second one is Nadia’s, as she’s wearing what has to be one of the most iconic outfits in Studio Gainax’s long history.  It works very will with the backstory of her being an acrobat and a utility performer at a circus, but if we’re being honest with ourselves, the reason this design has endured for over twenty years in peoples’ memories is because of how revealing it is.  I’m not going to say this is necessarily a bad thing, as I know that women should wear whatever they want to without feeling ashamed, but it does feel kind of strange when you consider that Nadia was wearing a normal looking european dress when we were first introduced to her, implying that that’s how she likes to dress when she’s off the clock...  But for the rest of the series, she seems to prefer skin baring clothing so much that she’ll tear entire pieces off of any other outfit that’s handed to her.  Again, this wouldn’t bother me if it felt like her decision, and not just that of a horny animator.But that’s not the only thing about her that’s made her such a fixture of Gainax’s history...  She’s also, in general, a very likeable and dynamic character.  She’s cautious around new people...  Who wouldn’t be, after working in the circus for so long...  But she’s willing to give them the benefit of the doubt after she becomes more comfortable with them.  Her convictions and principals are also a very strong part of her character.  She’s a pacifist, who’s adamantly against the idea of people killing each other for any reason, and while this belief isn’t portrayed as strongly as it was in Trigun and Fullmetal Alchemist, she also takes it a step further by being a strict vegetarian...  Yes, she believes that animals and people should both be spared from the wrath of greedy humans, and she’s not afraid to act on those beliefs, even when it may cost her the good graces of her peers.  She can be difficult because of this, but she never seems to cross into the territory of becoming unreasonable, at least not until...  We’ll get to that later.Oh, and her baby albino lion has giant balls.  Because...  Yeah, courage, and stuff.  He\'s awesome.Jean isn’t really as complex as his nimble crush, but that’s not to say he’s some bland self-insert character, either...  The darker tones of the series take their toll on his happy-go-lucky outlook, maturing him just like the rest of the cast.  He also has a very distinct personality, even if other personalities sometimes overshadow his in the story.  He’s very open about his feelings for Nadia, that visibly develop from infatuation to actual interpersonal romantic interest throughout the course of the series.  He’s very passionate about technology, and not just about his own inventions, but about the technology of the anachronistic Nautilus submarine, as well.  He’s fascinated by Nadia and the Nautilus, and will take any given opportunity to learn as much as possible about both, as they respectively become the inspiration and the basis for his future inventions, since only a flying machine can take Nadia to the faraway land she yearns for.

If it wasn’t for that filler arc, I’d be calling it one of my favorites of all time with no problem at all.  Without them, Nadia is an exciting adventure title that never slows down or panders to the viewer, offering romance, wonder, and new surprises at every turn.  There’s some sexism at play, but it’s largely innocent, and hits both genders about equally, never turning into straight up misogyny until the dreaded filler arc.  If my initial introduction to this series had been to the episode list that many fans...  And even the original director himself...  considers superior, I may have given this show a 7, but that sadly wasn’t the case.  I can watch it without those episodes, but I can’t review it without those episodes, which is why I’m going to give Nadia: Secret of Blue Water a 5/10.', ""Nadia is a strange and interesting series to talk about. From its reception, you’d find a show that can go from fun to nauseating and amazing to terrible at the drop of a hat after a magnificent early run. From the title and the premise, this show sounds like a wonderfully charming time. It creates this sense of trepidation as to whether you should watch the show, as while there is a lot of joy to be had, some may deem the lengthy yet temporary drop in quality not worth sitting through even for the ⅔ of the show that is worth cherishing.Allow me to...state that for all intents and purposes, now only is this show worth watching, but that a majority of it is some of the most charming and pleasant anime out there. Beyond the main antagonists and Nadia herself, every major character has a distinct level of whimsy and chemistry that make you want nothing more than to join them on their exploits. Absolute standouts include Grandis, Hanson, and Sanson, who apart from wonderful child character Marie, have the loudest and most animated personalities of the entire cast. Even the Nautilus crew manages to be wonderful despite the majority of them being tertiary characters. Along with the pluckiness of Jean, it becomes a glorious treat seeing their frantic exploits, and a blow to the heart to see them in tragedy.This is another of Nadia’s defining strengths, and indeed something that Gainax is known for: its ability to elegantly tiptoe between charming fun and soul-crushing despair. The directing tends to compliment the scenes of sorrow magnificently, courtesy of the legendary Hideaki Anno and even the not-so-legendary Shinji Higuchi when the time calls for it every now and then in Anno’s absence later on. The visuals on display are generally wonderful, with fantastic character designs from Grandis, to Gargoyle, to the iconic design of Nadia and all her wonderful clothes. Each design adds a distinct personality to these characters no matter what they wear, which is yet another of this studio’s most notable strengths. The animation is so vibrant, kinetic, and fluid that chase sequences and all other major action sequences are a sight for sore eyes.All of this is accompanied perfectly by the wonderful score composed by legendary Evangelion and Bleach composer Shiro Sagisu. Apart from the wonderful opening and ending themes, Sagisu composed a fantastic repertoire for this show. It goes from the heartwarming Ashita e, Hope, and Love of Tomorrow, to the gloriously imposing tracks of Neo Atlantis and Gargoyle, the melancholic tunes of Tragedy and Requiem, and the bombastic fun of The Evil Trio and All Purpose Submarine. While not all of these songs are extremely memorable, and even some of the ones listed here aren’t as fantastic as others, the OST is still a real treat forged by a master of his craft.It all blends to create a work that feels as natural and whimsical as anime can be. All of this truly sounds like a wonderful time that no one should pass up, and it is...until the dreaded island arc assaults you like Gargoyle’s ships do to the Nautilus. For whatever production-issue related reason this arc had to go the way it did, there’s no getting around it: this arc sucks! A whopping 12 episodes that have humor that doesn’t fit with the show, several moments where characters are derailed or contradictory for either cheap gags and convenience like Marie in episode 25, King in episode 26, and Nadia in several portions of this arc. Other time, it’s done because the director and screenwriter of this portion of the show seemingly have no idea what to do with them like with Hanson and Sanson. The visuals take a hit as well, with episodes that have the character models seeming off at all times, several moments where there’s a looping image for at least half a minute, and several clip shows. To be fair, the earlier half had some problems with looping footage as well, and two problems that permeate the entire show are hoe the blatant and sometimes incomplete the looping footage is, and how the visuals sometimes get jittery. The island arc sadly does this issue even worse, and had far fewer scenes if interesting direction than what came before or after said portion of the show. It has a hard time finding that delicate tone balance that Gainax is known for as well, and it goes on for far longer than it has any right to. Lastly, while Nadia was certainly a tough character to put up with, her flippant hot and cold personality and more abrasive attitudes towards her peers about anything -especially the killing and consumption of animals- at least made consistent sense. While this arc does flesh out how she got this mindset, it also has her contradict herself constantly for no good reason other than a sheer mishandling of a tricky character that happens to be the focal point of this entire show. It's a truly loathesome experience fromm beginning to end. There’s more I want to say about this arc but I’ll save that it another time.It’s not like the show picks up that much past this point. The final episodes are an absolute mess with glaring holes and moments of characters missing easy opportunities and making obviously wrong decisions, sloppy writing that feels like it assumes that the island arc answered important questions and connected pieces of its narrative to this final stretch better than it actually did. Even the power of willpower is used here, and it’s as cheesy as you’d expect. Character inconsistency also finds itself present within this stretch as well, and as intimidating as the villains are, even this portion of the show fails to make them anything but one-note pretentious “humans are our troubled servants so we must rule over them with an iron fist” characters and puppets. Characters such as Jean find themselves absolutely useless as well, and the final moments of this show are astronomically ridiculous for a variety of damning spoiler-related reasons that range from narratively nonsensical to character-shattering.It’s honestly sad what happened here. Several of the early episodes were wonderful in nearly every way, and even the final episodes managed to instill a sense of scale and raw fun. The vibrant and epically fluid animation led to some brilliant sequences that make this show feel like it would be an absolute classic. It’s just that the show truly started fumbling in terms of its narrative halfway through and then dropped nearly every ball for roughly a third of its run before just becoming a fun yet total mess towards the end. With a bit of retooling and tons of cutting, the dreaded island arc could still be as wonderful as what came before it, and with that same level of retooling, the final episodes could have avoided being as messy as they ended up being while giving more characters a purpose. Regardless, despite how tumultuous the voyage ended up being, it’s still one I’d thoroughly recommend, if only with a few caveats. state that for all intents and purposes, now only is this show worth watching, but that a majority of it is some of the most charming and pleasant anime out there.

Away from the bizarre island arc, it is nearly flawless. I recommend watching the 30th Anniversary fan edit, which converted the 16+ hours series into a trilogy of movies of less than 6 hours. It also treated the major issues like the island arc, and some other continuity errors and fillers in an amazing way. I personally think this is the best way to watch this work of art.The best thing about this masterpiece is the character development and writing. This is by far one of the most enjoyable, relatable and well written cast...of characters in a work of fiction. The music too is amazing. Could be Shiro Sagisu's finest work. of characters in a work of fiction. The music too is amazing. Could be Shiro Sagisu's finest work."", 'Recommendation: A decent series marred by almost 1/3 of the episodes being an irrelevant and terrible filler arc added as a cash grab without the involvement of the original creator. It\'s a respectable adventure series, but you have to skip episodes 23-34 or it will completely ruin your viewing experience.Nadia is, of course, most well-known as Hideaki Anno\'s prior series before Neon Genesis Evangelion.  And the parts of this series that he directed bear some resemblance to themes and ideas that would later be explored more deeply in NGE, especially with regards to religious symbolism.  For most of Anno\'s run on the series,...it\'s a fun, well-paced steampunk adventure series, following Nadia and Jean\'s travels on the submarine Nautilus, and their fight against an advanced alien race called the Atlanteans (or Neo Atlantis).  Some of the world-building is very confused, for example, it seems that the destruction of Atlantis happened just 14 years prior to the start of the series, which takes place in ""real-world"" 19th century France.  However, no one seems to have even noticed that it happened, even though they had supposedly controlled the entire world less than 2 decades ago.  There is simply no explanation for how no one remembers Atlantis\' worldwide dominance within living memory of most of the population of Earth.That is a minor nitpick compared to the cardinal sin of this series, which was Gainax deciding that since the show was doing so well on TV, they would just throw almost an entire season\'s worth of filler episodes straight into the middle of it, bringing the plot to a screeching halt.  Anno, realizing how idiotic this was and how badly it would throw off the rest of the series, refused to take part, so it was handed off to a new director that was clearly unfamiliar with the series and its characters, with the animation outsourced to Korea.  The result is a nearly-unwatchable stretch of episodes 23-34, nicknamed the ""island episodes"", where Jean and Nadia are stranded on a deserted island and nothing happens whatsoever.  It\'s boring, but even worse than that, Nadia acts horrendously out of character and becomes intensely unlikable and even brazenly tries to cheat on Jean as a way of generating some cheap drama.  If you were to tell me that the new director had some sort of grudge against Nadia and planned the entire arc to thoroughly and gleefully assassinate her character, I would probably believe it.  That\'s how bad it is.  And just for good measure, the animation is atrocious for this entire stretch as well.That ends immediately with episode 35, where Anno is back at the helm, and finally gets the story back on track.  You can legitimately skip straight from 22 to 35 without missing a beat, though there is a little bit of context in 31 that may be helpful for the ending.  Anno in fact seems to have designed 35 almost as a repudiation of the island episodes just by making the transition from the pre to post filler arc so seamless that they may as well not have even happened.  The ending to the story is solid, though some parts were rushed and I would have preferred that (SPOILER ALERT) the reveal that the Atlantean-supremacist Gargoyle was actually human would have happened earlier in the story, with his self-loathing serving as context for his behavior, rather than it being thrown in off-hand, almost as one final insult while he\'s already dying.In the end, the story it tells is pretty decent if you skip the filler episodes, but this is the series that will always have the legacy of making Hideaki Anno so depressed and disenchanted with the industry that it heavily influenced the dark tone of NGE, which was originally planned as a sequel to Nadia before having to be rewritten due to Gainax\'s loss of the Nadia IP, several years later.  Nadia probably deserves a higher rating on the merits, but you can\'t simply ignore the island episodes when fairly appraising the series as a whole (though I highly encourage you to ignore them as a viewer). it\'s a fun, well-paced steampunk adventure series, following Nadia and Jean\'s travels on the submarine Nautilus, and their fight against an advanced alien race called the Atlanteans (or Neo Atlantis).

Though inspired by Jules Verne\'s ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" it is a sci-fi adventure that is enjoyable even without any knowledge of Verne\'s story. The show displays Anno\'s talent as a director early in his career. While not as refined as Anno\'s definitive work, Neon Genesis Evangelion, it benefits from Anno\'s mastery over characters and spectacle. Sadly, it also suffers from the director\'s unfortunate tenancy to overemphasize on those strengths and his weakness in theme and plot.The show follows Jean Roque Raltique, a young scatter-brained...inventor who spends most of his time creating half-baked inventions. While in Paris, Jean meets a girl named Nadia and instantly falls in love with her. Nadia, who has no memory of her birth and only a lion cub named King as a friend, is distrustful of other humans, and snubs Jean. As it turns out, she is being hunted by a trio of jewel thieves who are after the Blue Water, a large jewel that is Nadia\'s only link to her past. Jean helps Nadia escape and the two find themselves on the run from the jewel thieves. That is until they find a safe haven on the mysterious submarine The Nautilus, which is under the command of the equally as mysterious Captain Nemo. However, this is just the beginning of an adventure that will not only reveal Nadia\'s past but uncover secrets of the world; as well as start a battle the will hold it\'s fate in the balance.Nadia starts off like a Ghibli film, which isn\'t surprising since the original concept was from Hayao Miyasaki, however Anno makes it his own (even throwing in biblical references near the end). One of the best things about this series is Anno\'s handling of the conflict between the crew of the Nautilus and the Neo-Atlantians, who serve as the series main antagonists. The Neo-Atlantians intend to use their advanced technology to conquer and reign over humans, which they see as inferior. Their leader, Gargoyle, makes a charismatic villain: cool, collected, and sophistic; possessing a silver tongue and merciless sadism. The crew of the Nautilus is a collection of people who have lost their homes to the Neo-Atlantians, and are determined to stop them at any cost. Leading them is Captain Nemo, who while cold and distant, retains a heroic demeanor by sticking to a strong set of morals. The sharp differences between the two factions and their leaders are put to good use and is one of the shows driving factors.In the middle of these two battling sides are Jean and Nadia, two maturing youths with unique views on the world. The enthusiastic young inventor Jean is obsessed with technology, holding it on the highest pedestal and believing it could do no wrong. As the series progresses, he has experiences that force him to question his faith in technology as well as learning what it means to grow up. Meanwhile, Nadia has an affinity for animals and nature, an little trust in other humans. She detests hunting, and condemns anyone who participates in the action, even when it is essential for food. Through her journey, she finds that living on nature alone is more difficult than she believes, and learns to value other people. The development of these two youths is double-edged. It provides some of the series most compelling moments, and provides a good amount of character development for the entire cast, not just Jean and Nadia. However, it can also be very heavy-handed in execution, even preachy at times. On top of that, it eats up time that could be spent developing other parts of the plot. This is especially true for the deserted island arc mid-way through the series.Speaking of the deserted island arc, it is the absolute low point of the series. For a time, the series takes the focus off the conflict between the Nautilus and Neo-Atlantians, and instead focuses on Jean and Nadia\'s relationship. This was not a good decision. For the entirety of this arc, taking up about a fourth of the show\'s run, Jean and Nadia\'s relationship more or less stays the same. Worse yet, there is no sign of the Neo-Atlantians or the Nautilus, making this stretch of episodes unbearably boring. The following arc, in which they travel to Africa, is similarly dull. Sure, there are some discoveries that progress the plot in these episodes, but it is hardly worth all the wasted time.This is all really a shame, because a lot of the story elements unexplored are quite interesting. The back-stories of Nemo, Gargoyle, and Electra (Nemo\'s second in command) are all fascinating, but relatively little time is spent on them. Despite being one of the plots most interesting aspects, Nemo and Gargoyle\'s rivalry barely is explored; which is practically a crime. The growth of the Neo-Atlantians\' technology is also barely explored; they just seem to materialize more powerful weapons out of nowhere with every encounter. Some of these complaints may seem trivial, but given this anime was 39 episodes long, it certainly had enough time to explore them. Instead, it opts to stick with Jean and Nadia having pointless misadventures on a deserted island.While the storytelling quality is not constantly good, the art and animation are at least. The character designs and backgrounds are nothing jaw-dropping (especially by Anno\'s standard), but good none the less, and certainly get the job done. Character designs remain on model throughout the show, and while some backgrounds might be bland, they effectively create a believable world. The animation is quite impressive for a TV anime of its time. Movement is fluid, and is supported by Anno\'s keen sense of cinematography and editing. The spectacular battles between the Nautilus; and a nightmarish sequence which gives insight on why Nadia is so against the killing of animals, notably benefit from Anno\'s direction. The musical score is more or less like any other animated adventure, but is used accordingly and supports the story very effectively. Overall, quite a nice package production-wise.Despite not putting its time to the best use, Nadia is certainly a solid watch. It has a strong, likable cast of characters and an intriguing plot. On top of that it is backed by the talents of a legendary director (albeit, early in his career). If it had not been for the incredibly poor use of time midway through the show, this could have been something great.

But the fact that for a good few episodes in the middle of the show, any trace of character development is killed dead, and any concept of the ongoing plot is put on hold and instead replaced with wacky comedy and pointless filler means that this show is not really anywhere near perfect, or indeed very good.Let\'s start with the good things. It\'s a steampunk sci-fi show featuring the VAs of Noriko Takaya and Anavel Gato in fine form as a rebellious French...boy and a certain very famous submariner of early science fiction. It has an awesome villain who is unafraid to do horrible things and who is highly competent. It has wonderful mechanical designs. It has a great comedy sidekick/recurring antagonist.Episode 15 is a real highlight of the show, not pulling any punches which most shows would. I shan\'t say any more - just watch it. It\'s up there with episode 19 of Rahxephon and the ending of the Garcia arc of Dougram in unexpected seriousness.There are also some wonderful designs which Gainax would later use in other shows. Gargoyle\'s ship variously lends its designs to one of the Angels, the bridge of the Exelion and the NERV HQ. There\'s a gag image floating around the net showing how Nadia and Shinji use the same basic character design. And I\'m sure there are more.The real problem is all the good stuff from the first 22 episodes gets thrown out for a swathe of the show.

Ever since then I've searched for a series that can compare and now, I have found one.Nadia is not MCOG and I still prefer the latter, but in style, plot and characterisations, there are lots of similarities, from an historical setting, world travel and survivors from an ancient civilisation destroyed by war.Nadia is better in terms of characterisation.

Nemo’s vice captain Electra is another story. There’s a climatic scene when Electra loses her marbles because she… has a father complex.

My rating: 5/10.', ""[Warning somewhat spoilerish]Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water ‘starts off’ as a great anime. The first ep was well-done and serves as a perfect example of how to capture your audience's attention from the very beginning.We are quickly introduced to the character Jean, who we understand is an upcoming inventor, he then spots Nadia, a mysterious girl who wants to find out where she comes from. Later, on we meet Grandis and her crew, who will quickly become my favorite characters in the series, and see that they are after the ‘blue water’ that is Nadia’s necklace.So there we go, we have are plot, we...have are mysterious, what should come next is just a bunch of whacky eps of Nadia and Jean trying to get away from Grandis and her crew.Well, not exactly.The plot quickly takes on a interesting turn in later eps when Nadia and the others board a ship called the Nautilus. A story that seemed to be going the way of two kids running away from a trio of goofy adults, quickly turns into a story about war, sacrifice, and what it means to be human.Sooooo,what do I think of it?Well, I’m a sucker for steampunk and while not as heavily focus on in the show as compared to something like Steamboy you can definitely see the elements sprinkled throughout the series. I love the characters and especially their designs, Nadia’s being my favorite. And I love the constant question the show asks about sacrificing and how they presented different scenarios on the topic that has the audience challenging their beliefs with each ep.So, do I think this is a great anime?Weelll...it could have beenIt’s kind of hard for me to talk about why this anime isn’t great because I somewhat disagree with the major reason that a lot of people seem to believe is the shows downfall, and that is eps 23-34 often dubbed as the island and Africa arcs.It is is between these 11 eps that things get kind of weird mainly for the character’s characterization and mainly for Nadia.Nadia, for the most part of the series, is a stubborn, bratty, girl who has a hard time trusting people. This makes sense however, as from ep 1 we can tell she had quite a hard life that had made her become that way. However, in these eps she goes from being bratty to a straight up bitch. The girl seems to be constantly angry with Jean even when there is no conceivable reason she should be. There is even a part in one of the eps that she admit she doesn’t know why she gets angry with him so much.The excuse or reason why these eps are so bad is due to the fact that during this time Anno Hideaki, the original director, handed it over to Shinji Higuchi. There was also the fact that NHK, the channel that was broadcasting it, wanted more eps than they had planned for.These reason are so highly accepted among fans as reasons why this show is bad that many will tell you just to skip theses arc, but this belief honestly frustrates me.You see my major problem with this show is the lack of character development with Nadia and her interaction with other characters. I was okay with Nadia being a difficult character to put up with in the beginning because I hoped that eventually she soften up to the others character, maybe even begin understand their opposing viewpoints but this never happens not even with Jean, her love interest.Also, I would like to take a quick moment to explain how bad Nadia & Jean’s relationship is. It is the second worst anime couple I’ve seen next to Sakura and Sasuke. Nadia and Jean have such strong opposing viewpoints about machines,man, and food that they spend 90% of the show arguing and can’t honestly even say it’s arguing as it just Nadia yelling at Jean  Like during the Nautilus eps, crew members constantly go on about how Nadia and Jean like each other but Nadia is so fucking indifferent/angry with him  that I don’t understand why they would think this other than the fact that she a girl and he’s a boy? Like I get Nadia is the prototype tsundere to Anno’s Asuka but man does her feelings for Jean seem to come out of left field when we do see it. .But getting back to my main point, Nadia lack of character development bothers me because what is the point of Nadia’s character if we never see her actually come to care about the people that surround her. Sure at the end of the series she suddenly cares about her ‘friends’ and ‘humanity’ but this just all comes out fake as we never get to see her grow into this line of thinking. Like even as a plot device Nadia seems to have no purpose in the story.Ignoring the fact that a few filler eps exist isn’t going to fix the fact the Nadia lacks depth. If anything those eps should have been the moments we really saw Nadia characterization develop instead of just exaggerated.In the end, I don’t think Nadia is a bad show like some may think but just a show that could have been great if it weren’t for it’s huge flaws. While I wouldn’t recommend it  to the average anime watcher I do think this would be a much watch for fans of Anno’s work, just because it’s fun to see how some of the stuff in this series can be seen in his later works. have are mysterious, what should come next is just a bunch of whacky eps of Nadia and Jean trying to get away from Grandis and her crew.Well, not exactly.The plot quickly takes on a interesting turn in later eps when Nadia and the others board a ship called the Nautilus.

In total honesty I'm no fan of Miyazaki when it comes to his stories - I watch Ghibli for the animation - so it's no surprise I wasn't the biggest fan of the plot of Nadia. What confused me most was the inclusion of filler (there's an episode where the characters sing 2+ minute songs set to clips from previous episodes), considering it ran to a non-standard 39 episodes and wasn't adapting anything. It's very hard to pin down the story's faults beyond that, though, because the...writing is inconsistent in its quality. It opened well, the episodes on the Nautilus were great, and the finale was fantastic. But anywhere inbetween those three points ranged from passable to annoying. I believe that's partly to do with the characters.CHARACTERS - 4/10Nadia: Secret of Blue Water has some really good characters. It's a shame they're not used very much. Our two protagonists, Nadia and Jean, are downright insufferable people. Nadia is preachy and needlessly confrontational, whereas Jean doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut about certain topics. The crew of the Nautilus and others serve a valuable role in keeping those two in check and teaching them how to not be awful to each other. Unfortunately the primary characters don't have near as much charm as the tertiary ones.VISUALS - 8/10I've heard the animation was kind of stellar by 1990's standards, but I haven't seen much from that time period, so I wouldn't know. Where Gainax earns this 8/10 from me is in the designs and the use of color in scenes. Most everything is incredibly vibrant, but by no means garrish or tacky. This also contrasts well with their decision to use monochrome at some points in darker locations and more intense scenes. Character designs were all readable and memorable, and settings reminded me of Steven Universe quite often.AUDIO - 10/10This anime has one of my favorite anime OSTs. It has the kind of jazzy feel you'd typically expect from a series of this time period, with plenty of memorable themes throughout. Sound effects were also masterfully done, adding just the right ambiance to scenes. This coming from somebody who normally doesn't pay much mind to sound design. As far as voice acting goes, I watched the sub because the dub was terrible, but I'm not an authority on the sub's quality since I don't speak Japanese. It seemed pretty good at the very least.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL - 6/10On the whole I liked this show more than I disliked it, but I would by no means recommend it. writing is inconsistent in its quality.

Those fond of \'Neon Genesis Evangelion\', in particular, owe it to themselves to watch it because Nadia is the anime that directly influenced Evangelion; in the form of director Hideaki Anno\'s very own version of a much loved Ghibli classic.The reason Nadia holds such influence is - partly - because the stress of working on the series was what lead to Anno\'s (in)famous four-year period of depression, which he would later channel into a sort of negative creativity in the form of THE psychological breakdown...anime; Evangelion. The two share the same animation studio, Gainax, and a considerable amount of key staff, including Anno himself, the character designer (Sadamoto) and composer (Sagisu). So, thematically and aesthetically, there are NUMEROUS similarities.Perhaps even more interestingly, Anno started out as an animator by impressing Hayao Miyazaki... and it was Miyazaki that came up with the original idea for Nadia, based on Jules Verne\'s \'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\', which he himself would later transform into \'Laputa: Castle in the Sky\'. Nadia could be described as Anno\'s version of Laputa; complete with his own brand of characterisation where very relatable, human failings become part of lovable characters.Nadia begins in disarmingly lighthearted fashion. Set during 1889, the series opens with an aviation fair in Paris. The titular heroine, Nadia, encounters the male lead, Jean (a young French inventor), whilst working for a traveling circus troupe with her pet lion and series mascot, King. Jean falls in love at first sight and saves Nadia from comical, almost Team Rocket-esque \'villains\' that later become endearing.Then begins a world spanning adventure that starts out fun-filled. Along the way, an adorable ""This is no fun!"" young girl called Marie forms a close bond with Nadia, under surprisingly tragic circumstances. The tone then shifts, becoming darker, starting with the first encounter with the series enigmatic masked villain, Gargoyle. An organisation known as \'Neo Atlantis\' controls the world from the shadows, using advanced technology from ancient Atlantis, and is pursuing Nadia for the mysterious \'Blue Water\' pendant she possesses. The lead duo eventually end up as crew members on the futuristic submarine Nautilus and are forced to grow up quickly due to the crew having but one mission: to destroy Neo Atlantis. They are all that stands between Gargoyle and world domination. The series retains a lighthearted edge, but children having to confront the harsh realities of adult life after becoming involved with military chain of command is undeniably similar to Evangelion.Before the small matter of Nadia-to-Evangelion influences, what made Nadia controversial to the point of sending Anno into the pits of depression and ALMOST ruined the series? For starters, there was a so-called movie sequel, which Anno and the original staff did not work on and is SO TERRIBLE people pretend it does not exist. And the TV series contains its very own non-Anno horror show. Anno only wrote/directed 26-29 episodes. Episodes 23-34 are the ultimate anime evil that Bleach/Naruto fans will be all too familiar with: FILLERS. The tone shifted to deserted island \'comedy\' (complete with cartoonish exaggerations such as Jean filling up with water like a balloon)... bizarrely RIGHT AFTER the series reached its darkest depths. Every character trait was reduced to the most juvenile of levels as the series went in mind-numbing circles. Worse, Nadia\'s character did a 180 and was butchered to the point she regressed from having an understandably naive vegetarian viewpoint... to deciding she would live only with nature; later begging for animals AND FISH to save her. She also stole food after forcing Jean to build a camp on his own since ""she hates science"" and just outright started treating him terribly, out of nowhere.The change in writing and direction was SO BLATANT that, when Anno resumed after the fillers ended, he ignored what came before. The worst involved Jean getting high on mushrooms and Nadia deciding she liked some random episodic boy more than Jean; completing her character self-destruction. And if you think the fillers are ok to begin with, believe me: when the second deserted island arrives, head -> wall.Ignoring the filler HELL, though, Nadia is an excellent character and FAR from your typical anime heroine. For one, she is black and of African descent. For two, she is best described as the prototype tsundere for Evangelion\'s Asuka. A more human, less ANIME tsundere, if you will. What is most striking about Anno\'s work is that he clearly values characterisation above all else (almost in complete contrast to Miyazaki).Anno\'s female characters in particular come across so strongly one would assume they were created by a woman. Nadia is no exception to this. Her love interest and companion, Jean, is no Shinji Ikari but she challenges him at every turn none the less with her dominant, strong-willed personality. Her jealousy over Jean unwittingly irking her by talking to other females; her hypocrisy over being a vegetarian / arguing with Jean over eating meat, whilst not minding her pet eating meat... there is a distinctly female charm about her \'evil eye\' glares and the natural inconsistency between how she treats Jean and others that make her flaws as a person believable; reminding me of Kyoko from Maison Ikkoku. As I have always said, a flawed character is a human character. Nadia\'s maternal bond with a young girl, Marie, being reflected in Marie copying her comments about males and how she mimics another female character\'s comments about the bickering \'husband and wife\' relationship between Nadia and Jean was priceless.Other characters also clearly would later have an influence on Evangelion. Captain Nemo\'s unreadable persona in a military position and actions that traumatise adolescent characters is reminiscent of Gendo Ikari. Nemo\'s First Officer, Electra, and her relationship with Nemo has a touch of Misato Kusanagi\'s father complex issues, paired with Ritsuko\'s one-sided love seen in Evangelion. And Electra also shared a bond with Jean similar to that of Misato and Shinji. Even moving away from the characterisation and onto more superficial aspects, the submarine battles complete with radar tension and the more serious soundtrack pieces give off a distinct Evangelion vibe. One such track was even later remixed and reused in \'Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo\'!The version I (re)watched was Animatsu\'s UK Blu-ray release of Nadia, and the remastered high-definition video quality truly impresses. Seeing Sadamoto\'s distinctive, charming \'old school\' art style in an image so sharp that the dirt on the anime cels clearly shows, paired with colours so vibrant, made it a joy to watch. At first I feared the slight \'jittering\' of the image occasionally visible and what I assumed to be a related \'vibrating edge-shadow\' issue were caused by the remastering process, but no: I checked my old ADV DVDs, and just about visible under the blurriness, it had the same effect. The video quality is just now so vivid I am able to notice those almost insignificant niggles. I did notice some issues during the filler episodes (a few brief parts not appearing remastered and colour bleeding), but nothing too terrible. Overall, it is up there with Cowboy Bebop\'s remaster; only let down by Nadia having a much smaller budget than that series.The ONE disappointing aspect of Nadia in terms of audio is the old ADV English dub. It is one of THOSE older anime dubs where the cast read stiffly off the script, sounding painfully wooden. Jean in particular will make or break the dub for viewers: he speaks with a thick/fake French accent... whilst no-one else bothers with similarly totally overdone accents in what is a multicultural anime. Nadia certainly does not sound African. A bad idea, that. The dub cast either only have Nadia on their resume - still - or few to no other roles. And it is easy to see why. Whilst it was a nice touch to cast child actors to voice child characters, it was not a particularly wise move. Compare them against the array of Japanese talent, such as Noriko Hidaka as Jean and Akio Ootsuka as Nemo, and the writing is on the wall. Just the manner in which Nadia\'s voice actress in Japanese can say Jean\'s name with such tender affection, then seconds later convey almost venomous anger... the difference in range is night and day. I STRONGLY recommend watching in Japanese.In summary, Nadia offers a charming adventure, grounded by Anno\'s human-relatable characters. The tone and pacing is initially inconsistent - only showing its darker edge around episode five - but, ignoring the fillers that weigh the series down like an anchor, there is honestly little to complain about. Jean did become less important as the series went on, in spite of some decent boy-to-man maturity--he simply had no relevance to the plot outside of his relationship with Nadia. Due to this, rather than Jean, my favourite male character was the villain, Gargoyle: his despicable, cunning nature was amplified tenfold by the mystery of a man that ALWAYS wore a mask. Truly a hate-worthy villain with a distinctively arrogant voice; never failing to entertain, much like the show itself.Buy it, watch it and make it last: they do not make anime like this anymore. anime; Evangelion. The two share the same animation studio, Gainax, and a considerable amount of key staff, including Anno himself, the character designer (Sadamoto) and composer (Sagisu). So, thematically and aesthetically, there are NUMEROUS similarities.Perhaps even more interestingly, Anno started out as an animator by impressing Hayao Miyazaki... and it was Miyazaki that came up with the original idea for Nadia, based on Jules Verne\'s \'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\', which he himself would later transform into \'Laputa: Castle in the Sky\'. Nadia could be described as Anno\'s version of Laputa; complete with his own brand of characterisation where very relatable, human failings become part of lovable characters.Nadia begins in disarmingly lighthearted fashion. Set during 1889, the series opens with an aviation fair in Paris. The titular heroine, Nadia, encounters the male lead, Jean (a young French inventor), whilst working for a traveling circus troupe with her pet lion and series mascot, King. Jean falls in love at first sight and saves Nadia from comical, almost Team Rocket-esque \'villains\' that later become endearing.Then begins a world spanning adventure that starts out fun-filled. Along the way, an adorable ""This is no fun!"" young girl called Marie forms a close bond with Nadia, under surprisingly tragic circumstances. The tone then shifts, becoming darker, starting with the first encounter with the series enigmatic masked villain, Gargoyle. An organisation known as \'Neo Atlantis\' controls the world from the shadows, using advanced technology from ancient Atlantis, and is pursuing Nadia for the mysterious \'Blue Water\' pendant she possesses.

Enter Jean Ratlique a young french inventor whose dream is to be the first person to make an actual flying aircraft. Jean along with his uncle enter a sort of flying/gliding competition, until Jean falls in love at first sight with a dark skinned girl who walked passed by. Jean leaves his project...in order to strike up a conversation with her, until a group reminiscent of team rocket intrudes in order to steal a blue jewel around the girl's neck. The two kids are able to escape, and jean later figures out that the girl is a circus performer by the name of Nadia. After that the show enters more or less a cat and mouse chase as Jean and Nadia try to outrun the jewel thieves which leads to a series of circumstances where Jean and Nadia and later the jewel thieves and some girl find themselves aboard a submarine commanded by the mysterious captain Nemo. They also find out about a group called the neo-atlanteans who are in a secret war against Nemo as well wanting to capture Nadia and her Jewel for mysterious reasons.The beginning of the anime was really great as the show would take you on an amazing adventure story. The story went on a decent but brisk pace, and there was always something to be had in each episode. Since the characters were mostly stuck in a submarine most of the time there was time to learn more about the characters and introduce the characters manning the submarine, as well for the characters to grow relationships among each other. Especially for others to deepen their relationship which made for a decently made subplot. Along the way Nadia learns more about herself until they are cornered by the neo-atlanteans which leads to the island episodes.The island and Africa episodes while not really that BAD were pretty much dull. The pacing for the show was put on a stand still and had the characters meandering around and doing absurd things. It takes a lot of suspension of disbelief for all the things that occur during these episodes from the way the characters act as will as the stories that happened during these episodes. Of course the island episodes did have some moments, but they were few and far between to matter. It’s rather odd to consider these fillers even though they are since almost nothing really happens and anything that did develop or happens was completely forgotten and thrown to the side as if nothing really happened. However that’s not what’s odd, what is odd is that these episodes could have had importance to segway into the final episodes because that’s exactly what it did, but due to its bad execution that leads them to become mostly pointless and thus fillersWhile the island episodes while the worst part of the anime I believe the worst thing they did was hamper the final episodes. Since these were the episodes that were meant to segway into the final part due to how long and pointless they were, the final episodes had to speed things up leading to what felt like a rushed ending. While the show was back to how it was in the first dozen episodes, with so little time on there hand now they just had to make stuff happen. While they were able to make it look spectacular and end the show decently, i believe that if given more time they could have made it better.To put it short the characters in the show were good. They all had amazing and diverse personalities, they are all full of life, enjoyable to watch, and well rounded. However since there are so many of them i will talk about the main duo.Jean our main character of the show is a genius inventor who is mostly a optimistic and friendly person. Due to being an inventor he always strives to be smarter and more concentrated on his work which leads to him not paying attention to those around him. Also due to his love the Nadia he is very caring about her but also due to his nice nature is also caring of everyone else.Nadia who is the main heroine of the anime while just as good as the other characters is also the most dynamic among them due to her part in the story. Due to her past she has a hard time trusting other people as well as the murder of living things even for consumption which she makes very clear early on, although she later on comes to accept that but still remains a vegetarian. Due to her off placed mistrust in people she comes off as a stubborn person making it difficult sometimes to express her feeling out right.However just like the story; the characters also take a toll during the island episodes. They start acting out of character, the way they are portrayed and the way they react are horrible, and for the most part they pretty much regress as character. There are still nice moments, but just like the in the story it's few and far between, and in the end doesn’t really matter.from the start of the anime you can already tell how the art and animation for the show will be for the rest of the show. The animation for the show are placed in parts needed the most while unnecessary parts were still images. While it looks bad, due to how they were chosen the anime pretty much ended up looking and moving good. There were still some reused clips at times but they were mostly placed far between each other to matter. The character design while not looking the best and sometimes looking dated were easy to get used to and allowed for the characters to be very expressive. There was never really alot of detail put in the shows art, but they were able to make it work. And just like the rest of the anime the island episodes really did hamper the anime as the way the anime was portrayed was more slap-stick and wacky, and while the anime did look like that it never try to be any of that.I only watched the english dub, but i did listen to the english dub, and i wouldn’t mind going back and watching it in english since it does sound decent enough to listen to. As for the voice acting in the japanese dub, it was pretty good. Every voice sounded in character and each voice sounded unique. The soundtrack for the anime was good as well which sounded mostly adventures since this is mostly an adventure anime. They also were able to use silence in the show very well for the more dramatic moments.I really did enjoy this anime and i really want to say that it’s a good anime since it started off as an amazing adventure with an amazing and interesting cast. But man those island episodes and how they affected the final episodes really put a dent on this anime. Nonetheless this anime is still a fun ride worth experiencing. in order to strike up a conversation with her, until a group reminiscent of team rocket intrudes in order to steal a blue jewel around the girl's neck.

I was certain Nadia: Secret of Blue Water would become one of my all time favorite series at an 8/10 or possibly 9/10 score until about the halfway point where the directors just threw in about ten episodes of superfluous and boring character interactions just to stall on keeping the plot going, that largely being what killed this for me along with the fact that it\'s chock full of blatant animation errors, among other things I\'ll get into. But it certainly has some very redeeming qualities.Nadia\'s story is the strong point. It\'s...definitely one of the best stories I\'ve ever seen in a series, up to a point. You may or may not know already that it loosely follows the plot of Jules Verne\'s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but it\'s mostly an original work. I personally consider it to be part of a trilogy along with Gunbuster and Evangelion because they\'re all very similar series, Nadia is of course the most obscure of the bunch but each of them share some of their themes and it\'s noticeable after seeing them all.Everything up to them is fantastic, but the two story arcs that ""killed"" the show are one set on a remote island that feels kind of like some fever dream version of Gilligan\'s Island with three kids and a baby lion. Most of the interesting characters totally absent here and the events leading up to this are mostly ignored. The episodes are pretty confusing and shockingly dumb. This arc is immediately followed by some inexcusably messy venture into some African village that thinks a can of food is a pillar of silver gifted to them by God or something. But it gets back to kicking ass in just the final 4 or 5 episodes, thankfully.The animation is mostly well done on its low budget but some episodes certainly suffer a lot, most of the details are typically conveyed in a very minimal fashion and whenever there is an error it\'s especially difficult to look at. One thing I couldn\'t get out of my mind even after I finished watching the show is a part where a character\'s entire forearm is see-through. Chilling.There are also lots of good characters in the show. The Nautilus crew is well fleshed out and the Gratan team is probably Gainax\'s first major endeavor into GAR characters. The Neo-Atlantis bad guy Gargoyle is really simple in terms of motives and personality but he\'s still kind of cool. The eponymous Nadia and Jean (the kid that orbits her) are unfortunately not among the good characters in the show. Nadia\'s personality and characterization, while you eventually come to understand it, is way too erratic. Though her boyfriend isn\'t too bad in terms of personality, Jean\'s knack for inventing is kind of abused as an unrealistic deus-ex-machina that just leaves you wondering if it\'s really possible for a 15 year old in the year 1889 to invent so many miracle machines. He makes like 20 planes across the series and even a functioning shower on a remote island composed of scraps. Not very plausible.The last good thing I can say about Nadia is that almost all of the soundtracks are bangers and they\'re very memorable, but I don\'t really know what else to say about that.Overall, if you are a fan of Gainax and Anno, or you\'re interested in something with a fantastic story and don\'t mind it having very few other merits, definitely go ahead and check it out. Otherwise maybe put it on hold or stay away from it. definitely one of the best stories I\'ve ever seen in a series, up to a point.

Otherwise maybe put it on hold or stay away from it.', 'Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water is one of anime\'s greatest kept secrets and a hidden gem (no pun intended) for most modern anime viewers. While I wouldn\'t say it\'s based off of 20,000 leagues under the sea, it certainly does take inspiration (Nemo) and pay homage (Jean) to many of Jules Verne\'s works. Most importantly, it\'s accurately captures Verne\'s spirit of adventure that would be expanded upon in Hiyao Miyazaki\'s latter works. It was basically Gurren Lagann before Gurren Lagann. Yet, I wouldn\'t blame anyone for rating this show a flat 7. Why?Well, while the first 23 episodes and last 5 episodes made up...one of the greatest adventure animes I\'ve ever seen, episodes 24 through 34 made up for one of the worst adventure animes I\'ve ever seen. It was almost as if the creator of episodes 23 through 34 (yes they did make 1 episode right) didn\'t even watch any of the preceding 22 episodes of the series, but instead felt content to, rather than tell a compelling story, preach about the inferiority of women. They are so preachy with their sexism, if you were a fan of e preceding 22 episodes, then it will straight up piss you off.Of course, that is in fact what happened. While Hiyao Miyazaki had creative control over a majority of the story, because production was slow, Gainex director Higuchi Anno asked his friend Shinji Higuchi (who hadn\'t seen the show) to take over episodes 23 through 34. You know, Shinji Higuchi, the genius behind the Vandread series? No wait, genius isn\'t the right word. No, braindead baffoon? Yes. The braindead baffoon behind the Vandread series, you know him right? He also worked as an assistant on Evangelion, which, if you\'re wondering where all the sexism and hatred for women in Evangelion came from, it\'s this guy. No, Shinji, Nadia isn\'t incompetent, you are.I can sit here for hours and write everything wrong with those episodes, but I don\'t have that kind of time. So here\'s a sample platter of everything wrong with just episode 24. By the way, this doesn\'t include the fact that it was horribly directed and had no plot.1. Nadia isn\'t Candian nor is she Tarzan.2. Nadia doesn\'t have superhuman strength.3. Marie doesn\'t think of Nadia as her sister, she thinks of her as her mother.4. Nadia doesn\'t hate machines because ""it\'s against nature,"" she associates machines with Gargoyle\'s weapons, which she has seen been used to cause mass destruction and kill her friends, which causes her to be rationally cautious of machines that specifically destroy. In fact, she has time and time again shown her appreciation for machines that don\'t kill people such as Jean\'s various aircrafts, despite the fact that they aways fail. And being cautious of machines that can kill and destroy is how a sane person would think. I mean, just look at the atomic bomb.5. Nadia doesn\'t hate Jean, or hate that he uses machines, she hates that Jean thinks machines are the solution to everything, because she knows where that will lead.6. A can opener is not a machine. Even if it was, why wouldn\'t she just use King to open the cans like everyone else?7. Nadia has always shown herself to be a logical person, she wouldn\'t try to ask fish to save her.8. Nadia wouldn\'t destroy their entire supply of food to prove a point.9. Nadia wouldn\'t lecture Jean about eating meat then few episodes later ask him to create a machine to kill mosquitos.10. Nadia wouldn\'t impose her vegetarian beliefs onto others. She hadn\'t done that thus far and even buys and feeds meat to King.11. Nadia has never quarreled with Marie, so there\'s no reason why Marie would think that of her.12. Jean shouldn\'t have any knowledge of chopsticks, as he\'s never been to Asia, nor has he mentioned anything about Asia up to this point. The fact that he even wants to use chopsticks in the first place just goes to show that not only is Higuchi a sexist, he\'s also a patronizing Japanese nationalist. I don\'t hate Japanese nationalists. I just hate shows like Gate: JDSF that appeal to a viewer\'s gut or pride rather than his mind or heart. It\'s a big deal when this show has spend the previous 20+ episodes showing off it\'s vast knowledge of western culture, which Higuchi obviously knows nothing about (honestly, why did he even take this job?). By the way, I\'m Asian, and I was born and raised in Asia. But nobody, if given the choice as a kid would use chopsticks over forks. I\'m sorry, but that\'s just stupid.13. Most importantly, Nadia is the main character of this story, not Jean. No one cared when we found out what happened to Jean\'s father. Finding out what happened to Nadia\'s father was literally the climax of the entire anime. So then, why would you repeatedly throw your main character under the bus and make her look like a bimbo who should just stay in the kitchen, who wouldn\'t be able to survive without someone there to hand-feed her, and should come to bed when it\'s time for a good shag?But I digress, those unbelievably stupid Shinji Higuchi episode aside, Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water is a very good show. The music, while sparse, is terrific. The characters are very enjoyable. There\'s a surprising amount of adult themes in this anime, despite it being presumably marketed to kids. It definitely doesn\'t talk down to you like those Higuchi episodes do. It\'s smart. It\'s fun. It\'s fast paced, and something happens in every episode. It does a very good job of switching it up every now and then to keep things fresh, not unlike Gurren Lagann. There are a few plotholes, like how everyone seems to be able to see into the future and no one questions this. But there\'s a surprising amount of high-level storytelling techniques here. Like how every episode begins with a narrator asking a question about what the mysterious blue water gem can do. It does pretty much nothing for the vast majority of the show. But when it finally does something, the fact that the narrator talked asked about it all this time makes it not seem like a deus ex machina at all, even though it otherwise would definitely have been.So yes, it\'s definitely worth a watch. But if you\'re going to watch I have two pointers for you. First, skip episodes 24 through 29, then 31 through 34. These episodes will honestly make you hate this show. Second, skip the intros, or if you want to listen to the music, just don\'t watch the intros, because it contains a lot of spoilers for what will happen in the episode. one of the greatest adventure animes I\'ve ever seen, episodes 24 through 34 made up for one of the worst adventure animes I\'ve ever seen. It was almost as if the creator of episodes 23 through 34 (yes they did make 1 episode right) didn\'t even watch any of the preceding 22 episodes of the series, but instead felt content to, rather than tell a compelling story, preach about the inferiority of women. They are so preachy with their sexism, if you were a fan of e preceding 22 episodes, then it will straight up piss you off.Of course, that is in fact what happened.

It's a Gainax show directed by Anno after all. I've definitely seen Jean, Nadia and Captain Nemo around the internet for well over a decade. As some of the other reviews here indicate, At less than 50k viewers, it is a hidden gem in the Gainax Library.*Will contain some minor spoilers*This is one of the better adventure show's I've seen. I know it's an aspect of the anime media to have over arcing storylines. However, this show does such a good job at stitching the end of one episode right where...the next one begins. The early pacing of the show is brisk. Boy meets girl being chased by some thieves. Boy shows girl flying contraption, but the two crash in the ocean. Boy and girl are rescued by the navy, that gets into a fight with a sea monster. It's just BOOM, BOOM, BOOM every ep. I have seen some complaints about how the show slows down a bit in the middle. I actually thought this was a good character building and relationship building arc..The art is surprisingly good for a show from the early 90s. Actually when I was watching the first couple ep., I thought that it looked like an 80s show only to find out that it was from 1990. The animation can be hit or miss. There is some nice sakuga here and there. There is also a lot of squash and stretch animation. Then there are times when the same animation is used for about a minute. So it is a mixed basket.The sound is fine. The OP and ED are very 90s style. Sound effects are good enough. I watched the English dub of this and my goodness. This is a very good dub. Most of the main cast really give it their all with emotion and accents. There is the occasional flat performance, but for the most part it's good.The main cast of characters are incredible and well fleshed out. Not just Jean and Nadia. Captain Nemo, Marie and others get a lot of story. The previously mentioned thieves, start the show as Team Rocket. (even though they predate them by a few years) Then by the time we get to the 8th or so ep., they've joined the main group of good guys and later become parental figures for the Jean and Nadia. Like, imagine if Team Rocket joined Ash and Misty instead of Brock and help mentor the two children. It was amazing to watch those characters grow over the series.Overall, yeah easy recommendation. Some aspects might have not aged very well, but this is still and excellent watch. the next one begins. The early pacing of the show is brisk. Boy meets girl being chased by some thieves.

However, its masterful beginning leads into a clumsy, seemingly neverending sea of filler, where character development occurs only to be reversed the next episode. It is clear that the additional episodes requested due to the show's success were unnecessary and only by the very end does it regain the tone and overall engagement its beginning has.I will mostly discuss the filler in this review. At first, I was surprised that it wasn't too bad, and thought that people on here and otherwise...were just over exaggerating. Lots of people just don't like when a show slows down or gets lighthearted for a bit. Nadia's stranded island arc is definitely not the worst offender of the filler, and at quite a few points isn't filler at all, progressing the story, both in regards to plot and the romance of Jean and Nadia. But its climax leads not into the final episodes, but more of the filler we just left behind, this time with a lazy, emotion baiting, frustrating love-triangle that makes the audience question Jean and Nadia in the first place. The crux of the issue is that it undoes climatic, romantic developments made during the island arc and leads us to believe Nadia does not care whatsoever for Jean, which lingers over the show's finale. The first half of the show gives us a clear picture of the intended development. Jean is persistent, Nadia is skeptical, they butt heads, but persistence pays off, and Nadia as a result becomes a warmer, more likable person. The filler arcs depict Nadia as unchanging, obnoxious, and make her easy to dislike, dampening the sacrifices she makes at the very end for Jean's sake.I would recommend that if you do watch Nadia, you see about skipping some of the filler episodes. I would recommend jumping from the climax of the island arc to the 35th episode. This avoids the Africa arc and keeps the mystery and suspense going, while keeping intact Nadia and Jean's relationship. were just over exaggerating.

The anime is based on the novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. The story concept was made by Hayao Miyazaki, and it was produced by studio Gainax and directed by Hideaki Anno (Neon Genesis Evangelion.)In 1889, the world is on the pinnacle of great discoveries in technology. We\'re introduced to Jean Roque Ratlique. He\'s a young inventor who, together with his grandfather, are joining a competition in order to make a flying machine. Jean see\'s a...girl that he takes a fancy to at first sight and ends up following her. It turns out that this girl named Nadia is being chased by some strange people who are trying to take the gem hanging around her neck from her. Jean ends up ""saving"" Nadia from them, but neither of them has any idea of what\'s in store for them going forward. Everything from submarines to Neo-Atlantis and Gargoyle, it all seems like too much for two kids to handle.The two most important characters to the story are Jean and Nadia. Jean is a young inventor from Le Havre who\'s in love with machines and technology. Nadia is a dark skinned girl who knows little about her past. She\'s basically been working for a circus her entire life and doesn\'t even know where she\'s from, who her parents are, or even when her birthday is. Because of the color of her skin she is certain that she has to be from Africa, and Jean is trying to help her get to Africa.Other important characters are Captain Nemo. The captain of a submarine that ends up rescuing Jean and Nadia. And Gargoyle who is the main bad guy of the series.The animation in this show follows what seems to be Anno\'s usual pattern. It doesn\'t look half bad, but the animation takes a turn for the worse towards the second half of the show, and even more so towards the end. Despite this, the show doesn\'t really look bad, just not as good as it could have looked.Overall this show was a lot of fun to watch. I didn\'t know much about this going into it, so I was not sure what to expect, but it got off to a strong start. The show ended up lulling a bit in the middle which I wasn\'t too happy about, but then it gets weird. I was not expecting it to get as weird as it did, but I was not against it. It wasn\'t just Jean that was tripping on shrooms during this show. Then it all came to an ending that I enjoyed quite a lot. They decided to put just a tiny bit too much into the last episode in my opinion, which made some things feel a bit forced, but even so the ending was solid. I really enjoyed this show and I would recommend anyone to check it out. It might not be your cup of tea, but I still think it\'s worth checking out. girl that he takes a fancy to at first sight and ends up following her.

This deviation spans roughly 10 episodes, constituting approximately a quarter of the entire anime, which somewhat detracts from the overall experience. Setting that aside, the narrative is reasonably well-crafted, albeit with a few plot holes and an increasing reliance on exposition in the later episodes. The characters, while relatively straightforward, are overshadowed by the anime's heavy thematic emphasis. The initial episodes exude a strong sense of adventure, harmonizing effectively with the more dramatic and action-driven scenes in the conclusion. Overall, Fushigi no...Umi no Nadia is a predominantly good anime, yet the jarring shift in direction ultimately leaves the conclusion somewhat unsatisfying.

Everything, down to the lighting, has his fingerprints all over it, and, most importantly, the writing is filled with his excellent quality...theatrical speeches and religious reference, and noticeably well written women.For the most part, Nadia is practically perfect, being consistent in most every aspect, and has a wonderful pacing and tight control of its tone with smooth transition from a lighthearted adventure to a dark and brooding sci-fi. Unfortunately, the infamous Island Arc really is as bad as it's made out to be, taking up about 1/3rd of the total episode count. Before and after it, the show is immaculate, but getting through the Islands Arc, with its noticeable downgrade in everything that makes the series enjoyable, can be a very laborious experience that almost makes you forget why Nadia is so good in the first place.

I'll start with what's good about the anime since there's a lot great about it. Nadia: Secret of the blue water is very fast paced and exciting. The roller coaster of emotion this anime takes you on is amazing, one episode your having a blast and laughing it up with the hilarious and dynamic cast, the next you feel like bawling your eyes out. The action in this anime is also top tier, it's not listed in the genres in MAL but I would honestly call this a mecha,...with it's intense submarine battles.The art in this anime is fantastic (especially in non filler episodes, but we'll get to that later). The landscapes are beautiful, and the character design is top notch. I especially like Jean and Captain Nemo's design. The music is another high point in the series with great tracks, some somber and slow, and others bombastic and really add to the grandiose battles.The plot and characters is where this anime shines the most, the plot instantly grasps you with the mystery of the blue water and takes hold of you for the entire series, constantly hanging it over your head. But the plot really kicks into gear when the main characters are picked up by captain Nemo in the Nautilus. The characters are one of my favorite parts of the show, as to be expected from Anno they are complex and very well written characters. The dynamic between characters is a very strong point as well, Nadia and Nemo's relationship is interesting and fun to watch develop. The Grandis gang is so fun to watch too, but they fumbled the ending with the last minute of the show with Sanson, it's not enough to really ruin the character but it is quite disappointing.The elephant in the room here when it comes to the negatives of the show is it's filler, which I skipped and will always skip filler no matter the show. However skipping the filler also doesn't feel like a great option because you're left a little confused on how they got to where they are. But I just pressed on and it was fine, but it definitely takes away from the show a little, and is the main contributor to my rating being 9/10 instead of a 10. One more thing I slightly disliked about the anime is I think the ending just moves a tad bit too fast. It's still a really great ending but I wish some things were drawn out a little more. But that being said my complaints are minute, especially compared to the positives of the show which greatly outshine the negatives.I cannot recommend this anime enough. Especially if you like evangelion, since eva was planned to be a sequel to this show but couldn't attain the rights so they had to reskin it. It's also composed by Shiro SAGISU so you know the soundtrack is great if you've seen eva. I recommend skipping the filler as well, and continue watching until the end because it is well worth the small stumble for that amazing ending. with it's intense submarine battles.The art in this anime is fantastic (especially in non filler episodes, but we'll get to that later).

But that being said my complaints are minute, especially compared to the positives of the show which greatly outshine the negatives.I cannot recommend this anime enough. Especially if you like evangelion, since eva was planned to be a sequel to this show but couldn't attain the rights so they had to reskin it. It's also composed by Shiro SAGISU so you know the soundtrack is great if you've seen eva. I recommend skipping the filler as well, and continue watching until the end because it is well worth the small stumble for that amazing ending."", 'This series i expected alot of adventures discovering about Nadia past with some mild drama, but there was alot of filler episode which took like 80% of show. I would be generous and give this 6/10 cuz of some characters and which is not Nadia even tho she is title of this anime. She forgotten where she came , and the one helping her is the boy who loves her no matter what and does anything to help her archieve her goal of remembering who she is or what she is responsible for.Nadia is probably in top worst characters i saw in animes. First of...all, she despise people who kill animals to eat them and even want to force them not to eat it cuz of her ideals she puts on people, whenever its hard in life she just cry it off or get angry like most of show for no perticural reason.Jean is one of the nicest kids in anime and he fell in love at first sight with Nadia and nothing cant stop him for even leaving his country to help her which she took for granted many times. And when finally things were going in good way for both of them (romantic way) and she saw how much he cares for her, the moment they landed in country where she was headed , she met some boy Hanayama of some african tribe and fell in love so hard she ignored Jean for 2 episodes in row and took all her anger on him. She treated him like trash and he done nothing wrong, while she was fan gazing at that african dude she just met.Music is non existant and animation gone sometimes from worse to nightmare how bad it is.Other characters are more like comedic part of story helping our duo archieve their dreams.Like i said there was alot of filler episodes which leads to nothing, i understand few but most of show is filled with no logic crap.Plot was not that bad , it piqued my curiosity what Captain of ship which helped Nadia and friends was related to her country and family. Ending was nice with some time skip :D , plot was 7/10 characters 7/10 which Nadia took score down, music 1/10, animation 3/10. all, she despise people who kill animals to eat them and even want to force them not to eat it cuz of her ideals she puts on people, whenever its hard in life she just cry it off or get angry like most of show for no perticural reason.Jean is one of the nicest kids in anime and he fell in love at first sight with Nadia and nothing cant stop him for even leaving his country to help her which she took for granted many times.

Although I don't hate it and it has enjoyable moments, there is a lot wrong with this anime, even if we ignore the terrible filler episodes that any other review can inform you of. Nadia is extremely unlikable: constantly yelling at Jean for no reason, a vegetarian who won't let others eat what they want, and inconsistent character-wise.The best part of this show was Jean's kindness and intelligence, the Nautilus crew and lore, and some of the (albeit underdeveloped) Atlantis lore. The Atlantis technology and buildings are very interesting but there's so much time wasted on filler instead of properly painting...us a picture of the Atlanteans and connecting the various ideas. It's very interesting seeing the parallels between this and Evangelion: the music, the characters/their personalities, the technology, the battle scenes, etc.The end is heartfelt and I did cry but Electra being pregnant was random. If the time skip is 12 years and Marie was 4 during the events of the series, Sanson is a literal pervert. By the time they're married, she's only 16 and he's 34. He married a child. So weird and unnecessary.Lots of sexist commentaries throughout the show and enforcement of gender roles (it's a woman's job to clean and cook, women are crazy/whiners/complainers and cannot be understood, consent is thrown out the window, etc.).I've lost respect for Anno over the years but this definitely made me lose even more respect for him. us a picture of the Atlanteans and connecting the various ideas.

This story follows the titular Nadia and a young inventor, Jean, as they get caught up in a spanning adventure that takes them across the ocean, under the waves, and through the skies in search of Nadia\'s past all the while discovering more about each other and, more importantly, themselves.The character relationships of the cast are dynamic and really change over time. The animation is beautiful to behold; there are great elements of mecha and magic present in the show... I hesitate to say much more as don\'t want to spoil the experience of the...story. It really is a treat to experience for the first time. Overall a beautiful mix of light and dark elements.The narrative is all tied up in a bombastic and exciting conclusion that, while feeling a little rushed, seriously delivers on viewer satisfaction all the way to the end. There are also a lot of visual/audio queues and tropes that are both referenced and originated in this anime that later became ingrained in not just Hideaki Anno\'s other works, but the anime medium in the decades following.On to the music - simply put, it is excellent. Able to jump between playful, intense, tragic, and alien nature of different elements of the story, it was one of my favourite elements of the whole show. Well worth tracking down the OST. As for general audio, I stuck with the Japanese track which is what I would recommend. The actors all give extremely memorable performances, are well cast, and are what kept the show afloat for me even in it\'s downtimes.Some things to note for this show/release... There is an often mentioned caveat with this series known as ""the island filler"" or the Island/Africa arc which I suppose bears addressing in a review of the series. I won\'t get into the production reasons, but for a chunk of episodes in the middle, the episodes were outsourced to a different animation studio and the animation quality took a big hit. Not just the animation quality, but for a few episodes, our main cast were quite off-model. Putting this aside, however, I found these episodes nonetheless endearing and possessing many key character moments for our main characters. Of the whole of this subsection of episodes, there was perhaps only 1 episode I though was objectively bad and irredeemable, and one plot element in another that really didn\'t work. Getting to my point, I would say, just know there is a section with lesser animation quality, but just stick with it and you can still find some treasure buried here.Putting aside the drop in animation quality for a few episodes, there were strange drops in resolution in some scenes throughout the rest of the anime, often in the same scene (I watched through the Gkids blu ray which totes a 4k remastered scan). It would switch from a sharp HD, to what looked like an old VHS or DVD transfer. I am not sure if this issue is present in other releases as I do not have the Sentai or Japanese releases to compare. Whether it could be that maybe these elements were lost and so could not be adequately touched up or if this was a result of the ""4K"" treatment this release totes, I\'m not sure. Occasionally there appeared to be some DNR aftereffects that overly smoothed some details, but I didn\'t notice this too much.Overall, I highly recommend this anime. The positives far outweigh the negative.  Don\'t let this gem pass you by. story. It really is a treat to experience for the first time.

No, wait, I\'m an Ultraman fan too, everything\'s OK) of that series, in turn the virtues and sins of the creator,...who can write enticing and reflexive stuff when he refuses to give go to any pretention of fake intellectualism (hello the Gainax Bounce on Grandis\' tits and the nude butt of Nadia/Vegetarian Asuka in the bathtub! Hello final reference to Otaku No Video!) and when he tries to convince you that he\'s the intellectual that he isn\'t due to his geek obsession of psychology by inserting a cameo of Goya\'s Saturn eating his son that has no meaning whatoever or with some kind of word salad/overcomplication that true intellectuals don\'t use (these ones make complicate concepts digestable for people who are not in their same league, not the contrary) the writing takes a nosedive for the worst, in particular with the all the stuff concerning the Electra complex of Electra towards Nadia\'s father (Misato Katsuragi and Ritsuko Akagi Anyone?) which literally has no point whatsoever and it is not particularly well written or explained. Oh yes, you can also clearly see that Hideaki was using this series as a way to externalize hard his depression like he did with Evangelion, and again the writing suffered for it, even if it didn\'t suffer the way sucky and unwatchable End of Evangelion did. So, this being the preamble of Evangelion, the only logical consequence is to give it the same rating I give to Evangelion, a 7. TBH, I still put Gunbuster and in particular the first five episodes over the Eva stuff (of which I\'m a fan of certain things only, meaning all the Otaku stuff - I.E. the ladies, the mechas, the audio department and the people behind it - and not the word salad or the uberdepression) which have NO OVERDEPRESSIVE TONE and they\'re just him and the Gainax guys doing great Otaku stuff for other Otakus like them, but there are far worst Hideaki Anno products out there (totally unwatchable/boring End of Evangelion and trio of Love&Pop/Shiki-Jitsu/Shin Japan Heroes ""movies"" I\'m looking at you). Oh and BTW as suggested by the majority of this anime\'s fandom I didn\'t care to watch the filler arc except episode 31, where the penultimate Ultraman fan fanboys like only he could do with no particular pretention, and I\'m perfectly OK with that.

Next in the watchlist for the Hideaki Anno world tour: his preferred thing ever The Return of Ultraman!P.S. absolutely excellent voice acting and in particular by Akio Ootsuka and Kikuko Inoue in here, if you\'re a fan of those Seiyuus you\'ll love them.

Hayate no Gotoku!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2026/Hayate_no_Gotoku,"[""Here is an anime that's not like many others. Hayate the Combat Butler is a colaberation of all kinds of Anime thrown into one, in order to make fun of it of course. What I mean is that Hayate is one of those Animes that make fun of Anime in general. I first herd of this series when it came out as a manga and so I got the manga and read a few books. Now even more intrigued, I began my search of the animated version. To my surprise there it was and began to watch it with my good friend from campus, Edge....Both of us fell in love with the series and it's comedic view on Anime.Like I mentioned before, Hayate is a comedy anime, so it doesn't have a strong storyline. But what it's missing in story line makes up with many vibrant characters. Each character has their own interesting persona which gives a feel and equal balance between characters. It is obvious to say that the little storyline is really nothing to complain about. Another interesting thing to point out is how they transition many aspects of the Manga into the Anime. Though the Anime doesn't follow along the original chapters of the Manga, the characters still have the same aspects and don't astray from their original concept.The comedy in this Anime is truely halarious, but not many will understand it if they haven't seen many mainstream Animes like; Dragon Ball Z, Mobile Suit Gundam, Saint Seiya and the Knights of the Zodiac, etc.. This Anime heavily uses other anime quotes, actions, and scences as references. They also use alot of Japanese television cullture in this as well. References to famous idols, Soap Opera, and other TV shows. Most of the anime's they bleep out during discusions are purposely done because of how it was like in the Manga. Originally the manga would bleep out certain words so they wouldn't get sued by other companies by using certain names, example; Gundam would be changed to Gu--am or ---dam on the TV show or Manga. But that in itself is halarious.The art in the anime is pretty good. Though the characters are all flashy with serveral Neon color overtones, they don't look all too bad. There is no serious fan service in this anime so if you are looking for enourmous Boobs, you won't find any here. Many other characters are of proper proportions and aren't really saturated. Though in certain scenes they make tease pictures of certain characters in the end of the episodes for Fan Service, which are really more funny then sexy. Also they have certain episodes where they change the animation stylings as well. In one episode they hire the designers of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann to do the episode.In the end I wrote nothing but good about this anime, that's because I favor humor against many popular animes. Indeed not many of you will enjoy this Anime, it's all about preferences and interests. I, however, will encourage you to watch a few episodes and see what I mean. This Anime is one for my record books. I've got my laughs and can't wait till the next season comes out, oh wait...kinda spoiled it for you guys, lol.

It follows the story of a very ordinary boy Hayate, who&rsquo;s always been a noble person and forced to work most of his life. One day his parents left him with a huge dept to pay, to some very kind people (the Yakuza). Now that he&rsquo;s lost all hope, Hayate attempts to kidnap a rich girl, Nagi but he ends up saving her from the &ldquo;very kind people&rdquo;. She returns the favour by allowing him to work as her butler, thus their adventure begins.That&rsquo;s basically the...set-up of the show with one of the funniest opening episodes ever. With this being a romantic, comedy both of these aspect are important. There are several obvious romantic interests between the characters like Hayate and Nagi. This really isn&rsquo;t all that relevant to the story though but it just helps give it purpose. On the other hand the comedy is what stands. The jokes are funny and fresh, making the gags so blatantly obvious that you&rsquo;ll have to be asleep to not notice. The comical &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t show this&rdquo; gag and bleeping (****) out anime/manga references are just a few of the running gags that will leave you in laughing fits. There are dozens of whacky parodies in this anime series that can easily surpass the like of Exc*l S*ga. One thing this anime will become known for is perfecting the art of &ldquo;breaking the 4th wall&rdquo;, which also has been achieved in several other series. ^_^*For those who don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;breaking the 4th wall&rdquo; is when a character is aware they are being watched and they even interact with the audience*The animation quality is great for a comedy with the characters having the classic &ldquo;Moe&rdquo; features (e.g. big eyes, big head, slim body). Compared to similar romantic comedies that arrived around the same time &ldquo;Nagasarete Airantou&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seto no Hanayome&rdquo; the animation in Hayate no Gotoku! is just as luscious and vibrant, however there are scores of anime with superior animation. This doesn&rsquo;t matter because the way the show looks definitely suits this anime. The music also suits the fun nature of the show and has plenty of catchy beats but it can get fairly repetitive after a while.Overall this is definitely an anime for anime fans who&rsquo;ve seen plenty of shounen anime, due to the number of jokes related to those. However for those who haven&rsquo;t seen much anime won&rsquo;t feel left out by not understanding, as most of the jokes are just blatantly obvious. Though no matter how enjoyable this series is, the story is the weakest aspect and after a while it gets fairly unimpressive and repetitive. Even with all the added hilarious action, in the second half, it can get a bit old.

There were some entertaining scenes and sometimes even episodes in Hayate the Combat Butler! It\'s just that, you know, there aren\'t enough. I can also say with a certainty I rarely feel regarding any anime that this was too long, way too long, for its own good. There are reasons of course. First of all; this anime is episodic, 52 episodes of episodic plots is too much. It will never be good, in any anime. I don\'t really have anything against episodic animes, but this genre, or these genres are perhaps not suitable as a base for a...52 (!) episode anime where each and every episode has its own plot. At some point it gets tedious.In Hayate the Combat Butler! I can honestly say I don\'t even remember at what point it got tedious. All I can say is that the three episodes that Nabeshin was contributing to with storyboard and directing were the best, especially the one where he appears in person with his \'fro. I did laugh at other scenes aswell, but as I said before, the laughs came too sparsely for it to be worth living through 52 episodes. There are other, better animes with denser, in want for a better word, comedy (laugh) value.There were some references to other anime and populat culture in general in this anime. For the people who have seen this; did you notice them? Yea. They were hard to miss. I don\'t mind it once or twice or maybe even ten times, but when we\'re talking like 100 times it, as the entire anime, gets tedious.Did you know that when you\'re 20 you\'re basically ready for retirement in Japan? Throughout the entire series I was contemplating if the subtle (not) hints you got that this was the case were serious or if they were just yanking my chain, so to speak. I\'m more inclined to say they were serious though. Maybe this entire anime was made for those kids in middle school that form anti grown up clubs and enter depressions and states of emo-ness due to the fact that they\'ll soon enter highschool in which case they will be ""old"". Perhaps I was never meant to watch this anime at all, I honestly don\'t know.Did you know that there was no character development of any of the characters, whatsoever, in the entirety of Hayate the Combat Butler! It\'s true, if anyone should disagree with me I ask of them to show me proof by pointing out character and episode and I will take the time to rewatch the entire episode just to see if it\'s true. That is how certain I am that character development does not exist in Hayate the Combat Butler!If anyone should be interested I will go after Wikipedia\'s definition of character development which is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_development52 episodes?

Most episodes were a great laugh and I enjoyed following the series, even though most of it is based on tried and proved humor and events.I do like the fact that the series did not take itself too seriously and often not only made fun of other anime and manga, but also made fun of itself and its own absurdities as well, which showed in elements such as characters interacting with the narrator or seemingly...reaching out to the audience to question what is happening on-screen.The cast of characters is large enough to provide ample variation, however many are more stereotypical characters or are comprised out of stereotypical character traits, luckily they're quite effectively or humoristically used at times, which helps greatly.Then again, Nagi, Hayate, Maria, Hinagiku, and the many more of the large cast present in the series were always good for a laugh or a surprise.Some characters barely appeared tough, such as Himegami, Chiharu and Aika, they were added to the second opening sequence as if their characters would have quite a bit of screen time and importance but they ended up appearing only a few times. This could give the impression the creator/writers aren't sure yet where they want to go with the series.The ending of &ldquo;Hayate No Gotoku!&rdquo; 52 episode run was somewhat unexpected though, it was a nice episode with some evolution of the main plot but offers no closure since they announced a second season is in the works, so be prepared for that if you intend to watch the series.I'm unsure how well another series run will do for &ldquo;Hayate No Gotoku!&rdquo;, I'm unfamiliar with the manga so I do not know how much material is left for them to use. While I did enjoy the show a great deal, the question is will it be able to carry itself for another run of 52 episodes?However, now that &ldquo;Hayate No Gotoku!&rdquo; has finished airing, I notice how I do miss it, seeing the antics of Nagi, Hayate, Maria, Hinagiku, for such a long time made them grown on me, I was used to seeing them around every week.The animation on &ldquo;Hayate No Gotoku!&rdquo; was always good to decent, while the obvious fanservice scenes got better animation and finish compared to other scenes that were more simply animated or illustrated, I didn't find this bothersome. The series looked like it also tried to keep some of the character design style of the manga, most characters looked good, albeit generic at times.With the many homages, easter eggs, many links and references to other anime series, the style sometimes did change during several scenes which would often lead to hilarious scenes.The soundtrack was allright, clearly made to accompany what happens on-screen without truly standing out. In contrast I am fond of the opening songs done by Kotoko, I generally enjoy her music a lot and found her contributions here were energetic and lively tracks that fit the pace of the series perfectly.If you're looking for a good romantic comedy that does not only have the themes we're used to but is also rife with absurd humor and links to other series then you most likely will love &ldquo;Hayate No Gotoku!&rdquo;.At 52 episodes it is a long series so I'm not sure how viewing it in a batch will come over, I do think watching it weekly or with some pause between episodes may make it more enjoyable. reaching out to the audience to question what is happening on-screen.The cast of characters is large enough to provide ample variation, however many are more stereotypical characters or are comprised out of stereotypical character traits, luckily they're quite effectively or humoristically used at times, which helps greatly.Then again, Nagi, Hayate, Maria, Hinagiku, and the many more of the large cast present in the series were always good for a laugh or a surprise.Some characters barely appeared tough, such as Himegami, Chiharu and Aika, they were added to the second opening sequence as if their characters would have quite a bit of screen time and importance but they ended up appearing only a few times.

I\'m not doing it out of spite; having seen all of both the first and second seasons, I can definitely say that I was disappointed with how this series turned out. So, let this be fair warning so others do not make this mistake: Hayate no Gotoku is NOT a story-driven anime. While I began watching with some knowledge of this, the total absence of any plot whatsoever and any character development at all (I will say the second season provides a lot more development though) were incredibly frustrating...for me, and I\'d like to prevent others from having to endure over 70 episodes in order to learn the same lesson. Please understand this is nothing more than my personal opinion, and that while I recognize that others did enjoy the show, it reached the point where I no longer could.Story:1/10, Mainly because there is none. Nor is there really a pretense of one. The purpose of this show is nothing more than comedy; it\'s goal is not to tell a story, and so there is no plot. If you enjoy this approach, then it can certainly be amusing, but for anyone looking for the barest hint of a story, you will find nothing.Art & Sound:8/10 and 7/10. To be honest, I rather enjoyed the art style, and that\'s part of what kept me watching for the duration of the series. That said, for most of the first part of the season they ""censored"" out a lot of the blood/violence/random words (not even explicit language). Although this was amusing at first, it was heavily overused and became incredibly annoying.Character:4/10 For a reasonably strong cast. Unfortunately, there is no character development whatsoever, which makes it very difficult to watch the characters making the exact same mistakes they did 50 episodes ago and having it still be funny. Because of the lack of plot, the characters really needed to carry the show, and in the early episodes they do an admirable job. But a series this long really demands more than what was provided, and by the end I was totally unsatisfied with almost every aspect of the show.Enjoyment:3/10 As others have mentioned, the series starts off strong, but it really does become a grind to get through the second half. And getting to the end and realized that there has been no progression whatsoever really makes it difficult to look back positively on the show as a whole.Overall: 3/10Solid art and sound work, but every other aspect of the show is totally inadequate for meeting the demands of a show that is more than 50 episodes long. for me, and I\'d like to prevent others from having to endure over 70 episodes in order to learn the same lesson.

This is just pretty much an anime not worthy of your time if you doesn't want to waste your time becoming fanatics to a few characters in this show.Anyway,this show is a pure romance comedy which have attracted many people with its characters and comedy. It have its own kind of comedy unlike anything else including the non-existent fourth wall thanks to the fact that every characters destroy it almost every episodes.Story: This show actually doesn't have a true storyline.Most of the episodes are fillers and some of them actually bend with the manga but that's the funny part of it.The central...plot is pretty much about a boy name Ayasaki Hayate becoming a butler to a 13-year old girl name Sanzenin Nagi(and she's mine BTW, RAWR!!!!) and the whole plot revolves around this baka butler journey toward becoming the best butler ever.Art: Nothing to comment except its awesome xD. The art is so great that it makes 3D looks like ugly for a while.Sound: This show have some of the best OST I ever heard.Both OP is awesome and hilarious at the same time while its ED have those romance feeling. Proof have these sleepy,sow sound while Get My Way! have these party style. Chasse have these calm-sound and the best ED by the way while Ko No Me Kaze have these unknown-feelings.......Character: These show have some of the best characters you gonna ever saw like Katsura Hinagiku and Ayasaki Hayate but not all of them are as awesome as Nagi ojou-sama xD. End of pointOverall: Overall, this show is what makes me an otaku to start, so if anyone who doesn't like anime at first, take this show and pledge yourselves as a full anime fanatics xD plot is pretty much about a boy name Ayasaki Hayate becoming a butler to a 13-year old girl name Sanzenin Nagi(and she's mine BTW, RAWR!!!!) and the whole plot revolves around this baka butler journey toward becoming the best butler ever.Art: Nothing to comment except its awesome xD.

Hayate the Combat Butler, is the story of unlucky teenager Hayate Ayasaki,who after being sold to the Yakuza(Mafia) and inheriting a debt of 156,804,000 Yen, decides to kidnap a girl named Nagi Sanzenin. Unfortunately, the idiot(Hayate), botches up the plan, and due to poor empathy, makes Nagi believe that Hayate is in love with her. After saving her from another kidnapping plot, Hayate then becomes Nagi’s butler, where he must use all means necessary to protect...her, completely unaware that Nagi is in love with him.It was in 2004 that Kenjiro Hata released this hilarious manga (which eventually turned into an anime) which featured funny characters, outrageous humor, many references to popular culture, parodies of pop-culture, and the craziest situations created. Whether it be walking to the grocery store only to end up getting attacked by thousands of bodyguards with swords, to attempting to sneak into a school, only to be met by a crazy alcoholic history teacher that really wants to kill someone, the situations simply from crazy to ludicrously demented. The reason for most of these “incidents”(If you can call them that.) is due to the fact that Hayate is the unluckiest 16 year old I have ever seen in my life. While he is skilled in combat, martial arts, stealth, weapon use, painting forging, assassinations, cleaning, door to door salesmanship, etc….(How he learns all these skills are beyond me), he just seems to always be at the wrong place at the wrong time. One other factor could also be that his weakness, girls added to what seems to be the poorest empathy I’ve seen from 16 year old, simply makes Hayate’s life a living nightmare. Whether it be that every single girl in Tokyo is insane, or the fact Hayate still hasn’t figured out (After two season and 20 volumes), that most of the girl’s that he meet are in love him, usually results in Hayate being in a lot of mental and physical pain.The format of the show is basically scenario after scenario, a basic format that really doesn’t distinguish it from other animes/mangas. However, it is not format but the scenarios that it get right, for every scenario usually involves a lot of parodies, breaking of the wall, truly insane action, and lots of freaking misunderstandings. Whether it be misuse of the word “play”, or accidently killing off a character for really no reason what-so-ever, the series revolves around the idea of world where everybody takes everything too seriously, resulting many casualties caused by a war that ends many innocent lives. (Moment of Silence Please) However, all of these scenarios are hilarious, as for they rely on outrageous humor, a ridiculous amount of sexual innuendo, and amusing character abuse scenes. Even the normal scenarios are hilarious, for they range from attempting to get into one of the greatest school in Japan (An obvious parody to Love Hina), to trying to escape a gay person who loves Hayate, instantly turns into a fight to the death situation.If their one flaw with this series (I don’t find it a flaw, but many people do), it’s the fact it leans VERY closely to Harem. For those of you who don’t know, Harem is usually an anime with the situation in that one guy is involved with two or more girls. This isn’t bad, in my opinion, but it usually leads to girls being made into sex symbols. (Still have no problem with that) Meaning if you are a woman, you may be turned off by this series. however, if you are willingly to overlook this and just laugh at what you on screen, then you will really enjoy this show.If what I said make’s Hayate the Combat Butler a mindless comedy, then you are wrong, This series can be very touching at times, as for before Hayate became a butler, he was dirt poor kid that had to support two lazy parents that sold him to the mafia, even going to the extent of giving him the . After seeing the first episode, you really feel the problem that Hayate is going through, as for everyone has abandoned him. Heck I’m not afraid to say that I even shed a tear. Hayate the Combat Butler is the story of survival. Hayate, being a butler, has to constantly serve the most spoiled child I have ever seen (Nagi) and no matter how angry she gets at Hayate, Hayate always seems to do everything willingly, even feeling guilty when he isn’t working or taking a day off. Basically it’s the story of Hayate wanting to be accepted, but due to bad luck, has a very hard time doing it. Since the series is still running, I can’t come to any conclusions if Hayate is going to actually end up being happy, so I am hoping that the conclusion is really well done, as for death shall come to Kotoko if they do release a crappy final episode.Hayate the Combat Butler is simply hilarious and touching. While the slight harem feel may stop girls from reading/watching this, most of the population will simply enjoy this great manga/anime series. her, completely unaware that Nagi is in love with him.It was in 2004 that Kenjiro Hata released this hilarious manga (which eventually turned into an anime) which featured funny characters, outrageous humor, many references to popular culture, parodies of pop-culture, and the craziest situations created.

So if this is the first time watching anime I would suggest that this would not be a very suitable anime to start on.Story:The main plot of Hayate is not very strong, but it does set up a good environment for a comedy to take place. Basically Hayate takes on the role of Nagi Sanzenin's butler in order to pay off the debts left behind from his parents. There is not...much story development after that and I'm not exactly sure what there was to develop, but that didn't make the show any less fun to watch. The episodes consist of each episode that doesn't really matter if you watch it or not because most of them don't change anything. Many people may look at that as a turn down, but as a comedy it was probably necessary in order to keep each episode funny. So each episode takes on a different event in the life of a butler is how I could interpret the story.Animation:The art/animation for Hayate was, I thought, very well done. The style used for this show was perfect to set the mood of a comedy. There were many bright colors used in the animation from the characters to the background. Also this isn't like other animes where they try to make it as realistic as possible, but this is a positive seeing as they weren't looking for realistic nor a serious looking anime.Sound:To get right down to it the theme songs, background music, and character voices were all very upbeat. The theme songs especially made the show seem very much like an upbeat show. As for background music I'm pretty sure they were going for a classy sort of comedic beat seeing as the settings were all suppose to have that rich-like theme. The character voices was probably the strong point in sound. All of the voices suited the characters for what they were suppose to be (except maybe Maria?). So sound is good in all, but nothing really special. =)Character:Heres where I thought Hayate succeeded in the most. The characters were what made this show enjoyable and one of the most funniest animes out there. All the characters (and there were MANY) played there parts in jokes that made me laugh throughout the anime. Even the most serious of characters were in their own way comedic and contributed to making this show very funny. One problem I did find was that because there were so many characters some of them found themselves taken out of the storyline for up to 20 episodes (maybe even more). Noticing this problem the makers of Hayate still made a way to turn this into a joke (or maybe it was intentional?).Enjoyment:I thought this show was very enjoyable and those looking for a few laughs keep looking because you won't get a &quot;few&quot; you will get ALOT. Although I did enjoy this anime and thought it was very funny there were somethings I thought were annoying or unnecessary. I have nothing against comedy, but I couldn't give this show a 10 for enjoyment because I still like action and horror better... =.= much story development after that and I'm not exactly sure what there was to develop, but that didn't make the show any less fun to watch.

From episode 1 to episode 52 the wasnt a single moment where I wasn't either chuckling or laughing my head off.Ayasaki Hayate is a normal kid, except, he is over 100 million Yen in debt. The story begins with him being sold to the mafia by his own debt ridden parents to ease their money problems. Hours upon hours of comedy ensues.The story is like a bamboo tree - sure it goes direct and gets to the end but there are many twigs...jutting off that are highly funny, but not a part of the actual story. If you have seen D.Gray-Man, you will almost instantly relate Hayate to Allen because of their parents/master and what they had to do to pay of their debts. Even their hair and voices share similarities.There are so many parodies in this series so make sure you watch quite a few beforehand although it isn't absolutely ESSENTIAL. There are references to Evangelion, Death Note, Final Fantasy, Shakugan no Shana, Full Metal Alchemist, xxxHolic, Dragonball Z and.. well as many other anime as you could shake a Lance of Longinus at. Though even without understanding all of the references this IS the funniest anime.The comedy is not all randomness and parody, there is some romantic comedy aspects (as Hayate is the most clueless character in history). There are action scenes and things that are so unexpected and funny such as ... well all I will say is Tama is not all he seems.Basically, if you're looking for a historically funny anime - look no further!

Well, the first thing I can say with a large amount of confidence is that overall it's a pretty good anime, the comedy is usually pretty funny, and the action is fast-paced enough to keep it exciting, but not overbearing.  By the same token, it's not great, it's comedy is not drop-dead hilarious, the action doesn't bring you to the edge of your seat, and it does not bring anything really ground-breaking to the anime industry.  This anime does a great job of establishing a sense of normalcy, and does a great job with...characters that aren't too deep establishing a few funny quirks for you to learn about for each character.  These are both the anime's strongest qualities and its weakest point; the characters rarely have any depth at all and seem to be cookie-cutter molds of the industry, but that doesn't make them bad characters, cookie-cutter molds exist for a reason, because its what people like.  Also, the normalcy is impressive, but no real story climax results from it, even though what happens in the last few episodes might be considered a climax as I've said before it doesn't really make you grip the edge of your seat in anticipation.If you're debating whether or not to watch this anime, I would suggest trying it out for a few episodes, and if the character of Hayate and the first 2 or 3 episodes don't do anything for you this anime is not for you.  Also, this anime is a harem-style anime, but it manages to keep it pg, so not too much fan service for those of you that are into that. characters that aren't too deep establishing a few funny quirks for you to learn about for each character.

A lot of comedy, some romance, and Queen Tsundere, Rie Kugimiya . Kugimiya also voiced other popular characters such as Louise in Zero no Tsukaima , Taiga in Toradora , and Shana in Shakugan no Shana (among with a variety of others). I personally have seen all of those except Shana and I\'m a huge fan of her voice so this show was an easy pick with her playing the young, rich, spoiled, shut-in otaku tsundere Nagi.But moving past characters let\'s actually talk about the show.The...show started off pretty strong. It was about poor Hayate who is thrown into a world of debt after his parents gamble him away and in a last ditch effort to make money he thinks about kidnapping young Nagi in the hopes for a ransom only to back out the last second and end up saving her. So for the first few episodes we follow this narrative and the introduction of characters and settings. I want to say about the first 10 episodes are focused. However it\'s what happens after that changes everything...Any sense of focus or story is thrown to the side. In a 52 episode series, there\'s less than 10-20% of episodes with some significance. Is this necessarily a bad thing to drift away from the story? Of course not! It\'s good to get a break. But when there are this many episodes it quickly gets tiring. Each episode basically pits some ridiculous situation and stems a large amount of jokes on anime references and the such. Again, all things that aren\'t that bad, but when you go 20 some episodes like this it quickly gets old. I remember falling asleep during so many episodes (which is VERY rare for me) just because I failed to keep interest. I would literally let the video run on the side and work on something else only looking over on occasion for the subtitles and things that catch my eye. I stopped watching the show a few years back with less than 7 episodes left to go and a couple months ago watched 4 or 5 and stopped again. I only NOW gained the motivation to finish the show more so I could take it off my list...Now in counter-point apparently the manga is a little more focused and different but I only read a few chapters to start. Also the voice acting is great and some jokes hit here and there but it\'s forgetful. The show also does the horrible crime of suddenly remembering there was a plot in the last 2 EPISODES and decides to make a mention to it like ""oh yeah remember that? Yeah, we\'re not gonna resolve it but just wanted to remind you that it did exist once"".In conclusion Hayate is a show that would\'ve served fine with simply being shorter and having a few more episodes to develop the plot. At most I would\'ve given it 26 episodes and that\'s stretching it. The fact that there\'s a 2nd season baffles me in the sense of how much more junk could they figure up to fill up the gaps. I\'m sure I might just be taking the series a bit too seriously but I\'m the kind of person that overlook things in the hopes of taking things lightly, this just pushes it too far. If you really wanna check it out watch the first few episodes and maybe a few more. Nothing ever gets resolved anyway so don\'t worry about finishing it. If you want, catch a few episodes here and there just to meet some new characters but it won\'t matter too much. The whole show basically revolves around the characters you meet at first.Final rating? Stream it on crunchyroll, DON\'T put any money into it. You could go without watching it though it is a somewhat referenced in anime fandoms so you might be out of the loop on some things. Also Kugimiya is an awesome voice to hear. show started off pretty strong. It was about poor Hayate who is thrown into a world of debt after his parents gamble him away and in a last ditch effort to make money he thinks about kidnapping young Nagi in the hopes for a ransom only to back out the last second and end up saving her.

And this is one of those anime's, it's where nothing makes sense and where many different genres are thrown in one package. There is rarely any doll moment in this anime, and it keeps you entertained all through if it is romance-comedy or fighting big machine's and saving the girl.All the characters are as solid as they come, you can't help but love everyone of the character's, who always find up some crazy schemes to torture Hayate or some other poor person. Or some other girl that misunderstands what Hayate says and sooner Hayate get's beaten up...because of it.This is one of the best romance-comedy's out there because you can never predict what's going to happen next! There is always those ''WHAT'' moments that never grow old.

A butler is the formal guardian who supports the days of their master.”Now whats so special about this quote? Well in Hayate no Gotoko (Hayate the Combat Butler) it forms the basis of the anime making it your perfect comedy anime filled with action, romance, laughs, gags, and of course...some fan service(but the fan service if very little). I can tell you that this is a comedy unlike any other. It is full of references to other anime and Japanese culture. If you are familiar to Japanese culture or enjoy watching anime...a lot, then the references made in this anime will make you giggle with enjoyment. Saying that it doesn’t mean you won’t enjoy this anime if you haven’t seen your fair share of anime it just means you might miss quite a few things.PLOTPlotwise Hayate no Gotoko specifically doesn’t have a plot. It’s not an anime you watch to view a steady progression of events nor does it follow through consistently with a main story line. Yet this can be seen as one of the strengths of Hayate no Gotoko. Since it doesn’t strictly follow a story line the comedic elements of the anime are strictly reinforced, ensuring that anything can happen so the audience doesn’t need to sit there waiting or trying to predict what could happen in the next scene.CHARACTERThe character archetypes are very cliché so you won’t expect much development here. We have your typical airhead Hayate, your small tsundere Nagi etc etc.  But that’s not the point of the anime. Character development doesn’t need to play a major role in the development of this anime.

They do use a few neon based colours, but that isn’t a reason why you shouldn’t watch this anime. Basically it is a very well drawn like any other standard anime.MUSICThe music in this anime is very relaxing and comfortable to listen to.

There are so many references to other anime/manga in this show that you honestly could never understand each of them. Aside of that it tells about events spanning over more than a whole year, though there isn\'t really a big storyline holding everything together. Only characters will develop and change a bit.At this point I should also mention that females easily outnumber males. This show could easily be seen as a harem... and well, it kinda is. (There are enough Girls, who seem to really like Hayate, the protagonist,...though not all of them) However it\'s not the main-aspect of this show, the comedy is.Animation: (7)Well it\'s ok. There are episodes with quite nice animated fighting-scenes, which are usually not to be taken serious anyways, but mostly it\'s nothing special. (It is mostly comedy after all) Art was good as well, though once again nothing too special here.For what this show needs it\'s really well done.Sound: (7)Intro- and Outro-Songs are all quite good, the normal OST however isn\'t... you\'ll probably not remember anything from it.

Its success can be attributed to the always present, comedy aspect of the series. Some might think anime comedy is a little ""meh,"" but this definitely is an exception. I\'m sure if you\'ve watched the majority of the popular anime shows...out there (HtCB utilizes a lot of references from popular pop-culture movies/icons as well as anime), you\'re going to be giggling or even laughing-out-loud. Personally, I haven\'t seen many of the ""uber-popular"" animes out there, so I might have laughed even more if I actually had.Continuing with the comedy, it\'s solid, but not ""30 Rock"" or ""Arrested Development"" caliber and you won\'t be laughing non-stop, but you will be laughing a lot at certain times.Don\'t expect too much contribution from the romantic side of things, too. The chart on the main page of this show\'s profile are very accurate representations of the actual ""dosage"" each genre offers. But overall, the story is moved forward by the [main] story arch of Hayate needing to pay back 150 million yen (approximately $1.7 million USD to put it in perspective)to Nagi; and I\'m totally alright with that.The art and animation was surprisingly consistent over a 52 episode-long series; consistently good, not bad. It\'s not the best animation ever, but still really good for this day and age. (2007-2008)Sound was sound. It\'s hard to judge this accurately other than pointing at the track/theme and the voice actors. All which were solid, they had a few opening themes over this span, and the voice actors were also very consistent when delivering emotional, funny, or generic scenes.I think it would be impossible to watch this series and not become partial to one specific character. For me, that was Maria. She was subtly good and never really did anything very exuberant or anything to ""wow"" you. She idled in the background, but was a main character and that combination really compelled me to her.Really, every character is well-done. Very deep (as expected of a series as lengthy as this) and multi-dimensional.My enjoyment and my overall grade are always synonymous with each other.

', ""Ever since that fateful summer of 2008 when I got into regular anime watching, I've never stumbled upon something so confusing and nonsensical, yet entertaining as 'Hayate no Gotoku!'. This show features a male lead with the strength, agility and endurance that could make superman cower in fear. A white tiger that tries to violate said male lead on numerous occasions. A cast containing more tsunderes than I care to remember and comedy that constantly breaks the fourth wall and makes you check your download folder to see if you're watching the right anime. To top it off, this show parodies a whole truckload of...other anime shows - Dragon Ball, Bleach, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Sailor Moon... the list is truly endless. And not just anime either. It parodies anything it can get its hands on. Now how could this mix ever be entertaining you ask? Wouldn't it be over the top? I'll explain in due time.But let's get back to the beginning. What's the premise behind this bombastic show?Very simple. We have the protagonist, Hayate Ayasaki, who works hard every single day to pay off the debt accumulated by his parents. Due to all the physically demanding menial tasks, the youth developed attributes that go far beyond the limits of a human being. However, after finding out that his parents abandoned him with debt that he'll never be able to pay off with honest work, the young man becomes disillusioned with life and decides to kidnap someone for a ransom. Namely, the show's horrendously rich heroine - Nagi Sanzenin. She misunderstands his true intentions though and he somehow ends up being her butler with the chance to work for her to pay off his debt.That's it. That's your whole story done in a single paragraph. What happens between that moment and the last episode is pretty much a free-for-all-no-holds-barred-what-in-the-hell-did-I-just-watch-what-the-fuck-fest. Phew. And trust me when I say that. You will witness a lot of weird stuff here. Is that what makes this show good? Partly, yes. The shock value here is significant. We usually laugh at the things we don't expect coming and in 4/5 cases, you won't expect the things this show is prepared to throw at you. Constant style changes, characters going super saiyan for no reason, sexual innuendo featuring home appliances... and much more.That said, there's more to like here than just the comedy & randomness factor. The characters are generally likeable and the interactions between them are always kept fresh and interesting. There's always some wisdom a viewer can gain from them, whether it be trivia on Japan's culture or a quick history revision. Hey, did you know the Osaka expo actually took place in 1970?Unfortunately, the characters and the story is where the problem with this anime also lies. 'Hayate no Gotoku!' is stretching itself way too thin. 52 episodes? I do enjoy episodic shows if they do their job right (comedy wise) but 52 episodes is way too much even for the most hilarious episodic show on the planet. This is exactly what happens in here . I've never read the manga for this series so I can't tell where the true plot ends and fillers start being churned out but I'd say the quality drops off around the 25 episode mark. After that the show derails and relies solely on comedy to get it through. Character and plot progression are null from around that point onwards. Or maybe even earlier.Which is bad because the show initially focused on the bond between Hayate and Nagi. The misunderstandings between him and her were a perfect pretext for romantic vibes to appear and while they do, the show drops the ball half-way through to focus on energy blasts, ultimate moves and Gin Ichimaru's Shikai (100 points for those who watched this and get the reference) rather than the plot at hand.Lastly, we have the art and sound components. I'll admit, the art here isn't exactly top notch. It's just scraping a 7. If I was to be entirely fair, I'd give art a 6,5. The reason for this is that quite often the characters look absolutely awful when focused out of the action zone. And I mean really really awful. Barely recognizable blobs that look like they've been drawn by a 7 year old. And this isn't a comedy effect either, it happens constantly throughout the show regardless of what scene the viewer's looking at (comedic, dramatic etc.). I don't really have that much to say about sound though. It's decent as is the voice acting but it didn't evoke any particular emotion or amazement in me, hence a 7. It is what it is.All things considered, 'Hayate no Gotoku!' is extremely enjoyable despite some of its pitfalls. You can always learn something new from this anime, which is always a good thing (well actually, mostly useless trivia but still). The references are surprisingly easy to understand, as in you don't need to be an otaku to laugh along. The sheer amount of them will also ensure that there's something everyone can relate to. And of course, the plot and the characters fit in perfectly for this type of anime.It isn't a masterpiece or even anywhere close to it but it gives you the enjoyment only a masterpiece could. It's funny. You enjoy it as if it was the best anime out there but you know it isn't. Which I guess is just another weird and nonsensical quality of 'Hayate no Gotoku!'.Thank you for reading.8 points. other anime shows - Dragon Ball, Bleach, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Sailor Moon... the list is truly endless. And not just anime either. It parodies anything it can get its hands on. Now how could this mix ever be entertaining you ask? Wouldn't it be over the top? I'll explain in due time.But let's get back to the beginning. What's the premise behind this bombastic show?Very simple. We have the protagonist, Hayate Ayasaki, who works hard every single day to pay off the debt accumulated by his parents. Due to all the physically demanding menial tasks, the youth developed attributes that go far beyond the limits of a human being. However, after finding out that his parents abandoned him with debt that he'll never be able to pay off with honest work, the young man becomes disillusioned with life and decides to kidnap someone for a ransom. Namely, the show's horrendously rich heroine - Nagi Sanzenin. She misunderstands his true intentions though and he somehow ends up being her butler with the chance to work for her to pay off his debt.That's it. That's your whole story done in a single paragraph. What happens between that moment and the last episode is pretty much a free-for-all-no-holds-barred-what-in-the-hell-did-I-just-watch-what-the-fuck-fest. Phew. And trust me when I say that. You will witness a lot of weird stuff here. Is that what makes this show good? Partly, yes. The shock value here is significant. We usually laugh at the things we don't expect coming and in 4/5 cases, you won't expect the things this show is prepared to throw at you. Constant style changes, characters going super saiyan for no reason, sexual innuendo featuring home appliances... and much more.That said, there's more to like here than just the comedy & randomness factor. The characters are generally likeable and the interactions between them are always kept fresh and interesting. There's always some wisdom a viewer can gain from them, whether it be trivia on Japan's culture or a quick history revision. Hey, did you know the Osaka expo actually took place in 1970?Unfortunately, the characters and the story is where the problem with this anime also lies. 'Hayate no Gotoku!' is stretching itself way too thin. 52 episodes? I do enjoy episodic shows if they do their job right (comedy wise) but 52 episodes is way too much even for the most hilarious episodic show on the planet. This is exactly what happens in here . I've never read the manga for this series so I can't tell where the true plot ends and fillers start being churned out but I'd say the quality drops off around the 25 episode mark. After that the show derails and relies solely on comedy to get it through. Character and plot progression are null from around that point onwards. Or maybe even earlier.Which is bad because the show initially focused on the bond between Hayate and Nagi. The misunderstandings between him and her were a perfect pretext for romantic vibes to appear and while they do, the show drops the ball half-way through to focus on energy blasts, ultimate moves and Gin Ichimaru's Shikai (100 points for those who watched this and get the reference) rather than the plot at hand.Lastly, we have the art and sound components. I'll admit, the art here isn't exactly top notch. It's just scraping a 7. If I was to be entirely fair, I'd give art a 6,5. The reason for this is that quite often the characters look absolutely awful when focused out of the action zone. And I mean really really awful. Barely recognizable blobs that look like they've been drawn by a 7 year old. And this isn't a comedy effect either, it happens constantly throughout the show regardless of what scene the viewer's looking at (comedic, dramatic etc.). I don't really have that much to say about sound though. It's decent as is the voice acting but it didn't evoke any particular emotion or amazement in me, hence a 7. It is what it is.All things considered, 'Hayate no Gotoku!' is extremely enjoyable despite some of its pitfalls. You can always learn something new from this anime, which is always a good thing (well actually, mostly useless trivia but still). The references are surprisingly easy to understand, as in you don't need to be an otaku to laugh along. The sheer amount of them will also ensure that there's something everyone can relate to. And of course, the plot and the characters fit in perfectly for this type of anime.It isn't a masterpiece or even anywhere close to it but it gives you the enjoyment only a masterpiece could.

"", 'Hayate No Gotoku was probably the first anime of 2017 that made me really appreciate its existence. The funny thing about this one, was that it was the first anime that I saw that made me see the character\'s role as a male maid butler. It was always considered ""cute"" to see the female maid butler to satisfy male audiences, but it was nice to see the story of how Hayate came to this position in the first place. The anime references of older anime shows towards this one were pretty cool, considering that this show came out back in 2007. The second half of...the series seemed to almost feel a little clunky sometimes. Either way, it didn\'t really make me not wince a bit, as far as the humor is concerned. Overall, this show is still getting me excited for watching the second season, which I\'m currently finishing up.This show is a must-watch for anyone that wants to see what a 13-year old, along with a female maid, an old man who still wishes for more character time while watching over Hayate, and a talking tiger who just wants to be treated as an equal along with the main and supporting characters. the series seemed to almost feel a little clunky sometimes.

This romantic comedy is all about a butler, Hayate, who serves his master Nagi due to extremely odd events. Misunderstandings happen between the two of them repeatedly and thus it creates the comedy that we see throughout the series.Some of the comedy in this anime can be repetitive and is fairly funny for the first few times but loses it thunder as it goes on but the creators have so much in here that they are able to keep the entire 52 episodes interesting and funny.Plot...there is very little of it. Most of the episodes...are all tied just on random adventure that Hayate and Nagi have together. Taking the bulk aside, the main plot that advances pretty much everything is fairly good and is put together fine. Really the last episode is 51 for main plot goes but the last episode I would say is the best out of the entire anime and I watched it again just because of how good it was.What I would tell someone about this anime is that it is long and if you do not like random adventures and you like plot oriented animes, then I would not watch this.

This is a comedy that has almost everything. Romance, Fighting, Drama, Slice Of Life, a bit of Majou Shoujo...to name a few. It's a melting pot that deals out a little bit of everything. Fourth wall breakings, or instances where you're informed that the characters know they're fictional, are everywhere. It's not frequent in anime to actually show the poor side of life. Hayate is in debt for ¥156,804,000, or about 2 million American dollars, thanks to his happy-go-lucky parents. Hayate becomes a butler to Nagi, and it all goes crazy from there. A kid who's supposed to be in high school being...a butler is already unheard of. But it's a creative yet simple plot, and it works. Story gets a ten. The art style is a very good mix, yet it shows that the creators put a lot of work in. The size scale is surprisingly fantastic for anime, and it really gives you a feel that they knew what they were doing. So art gets a ten. The voice acting is very good, and it even got a dub. Now, I'm not sure if it's a fandub or not, but whatever the case, the English voice acting is very fitting. The Japanese is even more. Hayate sounds very much like a poor man would, with a somewhat broken Tokyo accent. Nagi actually sounds like she's a whiny 13 year old. Maria actually sounds a bit English, and has a very generous voice. While there isn't much for sound effects, the ones it does have give you a tense feel. Sound gets a ten. Characters...a poor high schooler as a butler to a 13-year-old. An English lady. A gruff head. A talking white tiger. They incorporated the main characters into the story very well, and it's also very creative. Ten as well. And enjoyment...for me, it always kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next. Wondering who Hayate will fight. Wondering if Hayate's going to be the damsel in distress. I would give it a ten. Score is 50/50. This is the only one to get a ten on my list.

Heroic Age,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2002/Heroic_Age,"['Every genre has certain themes that are considered its staples - the building blocks of stories that have been, or are yet to be told. One of the most common elements in science fiction is the Earth being attacked by an alien force with superior technology, and there are numerous stories about this topic in everything from radio plays to comic books (with a few Hollywood blockbusters thrown in for good measure). These tales are usually resolved by the use of human ingenuity and courage, together with a healthy dose of serendipity (the battleship just happened to be there).But what happens when the enemy really...is unbeatable?Heroic Age is set in a future where Earth has been conquered by two alien races that are hell-bent on the total annihilation of the ones they call the ""Iron Tribe"". Over a century has passed and humanity continues to live in hiding across the universe, hoping and praying that the saviour promised by the all-powerful Golden Tribe would appear. After a short introduction concerning the major tribes in the series, the story begins with the spectral image of Princess Dianeira Y Laisha Arturia Ol Yunos floating in space as she attempts to locate the traces of a ship that has been lost for over 120 years. Together with the crew of the Argonaut she has journeyed through uncharted areas of the cosmos, and after four long years of searching it seems as though their quest may end on a half-destroyed planet that appears to be cut off from the rest of space.That world is Olone, and upon it lives a young man called Age (and his tentacled friend Food).Science fiction tends to be a pretty common genre in anime, but only a few shows can truly call themselves space operas - and even amongst those Heroic Age is more than a little unusual. Much of the plot has been inspired by greek mythology - in particular the legends surrounding Hercules - and this is very clearly reflected in not just the nomenclature or the tasks given to the Nodos, but also in the language used throughout the series. The narrative adopts a measured, formal tone which may not sit well with viewers who want a frenetic pace and minute-to-minute excitement - even though this approach is fitting because of the heavy classical influencel.That said, Heroic Age does contain a lot of combat and tension, but instead of the usual gung-ho attitude of other space-based anime (certain parts of the Macross and Gundam franchises for example), there\'s a tangible sense of desperation within the series. This stems from the fact that humanity is very clearly outnumbered, outgunned, and vastly inferior in terms of technology - factors which place far more emphasis on the need for a miracle, and like all such things the Nodos are both a blessing and a curse.In terms of design the characters are something of a mixed bag. The clothing for the humans is generally in keeping with the plot (utilitarian outfits for the most part), but their features are often unremarkable. As for the aliens, aside from the insectoid Bronze tribe and Food\'s species on Olone, everyone seems to be humanoid. It would have been nice if a little more imagination had been applied to the other inhabitants of the universe - variety is the spice of life after all. That said, the Nodos are interesting as they look more like an armoured creation of Doctor Moreau - which gives them a degree of familiarity, but also makes them appear far more monstrous than every other alien species.Character animation is surprisingly consistent throughout the series, and while the usage of CG is generally good (the transformation sequences or the pitched space battles for example), there are several moments that are decidedly clumsy in both execution and integration. Thankfully these are relatively minor issues that don\'t really have any impact on proceedings, and the show features some great audio-visual effects and choreography (although the mechanical servo noise used for Belcross has caused some confusion about the Nodos).One of the things that people will remember about Heroic Age is the exceptional music. The score is filled with tracks that appeal to any number of human emotions, and in all honesty the entire soundtrack (especially the main theme), seems to have two main purposes - add to the atmosphere of the story and make the viewer feel just a little bit epic.The opening sequence is a decent compilation of the main characters and a few action scenes, combined with Gravitation by Japanese pop band Angela - and thankfully there\'s almost nothing that could be counted as a spoiler. Each episode ends with Azurite - a melancholy ballad sung by Urakabe Tae - and the accompanying imagery shows Dianeira walking along the shore alone and then floating in space above a planet. Now this may seem like a fairly typical anime closing sequence, but it\'s actually a rather clever bit of foreshadowing that fits very well once the viewer understands the context.Possibly the biggest issue with Heroic Age is the dialogue - in particular because of the formality inherent in the series. The Japanese script is rather cumbersome in its use of language and is filled with repetitions of words and phrases  - sometimes just in one scene. Thankfully this approach fits the tone of the anime and the experienced voice cast have managed to overcome this hurdle to deliver some good performances. Unfortunately the English dub is even more convoluted, and things only get worse with the use of incorrect nomenclature (Dianela should actually be Dianeira - after the wife of Hercules, Age is pronounced Eiji, and so on). It\'s clear that the rewriters have tried too hard to turn the series into an animated saga poem, and many of the voice actors audibly struggle with their lines during certain monologues and declamations.That said, if the viewer is able to move past these issues then they\'re likely to find some rather interesting characters.Heroic Age is filled with lots of people who have their own beliefs and circumstances, but it\'s the numerous questions that surround the Nodos, the tasks assigned to them, and their purpose in the universe that lead to evolution of several major supporting roles on both sides of the war. In addition to this the series clearly highlights the dual nature of humanity as both protectors and destroyers - which is something of a rarity in the genre - and the repercussions of these acts have a lasting effect on storyline.Dianeira isn\'t the typical vapid lead female, but she is a bit too kind, trusting and forgiving for her own good - especially where her brothers are concerned. She also displays a great deal of courage on a variety of occasions, not the least of which is her decision to lead the crew of the Argonaut across uncharted space while the two most powerful tribes in the universe try to kill them. Her character is particularly unusual because of the dichotomy of her role - she is both protected by the crew of the Argonaut, but also acts as their guide and protector across space.On the other hand Age is something of a conundrum - which is why there are a few misconceptions about him. He is a teenager who has been young for a very long time (over 120 years), and has an innocent mind but possesses knowledge of the future. He can be charming and endearing at times, but also terrifying in his rage - and his straightforward mentality hides a surprisingly deep character. His childhood with beings who are effectively gods and his years sharing his body with Belcross - a surviving member of the legendary Heroic Tribe - have effectively isolated him from the race  that he is fated to protect, but his carefree attitude and sunny disposition add some much-needed comic relief to the story. More than anything, he is a departure from the usual heroes found in anime as he is not driven by courage or the desire to protect his friends, but by faith in the future that he has been shown.Heroic Age has a lot in common with shows like Battlestar Galactica (the new version), Ulysses 31, Guin Saga, and surprisingly - Shingeki no Kyojin, and fans of those titles may find themselves on familiar ground with the storyline.  The layers of subtext about the nature of man and humanity\'s place in the universe fit very well with the narrative and themes of the show, and the series contains a lot more symbolism than one might expect (the similarity between Dianeira\'s astral projections and the figureheads found on sailing ships, the five tribes being named after Hesiod\'s Ages of Man, the number of labours assigned to each Nodos, and more).The decision to adopt a cerebral approach to a very common theme in science fiction and to follow classical themes and influences has created a space opera that - although formal - adds a dose of intelligence and thoughtfulness to the action and tension. The show may not be for everybody, but those who do give it a chance will understand why the name ""Heroic Age"" is so appropriate. is unbeatable?Heroic Age is set in a future where Earth has been conquered by two alien races that are hell-bent on the total annihilation of the ones they call the ""Iron Tribe"".

Together with the crew of the Argonaut she has journeyed through uncharted areas of the cosmos, and after four long years of searching it seems as though their quest may end on a half-destroyed planet that appears to be cut off from the rest of space.That world is Olone, and upon it lives a young man called Age (and his tentacled friend Food).Science fiction tends to be a pretty common genre in anime, but only a few shows can truly call themselves space operas - and even amongst those Heroic Age is more than a little unusual. Much of the plot has been inspired by greek mythology - in particular the legends surrounding Hercules - and this is very clearly reflected in not just the nomenclature or the tasks given to the Nodos, but also in the language used throughout the series. The narrative adopts a measured, formal tone which may not sit well with viewers who want a frenetic pace and minute-to-minute excitement - even though this approach is fitting because of the heavy classical influencel.That said, Heroic Age does contain a lot of combat and tension, but instead of the usual gung-ho attitude of other space-based anime (certain parts of the Macross and Gundam franchises for example), there\'s a tangible sense of desperation within the series. This stems from the fact that humanity is very clearly outnumbered, outgunned, and vastly inferior in terms of technology - factors which place far more emphasis on the need for a miracle, and like all such things the Nodos are both a blessing and a curse.In terms of design the characters are something of a mixed bag. The clothing for the humans is generally in keeping with the plot (utilitarian outfits for the most part), but their features are often unremarkable. As for the aliens, aside from the insectoid Bronze tribe and Food\'s species on Olone, everyone seems to be humanoid. It would have been nice if a little more imagination had been applied to the other inhabitants of the universe - variety is the spice of life after all. That said, the Nodos are interesting as they look more like an armoured creation of Doctor Moreau - which gives them a degree of familiarity, but also makes them appear far more monstrous than every other alien species.Character animation is surprisingly consistent throughout the series, and while the usage of CG is generally good (the transformation sequences or the pitched space battles for example), there are several moments that are decidedly clumsy in both execution and integration. Thankfully these are relatively minor issues that don\'t really have any impact on proceedings, and the show features some great audio-visual effects and choreography (although the mechanical servo noise used for Belcross has caused some confusion about the Nodos).One of the things that people will remember about Heroic Age is the exceptional music. The score is filled with tracks that appeal to any number of human emotions, and in all honesty the entire soundtrack (especially the main theme), seems to have two main purposes - add to the atmosphere of the story and make the viewer feel just a little bit epic.The opening sequence is a decent compilation of the main characters and a few action scenes, combined with Gravitation by Japanese pop band Angela - and thankfully there\'s almost nothing that could be counted as a spoiler. Each episode ends with Azurite - a melancholy ballad sung by Urakabe Tae - and the accompanying imagery shows Dianeira walking along the shore alone and then floating in space above a planet. Now this may seem like a fairly typical anime closing sequence, but it\'s actually a rather clever bit of foreshadowing that fits very well once the viewer understands the context.Possibly the biggest issue with Heroic Age is the dialogue - in particular because of the formality inherent in the series. The Japanese script is rather cumbersome in its use of language and is filled with repetitions of words and phrases  - sometimes just in one scene. Thankfully this approach fits the tone of the anime and the experienced voice cast have managed to overcome this hurdle to deliver some good performances. Unfortunately the English dub is even more convoluted, and things only get worse with the use of incorrect nomenclature (Dianela should actually be Dianeira - after the wife of Hercules, Age is pronounced Eiji, and so on). It\'s clear that the rewriters have tried too hard to turn the series into an animated saga poem, and many of the voice actors audibly struggle with their lines during certain monologues and declamations.That said, if the viewer is able to move past these issues then they\'re likely to find some rather interesting characters.Heroic Age is filled with lots of people who have their own beliefs and circumstances, but it\'s the numerous questions that surround the Nodos, the tasks assigned to them, and their purpose in the universe that lead to evolution of several major supporting roles on both sides of the war. In addition to this the series clearly highlights the dual nature of humanity as both protectors and destroyers - which is something of a rarity in the genre - and the repercussions of these acts have a lasting effect on storyline.Dianeira isn\'t the typical vapid lead female, but she is a bit too kind, trusting and forgiving for her own good - especially where her brothers are concerned. She also displays a great deal of courage on a variety of occasions, not the least of which is her decision to lead the crew of the Argonaut across uncharted space while the two most powerful tribes in the universe try to kill them. Her character is particularly unusual because of the dichotomy of her role - she is both protected by the crew of the Argonaut, but also acts as their guide and protector across space.On the other hand Age is something of a conundrum - which is why there are a few misconceptions about him. He is a teenager who has been young for a very long time (over 120 years), and has an innocent mind but possesses knowledge of the future. He can be charming and endearing at times, but also terrifying in his rage - and his straightforward mentality hides a surprisingly deep character. His childhood with beings who are effectively gods and his years sharing his body with Belcross - a surviving member of the legendary Heroic Tribe - have effectively isolated him from the race  that he is fated to protect, but his carefree attitude and sunny disposition add some much-needed comic relief to the story. More than anything, he is a departure from the usual heroes found in anime as he is not driven by courage or the desire to protect his friends, but by faith in the future that he has been shown.Heroic Age has a lot in common with shows like Battlestar Galactica (the new version), Ulysses 31, Guin Saga, and surprisingly - Shingeki no Kyojin, and fans of those titles may find themselves on familiar ground with the storyline.  The layers of subtext about the nature of man and humanity\'s place in the universe fit very well with the narrative and themes of the show, and the series contains a lot more symbolism than one might expect (the similarity between Dianeira\'s astral projections and the figureheads found on sailing ships, the five tribes being named after Hesiod\'s Ages of Man, the number of labours assigned to each Nodos, and more).The decision to adopt a cerebral approach to a very common theme in science fiction and to follow classical themes and influences has created a space opera that - although formal - adds a dose of intelligence and thoughtfulness to the action and tension. The show may not be for everybody, but those who do give it a chance will understand why the name ""Heroic Age"" is so appropriate.', ""Heroic Age is a Space, Sci-fi, Action, Adventure with a story basically about mankind's struggle to exist in the galaxy and to carry out instructions laid out by the Golden Tribe. The basic premise of the story itself is great but not original, but at least it's made easy to understand with the superb intros in the first couple of episode. There happen to be some similarities in this anime's plot and Star Wars IV and some other sci-fi anime; Vandread and Gundam Seed. So this is an anime Star Wars fans can enjoy however don't expect to see any lightsaber duels.The battles in this...anime are pretty spectacular, which is basically composed of thousands of mechs, space fighters and aliens, plus throw in a Nodos or two. These are animated very well which mixes drawn animation and 3DCG and is to the point, where something as insignificant as Age transforming into the Bellcross becomes a spectacle however there will always remain some who won't like the CG. The space battles between huge fleets are amazing but they later lose their affect, when some scenes are later reused. Also when a single Nodos has the power to easily wipe out a planet from the face of the galaxy, it makes all the huge superbly animated space battles seem like such a waste of time.The music is fantastic to listen to with a superb orchestra score that's especially good when it comes to the battles but it lacks variety. The opening theme is also really great and stands out from others I've heard.Overall this anime series had a great deal of potential as the story began to develop however there's a turning point, which stopped the series from living up to its expectation. Apart from the several noticeable flaws, like the characters' personalities, reused battle scenes and illogical story, this was a pretty enjoyable sci-fi series. So don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this however for those who aren't fans of Space anime should steer clear from this one.^_^ anime are pretty spectacular, which is basically composed of thousands of mechs, space fighters and aliens, plus throw in a Nodos or two.

Even though the first few episodes held so much promise for this anime series, the repetition of battles and the boring political talk between plain looking characters is what takes the heroic out of the anime, Heroic Age.The story is your pretty standard inter-galactic war plot, with a few new wrinkles added in to create something original.  The Golden Tribe used to rule over the universe...a long time ago, but with its sudden disappearance, the Silver Tribe has been the dominant one throughout the universe.  However, with the rebellion of the humans, a war breaks out.  The Silver Tribe (superior beings), the Bronze Tribe (humans) and the Iron Tribe (an insect race) are the participants in this war.  What makes the war interesting is the battles fought between Nodos.  The Nodos - a powerful being that looks oddly similar to an Eva - are monsters that are hidden within the soul of people that are from the once-thought extinct Heroic Tribe.  Each Nodos has been sworn to oath set by the Golden Tribe that he/she must fulfill.The character art is boring, enough said.  All of the characters look relatively plain and uninteresting.  And as a result, will not spark much interest in you, as the viewer, and will unfortunately, at times, make you become bored with the anime.  The animation, on the other hand, is pretty good.  A bunch of repeated frames for sure, but compared to the art, it's not so bad.The sound, although nothing remarkable as well, is pretty decent.  There are a few scores which you might start playing in your head a few times.  The voices to all the characters fit them well, but you can sense an apparent lack of emotion in all of them.You'll find your average set of protagonists and antagonists in this anime.  You have your basic good-willed princess, a commander who will fight for her,  and even a big-breasted female general.  Even Age, the main character, is nothing special, as his appearance will undoubtedly look familiar and you'll wish he never got that haircut after the first episode.   Probably the most annoying characters you'll find in this anime is the princess' brothers, who are your typical hungry-power people willing to sacrifice everyone for their gain.  They are a waste of space, in my opinion.Heroic Age would have garnered a bit of a higher score from me if it were not for the extremely uneventful and boring episodes that occur right in the middle of the anime.  The first nine or so shows are interesting, but then after that, there's another nine or ten in which the same thing seems to happen over and over again.  In addition, the constant unemotional speeches from everyone will have you yawning in no time.From the review I have written above, it seems that I made it out so that Heroic Age has no good points whatsoever, which is definitely not true and hence why I haven't given it a 1/10.  The Nodos battles are really epic and its interesting to see what kind of powers and attacks they develop.  You'll also be interested in the hint of love between Princess Deianeira and Age, which is rather amusing to watch.  You'll also see many reference to the Greek Mythology version of the Heroic Age and its always fun to see them and point them out to yourself.In the end, Heroic Age is an anime to be seen if there is nothing else out there that you are interested in and want to pass your time. a long time ago, but with its sudden disappearance, the Silver Tribe has been the dominant one throughout the universe.

Mecha-monsters that constantly fight, a princess who constantly cries and people who keep talking about tribes and “contracts” that don\'t make any sense to anyone, not even to the anime characters themselves. This show fails in a major way by making the show too complex and unintelligible. They didn\'t use their time wisely to explain all of these new concepts to the average-minded viewer, things like, “tribes”  or the importance of the “contracts”,  the nature of these contracts, or go into further details of these “labors”. There was also ZERO character development! No downtime between battles to...any real extent, no history or background of the characters, just that age likes to paint...basically. Boring! I like humans and people and human drama. Where\'s the tension? Where\'s the DRAMA?Of course I love the art and animation, it\'s the same as Gundam SEED which is to say, it\'s pretty good. However, I think this series was really just an showcase for the art concepts and graphics and special F/X. Like why does the Captain\'s room have no walls? It\'s just a bunch of lights and LEDs against the backdrop of space and stars.  Also, the music is not that great, nothing to do back-flips over.The story makes no sense, it\'s all a bunch of mysticism and interplanetary mumbu-jumbo that doesn\'t make sense to anyone outside the anime and they do a terrible job relaying it to the viewer....so there\'s no connection there either!I\'m a character driven person and this show did nothing for me, the characters were trite and clichéd. And you didn\'t get to really see them much at all except when they\'re delivering all these monologues and soliloquies about legends and Golden Tribes, ugh, I was so bored of it all! this show is more about giant space mecha-monsters and spaceships and planets. The character\'s behaviors are severely irrational and underdeveloped. OMG the silver tribe makes me want to barf! Especially the little silver girl/monster, one minute she\'s a cold bossy bitch then suddenly she goes ballistic for no apparent or tangible reason and practically destroys the ""universe"" [ugh, why must everything be on such a grand scale.....so unnecessary!] but then in the next moment she\'s crying saying she so alone, like no one loves her [COULD it be because you\'re a bitch, honey?]. Actually the whole the silver tribe is like this. They\'re supposedly this cold and “logical” people but somehow these emotions are popping up left and right, WTF! The blond princess with the constant crying also gets on my nerves yet ironically she never shod one tear when her both her brothers supposedly got fried.What a boring anime, a lot of fancy F/X and cute character\'s but the story is a hot-ass mess.

For me it is a must see series.Story : 9Though the story may seem a bit classical for those of us who are fans of the sci-fi genre I want to assure you that it is non the less amazing. Yes it is the classic battle between humanity and the alien forces and yes there are heroes/champions for each of the warring factions but despite these cliched details the story is so much more. It is an extraordinary tale that depicts an awe inspiring journey of Age and the Princess towards the future not for the human race...or the Nodos or the other races but for the universe as whole. It kind of reminds me of the journey of Odysseus, the Greek hero who traveled the seas and encountered numerous perils and obstacles in his journey home and towards peace. I can keep going but I could never do justice to the story. In my humble opinion this an epic story filled with action, intrigue, chaos and dozens of feelings.Art : 10The art is another outstanding feature of this series. Though the art is not high class and edgy like newer anime series (Gundam 00, Code Geass, Tengen Toppa etc) it is truly remarkable. It gives off a vibe of older series that were created during the 80'2 and 90's. While watching Heroic Age I was constantly reminded of such series as Space battleship Yamato 2199, Captain Harlock, Gundam Wing etc. of course I do not claim that the art is the same as it was for these older series but that it just gives off a similar vibe. The artists managed to combine to very different art styles into one and the result is truly amazing.Sound : 8The soundtrack was pretty good. The opening and ending songs were well suited for this type of series and they managed to hook the viewer into watching them. The rest of the music throughout the series was very good as well. Each music piece complimented the scenes depicted. Music in this series managed to compliment the story telling and allowed the viewer to receive the anguish, sorrow, determination, joy etc of the characters.Character : 9Each of the main characters was written quite brilliantly. I, as a viewer, was able to follow the actions of our characters very easily. In essence all characters made sense. There was no part that confused me. Of course there were times were I disagreed and even cursed towards my screen but I think overall this fact made the characters more human and more believable. The one small issue I had with the character development is that certain things that occurred in the past were lost in a sense but to explain further I would have to spoil you.Enjoyment & Overall : 10Of course this series deserves a 10 +.

It was once considered by the people of Earth to be the final frontier. A boundless, infinite universe stood just beyond the reaches of our ever advancing technology. We expected there to be life out there in the universe, but we had no way of knowing that by leaving the comfort of our blue planet, we’d be setting foot into a game of celestial thrones that was already eons in the making. As we entered this conflict, forced into the struggle for galactic dominance, we were dubbed the iron tribe. But with the regal albinos of the Silver tribe and the larvae-looking Bronze tribe...teaming up against us, we were faced with the inevitability of not just defeat... But extinction.That is, until one fateful day when Dhianeilla, the princess of the human race, and the crew of her space ship The Argonaut stumbled across a half-destroyed planet, inhabited predominately by terrestrial squids. Living amongst the squids, they found a childlike young man; Savage in appearance yet kind of heart, his name was Age, and he alone possessed the ability to defend us against the worst that our enemies could dish out. But will this curious young savior be enough? Is he strong enough to bring about an end to this horrible war? Is he heroic enough to do so with as little bloodshed as possible? Or will he fail, dooming us to obscurity? One thing is certain: Without Age, this frontier truly will be our final one.Studio Xebec is a name that I’ve often heard spoken in painful, frustrated tones by many different reviewers. And hey, it’s time to add my name to that list. If animation studios were being sold in the supermarket, Xebec would be the store-brand option... I’m talking Great Value levels of cheapness. They’re the same company that produced Love Hina and the first Negima series, and the 2D animation in Heroic Age is a slight improvement over those works, with much better use of coloring, but as far as basic animation goes, this is pretty much the same stiff, lifeless crap that we’ve become used to seeing from them.Having said that, I’m still going to give credit where credit is due. The animation looks awful whenever characters are on screen, or with any shots that take place on land or inside the space ships, but when we leave those setting and venture out into open space, the switch in visual quality is like night-and-day. The 3D animation in Heroic Age is nothing short of beautiful. This series came out in 2007, so the CG looks a little dated, but it still holds up really well. The spaceships themselves look awesome at all times, but what’ll really catch your eye is the expansive outer-space backgrounds, which are full of life and color... Although when it’s sharing screen time with the 2D characters, the styles really don’t mesh well together.As far as the character designs go, there’s very little inspiration or originality here. The silver tribe... The primary antagonists of the series... Are emotionless, so of course they all have long white hair. Yeah, if you haven’t seen an anime where the villain had long white hair, then you don’t watch much anime. There are several characters who appear to have had their aesthetic lifted directly out of Leiji Matsumoto’s sketchbook, and thinking back, the only designs that really stand out are that of Age and a few less humanoid aliens, such as the bronze tribe and his squid friends.Oddly enough, the one aspect of the character design that stands out in my memory is the sheer number of baffling choices that the creators made in regard to the female characters’ uniforms. On the low end of the scale, you have several members of Dhianeila’s crew... Including the princess herself... Who are wearing uniforms so skin-tight that you’d swear they were painted on. I actually kind of wish that were the case, because otherwise, those poor girls are experiencing the most uncomfortable wedgies in human history. That, and somehow the suits indent enough to show off their belly buttons. On the high end of the scale, there are a few high-ranking female characters whose outfits were designed to have gaping, cleavage-baring holes in the front, and I would LOVE to hear the practical applications of this dress-code choice. I highly doubt they did that for the sake of sexiness or fan-service, because with Xebec’s art quality, one poor character’s cleavage looks more like ass-cheeks than anything else in most shots.The music is your standard sci-fi fantasy fare... If you’ve seen any anime like this, you’ve heard soundtracks exactly like this...  But the English dub, on the other hand, is much more unique. I’ve heard quite a few bad dubs from Funimation before. I’ve heard them release dubs that were written poorly, directed poorly, or cast poorly. But through it all, I’ve always felt that they were at least trying. No, phoned-in dubs were always more of an ADV thing than a Funimation thing. Heroic Age is the first dub I’ve heard from them where it sounds like most of the people involved just didn’t care.In a cast full of late-2000s Funimation regulars, there are several actors who didn’t have to reach very far into their bags of stock voices to find the right one for their respective characters. Monica Rial plays her usual squeaky-cheerful voice, aged up slightly for the dual roles of the twins Mail and Tail. Luci Christian raises her voice ever so slightly for the role of Dhianeila’s personal attendant Aneasha, and Greg Ayres does his usual Greg Ayres thing for the meek Mehitak. Think Negi Springfield, but without the accent. Colleen Clinikenbeard plays another deep-voiced tough woman, Christopher Sabat plays what he likes to call a ‘coffee break role,’ and so on and so forth.Vic Mignona plays a scheming antagonist, which is fun to listen to, but he barely gets any lines. The only actors who seem to have brought any genuine effort to the table are Cherami Leigh, who plays the tortured Lekty, a member of the Silver Tribe who slowly learns affection and emotion with the help of a fellow Nodos who’s been tasked with protecting her... Cherami put out a compelling amount of pain through this character’s development... And Brina Palencia, who gracefully dances the line between adorable mascot and helpful navigator in her role as the ship’s AI system, Bee No Bee.And then you have the two main voice actors. I don’t even know where to begin with this one. J Michael Tatum plays the titular character, and it’s probably the only time I’ve ever heard him attempt to do a high-pitched, wistful voice. Thank God for that. Every single line he utters sounds like he’s making fun of Johnny Yong Bosch. Tatum generally has a very pleasant, soothing voice, and his performance as Age is proof that he should stick to that voice as often as possible.And yet, his female co-star is still worse. Caitlin Glass plays the role of Princess Dhianeila, and I am sorry to say this about any character voiced by her, but she will put you right the hell to sleep. She gives monotone a new meaning with her soft-voiced, droning delivery. She sounds like a lazy LOTR-style opening narration, which makes it even more grating to the attention span when she doles out exposition about long-winded prophecies or soliloquies about Age's feelings.Together, these two voice actors turn the series into a boring, dull slog that’s often a chore to watch. They have absolutely no chemistry, which is insane because... And I can’t stress this enough... They’re the voice actors for Isaac and Miria in Baccano. Yeah, these two one-note windbags are directly linked to the most electrifying and entertaining couple in anime history. This is the only thing that ever surprised me about this series. The Japanese actors for both characters are far superior, able to hit the same basic tones while showing so much more personality in the process.The show had a whole slew of people working on the adaptive writing, and yes, it feels it. There were several different writers and ADR directors taking turns like a revolving door, and out of the three script writers attached to the project, two of them were actually good. I’ve always known Monica Rial to be a talented writer, and she’s always been able to adapt material in such a way that it’s accessible without losing it’s intent or meaning. I’m new to Brandon Potter, but he did a decent job as well.It’s when we talk about the third writer... J Michael Tatum... That we run into some serious problems. He’s a generally well-liked actor, and rightfully so... But when it comes to scripting a dub, he’s become notorious for over-writing. My least favorite kind of writers are the ones who think they’re better than the material, and take every possible opportunity to make themselves look like the cleverest person in the room, which Tatum does by replacing subtle and in-character dialogue with over-used cliches, purple prose, and bizarrely out-of-place idioms that make a mockery of the text while, in some cases, changing the intent of it all together.Here, I’ll give you an example from episode sixteen. At one point, one of Age’s enemies is defeated, and brought onto the Argonaut. When confronting Age, he expresses reluctance to the idea of fighting him again, and is relieved when he hears that they don’t have to. This makes sense in character, because this guy’s always been pacifistic throughout the story, and the idea of engaging in an all out brawl with Age in the middle of a populated spaceship will cause countless casualties. But in the dub, Tatun changes his line to “So, you’re not going to hurt me?” Down-grading it from a sentiment of compassion to a sentiment of selfish cowardice. And yes, there are worse examples in here. Definitely stick to the subtitles on this one.I’ve been putting off reviewing this series for a few years now... No exaggeration there, I’m dead serious... And in that time, it’s always been floating over my head as something I would have to tackle eventually. But there were two problems. The first one was that I didn’t know if I’d be able to watch it all the way through a second time. And the second was that, as many problems as I have with it, I had no idea how I was going to present my biggest problems with this series. So now that the time has finally come, I think I’m going to start with the problem that I like to bring up whenever someone asks me why I didn’t like this series... Let’s talk about the title character.Age is a kind-hearted, childish savage who’s not human by birth. He’s one of the last surviving remnants of a tyrannical race of warriors that were almost completely wiped out by a more powerful force. He’s picked up by a crew consisting of mostly humans, and a lot of quirky hijinks ensue as a result of their many differences. It’s eventually revealed that he has the ability to transform into a giant, ferocious monster with it’s own name that’s unique to his, and he has to fight the other few remnants of his species if he wants to protect the human race from extinction. In other words, he’s Goku. Yup. Just Goku. He doesn’t have the personality, depth, or charm of Goku, but when you get right down to it, he was ripped wholesale out of the DBZ universe.Now, is unoriginality a bad thing? Not necessarily. Bleach ripped it’s initial premise straight out of Yuyu Hakusho, and I actually like the first three seasons of Bleach MORE than it’s predecessor. But then you have my next problem... Heroic Age is really stupid. This show knows about as much about outer space physics as I did in elementary school. There are plenty of rules you’re allowed to break in science fiction... Sound and color don’t exist in space, but very few Sci-fis care about that. Heroic Age breaks the rules you’re allowed to break, as well as the ones you aren’t. Not only do many of the characters move through open space as though they were swimming under-water, but in episode two, we see the main character digging a hole through the hull of the Argonaut in order to attack the villains waiting outside.Hey, do you remember Jason X, the Friday the 13th movie where Jason Voorhies kills a bunch of people in outer space? Pretty cool, huh? One of the characters was killed when Jason broke a hole in the hull from outside, and she was sucked through that hole. That was the dumbest movie in an entire franchise of dumb movies, but even THAT story knew that when you compromise the hull of a space ship, shit goes terribly wrong. Also, I get that Age and the other Nodos can breathe in space, but an inhuman biology doesn’t explain outer space wind blowing through their hair. Someone had to animate that.But much like unoriginality, stupidity is not a deal breaker. There are plenty of shows that were awesome, despite having the IQ of mayonnaise, but they usually offer up some redeeming qualities to make up for it. Gurren Lagann is stupid, but it has so much energy and confidence that you just can’t help but believe in it. Knights of Sidonia is incredibly stupid... Probably even more so than Age, now that I think about it... But it’s so creative and sincere that it honestly just comes off as fun and adorable. Heroic Age doesn’t have anything like that. In fact, rather than making up for it’s stupidity, it compounds that problem with it’s insistence on looking smarter and deeper than it actually is.At the start of this review, I gave a heavily simplified(and not 100% accurate) plot summary of this series. What I left out was all the over-complicated pulp. Heroic Age goes up it’s own ass to establish a long-winded and often self-contradictory lore about the many tribes vying for control of the universe, which never serves as anything other than an explanation for the setting. There are scattered references to Greek mythology, namely to the five ages of man, but these references are in name alone, and the tribes named after them have little to nothing to do with the ages they correspond to. The only reason Age is a descendant of the Heroic Age is because the creators wanted to emphasize how heroic HE was, never mind the fact that they’re also comparing a brutal race of murderers to one of the most noble ages of the five. The tribes could just have easily been named after different ice cream brands, with the show being called Haagen-Daas Age, and it would have had just as much depth to it.But is pretending to have depth or meaning a deal breaker? Not on it’s own, but I’m sorry, ‘stupid’ and ‘pretentious’ are not good bed-fellows. This show would have been a lot easier to watch if it had dropped all attempts at undeserved profundity, and had just told the simple story that I mentioned earlier... Only it wouldn’t, because of this series’ final, and biggest, problem. Heroic Age, at it’s core, is just very badly written.There are a ton of characters floating around in it, but Age is the only one who even gets the slightest hint of a backstory, and not one of them have any complex motivations. The two main characters... Age and Dhianeilla... have no personality outside of the fact that they’re good people who are always right about everything, and everyone else just exists to support or oppose them. I’ve seen this show twice, and I cannot describe a single one of it’s characters with anything more than a two-sentence explanation of what they are and who they’re connected to.And it apparently isn’t enough that I don’t feel invested in any of the characters... I can’t even enjoy the action of these epic space battles because of how muddled and poorly edited these multi-episode set pieces are. You’ll notice quickly that during these long battles, there is a LOT going on, at many different locations, involving many different characters, often at different times. You’ll get a few seconds of Age fighting his brethren, followed by a cut to Princess Expositia explaining to us what he’s going through, followed by a cut to the political squabble involving her scheming brothers, to a cut to the other Nodos’ loitering around and discussing their lot in life, to a conversation someone had with Age earlier, and by the time they finally cut back to Age’s fight in current time, I’ve all but forgotten what he was doing there in the first place, which is the final nail in the coffin for a series I had to struggle to care about.Herioic Age is available from Funimation. The old releases are still available in relatively affordable halves, but you can get a much better deal by going with the SAVE release, which you can find pretty much anywhere for between fifteen and twenty dollars. The manga, which released it’s first volume during the initial run of the series, is pretty much the same story told from another character’s perspective, and it’s not available in the states.I don’t like Heroic Age. I also don’t hate Heroic Age. Hell, I don’t anything Heroic Age. I gained nothing from this series, and in exchange, I lost way too much time on a series that I’m going to forget in less than a week. It’s biggest crime isn’t the fact that it’s stupid, pretentious, badly animated, or generic. It’s biggest crime is that it’s boring. I can stare at the screen for several episodes in a row, with no distractions, and I still have to constantly rewind to pick up on what the hell I missed in regard to what’s happening. I’m glad to finally put this turkey behind me, and I look forward to forgetting it exists. I give Heroic Age a 3/10. teaming up against us, we were faced with the inevitability of not just defeat... But extinction.That is, until one fateful day when Dhianeilla, the princess of the human race, and the crew of her space ship The Argonaut stumbled across a half-destroyed planet, inhabited predominately by terrestrial squids. Living amongst the squids, they found a childlike young man; Savage in appearance yet kind of heart, his name was Age, and he alone possessed the ability to defend us against the worst that our enemies could dish out. But will this curious young savior be enough? Is he strong enough to bring about an end to this horrible war? Is he heroic enough to do so with as little bloodshed as possible? Or will he fail, dooming us to obscurity? One thing is certain: Without Age, this frontier truly will be our final one.Studio Xebec is a name that I’ve often heard spoken in painful, frustrated tones by many different reviewers. And hey, it’s time to add my name to that list. If animation studios were being sold in the supermarket, Xebec would be the store-brand option... I’m talking Great Value levels of cheapness. They’re the same company that produced Love Hina and the first Negima series, and the 2D animation in Heroic Age is a slight improvement over those works, with much better use of coloring, but as far as basic animation goes, this is pretty much the same stiff, lifeless crap that we’ve become used to seeing from them.Having said that, I’m still going to give credit where credit is due. The animation looks awful whenever characters are on screen, or with any shots that take place on land or inside the space ships, but when we leave those setting and venture out into open space, the switch in visual quality is like night-and-day. The 3D animation in Heroic Age is nothing short of beautiful. This series came out in 2007, so the CG looks a little dated, but it still holds up really well. The spaceships themselves look awesome at all times, but what’ll really catch your eye is the expansive outer-space backgrounds, which are full of life and color...

I give Heroic Age a 3/10."", ""There are some many things wrong with this show.It's a futuristic anime, done with the same animation tpe as the Gundam Seed and Destiny. The Gold Race set at a call to all intelligent races to enter space. There's the human race, known as the Iron Race, the Silver Race, the Heroic Race, and the Bronze Race anwser the call. Time passes and the Gold Race as left for another universe. The Heroic Race has disappeared. The Silver Race has taken power, with the help of the Bronze Race. In order to save the human race princess Deianeira travels to the far distant galaxy for...their savior of the prophecies. They find a boy named Age who could help bring the human race to power.I really started out liking this anime, in one of my earlier blogs I even thought I would give it a 8, 9, or 10. Boy was I wrong, and disappointed in Heroic Age. Lets go over the things that are wrong with this anime. First the overall story started out with a good premise, but quickly became convoluted and incoherent. Than there's the one dimensional characters that have no depth to them. Finally there's the animation and battles. Both reminded me of Gundam Seed/Destiny, the more I watched. I swear the animation looks exactly like Gundam Seed/Destiny even though it's animated by different companies. I thought I was watching Gundam Seed/Destiny as I watched the battles. They were overblown big time, and ridiculous. Heroic Age had potential to be great, but let things go down hill fast. their savior of the prophecies.

The tale revolves around a ship of the iron tribe(humans) and their journey through war fighting and discovery.The story is quite different from your usual futuristic anime, somethings like gundam  where you get several different parties fighting in a war. And the ultimate weapons instead of gundams are the heroic tribe which are people who can turn into big fighting robots. Though there is a dabble of fate and destiny in the story...i found it quite touching. There is a bit of romance which is only evident late in the anime, so don't expect much from romance in this anime. But it is quite a good story nonetheless with a deep meaning.The art is quite similar to thatd of gundam seed you could say the main female lead looks like lacus clyne in gundam seed. I find this style of anime quite to my liking and there are no flaws in the anime,the scenaries are done up quite nicely.The songs of the anime are quite good. I was especially entranced by the ending song Azurite, which was an insert song in certain episodes, this really brought out the mood of the setting and it was very sentimental and touching, the insert songs were done up quite well so i applaud the studio for their effort.The characters have some depth and carry a lot of meaning in their words and actions. The story focuses a lot of the main characters and the supporting characters are not so important. Morality is a a question that many of the characters think of and then theres the theme of fate and destiny and how the characters react to them. In the end, the characters each have thier roles to play to create a new path.I enjoyed the anime because of the meaning that was portrayed in the anime. The fight scenes were also quite extravagant and i found it quite touching so it was generally quite entertaining, Though not the best since im a drama-romance fan, though there is a good deal of drama in this show.Overall, i think the anime is worth watching, if you like action and adventure you will like this, the anime is not so much a mecha show though,so mecha fans should not have too high hopes for this. i found it quite touching.

As a french person it\'s always very easy for me.I watch this serie by pure random choice on animeultima.com. I was searching for a sci-fi show and I notice that the art character were done by Hisashi Hirai, who\'s one of my favorite character designer. So I watch the show without understanding a lot of things at the beginning and it turns out to be one of the greatest sci-fi show I ever watch ( including anime and real tv serie/movie).Story: I\'m not going to describe the story (after all, you read the synopsis, don\'t you?). The story began with...an easy cliché: the only human raised by the golden race is the saviour of humanity, because he is the most powerfull of the five Nodos (space godzilla... just kidding). But I dindn\'t mind this cliché. The story follows a path of originality that I like. My only little complain: the Nodos are pretty much invicible and uber-powerfull. At least, there\'s a good reason why there are like this. Some people complain about this show for being to slow for his first half. I know this is not the most fast-paced action you can get, but it\'s a built up for an extremely good ending.Story: For it\'s originality, despite some ""slow moments"", 9/10Art: A lot of ships were pretty well designed. The Argonaut is an awesome ship, the Silver Race have weird design, but I don\'t understand their bridge at all. The Bronze Race are some zerg caterpillars with acid attack. Although the ships can be more colored (silver, green and silver again), I  can\'t bring myself to hate this design.Art: 8/10Sound: One word: EARGASM!! An absolutely amazing soundtrack. The opening made by Angela (soukyuu no fafner, asura cryin\') is an outstanding one. The ending is really cool. The soundtrack is a kickass one. If you have the chance to watch this show on a surronded system your gonna cry in joy. I tried it, it\'s totaly awesome.Sound: 10/10Character: An interresting cast with some ""dicks"" ( Dhianeila\'s brothers). Age is amusing for the most part, ignoring what\'s number, but understand every single words that Dhianeila tells him. Some people complain (again?!) about Age and Dhianeila for being almost ""perfect"" character. I can understand Age (although I don\'t agree), but I can\'t understand Dhianeila. She\'s not perfect, she just know when to take the right decision like a wise and old           captain (just kidding). I\'ll just say that this show needed a little bit more of background about his cast. The design of the characters is very good, but I think Hisashi Hirai need to put just a little bit of originality in his creations. Even so, I like his way of drawning.Characters: 8/10Enjoyement: I had a lot of fun watching this show. I was always looking forward to the next episode and I was never disappointed. The first half let you know what\'s going on and the second half kicks out with those big confrontations of flleet battles. An absolute fun watch!!Enjoyement: 10/10Overall: I don\'t understand why this show is so unknow to the anime public. You should try this show and then judge it. Of course, you need to like a little bit the sci-fi universe, but I can recommand this show to everyone. Just watch it and judge it.

This anime is like Gundam meets Tarzan as we experience the wild antics of Age, a prodigy with the powers of the Hero tribe. Along with the magical components of this story, everything else falls into place without any set-backs. VERY light humor sets a realistic feeling tone and travel through space makes it feel like problems are only a step away, seeing as everybody travels in the same space ship.The actual parts and details of the story differ...though. Let\'s break this down:1) Action-Fight scenes all have their own luster with a uniform style. Each scenario has some crucial detail that gives a fight it\'s own essence.2) Humor-The very short scenes are heavily outweighed by the drama so their abilities to reach you are easily outweighed. But I have to admit there are very rare moments where you will laugh.3) Romance-Surprisingly, it is really good, but you have to step back after finishing the series to really appreciate it. Yeah, if you pay attention you would notice the cliff hanging love suspense, but it can be easily confused for drama.Overall 10/10; I don\' t recommend this to everybody though, stick to your preferred dramas if you don\'t like those ""traveling"" animes. The story here is really reminiscent of Gundam Seed/Destiny if you know what I mean. though. Let\'s break this down:1) Action-Fight scenes all have their own luster with a uniform style.

However, it has arich story that derives many of its elements from Greek mythology, ecspecially Hercules. The plot itself has enough twists, turns, and tragedy to keep the audience wanting more, after the initial start-up period of about ten episodes. Yes, that\'s right, it has a slow start. A VERY slow start. Regardless, once it gets going it is hard to stop watching, unless you\'re Jupiter (inside joke). I can honestly say it is one of the msot clever loose adaptions I have ever seen.Art""Heroic Age"" incorporates so much CGI into their animation...tat sometimes it\'s hard to tell what is handdrawn. Usually, I would disdain from this practice but this time around I didn\'t mind it so much. It may just be because I am growing weary of arguing for handdrawn and against CG. The character desgins and other 2D aspects of it are done well, some characters are pretty generic but others really stay with you: Age, Mehitaka, ect. Also, the Heroic Race\'s mech desgins (though they are technically not mechs) are some of the most original and I must say, BADASS, desgins I have ever seen. Bellecross, ecspecially.SoundNothing special sound wise. The opening theme is good, catchy even, but not really memorable. Any background music suits the show but isn\'t a draw. Voice acting is good, they really had a talented group of actors. Yui Ishikawa did a wonderful job with Princess Dhianeila.CharacterWhat I really like about ""Heroic Age"" is that, like many Miyazaki films, it is devoid of any true villians. There are people who do villionous things (Rome Ro, Dhianeila\'s elder Brothers) but everyone are really just people with their own agendas. All the characters feel as if they are acting int hte best interest of their people, no one is out to destroy the world.Overall, ""Heroic Age"" is a wonderful series. It does has a slow start and has sort of an acquired sci-fi taste. It isn\'t for everyone, I would reccomend ir more to sci-fi fans more than traditional anime fans.

I really loved it! You can really tell that the writer putted a lot of effort into it the knowledge the idea of space battle is unheard of well mostly! The writer even put down the Type of Civilization (You can find more information on YouTube). There are 7 types of civilization or more actually there are more, I only know till type 7! We are not even in 1st type of civilization (I mean us)! 🤣 In first type of civilization we...can travel through spaceships, etc. Just like what in anime Bronze tribe is doing! Type 2 civilization can hardness the power of planets and use those resources etc! The 3rd Type of Civilization uses a Dyson sphere around the star's, sun's, planet's & even Galaxy's they can harness energy from them and that's what the Golden tribes are doing! And of course there are more Type of civilization remember there are 7 but in this anime its only 3 so we won't talk about those! So you can already imagine the concept putted in here it's all a theory which is already been thought of by the scientist but who would have known that these type of theory will be putted in anime! Just magnificent!🗿Now after watching the anime I think I know why the golden tribes decided to to all this they wanted to see if we are worthy enough to hole there legacy and not only that golden tribes wisdom is so amazing, I think they saw through there future! They know this was going to happened! And now I am confused again because in the end age opened up the portal and oped the another universe! So where did age go? And another question is the Golden tribe still alive behind that new universe? I really want to know come on this can't end like this! I really want a second season! But guess it's not going to happen but I hope one day or another someone makes a second season of this anime! I am glad I watched this anime!Overall I really want a second season it might ruin the anime but I really wana a know what happens next!

I havent seen a anime anything like this, sure theres alot of space,save the planet type animes but this one took that basic idea and came up with a amazing version. The basics may be the same but the rest was unique to this anime. The anime itself got straight to the point, within the first episode you understood a bit of what this anime was going to be like. The anime was an all around amazing achievment in a sworm of clique anime's it certainly stood out.~Art~I can't say this was the best are because it wasnt, it was...amazing but sometimes the battle scenes when the two people clashed it was a little hard to make out but only once or twice so other than that it was an amazing mix of 2D and 3D!~Sound~The music for the anime was...not great, it was a little repetitive but the sound effects for the anime itself was spot on and if you were on a space ship getting attacked this is certainly what i imagine it would sound like.~Character~Now, All the characters were unique in their own way. Instead of a big macho or cool and collected main male role the male was like a new born child in the begining and you could see him grow, guess thats what happens when your stuck alone on a planet for god knows how many years and have never learned the basics. Hes refered to as a monkey alot, i loved him. The rest of the characters were a little shallow but were amazinly well developed. The only characters that annoyed me were the Princess's two brothers, i was hoping they would die the whole time.~Enjoyment~A-M-A-Z-I-N-G The anime was fabulous to watch and kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The characters were badass icons that will be remembered forever for their awesome display of the future of anime.~Overall~Overall i would give it a 9/10, the only reason i dont give it a 10 is because the ending didnt explain much but its the only way it could have ended.

I am lucky and blessed to stumble upon such a beautiful masterpiece.The story is somewhat intriguing, it makes you wanna fall at the edge of your seat as you anticipate every episode, fearing for what will happen next.The story is based upon the threat of extinction of all humankind along with the struggles of political, military, space, survival and superpowers (Planetary Destruction kind of power).Three superior races, the silver tribe and the bronze tribe along with the relics of...the all powerful heroic tribe, who was forced to serve inferior beings as a punishment due to their wild behavior by the golden tribe, converge against such a newly primitive race (humankind/iron tribe) thus forcing the humans to leave earth to search for a new hope on far away galaxies. To prevent such demise, a princess took the call to search for the one who has been prophesied by an ancient race (the golden tribe) a 120 years ago before leaving. He is said to be the one who will save all humanity carrying a huge burden along with his 12 labors that must be done no matter what at all costs. But against all odds, political and other entities that threats their very existence, they all persevere towards the end. Kodus to such a very well laid story, i really appreciate it.Although the anime does not say any romance in it, but actually, it does, it has some cute moments. The ending is beautiful and i like to think that it is just the begining. I am really hoping for a second season.The characters are quite interesting, the art is not that beautiful and lovely but the animation sure does makes me wanna see more action.So that is all i have to say, this anime now belongs to one of my favorites, a 10/10. the all powerful heroic tribe, who was forced to serve inferior beings as a punishment due to their wild behavior by the golden tribe, converge against such a newly primitive race (humankind/iron tribe) thus forcing the humans to leave earth to search for a new hope on far away galaxies.

The content provided was so engaging, that it comprehensively ensured that it made itself clear in what it was trying to achieve, which is shown in the penultimate conclusion that may be questionable to some. The unexpected mystery elements added to the plot was intriguing to the viewer, as it constantly allowed us to internally ask questions which in hindsight, were not that difficult to answer as the story progressed.Story...-To summarise, the anime mainly revolves around an inter-tribal conflict that is occurring in the universe ever since the departure of the Tribe of Gold (ToG) who were the predominantly key figures in the past. The Tribe of Silver (ToS), in the absence of ToG have declared they would claim the entire universe for themselves, presumably as an act of responsibility as they are the most technologically advanced. The ToS and the Tribe of Bronze are seen trying to eliminate the Tribe of Iron (aka humankind), as they are seen as being detrimental to their goals who pose of a great threat.An expedition force led by humanity’s representative, Dhianeila, travels to the deserted and ruined planet Olone in search for the saviour mentioned by the ToG. The 5th Nodos named Age, has the 12 agreements mentioned by the ToG to fulfil for humankind in an attempt to bring back stability to the universe, by retaliating against the ToS’s aggression. The acquisition of Age mainly sees him encountering the other Nodos (each with their own agreements as well) who are beings that possess extraordinary powers (transforming to alien-mechs) that are immune to standard attacks. In other words, they are basically the trump card that can effectively decide the outcome of the battle(s). The game changer is when a certain conclusion is made after thorough analysis that signals an end to the situation at hand.Characters -The characters were numerous to say the least but my biggest gripe would be was that there wasn’t that much depth to them besides the main protagonist duo of Age and Dhianeila who play a pivotal role. One thing I very much enjoyed about this show, was the different angles explored when deciding the motives of certain individuals with clear emphasis placed on the Nodos and their importance. The opposition Nodos who are seen forced to fight for the ToS had dire circumstances, which is seen through the blackmail created from the exploitation of their agreements.The characters on the side of humankind mainly consisted of experienced military personnel who have sworn absolute loyalty to the princess Dhianeila. People like Iolaous and his family were interesting to watch however they were mainly insignificant and played only a bit-part role in support. Dhianeila’s brothers who are supposedly first rate politicians were amusing as they were comical for majority of time especially every whenever they failed as a military commander. On the opposite side of the spectrum were the leaders of the ToS, namely the O family governed by Prome and Prathe with Rom Rar being an advisor.

The Tribe of Silver (ToS), in the absence of ToG have declared they would claim the entire universe for themselves, presumably as an act of responsibility as they are the most technologically advanced. The ToS and the Tribe of Bronze are seen trying to eliminate the Tribe of Iron (aka humankind), as they are seen as being detrimental to their goals who pose of a great threat.An expedition force led by humanity’s representative, Dhianeila, travels to the deserted and ruined planet Olone in search for the saviour mentioned by the ToG. The 5th Nodos named Age, has the 12 agreements mentioned by the ToG to fulfil for humankind in an attempt to bring back stability to the universe, by retaliating against the ToS’s aggression. The acquisition of Age mainly sees him encountering the other Nodos (each with their own agreements as well) who are beings that possess extraordinary powers (transforming to alien-mechs) that are immune to standard attacks. In other words, they are basically the trump card that can effectively decide the outcome of the battle(s). The game changer is when a certain conclusion is made after thorough analysis that signals an end to the situation at hand.Characters -The characters were numerous to say the least but my biggest gripe would be was that there wasn’t that much depth to them besides the main protagonist duo of Age and Dhianeila who play a pivotal role. One thing I very much enjoyed about this show, was the different angles explored when deciding the motives of certain individuals with clear emphasis placed on the Nodos and their importance. The opposition Nodos who are seen forced to fight for the ToS had dire circumstances, which is seen through the blackmail created from the exploitation of their agreements.The characters on the side of humankind mainly consisted of experienced military personnel who have sworn absolute loyalty to the princess Dhianeila. People like Iolaous and his family were interesting to watch however they were mainly insignificant and played only a bit-part role in support. Dhianeila’s brothers who are supposedly first rate politicians were amusing as they were comical for majority of time especially every whenever they failed as a military commander. On the opposite side of the spectrum were the leaders of the ToS, namely the O family governed by Prome and Prathe with Rom Rar being an advisor.

Every battle is big with an enormous amount of human soldiers, ships, and alien species. As the series progresses the battles get bigger, more impressive and much more destructive. Personally I feel like based on the battles alone I feel like this anime is worth...at least checking out. Also while this is considered a Mecha in some regards, its done in a much similar way it is done in Code Geass, where the Mechs are just this anime's version of a super soldier and are just as destructible as anything else is, which I feel is much more exciting.The characters in the series are nothing too special, and are none too unique, but there are a few characters that you will get attached to and that's when the series picks up, because then it matters to you if they die.As far as music goes, the only song of interest is the opening which is very good, but not so much so that it worthy of extra special note (other than this one of course) but nonetheless is a catchy tune and you will find yourself listening to it out of choice at the beginning of each episode.Overall, the story and characters are nothing new but are done well so while you have a good idea how the series will end, the journey itself is the most enjoyable part. I'd recommend this anime simply based on the battles alone, they are so big and impressive that they (with good reason) take center stage. If you have the time and are in the mood for an epic space survival full of large scale battle, give this one a try, because personally I never get tired of it. at least checking out.

There are no major twist, the characters have very specific roles in it, so you know where everything is going to go, and that makes it a chore to watch.Animation and sound, both are fine. Nothing really spectacular, the design for the mecha is a little generic, but they move nicely during combat or...other scenes. One highlight are the ships, they look distinct and fit the personality of each race.Characters, this is the terrible part. None of the characters have any real dimension to their personalities, they have one motivation each, and for 80% of the cast it does not change, so there is no arch for anyone, their lives move in a flat line. Specially that dam princess, who is the biggest cliche of all and I cannot really stand her at all.To have a good space opera you either focus on the characters, making the world generic, or zoom to the world and make the characters just archetypes, but certainly not both. This is the case with this anime, the two parts are generic and thus boring. I would recommend to give it a pass. other scenes.

The story does not tell us about how The Golden Tribe came into existence and gained tremendous power but since it revolves around The Iron Tribe and The Silver Tribe it isn't needed.The ending was superb.

The design of the characters including the alien species, the ships, etc are good and the battles are believable.

Other than that overall, sound is average.Character - I felt the characters were pretty good, I really got accustomed to Age very quickly.  I did find Dhianelia a bit unbelievable, it might be an anime but no person is ever as nice as she is. The only other problem is Dhianelia's brothers who really will pee you off but I guess they are neccesary to show that there will always be people out thier who will sacrifice anything for power and influence.Enjoyment - Overall, it is a very good anime that is IF you can overlook the Dhianielia's brothers that is. The battles are big, enjoyable and aren't just resolved in 1 episode. I would definitely ask people to give this a go...

They aren't badly acted or written, they just are. The cast of Heroic age is very dull. From the script to the acting no one feels like there really there. Central to this cast is Age, the protagonist. The unaware, naive, aloof but powerful lead has been done before but they usually need strong personalities around to contrast them. Instead Heroic Age has an amorphous blob of exchangeable GI Joes and an enabling akunamatata style princess in charge of the whole shebang. Age puts humanity in serious danger on multiple occasions and is never confronted about it with any conviction. No one on humanities last ditch fleet to find earth 2.0 has any balls.When the crew isn't on screen de-saturating, we either get a series of Gundam/Macross era space battles, or dramatic irony in the form of dark space room conversations between the enemy god people. Though not appalling the battles are nothing spectacular and are severly hampered by 3D. There is a reason why top rated series that use 3D make it look hand drawn. No Fractals i can make in c4d look as nice as something a proper animator can draw. 3D works best with an enormous budget or an entire work rendered in it. Half measures don't cut it.Speaking of half measures. The Gold Tribe punished the Heroic Tribe for causing chaos. They destroyed all but 3. Those three would each protect a remaining tibe. The gold tribe left the universe and passed their knowledge to the Silver Tribe. The Silver tribe decided to destroy the Iron Tribe with the help of the Bronze tribe. That is the back story. The most unique thing Heroic Age has to offer story wise is that the leftover heroic's got their own name, Nodos. The ship is even names the Argonaut. Nothing is unique or exciting about any of this. It's as though no one even tried to get me to care.I watched this back when I was naive enough to push through a series I didn't care about just because. Heroic Age is not a bad series. I have watched bad series. I watched fucking basquash! But for the life of me I cannot find a reason why i would ever recommend Heroic Age.-Docbrown - Otakucenter.com - Reveiw Squad"", ""Heroic Age is a great anime series.  It is made to feel epic and serious with battles and characters that offer food for thought.  I am rating this show at 9 out 10.  The only flaw is the ending but that is a common theme in anime in general.  The Japanese tend to over-think the ending of their stories in general - that is nothing new.But aside from the ending which could have been clearer, this show will be enjoyed by people that like self-scarifying heroes, fighting, virtuous themes and purity of character.  Don't look for extensive comedy or high-school...drama here.  The soundtrack is well done and the theme itself is quite catchy.  The main characters are thoughtfully created and stay true to their nature throughout (i.e. they are dependable).  I see it as an uplifting and grounding show in today's fast-paced, confusing world.  A reminder that the goal of life must be grander than downloading the newest apps on your beloved cell phone. drama here.  The soundtrack is well done and the theme itself is quite catchy.

The sound effects in particular are outstanding, the music is of the highest quality, and there are scenes where the art actually made my jaw gape. I watched with subtitles and all of the Japanese voices are done to a high standard and the casting is perfect for every character. Some of the animation is a bit choppy during battle scenes...(and there are numerous repeated sequences), but it's in no way immersion breaking.The unfortunate anchor weighing down this space opera leviathan is the pacing and enormous quantities of melodrama. If this were ten episodes less with all of the repetitive weeping scenes lopped into oblivion it would easily be my favorite science fiction series of all time. One particular example is a three episode arc (it could have been four, my eyes were drooping quite a bit) where the Princess must make a decision. It's a decision everyone knows she's going to make one way (including all the characters besides her), and there's absolutely no tension whatsoever...but five or ten minutes of each episode of the arc is dedicated to her agonizing over it with all the subsequent weeping and melancholic music. Why? What purpose does this serve? It's utterly boring.There are also Nodos battles (Nodos being demigod mechas) that drag on for multiple episodes filled with recycled animations (even complete sequences repeated in entirety thanks to messing with space-time). It's not exciting at all. Good editors/directors deal with time travel scenes by flashing through the parts we've already seen, bad ones show it all just to pad out the melodrama.Despite the overreliance on unneeded filler, there are many genuine scenes of drama that had me choking up internally. I won't spoil anything, but the majority are shown with incredible art and masterful music that demonstrated the level of talent in the production studio. I can't stress enough that the story here is extremely good and if your tolerance level for pointless scenes is higher than mine this is a no brainer to watch. I think this could have been more, but what is here I still enjoyed tremendously.

It is set in a futuristic, space opera feeling and holds a lot of space travel “stuff”.The very beginning of the story interested me, which is the hardest part of any anime, catching the interest of the viewer at the very first glance. It was introducing characters and background quite well, but the continuation was rather bland. Since I have to judge the story in this part I’ll try to do it that way:The first part of the anime was the best part; you can clearly feel how...much work was put in it compared to the following ones.While the “middle part” of the anime holds some interesting parts, or should I say more original ones, many of them are rather unnecessary.The last part, the conclusion, was almost as good as the first part, although predictable.-Art 6/10-The animation is very hard to judge because of some inconsistencies that are following the anime all along. First of all the animation relies a lot on computer graphics, while this should not be considered evil in itself the result is rather dull.A huge load of the episodes runtime is spent on showing generic starships with random orders being heard in the background, I’m almost sure you could delete a third of the anime and keep the story consistent without those. You’d be right to say this is needed to give the “space feeling” to the audience, but the problem is that we cannot differentiate those scenes from one another, which leads us to the combat/action part.The fleet action is ok, sometime better than previous battles, but at least it has the merit to be constant. It’s the Nodos fights that are not that great. You get the smash into huge ball and rip the shit out of it way too often. Ok, we get it, it’s powerful, maybe you’d be able to show it to us in more original ways rather than making a show out of a recycling bin… Don’t misunderstand, I found it hard to enjoy some of them, but I have no problem recognizing that some of the action scenes were very good and even more when compared to the previous ones.So it’s like this, some animation is good and some is just overused, it won’t stop you from enjoying the show, I think.-Sound 7/10-I do not have a clear opinion on this point. All I can say from the experience is that the tracks are good, but I would have like to hear more since it felt like a lot of them were being used too often. It’s still getting a very good score nonetheless.-Character 5/10 -This is where I was the most disappointed. I really felt that the beginning of a “viewer/character relation” was there, but it did not blossom at all. The only character that the anime made me really attached to was B, the AI of the Argonaut, but it may be due to my bias towards “android, robot” characters.The hero is one of the best characters and yet he is far from not being flawed. To get attached to a character you need to feel its humanity, its “pros and cons” on a psychological level. A part of it is done well and the other is completely lost because of the “perfect” feeling we get from him, not unlike the Princess character.She’s similar to him, not a common human with unique powers and a will that nothing can shake. She was shown with more weaknesses, even if subtle, that’s why I’m almost thinking she was done better than Age.Mobeedo is one of the characters we get to see the most and yet we know very little about him apart from the fact that three other characters are his children. He’s not a completely failed character, but given the runtime allowed to him that’s not enough.There are other secondary characters with potential, the relationship between Anesha and Iolaous and the weird and joyful feel we get from the twins Mail and Tail. All of the “important figures” of the silver race and the other Nodos are interesting too.The main problem is that they’re all “beginnings”. The character development is most likely not only the field I was most disappointed in, but the filed the anime mostly failed/lacks.

It's by far one of my favorite and I can always go back and re-watch it. I think I loved it so much because Heroic Age makes TONS of references to Greek Mythology and some of the characters are even have or have similar names to Greek Mythology characters. Heroic Age is takes place in space and is intended to be a Si-Fi anime. If you enjoy epic battles in space and Greek Mythology then I think you'll enjoy this anime. "", 'In the beginning it gives out Battlestar Galactica feelings, humans running away from an unbeatable foe. It is too much magic to be just sci f and to me it is more like fantasy in space. Magic goes anywhere from teleportation, telekinesis, telepathic communication, to a weird Deus Ex Machina, where a ""tribe"" became literal gods, though they were not. But oh yes, they were. So it\'s a mixed bag of lore, which feels contradictory, kinda very religious like.Battles feel too repetitive, with some literally recycling animations for most of it. But in the end it is well made, though it does drag on. If...it was at least 10 episodes shorter, it would´ve been better.

It's storyline is the old one. Find a fabled, prophecised hero, get him to understand his job somewhat, and then send him off into a war. Its easy to understand and follow story-wise.

Go ahead and test the waters.P.S. One of my first reviews, hope it helped. "", 'Story (3/10): very dragged. Extremely dragged. I think, every plot has crucial events required for creating its vision in your mind and some less important periods in between, where average life happens. The story here mixes what\'s important and what\'s not, doesn\'t highlight events worth noting and has them all too rare.Let\'s look at an example. The synopsis says ""...Princess Deianeira sets out to search for the powerful being who might be able to save humankind. She meets a wild haired boy on an abandoned planet..."" From the first episode you see Deianeira has only one ship and it\'s obviously a search party, not something...able to counter-strike as soon as they find Age. So, they need some kind of a rendezvous with their main forces. And it happens in the freaking 10th episode. 35% of this anime, more than one third, is stupid traveling with some skirmishes on the way and achieving the very very first step in what humanity needs to do. To make matters worse, it\'s plain obvious to you as a viewer that they will succeed, but the first 9 episodes are still there. Nothing meaningful seems to actually happen at that time and you\'re just watching events... having no real value behind them and that\'s how the story keeps on going till it ends. During all the screentime, fights tend to get stretched and go on episode in episode out without any climatic release or again, at least some turning point. It\'s just like Naruto but without flashbacks...It\'s worth noting all planets are actually very important and somewhat connected with life in this universe. The show doesn\'t bother to tell you about the reasons or at least the simple fact of it even when one planet is destroyed, so you have no clue why characters cry or are shocked by it. Their reaction and real repercussions only become clear later, in the second half of the anime.There is also a plot point that humanity has some special features which are very rare in the universe and were previously only discovered in guess what? The Golden Tribe, the most powerful, beautiful and benevolent tribe and all other tribes of course don\'t have such qualities. It\'s such a cliche it\'s almost appalling.Art and sound (both 8/10): quite good. Beautiful effects, futuristic designs (for everything from helmet interface to control rooms), realistic art style, majestic and somewhat classical soundtracks (which I liked a lot despite the overall impression), calm and not over-the-top voices of real human beings (not something you\'d find often in anime). All in all it\'s impressive and immersive. I don\'t often enjoy the art and can easily ignore it but some scenes here really caught my eye and even had me rewind just to enjoy them again.Characters (4/10): there isn\'t really much to say. Characters are refreshingly calm and not overexcited with everything. It\'s pleasant to see cast resembling real people. However, only protagonists have this luxury but even then they are just there and just do something. Nobody really changes because the whole story tends to be static.On a little bright side, Age is not motivated by revenge and doesn\'t even perceive this war as his own goal, he just participates in it because doing so is set in his agreement and his future. It\'s interesting that fighting is kind of his duty and no more so he doesn\'t have much emotions about this war despite being part of species that\'s on the brink of annihilation.Enjoyment (2/10): watching this was a tedious task.Overall (3/10). The show has captivating premise (I like stories about societies on the brink of extinction) and the first episodes are both promising and beautiful. But as the time goes, story doesn\'t progress much, nothing really happens, you just see amazing art and can enjoy the soundtrack. In the end, it\'s just a pretty shell without the core - story and chatacters. This result is quite disappointing given the beginning and originality of some concepts - it all got wasted by terrible execution. able to counter-strike as soon as they find Age. So, they need some kind of a rendezvous with their main forces. And it happens in the freaking 10th episode. 35% of this anime, more than one third, is stupid traveling with some skirmishes on the way and achieving the very very first step in what humanity needs to do. To make matters worse, it\'s plain obvious to you as a viewer that they will succeed, but the first 9 episodes are still there. Nothing meaningful seems to actually happen at that time and you\'re just watching events... having no real value behind them and that\'s how the story keeps on going till it ends. During all the screentime, fights tend to get stretched and go on episode in episode out without any climatic release or again, at least some turning point. It\'s just like Naruto but without flashbacks...It\'s worth noting all planets are actually very important and somewhat connected with life in this universe. The show doesn\'t bother to tell you about the reasons or at least the simple fact of it even when one planet is destroyed, so you have no clue why characters cry or are shocked by it. Their reaction and real repercussions only become clear later, in the second half of the anime.There is also a plot point that humanity has some special features which are very rare in the universe and were previously only discovered in guess what? The Golden Tribe, the most powerful, beautiful and benevolent tribe and all other tribes of course don\'t have such qualities. It\'s such a cliche it\'s almost appalling.Art and sound (both 8/10): quite good. Beautiful effects, futuristic designs (for everything from helmet interface to control rooms), realistic art style, majestic and somewhat classical soundtracks (which I liked a lot despite the overall impression), calm and not over-the-top voices of real human beings (not something you\'d find often in anime). All in all it\'s impressive and immersive. I don\'t often enjoy the art and can easily ignore it but some scenes here really caught my eye and even had me rewind just to enjoy them again.Characters (4/10): there isn\'t really much to say. Characters are refreshingly calm and not overexcited with everything. It\'s pleasant to see cast resembling real people. However, only protagonists have this luxury but even then they are just there and just do something. Nobody really changes because the whole story tends to be static.On a little bright side, Age is not motivated by revenge and doesn\'t even perceive this war as his own goal, he just participates in it because doing so is set in his agreement and his future. It\'s interesting that fighting is kind of his duty and no more so he doesn\'t have much emotions about this war despite being part of species that\'s on the brink of annihilation.Enjoyment (2/10): watching this was a tedious task.Overall (3/10). The show has captivating premise (I like stories about societies on the brink of extinction) and the first episodes are both promising and beautiful. But as the time goes, story doesn\'t progress much, nothing really happens, you just see amazing art and can enjoy the soundtrack. In the end, it\'s just a pretty shell without the core - story and chatacters.

I haven\'t seen a space mecha in years, but I\'ve seen plenty of other anime, including shallow and stupid ones and those over-indulgent in bad anime tropes they become a joke within a joke.

Problem solved.Now that the humans have found their savior, how do they treat him? With disdain, jealousy, and fear of course! They can\'t be bothered to clothe him, or understand that he has the mental state of a five year old from living alone on a deserted planet. Teach him how to count to four or not run in the hallways?

Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa,https://myanimelist.net/anime/430/Fullmetal_Alchemist__The_Conqueror_of_Shamballa,"['5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Must watch after the seriesWant a real conclusion to the events that happened in Fullmetal Alchemist? Then you should watch Fullmetal Alchemist: The Movie &ndash; Conqueror of Shamballa. In my opinion, it is impossible to get some real closure from watching the series alone.If you watched the series and followed it religiously like I did, you probably also marveled at how close Ed and Al are that they are willing to risk their lives for each other. If that&rsquo;s the case, then you were also probably shocked that the series ended with the two brothers separated, Ed on Earth, specifically...in Germany in the year 1923, and Al stuck in Amestris, specifically in Resembool. In the movie, Earth and Resembool are treated as parallel to each other, and you see how they interact with each other while in the process, the two brothers try to reunite themselves. It&rsquo;s definitely a wonderful storyline that will give viewers the conclusion they&rsquo;re looking for.I guess to keep things fresh and exciting, the characters were given new looks to go with new storylines. Ed and Al certainly have matured (and they look cool!), and the same goes for minor characters such as Winry and Roy Mustang. I don&rsquo;t want to spoil anything, but here&rsquo;s a hint &ndash; dead characters are even brought to life in the movie, however they have different personalities. All the characters still have their respective voice actors from the series, but there are also new additions to the cast such as a gypsy girl named Noa (Miyu Sawai), who I don&rsquo;t really like because she whines too much, and a new villain, Dietlinde Eckhart (Kazuko Kato).Even the visuals of the movie were new and improved. The character design became sleeker, the backgrounds are more detailed and attractive, and the color coordination is better than in the series. I especially like how the colors in Earth have a slightly weathered look, while the colors in Amestris are bright and vibrant.Michiru Oshima, who worked on the music of the series has returned to compose music for the movie as well, but I have to say I like the music of the series better. The music in the series was more striking and memorable compared to the music of the movie. L&rsquo;Arc~en~ciel also sang the opening and ending themes of the movie, and just like the series, they also came up with catchy tracks for this one too.As much as I liked the movie, I have to say that I like the series more. It&rsquo;s not because of the plot per se, but I was disappointed that there was less talk of alchemy in the movie. Alchemy was so important in the series that it made the plot, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case for the movie. Moreover, Al and Winry, two of my favorite characters, didn&rsquo;t get enough screen time, so that disappointed me a bit.However, I still recommend in watching the movie, because like I said earlier, Fullmetal Alchemist: The Movie &ndash; Conqueror of Shamballa will provide closure for the series. in Germany in the year 1923, and Al stuck in Amestris, specifically in Resembool.

Though I had been a long time fan of the series, the movie was a dull, disconnected effort to recapture the quality of the former.Story 7/10This is where things fall apart. The general premise of the story was high quality yet the execution in relation to its source material was poor, largely because the end of the series left so many plot threads to be explained. Unfortunately, the movie spends less time attempting to address these numerous plot threads and more time creating larger questions of its own. This is fine by itself...but Shambhala is inherently a continuation of the series rather than a stand-alone piece. It begins with an unanswered series of questions, brings forth a new series of questions, and in the end, doesn&rsquo;t conclude in answering any of them.Art 9/10Beautiful and fluid as always: even more so since this is a feature length film.Sound 8/10Far above average. The film is lacking in truly memorable pieces in the vain of its predecessor series (Brothers, Heavenly Spirit) but it manages to capture the viewer into the world it creates. It melds well into the background and there&rsquo;s little to be said otherwise. A notable exception is the movie opening, Link, which easily ranks among the best of the franchise.Character 7/10And this is where the story comments arrive into effect. The returning characters are handled well; the newcomers on the other hand fall victim to the films limited length. So much time is spent on the original characters that Noah and Dietlinde appear as cardboard cutouts. The villain becomes prominent towards the second half, acts in the stereotypically evil manner, espouses a tacked on, clich&eacute;d motivation for its actions, and proceeds to be literally dehumanized thereafter. Other new characters are treated in a similar manner with two sentence reasons for what motivates them.Enjoyment 8/10Interesting enough. If you take it as a continuation of the series, it often fails to reach a conclusion for plot threads espoused within it, while if you view it as a stand-alone work it still has some glaring problems in the character department. Still, its imaginations should manage to capture any viewer&rsquo;s attention and many of its other qualities are top notch.Conclusion 7.5/10The overall presentation was gorgeous but the story and character flaws were often to glaring to ignore. An above average score but not that of a masterpiece. but Shambhala is inherently a continuation of the series rather than a stand-alone piece.

The people who wrote this film know their history and their folk lore, using aspects of the Nazi society (including Hitler&amp;rsquo;s supposed obsession with the occult) to pen an enthralling experience. I went and looked up a number of the references made in the film to find out most of them were real. The setting also leads to lots of character conflict. For instance, Hughs (the Maeyz of our world) is a soldier in Post...WWI Germany suckered into joining the Nazi party out of desperation. He genuinely thinks the Nazis are doing the right thing (remember, none of these characters have the luxury of knowing where all this will lead) which puts him at odds with Ed. It&amp;rsquo;s very moving.The characters from the TV series are all there. Ed takes center stage, with the majority of the film taking place in our world. Al and his alternate version feature prominently, though. Al&amp;rsquo;s bit in the underground city with Wrath and Gluttony is amazing. Some of the other characters, like Winry and Hawkeye, are somewhat cheated of screentime, but practically every character from the show gets to make an appearance, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just their alternate version (there&amp;rsquo;s one cameo at the very end of the movie that&amp;rsquo;s absolutely hilarious).The animation in this movie is non-stop eye candy. The fight scenes and action sequences are all fluid and choreographed to perfection, but that&amp;rsquo;s only the half of it. The backgrounds and environments are lush and detailed and are just dripping with beauty, even when the setting is the dank bowels of a castle. I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful I got to see this film on the big screen.It&amp;rsquo;s hard to rank Conqueror of Shambala. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the TV series you will adore this film. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the show, you&amp;rsquo;ll like all the pretty animation, but the story will go completely over your head. Still, if viewed in the proper context, this film is worthy of a 9 to 10 rating. And if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the TV series, do yourself a favor and go check it out. You&amp;rsquo;ll be glad you did. Full Metal Alchemist is one of the best things to come out of Japan in a long time.Thank you for reading my review of this movie if you have any questions please join my friends list and i can help you best I can.

It almost felt like watching a strange AU fanfiction made into animation. The film has many plotholes and never really feels complete, plus the characters you got to know from the anime didn't seem &quot;in character&quot;, giving the whole feel to the series a touch of awkwardness. The animation is also a little &quot;weird&quot; compared to the series and the ending felt far from satisfying ((but then again, the whole movie was far from satisfying)). The action is purposeless and there's not many entertaining moments.I wouldn't even recommend this movie...to fans of FMA since it doesn't really make sense within the realm of the series and feels like pointless, useless filler, but I also wouldn't recommend the movie to newcomers to the FMA world since the story takes place after the anime is over. As a conclusion, there's nobody to really recommend this movie to. to fans of FMA since it doesn't really make sense within the realm of the series and feels like pointless, useless filler, but I also wouldn't recommend the movie to newcomers to the FMA world since the story takes place after the anime is over. As a conclusion, there's nobody to really recommend this movie to."", ""I've talked about Fullmetal Alchemist before, both the first anime and Brotherhood. It was largely positive, with both series having a lot of good elements. Well, the original series had a film based on it and that's what we're looking at today, Conqueror of Shamballa. Does it live up to the rest of the franchise, is it an embarrassment? Let's find out.Story:The film opens with a scientist showing Alphonse his new bomb, mistaking him for the Fullmetal alchemist. What a novel idea, we've never seen that before. He wants a State Alchemist to help him present his bomb to their higher ups. Alphonse refuses and...the scientist gets angry and attacks him. Which is just a bad move on his part. You'd think he'd be better off finding a State Alchemist who would listen, but that would show common sense and not result in an action sequence. Ed bursts in and the brothers manage to fight off the scientist. Who uses human transmutation in a last ditch effort to stop them. This results in him going through the gate and never being seen again. We cut ahead to Edward in a world very much like ours relating the story to someone who looks very much like his brother, who laughs it off since the idea of alchemy as a legitimate scientific practice is absurd. Which is a bit head scratching since his world has people with unexplained psychic and magic powers.The two join a group of Roma going to the carnival in order to show off their rocket. Ed excuses himself from the demonstration just in time to see a young Roma woman named Noah being chased by a trio of thugs. He steps in and manages to rescue her. Which results in him coming to the attention of the Thule society, you may remember them from your history as a group of occultists who sponsored the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, which was reorganised into the Nazi party. The Thule society is trying to open a gate into Edward's original world, which they call Shamballa under the pretense of gaining an invincible army so that the Nazis can take over Deutschland and then the world.Let's start with the things that are wrong with the film, shall we? The big one is that a lot of the plot points don't make much sense. The Thule Society's plan is patently stupid. They've had three people cross over from the other world, Edward, Hohenheim & Envy. Two of them are ordinary people who don't even have alchemy in their world and the third they manage to capture with no trouble whatsoever. So, how exactly is this world supposed to give them an invincible army? Of course, the woman in charge has a different plan and it is even dumber so there's that. We also get some real plot contrivances. For instance, Winry shows up to bring Ed a new automail arm and leg, knowing exactly how much he's grown so that she could compensate because she read ahead in the script. There's also the issue of the gate itself. In the series proper we saw that opening the gate has terrible consequences for just about everyone who does it. In this they open it several times without a bloody thing happening, save for that initial incident with the scientist. Some characters die, but they all die of reasons un-related to opening the gate. The closest connection we get is that some of them die as a result of someone else opening the gate.Now on the positive side I do like the idea of these two parallel worlds and how people on both sides can share an appearance. I also do think there was potential in Edward's story arc about learning to live in the world he's in instead of dwelling on the world where he was even if this film doesn't handle it well.Characters:You get to see pretty much the entire cast of major characters from Fullmetal Alchemist. Of course, the film screws some of them up. Roy Mustang in particular. Apparently between the ending of the series and this he decided to take a demotion and go off to a remote area to be emo. Yeah, that makes sense for a character who took his angst from a war and channeled it into strength to try to grab political power. Then we have the original characters. They're a pretty one-dimensional group with flat motivations. Maybe that's why our villains are Nazis. Since you don't really have to try to give them motivations or fleshed out personalities. You can just make them evil and everyone will nod and say “yes, that's how Nazis are.” You win this round, Conqueror of Shamballa, but I'm still calling it lazy. And it could have fleshed out Noah and some of the other non-Nazi original characters.Art:I will give the film credit, the visuals are really good, mostly. The character designs are just like the ones in the series and the backgrounds are detailed. What's more mixed are the action sequences. They use some effects that don't really work, sometimes giving them a jarringly different animation style. Some of the fight scenes are kind of badly done too. The fight between Wrath and Gluttony is just weak and there's also the pathetically easy way that Envy is captured early on.Sound:The original cast reprise their roles and they all do well. No worries there. There's nothing wrong with the acting whatsoever. The music is good too, at least the instrumental stuff. Some of the lyrical stuff is outright badly done.Ho-yay:There really isn't any in this film.Final Thoughts:Conqueror of Shamballa is the worst thing I've seen from Bones. It's not a bad film, but it is definitely weak with a lot of story problems and some characterisation & art issues. In the end, it's a weak and disappointing way to end the original anime series. My final rating is a 4/10. Next week I'll look at the second 3x3 eyes OVA. For those of you who are curious about when the Gintama review will be up, expect that on the 20th. the scientist gets angry and attacks him. Which is just a bad move on his part.

So, how exactly is this world supposed to give them an invincible army? Of course, the woman in charge has a different plan and it is even dumber so there's that. We also get some real plot contrivances. For instance, Winry shows up to bring Ed a new automail arm and leg, knowing exactly how much he's grown so that she could compensate because she read ahead in the script. There's also the issue of the gate itself. In the series proper we saw that opening the gate has terrible consequences for just about everyone who does it. In this they open it several times without a bloody thing happening, save for that initial incident with the scientist. Some characters die, but they all die of reasons un-related to opening the gate. The closest connection we get is that some of them die as a result of someone else opening the gate.Now on the positive side I do like the idea of these two parallel worlds and how people on both sides can share an appearance. I also do think there was potential in Edward's story arc about learning to live in the world he's in instead of dwelling on the world where he was even if this film doesn't handle it well.Characters:You get to see pretty much the entire cast of major characters from Fullmetal Alchemist. Of course, the film screws some of them up. Roy Mustang in particular. Apparently between the ending of the series and this he decided to take a demotion and go off to a remote area to be emo. Yeah, that makes sense for a character who took his angst from a war and channeled it into strength to try to grab political power. Then we have the original characters. They're a pretty one-dimensional group with flat motivations. Maybe that's why our villains are Nazis. Since you don't really have to try to give them motivations or fleshed out personalities. You can just make them evil and everyone will nod and say “yes, that's how Nazis are.” You win this round, Conqueror of Shamballa, but I'm still calling it lazy. And it could have fleshed out Noah and some of the other non-Nazi original characters.Art:I will give the film credit, the visuals are really good, mostly. The character designs are just like the ones in the series and the backgrounds are detailed. What's more mixed are the action sequences. They use some effects that don't really work, sometimes giving them a jarringly different animation style. Some of the fight scenes are kind of badly done too. The fight between Wrath and Gluttony is just weak and there's also the pathetically easy way that Envy is captured early on.Sound:The original cast reprise their roles and they all do well. No worries there. There's nothing wrong with the acting whatsoever. The music is good too, at least the instrumental stuff. Some of the lyrical stuff is outright badly done.Ho-yay:There really isn't any in this film.Final Thoughts:Conqueror of Shamballa is the worst thing I've seen from Bones. It's not a bad film, but it is definitely weak with a lot of story problems and some characterisation & art issues. In the end, it's a weak and disappointing way to end the original anime series. My final rating is a 4/10. Next week I'll look at the second 3x3 eyes OVA. For those of you who are curious about when the Gintama review will be up, expect that on the 20th."", ""If you slept through high school history, and you know who you are, your appreciation of the depth of this movie will be greatly enhanced by reviewing the following things: Treaty of Versailles, Weimar Republic, rise of the Nazi party (including history in the 1920's), the Manhattan Project, the Thule Society (yes, it's real), Shambala (yes, it's real), Nazi occultism, and, if you somehow missed it, the Holocaust. Japan's opinion of nuclear weapons should be obvious to anybody with a basic grasp of the history of World War II. They're never portrayed as a Good Thing in Japanese media, and frankly, I can't blame them....They represent the end-all be-all of total destruction and horrific weaponry, a symbol of the Apocalypse. This race-memory seems embedded in Ed and Al from the moment they hear the term &quot;Uranium bomb&quot;, even though they live in pre-1945 parallel-universe Germany. This entanglement with world history is prevalent throughout the movie, and while sometimes a little heavy-handed, it's good.Sometimes I have to wonder if &quot;Conqueror of Shambala&quot; is being deeper than I should give it credit for, but given the stunning depth and quality of storytelling displayed in the TV series, I am inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt. I was shocked and dismayed at the behavior and petty idealism of one of my favorite characters from the TV series as portrayed in Weimar Germany (I'll give you a hint: his daughter just turned three), as he was one of the most accepting, intelligent, and gentle people in the series, but we are a product of our circumstances, and as a modern-day American I feel I have no right to stand in judgment of those who were members of the National Socialist Worker's Party in the 1920's. It started out sounding like a true people's revolution, and Adolf Hitler was a true charismatic leader. I just would have expected better of you, Hughes, especially when you outspokenly buy into myths about every race but the Aryan. I pray he came to his senses before Kristallnacht or later became a defector. I guess the upcoming new series will tell.I guess that was the biggest problem I had with the movie. I felt as though it would be more in-character for Hughes to be an anti-Nazi activist, but our idealizations often do not match with reality. And this brings me to the theme pervading the movie: people destroy so much that they do have searching for idealizations that do not exist. L'arc~en~Ciel expressed it best in the ending theme: &quot;we're letting go of something we never had&quot;. Whether it's the mythical land of Shambala, a country for the German people, a scapegoat, Equivalent Exchange, Mustang's ideals of reforming the military, etc, each of the characters faces the realization that he or she must live with the reality life has given, even when it's not pretty, and even when it's heartbreaking.I find it interesting that Lior and Munich were linked through the parallel universes; both cities were devastated and eagerly looking for a prophet to come and save them and restore them to former glory. This is the destructive side of idealization; people make themselves vulnerable to being used by charismatic leaders. They make themselves gullible. They make themselves terrifying in their devotion to that ideal, even if it means destroying things they see as interfering with their ideal world. Sometimes those things are a scapegoat. You see where this is going. Etc.I guess this is my very roundabout way of saying that this was a stellar movie, all things considered. It hit me square in the chest and made me tear up, and it ties up many of the loose ends left by the end of the TV series. Roy Mustang is back with a vengeance ready to kick ass, and I hope that he and Hawkeye finally get together. My heart almost broke for Winry. She has become an even stronger, smarter, and more resourceful girl--no, woman--than she was in the TV series. Alphonse is still painfully naive, and, returning to an underlying theme, his idealism and naivity come to bite him in the ass hard toward the end of the movie. Edward has become a little calmer, a little wiser, and a little more distant, but ultimately he is still the same hot-headed, stubborn boy--no, man--that he was in the TV series. The artwork is supurb, rich and realistic, and the music is sweeping.Though the movie was written to be able to be viewed as a stand-alone, it's enjoyable on a quantum level beyond if you have seen the entirety of the TV series. And, if you plan on seeing the TV series EVER, the movie will spoil it utterly. I cannot recommend it enough to FMA fans.

Before we get into it I have not seen Brotherhood to date. Also, I give the FMA 03 series a 9 out of 10.

Was it better than the original? NO. Well, there might be spoilers in the following review, so you have been warned.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!Story (3/10) Well, I wanted to see more of the world of the original fma that we all grew to love. But instead, this movie got involved in some plot about the Nazis. So yeah, very disappointing. At least we saw a little of the original. But I hate the story because it literally goes nowhere....except for the screwed up ending. Literally, the choice Ed made at the...end of the movie was so stupid.Art (7/10) Well, the art was actually a little worse. The animation was still fluid, but the art was so dull and gray. In the original series, it was beautiful to look at, but here, it was just gray everywhere, dark, dull, just not as good. It wasn\'t horrible, but was a real letdown.Sound (7/10) Okay, but still, lacking compared to fma. That\'s all I have to say.Characters (6/10) Well, the original characters (some of them at least) come back very well. Alphonse came back much diferrent, but the movie didn\'t have ENOUGH OF HIM!!!! You wanna know why? Because the movie put focus on useless characters that literally had no development or anything interesting about them. One of them even DIED! Wow, such a waste. At least Armstrong came back though.Enjoyment (2/10) Boy, I really wanted to quit this movie in the middle of it. No, all of it. I hated it. I was extremely disappointed. I know most of you don\'t agree with me, and that\'s fine, but I had no enjoyment at all except for the few scenes when some of the original characters came back (for about a minute)Overall: Pros:+Some things from the original series are resolved.+Nice to see some characters come back.Cons:-Everything was a step down from the original FMA.-Awful story-The art, while still decent, was very lacking compared to the original.-New characters have nothing interesting about them and have no development whatsoever.-Even worse ending then the original FMA.Overall Score: 5/10My Score: 3/10I don\'t recommend this film to anyone, neither newcomers nor FMA fans. end of the movie was so stupid.Art (7/10) Well, the art was actually a little worse.

This movie tramples on every message established by the end of FMA. I guess the point was to give the story a more satisfying conclusion, but they couldnt even manage to do that.

This movie has an obsession with killing off important characters from the series and replacing them with the most...forgettable pillocks known to fiction. The main female support is very insufferable, this is because she herself is a raging troglodyte and also because she\'s a ripoff of Rose, who nobody has ever liked. The main ""villain"" is also stupid, she\'s introduced last minute with no real motivations and poses no threat compared to the old antagonists in the series. I can think of at least 5 characters that would be more suited for her role had the movie not randomly killed them off. Tldr this movie is bad. The only interesting part was when they made Hughes a nazi but that is never touched up on afterwards. forgettable pillocks known to fiction.

So here we go...I started watching this movie hearing mixed things about it. Sure it had a pretty good score on this website, but some people I know who had seen it said it was just OK. But I started watching it still hopeful that they could be wrong and it would be great. But it ended up being just OK, like they had said.Story (6/10): The end of the TV series left a lot of questions. All this movie does is add more questions to your mind and then answer them poorly or not at all. The story...was just plain confusing, and the setting made it not even feel like Fullmetal Alchemist. It was slightly interesting about the beginning, but my interest started to slip towards the later portion of it.Art (8/10): The art was pretty good. It's better then the TV series, which is expected considering that it's a movie. One thing I didn't like was that they are these armored suits in the movie, and when they move they are shown in this awkward 3D animation. I've never liked 3D animation mixed with 2D, so this kind of turned me off...Sound (7/10): Nothing outstanding. The music blends in well in the background (I didn't really notice it), and the opening music is pretty good.Characters (5/10): I feel this is where it mainly fell apart. It felt like it tried to squeeze in all the characters from the original series, and it did a poor job of doing so. A lot of characters you see for like five seconds, and then they are gone from the movie. And the ones they did show a lot didn't really act like themselves. The ones introduced weren't amazing either. I liked Noah, but the main antagonist was just your stereotypical villain who was very bland and not interesting.Enjoyment (6/10): Another mediocre area. I was enjoying the beginning, but I began to get kind of bored 30 minutes in. The action was kind of monotonous and felt forced, and the only reason I didn't forget I was watching a Fullmetal Alchemist movie was because I saw Edward on screen. It was not nearly as epic as the original show and everything felt out of place.Overall (6/10): This movie was mediocre. Nothing about it really stood out to me. I felt it was unnecessary, and slightly tarnished the original 2003 series, which already didn't have an amazing ending. The ending for this movie was not very good, and the setting and characters felt like they were from another show. It had some good elements, but was not nearly as enjoyable as the anime. Edward felt like himself, but Al didn't at all. I would tell you if the other characters did or not, but they only appeared on screen for five seconds, so I couldn't say. I wish I could say more about the ones that had more screen time, but then I would be spoiling stuff.So is this worth watching if you watched the original anime? I don't think so. But I won't say you shouldn't watch it. It definitely could have been worse, and not everything about it is bad. I may sound a bit overly negative in my review, which is probably because the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. The movie really isn't BAD. It just isn't GOOD.Well, that's my first review. Sorry if it's a bit messy, or if it's lacking detail or great reasoning. I just really had to review this one after seeing it's overrated score.

It's a decent and unnecessary movie, but it could have been worse."", ""As someone who has only just recently had the chance to watch Fullmetal Alchemist despite reading some of the manga a few years back. Now I will preface this with: No I haven't finished reading the manga nor have I watched Brotherhood. Saving up my money for that.Onto The Conqueror of Shamballa.Honestly to sum up: Save the 2 hours you could spend watching this and rewatch the original anime or read some of the manga, or watch Brotherhood if you can -  they are all better than this.This movie has just no real weight, nothing is really accomplished and the worst part is -...I didn't really care for the characters at during the  film. Yeah I understand that's the point of a non-canon film but really even the fight scenes are not really worth sitting through the two hours because they are short and there's better action in the original series.The best action sequence happens in the first 5 or so minutes of the film. The best scene is just seeing Alphonse and Edward goof off in the first few minutes as they would in the anime but that's the problem - it doesn't last.Most of the film is spent with the many disconnected subplots which we don't really care about. Sure we want Edward and Alphonse to see each other again but we spend most of the movie building up to that with boring dialogue and explanations that no one cares about. Also they never explain how Alchemy just suddenly starts working in the otherworld again despite the ending of the anime stating that it couldn't be used - looks like they just threw continuity out the window there.Otherworld Al is building rockets, he's only known Edward for 2 years - the time it's been since the last anime - so they don't really act like brothers, Alphonse and Edward don't understand each other's feelings. Edward is too busy moping about not being able to see Alphonse so he doesn't even feel like the cheerful Edward we spent 52 episodes getting to know. The other Alphonse can't remember his experiences so he doesn't feel like the strong little soldier we know from the anime either. That's the problem everyone feels like shells of their former selves from the anime. Even Mustang is moping around.Despite all my complaints about this movie's Al, he does show off some impressive Alchemy and a nod to his soul being attached to the armour by being able to bring suits of armour to life by putting a bit of his soul in them. I still feel like that contradicts some of the logic of alchemy from the series but oh well none of this is canon anyway.The only drama here is everyone being depressed until the portals open in about the last 20 minutes of the movie. Leading to fights with villains no one cares about and we know are going to lose because they are in a world with magic they don't truly understand the advantage to Edward and Alphonse is obvious.Sure the voice actors are all giving it there best shot to try and make you care but the plot is just so empty and meaningless. There are plenty of cameos of old characters from the anime in the otherworld but since it's a parallel dimension none of them really act like themselves, if they ever show a hint of their real personality it doesn't last and it all just feels like a strange crossover that no one was asking for, why would anyone want a Nazi Maes Hughes? He was one of the nicest characters yet they made him a Nazi?I guess you could say my main problem with this movie is the plot. How all the characters don't feel like the ones we know and love but rather empty depressed shells.The music and animation is pretty much standard though nothing compared to that of the anime - the music also seems to start and stop in odd places here and there that ruin the dramatic tension for me.  There are some parts where the animation is noticeably poorer only to have the next few seconds be in overdrive which is somewhat jarring. Mostly in the Wrath versus Glutton fight.The voice acting is the same overall quality from the series but since the writing isn't near as memorable it doesn't carry the same weight or purpose.Essentially that made me completely unable to enjoy the film.The action is pretty subpar in comparison to the anime, in fact everything plot wise and action wise is boring and subpar compared to the anime series, why are you watching this when you could be watching that is all I'm wondering.-Spoilers-Also Alphonse and Edward care for Winry far too much to leave her behind like that, I expected better from Edward and Alphonse.

Edward is too busy moping about not being able to see Alphonse so he doesn't even feel like the cheerful Edward we spent 52 episodes getting to know. The other Alphonse can't remember his experiences so he doesn't feel like the strong little soldier we know from the anime either. That's the problem everyone feels like shells of their former selves from the anime. Even Mustang is moping around.Despite all my complaints about this movie's Al, he does show off some impressive Alchemy and a nod to his soul being attached to the armour by being able to bring suits of armour to life by putting a bit of his soul in them. I still feel like that contradicts some of the logic of alchemy from the series but oh well none of this is canon anyway.The only drama here is everyone being depressed until the portals open in about the last 20 minutes of the movie. Leading to fights with villains no one cares about and we know are going to lose because they are in a world with magic they don't truly understand the advantage to Edward and Alphonse is obvious.Sure the voice actors are all giving it there best shot to try and make you care but the plot is just so empty and meaningless. There are plenty of cameos of old characters from the anime in the otherworld but since it's a parallel dimension none of them really act like themselves, if they ever show a hint of their real personality it doesn't last and it all just feels like a strange crossover that no one was asking for, why would anyone want a Nazi Maes Hughes? He was one of the nicest characters yet they made him a Nazi?I guess you could say my main problem with this movie is the plot. How all the characters don't feel like the ones we know and love but rather empty depressed shells.The music and animation is pretty much standard though nothing compared to that of the anime - the music also seems to start and stop in odd places here and there that ruin the dramatic tension for me.  There are some parts where the animation is noticeably poorer only to have the next few seconds be in overdrive which is somewhat jarring. Mostly in the Wrath versus Glutton fight.The voice acting is the same overall quality from the series but since the writing isn't near as memorable it doesn't carry the same weight or purpose.Essentially that made me completely unable to enjoy the film.The action is pretty subpar in comparison to the anime, in fact everything plot wise and action wise is boring and subpar compared to the anime series, why are you watching this when you could be watching that is all I'm wondering.-Spoilers-Also Alphonse and Edward care for Winry far too much to leave her behind like that, I expected better from Edward and Alphonse."", 'This movie is a direct continuation of where the first TV series  leaves off and it’s STRONGLY suggested you watch the TV series first in order to understand this movie, and to see this movie as a complete closure to it as well. A good portion charms I feel of what defines the TV series are still present, and the returning characters do have presence, but not to their fullest use in my opinion. Mustang does his thing, but I think in some way they could have still developed his character. But for general character development with Ed and Al as well as their...relationship, it really does the job which I feel you have to see for yourself on how that pans out.Yes, it does give closure, but some of the movie does have some unsolved questions. Such as it doesn’t explain why Noah has the power to see somebody’s life just by touching them. And outside of that, she really has no use to the story though her presence does symbolize that gypsies were scorned by the Germans just to make emphasize the history going on in Germany at that point. Another factor I didn’t like was how little significance the opening becomes after that. It’s supposed to be something important and you get an idea of what it’s supposed to be (based on your knowledge of science and history), but after that, it really has no overall contribution of the story, nor did I felt it really established anything.Take what I said about the TV series and times it by 2, and you perfectly get the quality of the art and animation of this movie. The moment that Ed’s mechanical arm first appears, it’s so detailed and rendered and yet syncs perfectly with the 2D art. The designs of the characters are simply for the sake of theatrical quality, but of course shows maturity to the features as well. Specifically, not just Ed by growing taller, but by placing his pony tail closer to the crown of his head to symbolize that he’s an adult and to make him more scholarly looking. And my thoughts on the environments and action sequences still remain the same and the qualities are still there, but obviously better.Pretty much what I can say about music and voice acting has already been said in my review of the TV series. The voice acting in both English and Japanese is still a quality that I consider a standard to look up to. In addition to new characters, we got new seiyuus. Noah is played by Sawai Miyuu, who actually happens to play Sailor Moon in the live action version. She does a great job of being scared, isolated, and yet curious, as well as her actress in English. Alphonse is played by Oguri Shun, who was also in the live action versions of GTO and Gokusen, and also played the voice of Asakura Akio in the anime version of Wangan Midnight, an anime that I also previously reviewed. I thought he had a good chemistry with Park Romi, the voice of Ed in bringing a new kind of sibling relationship between the two characters.The music is just incredible. The opening and ending themes, Link and Lost Heaven are both sung by L’Arc~En~Ciel, the 2nd best J-Rock band of all time (behind X-Japan), and if you recall, they also sang the 2nd opening theme of the TV series. Their style for these songs are more in tradition of being hard, but yet still captures the franchise’s romanticism.If you’ve already seen the first TV series, then it’s a highly likely possibility you’ve watched this already. But if you haven’t the TV series and have been meaning to watch it or currently watching it, then naturally you’re going to watch this anyway. In the extras, it is revealed the original first draft was going to be between 2 to 3 hours long and I felt that a 95 minute movie was really too short to really give this installment of Fullmetal Alchemist a little too small of a conclusion. Personally, I think maybe an OAV series based on the initial script could have worked, or maybe just made the movie based on that script in the first place. There are anime movies out there that are over 2 hours long, so why give this the shortening treatment? It adds some confusion to some things, but the big picture is….forget it….it’d be a spoiler if I got into that, but I got about around a good portion of what I wanted out of it. relationship, it really does the job which I feel you have to see for yourself on how that pans out.Yes, it does give closure, but some of the movie does have some unsolved questions.

Ed and Al are now in alternate dimensions, worlds which differ in the path technology chose to follow. Ed\'s world is our own, set in pre-World War 2 Germany, while Al remains in the world of the FMA series. While the brothers try to find their own ways to reunite with one another, the Thule Society in Ed\'s world is preparing to prop up the new Nazi government under Adolf Hitler. Seeking the power of alchemy, the Society searches for a way to cross over to Al\'s world. On their journey...to be with each other once again, Ed and Al will have to face a maniacal enemy bent on domination of both worlds.Shamballa is a pretty good film: animation is in line with that of the series (if not a bit more detailed and polished) and viewers should expect comparable audio. The storyline, while necessary for those of us left hanging at the end of the series, is a little too ambitious for even a nearly 2-hour film. While the plot is strong overall, the ending and enemy both seemed forced and left me with questions. In some cases, those questions were answered, but the answers were not satisfying. For instance, how is the primary enemy, a mere human from the other world, suddenly a beast with alchemic powers which prove a match for even trained state alchemists? And more importantly, what is her motive for wishing to destroy and conquer ""Shamballa?"" She gives viewers an answer, but it is pretty weak and is easily the low point in the movie.On the bright side, fans should be pleased with how the movie brings the main storyline to a wrap: the two-world system is explained, we find out what happens to Ed and Al, and we see whether Roy Mustang remains a bum for the rest his life.In Shamballa\'s case, the pros outweigh the cons. Animation, audio, and storyline are all enjoyable; it\'s nice to see the characters one more time, and the underlying premise is well-developed throughout. Apart from what felt like a forced dramatic ending battle and final enemy, Shamballa is a hit.Overall Score: B+For snapshots and a high quality download check out my blog, http://animefiend.blogspot.com to be with each other once again, Ed and Al will have to face a maniacal enemy bent on domination of both worlds.Shamballa is a pretty good film: animation is in line with that of the series (if not a bit more detailed and polished) and viewers should expect comparable audio.

Because of the way the industry operates, telling complete stories rarely works out to be the most profitable option, and any anime fan can tell you about at least one series they found enjoyable but had a final act that was obviously rushed, bloated with filler to drag the series out, or even ending on a giant 'go buy the manga' cliffhanger. In this regard, Fullmetal Alchemist has been very lucky in that BOTH of its anime series received proper, conclusive endings (although being a critical and commercial smash-hit DOES tend to help your luck). The...2003 series comes to its conclusion in 'The Conqueror of Shambala', a thrill-a-minute action flick that keeps the hauntingly bittersweet tone the original series is known for.Story:I won't lie, the story isn't 100% airtight if you really want to dig around. There are a couple plot conveniences and the opening scene includes some obvious exposition meant to get any newcomers to the franchise up to speed. But if you're willing to overlook that and enjoy the Rule of Cool going on on-screen you'll get to see the Elric Brothers fight ROCKET NAZIS. And while not flawless, the plot holds together more than well enough it won't distract from anything else. The tone of the story is also consistent with the rest of the FMA universe: bittersweet, as things don't always go the good guy's way and even the best intentions don't always lead to positive outcomes.Art:What happens when you take a smash-hit manga with an internationally famous anime adaptation during a financial boom time for the industry and turn it into a 100-minute movie handled by a major studio? You get stellar animation quality. 'Shamballa' brings excellent fluidity and consistency in the animation depart. There's also very little of art-shift humor Brotherhood is known for, but I won't say if that's a plus or minus. However, a definite mistake occurs in the editing- 'Shamballa' often uses long blackout cuts, even when the scene it cuts to clearly happens right after the previous scene. I usually don't pay much attention to the fine details of editing and scene transitions, but this bugged me. Otherwise, excellent art.Sound:The OST doesn't have anything worth remembering except for one folk song that plays near the denouement. 'Shamballa' keeps the home-run voice cast of the original series, however, and that's more than enough to score points in the sound department.Characters:FMA has always separated itself from the competition in the Shonen demographic by its excellent character writing.  The series loves breaking its characters down and reforging them by the experience. Some of Mustang's choices seem a bit iffy, but Al makes up for it with his arc. 'Shamballa' also takes advantage of the parallel worlds the original series established for the sake of irony ( let's just some of the decisions made by Our World Maes Hughes will be.... interesting.... to those who know his character). The main villain Ed fights at the climax is pretty weak and forgettable in that their motivation really isn't that clear or well-defined, and comes out of nowhere with no real build-up.Enjoyment:A big, explode-y FMA romp. Excellent as a Rule of Cool film.Overall:Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shambala is a very entertaining film that isn't completely perfect, but does provide definitive closure on the Original Series storyline.

If you watch the movie before the series, the plot will make little or no sense to you whatsoever. It will also spoil the end of the series as the movie picks up from where it left off. Anyone who is new to the franchise should watch the series first - you will not be disappointed.The movie is a satisfying conclusion to a great series; it does a good job of tying up the loose ends. The story is well written and original; I especially liked the addition of real people such as Adolf Hitler...and Fritz Lang. The movie takes place in 1923, a few years after World War I ended, and the year before Hitler was sent to prison. Clearly a lot of effort has been put in to this movie - it's very well researched in terms of history, making the movie believable and intriguing.The contrast between the two settings, Munich and Shamballa (also known as Amestris) is quite subtle. There are the character likenesses and the differences between modern science and alchemy - it's interesting to compare them.However, although the movie is good in many ways, it is not flawless. I thought that the movie was slightly disappointing as it felt like there was something missing. Compared to the series, I think that there is not as much emphasis on alchemy in the movie. It was one of the main themes in the series; that's partly why it was compelling in the first place, due to the fascinating concept of how alchemy works (in the Full Metal Alchemist universe, at least).Also, the movie doesn't make a good stand-alone piece; you may feel the need to watch the series, either to refresh your memory of what happened previously or to get a better understanding of the plot. Overall, the movie is worth watching, especially for Full Metal Alchemist fans or fans of the fantasy genre. and Fritz Lang.

Certainly, until episode 50, you'd never would have suspected this would happen, but they made it work. It was simply so absolutely amazing. If you are into those heart-wrenching, grief-stricken stories, like most of the series was, you won't be disappointed in the movie. It obviously doesn't follow the original plot of getting their bodies back. The 'after-plot' as I like to call it, was well developed, though. They are only trying to find each other, and the sacrifices they've made, it all really does come back to you, plus the new sadness it brings. I don't want...to give too much away, so I understand if this feels a bit confusing. I really liked how they use our world in the story though.Art: They use the original art from the show, and like in the show, the fight scenes were amazing. I especially love the body movements.

The trade-mark song for the movie, though (or at least the one I think to have made most of an impact) was the one for the very ending. 'Lost Heaven' was very appropriate and I believe it to be of great quality.

They are all very realistic I think. The German Hughes, I think, was a nice touch, since it's quite a contrast from Central Hughes. It's good because it makes you realize that even though they look the same, they're their own person. Of course, on the new characters, they couldn't elaborate too much because of time limit, but they did excellent in creating them. They are not flat, meaningless characters--they are part of the plot, from the very beginning too, even if you don't realize it at first. Also, I have to note, you can tell Ed's grown up so much.Enjoyment: You'll probably hate the ending, but not because it's badly written or too cliche.

It is beautiful and is an upgrade from the series. Also the voice acting is very good. The original Japanese voices are good (although they might throw you off if your used to the Brotherhood voices). The dub is good although the german characters do not have german accents which is odd. Also the soundtrack by Michiru Oshima is beautiful as well. Now I will get to the unpleasant part.I do not understand why anyone would like this movie for any other reason besides the beautiful art, the good voice acting or to hear the...beautiful soundtrack. The movie is awful! The original anime series was amazing. The character development for the brothers was great. The other characters (Winry, Mustang, Hawkeye, Izumi, etc.) were enjoyable and good characters. To be honest I liked the ending to series. I LOVE german history, especially in the 1920's to WWII.Now in Conqueror of Shamballa we are introduced to the most bland characters Bones could think of. Say what you want about Rose but she was a decent character in the original anime. So instead of giving her a role in the movie (she had a big role in the anime) we get her cardboard cut out alter-self. Also instead seeing more of Alphonse (the second most important character) we get his cardboard cutout too! I mean this is pathetic, Edward just replaces his brother! Also the villain! She was so bland in comparison to Dante.Now on to the returning characters, Mustang is turned into a woobie for no reason. The anime set up that his character was going to move on and help the new government. He looked happy. He was going to progress past what happened in Ishval. Instead he just regresses. Also we wanted more on Ed and his father, right? No, Daddy just abandons Ed again! Their relationship gets no closure. Then with Winry, she is carrying around automail for Ed on the off chance that she will see him. How did she know the automail would fit? This is pathetic. We know Winry is good but not that good. Also by the end of the movie, Winry is tossed to the side like trash.Look I am going to be honest, if Bones wanted to do this alternate world twist than they should have done another 50+ episodes. A movie is not going to do this story justice (especially considering the large cast). My favorite fanfiction of all time (He Who Searches For Himself by Yuuki Hikari) is a beautiful example of what bones could have done. Edward could have gotten a better relationship with his father. He could have befriended people who weren't cut outs of his friends from home (Rose, Al, Hughes, etc.). There could have been a compelling story about his journey home. We could have seen Al become a fine alchemist in his own right.Bones messed up. This movie is not good. I feel like it's sole purpose was to make the future remake (Brotherhood) look better. If Conqueror of Shamballa had been a good sequel than I would rank the original higher than Brotherhood. I can't though because of how this movie takes a beautiful series like FMA and just destroys it.The ending of FMA (2003) was very compelling and this movie was pretty much just missed potential. It doesn't do anything but present a bland plot and ruins all our favorite characters (in favor of introducing cardboard cutouts!).

The movie dose a good job at staying true to what the show was all about and that one reason why I liked this movie so much. Overall the movie is a great ending to one of my favorite shows ever. "", 'Though the movie is titles ""sequel"" to the FMA2003 (in short FMA03) series, it\'s not really end the series as the series went by but gave ""end"" to the series than continue it.The reason for that is, what I so loved about the FMA03 series that made me love it so much was the character development and the alchemy theory which didn\'t went easily without further explanation, so sure, the series has end with some points to continue - Ed looking for way back to Amestris world with rockets to space and Al learning all over again alchemy to find a way to return his...brother with his memory lost and some other points that left open, but the movie didn\'t care a bit not only about those points but also make some other plot holes and placed some characters in a way that the series didn\'t putted them there.When I saw this in the movie I had told myself that maybe the movie will explain, continue as the series went to explain how things moved that way, not only it didn\'t happen but took course of things that the series never went, through the movie I asked myself: ""why?"" but as the movie continued to failed and disappointment it was clear enough for me - the movie didn\'t care really what was in the series, I mean, if the movie should had go the way the series went in the same ""conqueror of shamballa"" storyline, it would won\'t end with only one part of movie but two or even three, but the movie don\'t care about how-things-were-in-the-series but to give the expected end, even if it means to smooth things up without really clear explanation or even reasonable actions, the movie wanted to do the expected end and it\'s not a spoiler - to reunite Al and Ed, in what cost? it doesn\'t matter if it make sense or unreasonable, the important things is that it will happen.Don\'t get me wrong, the watcher can ""understand"" why alchemy in the Other World is suddenly can be done or what happened to some character, but the way the things are in the movie is just not how the series will deals with, the series will give much more explanation about Mustang, Wrath and Hoenaim than just jump through things, the way of the movie dealing with is more close to FMAB way of ""if this 1 and this 1 so that\'s why this 2"", in FMA03 on the other hand I would expect much more to end the open stories.Now that I had cleared myself I would say this - this movie though all I had said is actually a good movie, unlike usual FMA style most of the story is mainly based on the Other World that based on the WW2 Germany side of hating foreign nations, and the story takes good advantage of that to create the evil side of the movie, so yeah, there\'s one good story here besides the Ed and Al looking to be reunited again, but then again, this ""Other World"" story though to be good isn\'t much explained as much the fans of FMA03 will want.Without the Story part, the art and the OST went really well to take a different and dark theme in the movie, I really loved the ending theme than the opening theme, can\'t get it of my head.I will just finish and say - though all I had written, the movie isn\'t bad, it\'s really interesting with some good action battles (though the last battle could be written better, it\'s not the art but the way it\'s written) good animation, excellent OST and good story, My only bad point really is that the movie disappointment me in the way it\'s continue the series, I don\'t complain about the end (that was expected) but how the movie took the way of the sreries. brother with his memory lost and some other points that left open, but the movie didn\'t care a bit not only about those points but also make some other plot holes and placed some characters in a way that the series didn\'t putted them there.When I saw this in the movie I had told myself that maybe the movie will explain, continue as the series went to explain how things moved that way, not only it didn\'t happen but took course of things that the series never went, through the movie I asked myself: ""why?"" but as the movie continued to failed and disappointment it was clear enough for me - the movie didn\'t care really what was in the series, I mean, if the movie should had go the way the series went in the same ""conqueror of shamballa"" storyline, it would won\'t end with only one part of movie but two or even three, but the movie don\'t care about how-things-were-in-the-series but to give the expected end, even if it means to smooth things up without really clear explanation or even reasonable actions, the movie wanted to do the expected end and it\'s not a spoiler - to reunite Al and Ed, in what cost?

It continues the story from both the brothers' viewpoints as they live separated from one another. The sequel continues its dark themes as the brothers mature and finally accept their place and role in the world that they live in.Dub or Sub?: Both. They used the same voice actors.Story/Characters (7/10): Ever since the ending of Fullmetal Alchemist, I  thought that it would be impossible for anyone to continue the story from that point (The ending was good on its own.)....Fortunately, it turns out that you can continue the storyline after the the series ended. Unfortunately, it did not turn out the way that I expected it to be.The Elric Brothers: The brothers, Edward and Alphonse, have regressed since their quest of atonement and discovery. Over the course of the movie, Edward seemed a bit useless since he can no longer use his alchemy and Alphonse became his brother in their home universe. Their new goal is to find Edward a way back home. To say anything else would spoil the rest of the film so I leave you with the hint of a disappointing yet accepted ending.The Supporting Cast Members: Most of the supporting cast do make minor cameo appearances but it is still not enough to alleviate the desire to see them again; other than rewatching the show all over again.The Villains: The villains are the Thule Society of pre-Nazi Germany. This has been hinted near the end of the show when Edward met up with his dad on the other universe (If you don't remember, WWI zeppelins were attacking Great Britain). I felt that the Nazis were nothing but ignorant villains who were given knowledge of power but were unable to understand or use it properly. In addition, their ultimate goal (to conquer Amestris) seemed very unrealistic.Art/Animation (10/10): The art/animation is similar to the show's.Sound/Music (10/10): The sound/music was good enough.Enjoyment (8/10): I enjoyed it but the plot, characters/villains really took my level of enjoyment down a peg.Summary/Overall (8/10): The story could have been better. The character development was minimal (since most of it was shown in the show) and the amount of satisfaction after watching this was decent.Review #8 Fortunately, it turns out that you can continue the storyline after the the series ended.

Fullmetal Alchemist decided to end the series in a movie... kind of pointless.. why not just extend the length of the series? but either way it was very well done and i enjoyed it even more because of the Nazis! Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa was a very good ending for the series. ', 'Review in brief:  The Conqueror of Shamballa attempts to be its own thing while being a sequel to a show with loose ends and completely fails to succeed as either.  It\'s almost as though this movie was initially a failed standalone pitch before being shoehorned into FMA as the 2003 anime was reaching its end.  As disappointing as FMA \'03\'s ending was it\'s far better than anything The Conqueror of Shamballa has to offer.**This review assumes you\'ve watched FMA \'03.**Review in full:  Anyone who finished FMA \'03 knows that its ending was just a setup for a sequel.  Aside from...the implicative final scene there were still a number of lingering questions regarding specific details from the show that were left unanswered.  This movie serves to end the anime-original storyline, but nothing more.  It has no desire to answer the questions the series left open and instead seeks to stand on its own as the final arc of the story.  This in itself raises serious questions about the validity of its setup (FMA \'03\'s finale) but considering how much of the series\' rules this movie forgets they may as well have just forgotten about what they had done before.  This is especially true when it comes to ""the gate"", the means by which alchemy acquired its energy to function in FMA \'03.  The TV show went to great lengths to show that transmutations had a cost (except the last one that got Edward & Envy to Earth, apparently ""the gate"" stopped caring).  Now ""the gate"" arbitrarily lets people switch worlds (either freely or at a cost) so long as they can open it.  The old rules simply don\'t apply anymore, nor are they cared about as the ending similarly tosses chunks of the remaining system out the window.Even within its own story, this movie features an unending torrent of plot holes & conveniences.  Many of these revolve around characters (and most of the characters at that) doing things not because it fits their presented character or because it\'s a sensible thing to do but simply because otherwise the plot would not have moved forward.  This wouldn\'t bother me as much if it wasn\'t the excuse for such events as Edward cheerfully deciding to miss the public unveiling of his past 2 years of work for a quick snooze because it was apparently the only simple way to set up the next scene, or Fritz Lang using his indestructible 1920\'s automobile to crash the Beer Hall Putsch (and I do mean crashing into the beer hall where the putsch is just kicking off) because he magically knew Edward would be there, or just about everything Hohenheim does.  The whole movie is like this too, in fact it\'s difficult to give examples without giving spoilers.  There\'s more hole than plot and it\'s not even funny.Nearly all of the characters (including the new main characters) are cardboard cutouts who are either only present to push the plot another step or enforce a stereotype to hammer down its broken attempt at a moral lesson.  This movie could have had a solid central message if it understood or remembered what it was doing with its characters (much less had any actual characterization) but instead its failed effort only drags the sorry display down further.  The few characters with any meaning to them derive all of it from the TV show, so while Edward has clearly matured since his state alchemist days and Alphonse (Elric, that is) has become bolder (and can fragment his soul to control objects now, no reason given as usual), none of the development is actually shown and rather is just what we\'re given from the get-go, which means that most of what they do is just set up to push the plot forward as well.  Meanwhile you have characters like the main villain who attacks people she\'s supposed to ally with (because how else is someone who leads the antagonists going to look evil?) and Maes Hughes who has been reduced to a laughably shallow ""evil nazi"" stereotype.It\'s frustrating considering how little the setting has been tapped into by general media.  Weimar Republic Germany was a time of wild uncertainty with revolts and movements of just about every kind that would have been possible during the Interwar period.  Many of the important events and people associated with World War II were already set in place during this time, and Germany was at the center of it all.  The Conqueror of Shamballa does tap into its setting (though events revolving around ""the gate"" and the antagonist Thule Society are the main focus) and provides an interesting (though hard to believe, mostly due to poor execution) theory regarding the Beer Hall Putsch.  However, even if it succeeded at building a story around this, it has nothing to do with Fullmetal Alchemist and would have likely worked much better as a fully separate entity.  What few elements that were brought over from FMA almost all appear shoehorned in to remind the viewer that this is in fact a FMA sequel and certainly not something completely different.  FMA\'s world could have been swapped out with any other fantasy world without any other change.Finally, this also isn\'t a movie that features worthwhile production values. The sound is merely alright with passable music, forgettable effects, and (in Japanese anyhow) voice-work that only could have gone as far as the flat characters who were speaking to begin with.  While the animation quality is generally slightly better than the TV show it also features highly dated CGI and plenty of stilted moments. There\'s definitely worse but there\'s something to be said when a 2005 movie can\'t truly improve over a 2003-04 multi-cour TV series.Verdict:  It\'s the FMA \'03 finale and it has so little to do with FMA that it\'s painful.  If you want a sequel that cleanly ends FMA \'03 rest unassured that there are no answers, just holes.  If you want a good standalone movie set in the Weimar Republic then I regret to inform you that you won\'t find it here.  Those are the only two things this movie attempted to be.  You can skip this movie without missing anything worthwhile, in fact I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding it. the implicative final scene there were still a number of lingering questions regarding specific details from the show that were left unanswered.

I did not find what I was looking for. What I found instead is a movie that simply continues on where the series leaves off and essentially mops up the story. Though an enjoyable movie in its own right, ""The Conquerer of Shambala"" feels a little disappointing. It\'s not that there\'s all that much wrong with it, it\'s just that comparisons against the series is inevitable, and the series is so exceptional...that it\'d take something special just to avoid a massive disappointment... and this movie ain\'t that special.Presentation wise, ""The Conquerer of Shambala"" retains the art style from the series, but it looks more beefed up and polished in general, and the colours seems more rich. The background music is completely new, but has similar style to the ones heard in the series. It\'s pretty good, but I do have one qualm with it: ""Brothers"", the song that, for me, encapsulated much of the feel of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", does not appear to have been used in this movie. To omit the track that was at the heart and soul of the original series is a grave error in my opinion. Aside from the presentation, the setting for the story is also different compared to the original series. Ed\'s half of the adventure is set in ""our"" world, where alchemy is rarely seen.Even though everything about this movie has a similar feel as the original series, I just did not feel the same thrill as I did watching the series -perhaps the lack of alchemy in Ed\'s half of the story takes the edge off the excitement just a bit (I guess this highlights the importance and the strength of the fantasy element in the original series), or perhaps the story just isn\'t as good. But like I said, it would have been a tall order for any movie length anime to recreate the awesome feel of that amazing series. Still, in spite of this, I feel that as far as sequels go, it does serve as an adequate conclusion to the ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" saga. Now that ""Fullmetal Alchmist: Brotherhood"" is out though, it\'s not such a bad idea to just go straight on to that and forget about this alternative ending, because there really is no contest as to which one is better... that it\'d take something special just to avoid a massive disappointment... and this movie ain\'t that special.Presentation wise, ""The Conquerer of Shambala"" retains the art style from the series, but it looks more beefed up and polished in general, and the colours seems more rich.

I was wrong in my hopes. To put the main part of the problem with the movie simply, putting NAZIs into the movie won't make it good, espically when you make certain characters apart of it (we all know who).Since they were not underbudget, the quality of the movie was not bad, the direction was). Setting up the plot into two different universes can be interesting, but only if they are introduced at different times. Would you agree that the show might be interesting...(if only a litte) if it started off with Alphonse trying to find his brother, unlocking the gates to head to the other side, upon entertering, he realises that Edward will die soon if he doesn't stop the NAZIs trying to kill him etc.The use of Nazis comes to me as a failed attempt to pad out the movie. If you want an enemy to fight and you don't want to put much effort into it, choose something that everyone universally despises like the use of NAZIs. My point is that you cannot give a good depth to a story when you are cutting corners on the plot.Unless money was the motive, there was no real need for this movie to be made, the filler ending of FMA wrapped it up so we could move on with our lives. Sadly, a hook got us by the neck and dragged us to watch this.

It clearly wasn\'t perfect, but they made a great job of what they had; an hour and three quarters well spent, in my opinion.-----ART-----Nothing really stands out; it isn\'t super-detailed, or artistically magnificent. But it\'s...consistently visually pleasing, slightly improving on the similarly-satisfying quality of the series; with some very nice visual effects thrown in here and there. As with most animé of the last half-decade, it\'s primarily computer-rendered (nice crisp lines, and precise colours); but they haven\'t done what often happens, namely where they try to integrate 3D-renderings with the 2D environment/characters and fail horribly. Which is always nice.---------SOUND---------The soundtrack is orchestral, and was both well-written, and was of very good sound quality. Most of the seiyuu reprised their roles from the series, and all of them were not only appropriate to their characters, but knew how to speak in a way that conveyed the tone of the scene without once sounding ridiculous or annoying. Japanese women sometimes fail at this, but this was a success.---------------CHARACTER---------------I won\'t go into all of the characters from the main series, since it would take too long and get boring; but suffice to say pretty much all of those ones who are in this film get 10/10. The only let-downs in this area (in my opinion) were that the main Antagonist of the film was somewhat insufficiently explained (and their motives felt a touch forced right at the end); and that the appearance of the Homunculi didn\'t really make that much sense.---------------ENJOYMENT---------------This was a fun and exciting film; where the action sequences were well represented, and the story-progression scenes were consistent and interesting. A few scenes even combined the two well. In fact, there was nothing which detracted from the actual enjoyment of the film; but of course it simply didn\'t contain the epic-ness, spectacle, or sharp wit which would qualify this film to be a ""masterpiece"".-----------OVERALL-----------This film was very good. I can\'t really give it a 9, mainly since there was nothing particularly innovative about it, nor did it reach really significant epic-levels; but if you enjoyed the 2003 series, watch this film.Don\'t watch it if you haven\'t, since it assumes a lot of knowledge from the series.

Edward no longer has his alchemy powers and has to live by the physics of the real world. He spends most of his time helping a man named Alphonse Heiderich, a man who is a striking resemblance of Alphonse Elric, Edward\'s brother that he left behind in the alchemy world. In the real...world, Edward has been trying to find a way to get home and return to his friends and family while in the alchemy world, Alphonse Elric has been searching for a way to bring Edward back through alchemy. Both worlds are collided together and havoc is unleashed when some evil people from the real world discover a way to break into the the alchemy world.Story: (8/10)The story line of this movie follows and sticks with the story line of the TV series almost 100 % accurately. Also, historical events from the Post WWI era are represented in the movie. Hitler and the Nazi Party\'s failed attempt at the Munich Putsch takes place while Edward is in the real world and references to the Treaty of Versailles are shown as people are shown complaining about the government being taken over by communists. Standing alone from the TV series, the story line will seem confusing and many references to characters from the anime will not be understood. To fully enjoy this movie, I recommend that anyone should watch the TV series before watching the movie so that they can get a better feel for the connection between the brothers and experience the character developments through the TV series beforehand.Character: (9/10)The characters in this movie were excellent. Many of the characters from the alchemy world had a counterpart in the real world and vice-versa. To add historical significance to this movie, historical figures such as Adolf Hitler, silent film director, Fritz Lang, supposed clairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussan, and geopolitical professor, Karl Haushoffer were also involved in the story. Although some of the characters are given a lot less screen time than Edward, the creators did a good job in executing their appearances and integrating them into the story.Art/ Animation: (10/10)Beautiful, stunning, and great quality. The animation moved smoothly and was enhanced by the beautiful art and design of the characters and scenes.Voice acting/ Music: (9/10)The dubbed version that I saw had smooth voice dubbing and the music did a good job accenting the scenes in the movie.Overall: (9/10)This movie was a great adaption of the TV series and did an excellent job at showcasing the characters and giving them significance. The movie also did a good job at giving the TV series a satisfying conclusion and had both funny and tragic aspects in the story.

Every other aspect of the movie is better explained with my review of the anime so you can understand its greatness:&quot; The story is something never seen before in another anime, and the way it is told is superb. From the first episode you can see how great it is going to turn and believe me when I say that you wont be disappointed.The visual quality is top notch and doesn't drop in any episode.Every song is a true masterpiece and really goes with the different situations...that are presented.The character development is the best I've ever seen in an anime. Everyone's motivation is coherent and you really get the feeling of getting to know every character. There's one character (I wont spoil it to you) that you really get to hate and understand at the same time (even though you keep hating him), and it's this little details which makes you get into the world.I have no complaints with this anime whatsoever, as it manages to bring together all the aspects of a great anime: action, mystery, betrayal, friendship, laughs and almost every color that makes up a true human being.If you haven't watched it yet then you really have missed a lot.As a final comment, if you're going to watch it I recommend the japanese voices over the american dub. The japanese cast's voices are better suited for the personality and age of every character than the english voices. &quot; that are presented.The character development is the best I've ever seen in an anime.

It may contain spoilers.When I saw the cover for this movie, I was left with a ""Hmm... I don\'t know"" sorta feel in my head. The ending for the original FMA series was well done and even the author of the FMA manga approved the ending for the anime adaptation, but fans were like ""the ending is bullshit!"" or ""WHAT?! This ending is a disgrace to the series!!"" when the series ended. So Studio Bones and the FMA series team decided to make a FMA movie that ended the series right and that...answer was Conqueror Of Shamballa. The movie was loved by everyone and it become a cult hit among all FMA fans and was officially declared as a ""true ending to the original show"". Well, I decided to buy it and while it is a damn fun movie, it isn\'t the best thing I ever saw and for a FMA movie, it has some big flaws that many FMA fans missed on looking at.Conqueror Of Shamballa takes place 2 years after the original series, as we see Edward Elric living in the real world in Munich, Germany and he is studying rocketry with Alfons Heiderich, who resembles a lot to his younger brother Alphonse and finding a way to escape this world and getting back into his world. That is until Ed rescues a gypsy woman named Noah, who has the power to read people\'s thoughts and dreams, who\'s being chased by a bunch of man who work for a Nazi organization called The Thule Society, who are led by Eckhart and Karl. They want to open the portal to find a place called Shamballa, which is a paradise with no war, death or even corruption in any way they can imagine. Meanwhile in Amnestris, Alphonse has been learning a bunch of new alchemy powers in order to find Edward, so he can recover his forgotten memories that he lost during the final episode of the series. And thus begin an adventure of a lifetime for The Elric Brothers once again and could this mean that they can be together without causing more destruction and bloodshed this time around?The plot is good, but with some flaws. I like how the story gives these theories of science and alchemy like what if science and alchemy can be combined from two different worlds and how we can utilize it to make a change into this world. I\'m no expert in science and alchemy (it takes years to study all those theories), but regardless, it gives very interesting stuff. Also, the new characters Noah and Alfons are surprisingly well developed in this movie. I cared for Alfons because he wanted to be a proud citizen of Germany and would do anything to make a difference in the war. As for Noah... Well, it\'s hard to describe, but for me, I think it\'s because she is a lonely and sad person, due to that people treat her like shit, because she is a gypsy and that they claim that gypsy\'s were a bunch of thief\'s in their time, but Noah is a very gentle person and all she wants is acceptance to live amongst the people in the world.  Also, Fritz Lang, who you might know as the legendary German director for his famous film Metropolis from 1927, is also a very interesting character and I love the scene where he explains to Edward the portal to Shamballa.The villains Eckhart and Karl are terrible. They weren\'t interesting, their motivations were beyond stupidity and the final battle with Edward and Eckhart was a huge letdown (BTW, Eckhart and Karl were actually real people from the history of World War II). The relationship with Alphonse and Edward, while still deep and memorable, felt extremely short. They have a happy reunion, a sad depressing moment, a battle scene and the ending and I was expecting the relationship of The Elric Brothers to be longer. Another flaw is the subplot with Hitler and really, how in the world did The Thule Society convince Hitler to use a magical portal that can take them to another world to use it and win the war? It\'s just not right and I\'m surprised that Hitler didn\'t have a HOLY SHIT! response when he saw a portal that could take him to another world.The action and animation is nice. While the action is kinda shorter this time around, at least it satisfying as hell and the fights are still well animated and the fight with Wrath against Gluttony is pretty epic. Hell, each fan favorite character gets their big moments in the film, unlike Sacred Star Of Milos (which I will review later) where all the fan favorites FMA characters were barely useful in the movie. The animation by Bones is still spectacular to look at, the backgrounds are gorgeous with fluid detail and coloring, the character models are still pretty to look at, while getting major upgrade on their coloring scheme designs and the art is still awesome as always. Voice acting is also a high plus, every original English voice actor from the FMA series is here and they all do a brilliant job in their performances, even Jason Liebrecht gives a very deep performance as Alfons. The music, while not as groundbreaking as the series tremendous music, it\'s still serviceable.While it doesn\'t reach the heights of the FMA series, Conqueror Of Shamballa is a nice effort from Bones and delivering a fun experience while staying true to the source of the 2003 FMA series. Just don\'t expect this to be groundbreaking like the series or you will be extremely disappointed after watching this anime.

It did conclude the business of the show, in a way, but I feel there is so much more left.  The love arc with Ed and Winrey was what I really most wanted to see complete, but sadly that does not happen.  I feel that Brotherhood has a more satisfying ending for the story of Edward Elric, even if it is a different story.  Now if you remove Brotherhood from the equation I still feel like this movie left the show just a...tiny bit incomplete.  Watch it if you prefer the original show over Brotherhood, but if you enjoy Brotherhood more you will probably feel more like me. tiny bit incomplete.

Most found it weak and not finale material. So naturally, I went in a little leery of what I would think of it. The whole alternate universe plot seemed interesting enough during the show, and the final episode had me flabbergasted since everything was still left wide open. The beginning of the film had me confused as hell before they actually started to reveal what was going on. Two Al's and all the...characters being in Nazi Germany had me slightly off-put, and strangely intrigued at the same time. It was kind of a fresh direction to go for the series, I think. Granted ill say the new and unfamiliar characters were stock, however, everyone else shined. I especially loved Mustang's comeback. In all honesty the most annoying part was the whole fiasco surrounding the gypsy. They should have ditched all the new characters and had Envy be the big bad since he's pretty much my favorite villain. Other than those few critiques, I have to say, this was a very entertaining film. The music was perfect, the animation was gorgeous, and it was action packed. I actually liked seeing how Ed and Al acted apart from each other and the heartbreaking struggle they underwent to be together again, as well as the AU versions of other characters and cameos. This movie really didn't let its audience off easy killing two major hero characters (one onscreen) along with a villain...or was he? Also, the ending was equally as painful, if not more painful than the FMAB ending which is saying something. I really don't know if it was an amazing ending, or a bad one since it really threw my emotions in the blender. We all know I like depressing things that rattle my feelings so maybe that's why I was okay with the twist. I am happy to have finished the series feeling like things were wrapped up and I quite liked the film overall.8.5/10 stars.Watched dubbed. characters being in Nazi Germany had me slightly off-put, and strangely intrigued at the same time.

Why would You make both brothers live in the other world smh. Also i don't care about the villain. Dante should of been the final villain somehow and the homunculus should of been very important to the ending, not how they did it. Okay the way Wrath went out i'm actually happy with that but Envy? No. Just imagine a epic showdown between the Elric brothers and Dante! Edward Elric why the hell would You be so selfish and live in the other world!? I can't get over this ending. It just makes no sense out Ed was willing to just...like in the other world without his brother (Yeah his bro joins him in the end but stilll) Winry etc. They could of handled it a lot better but it was a mess. If i watch Brotherhood i know for a fact I will prefer that ending more than this but the character SLOTH is different in both verisons and I like the 2003 version so that will be my only downside. like in the other world without his brother (Yeah his bro joins him in the end but stilll) Winry etc. They could of handled it a lot better but it was a mess.

So I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was. The story was really well put together with some surprising plot twists which always had me guessing, and the art and sound are a solid upgrade from the series. I watched it in english which felt natural compared with the sometimes awkward translation from the series....But the most impressive thing about the movie by far is the characters. One of the biggest problems I had with the series was how shallow the characters were, but in this movie the characters have fantastic depth and personality, both the old familiar characters, and the some of the new ones. Their were some subtle and some dramatic changes to the characters which gave them a dynamic and compelling presence in the film which really played off of the series well, while remaining unique and new. It is really impressive that a 2 hour show can utilize so many characters each with their own story and personality. And each character had a good solid place in the plot. Also, the motivation for each characters actions was depicted in a believable way, that is not an easy task!  If you watched the series and were not impressed, give this movie a try! it really redeemed this franchise for me. But the most impressive thing about the movie by far is the characters.

I think of it as a really long episode 52, because it's one of the few anime movies that serves as part of the main story of the show it's from, the finale even. And it's... alright. I don't hate it, overall I gave it an average score, but especially after seeing the ending of Brotherhood or the Manga I really am not fond of the way they tried to wrap things up here. Let's talk about what I liked first and then get into...what I think is really holding this movie back.I actually kind of like the concept that our real world is what's on the other side of the gate. It's a little wonky and doesn't work at all in the original continuity but as a premise it's fine. It's a reverse Isekai. Let's go. I'm on board. I think it's interesting seeing how Ed interacts with the real world counterparts of people he knew in what I'm going to call Amestris even though it's never officially given that name in the 2003 anime. I think the WWII setting was a neat idea, I like how Hughes is a Nazi now, or the Jewish film director in place of Bradley. The Nazi occult stuff is always a good excuse to do magic in the real world, Wolfenstein games have been doing it since forever. This would have been a really interesting world to visit, and the challenges of coming back from that world to Amestris would have been a nice adventure.But boy oh boy did they think they'd throw us for a loop and instead have Al come and live in a now post-war Germany instead. No plans to return to Amestris. I guess forget Winry, who cares about Mustang and the rest of the military. It's like they forgot that one episode where the boys remember that they still have a home in Resembool and all the people they left behind when they were off adventuring. They even did an OVA joking about just how messed up it is that they left everyone behind to have some new crazy adventure with rockets in another world. Winry in this movie just looks so broken when she realized Ed apparently doesn't really care about her at all. I hate that ending, I think it's really dumb, they should have just brought Ed back.

This movie shows the conclusion of the FMA 2003 anime. The animation was better than the series. I know that this is not adapted from manga but the story was still satisfying. The ending was little sad as Edward and Winry were not able to be together. But when Alphonse came into the German planet, it was a really memorable pleasureable moment. The character of Alphonse of Germany is very underrated but still he was a excellent character. We were also able to see Roy Mustang in action once again 😀. The only minus point of this...movie was it's villians. As everyone knows that the villians in the series were outstanding but the villians in movie were serious pooped.

As someone who dislikes open ends, I was hoping this movie would leave me somewhat more content with the ending of the 2003 series, but I feel as if the movie left me more or less where I started - with some questions answered, some new added and overall the same level of satisfaction.This movie introduced some interesting ideas that, similar to how I view the 2003 series as a whole, are intriguing to see play out as an ""what if""-scenario - however while the 2003 series felt somewhat like a fanfiction version of brotherhood to...me, this felt like a fanfiction continuation of the 2003 series.It was interesting, it was entertaining, but I feel somehow less fulfilled than I did before watching the movie. The story was wild, and maybe just too off the rails for me to take entirely serious, and while the story-progression had big consequences, the stakes somehow didn\'t feel all that high for most of the playtime.I feel like it wrapped up some loose ends from the main series (given that this is kind of a very long last episode), but even though I felt ready to dive into this new concept, it just didn\'t quite work out for me.This movie is worth watching after the 2003 series, but the story could\'ve used some more polishing. To be fair, it probably wasn\'t an easy task to write from where the show left off, but the story seemed to be lacking a convincing direction and pace.I feel as if the writers somewhat wrote themselves into a corner with the introduction of their original plot-conclusion in the series, and the story here suffers from being unable to wrap up nicely what would need more time and setup to be wrapped up nicely. me, this felt like a fanfiction continuation of the 2003 series.It was interesting, it was entertaining, but I feel somehow less fulfilled than I did before watching the movie.

It should have worke as a conclusion too, but so little has changed between the start and end of the film that I really can't say it adds anything to the series beyond a few hours' airtime. As a fan of the series, of course we want to see more of our beloved characters (even if most only reappear for a few seconds), and it's enjoyable to see who Ed has become. But beyond that this...film honestly has very little to offer.The extended plot is simple and orthodox; the big bad wants to do evil, has tricked all the innocent people into following them, and only our hero with a few select comrades knows the truth of the matter and can stop them. There are certainly parts that are well done, but I can only say that this film is average, and depends on our pre-existing love for the franchise - somewhat ironically, as, although in some ways understandably, there is a glaring lack of one of FA's staples: Alchemy, or more specifically, the Fullmetal Alchemist; in the new world Ed is just an average young man. I still hated the ending, but I'm sure that's quite subjective, aside from it's inconclusiveness.Art:The art and animation were smooth and steady, just like the series... with the entirely random exception of the super-cgi army of armoured infantary (Why are the post WWI germans wearing suits of armour? Nobody knows, but Al's armour's doppelganger gets a cameo, so isn't that nice.)Sound:I can only say that, like the art, it was equal to the series, there was nothing particularly striking in a positive or negative sense.Character:The characters were definitely mixed in value, but I'll start with our protagonist, Ed.At the start of the film it's very clear that Ed holds to the values he learned in his old world during the series, and also how his spirit is affected by his current life; I thought it was a great transition from where the series left off, his development felt very natural. Within the film however Ed has nothing to learn and therefore develops very little as a person, if at all. He's already learned who he needs to be to deal with the events in this film, and he already knows his place in the world. If there is any development, it's accepting the transition of his place in his original world to his place in this one. In a way I don't think this is all bad; it's satisfying to see a character be supported by his life's experiences having watched him learn the hard way the first time round, and it allows him to guide the characters around him who are still finding themselves. I do miss his doing alchemy though; it feels as though a part of him is missing, as alchemy is an integral part of his identity and his growth throughout his life, and him lacking his true abilities is achingly clear during fight scenes, making things feel very off. This adds to the story, as we experience an extent of how unsettling this new life is for Ed... or should have been, as apparently this doesn't matter at all according to the end of the film. Simultaneously if the Fullmetal Alchemist is no longer an alchemist, what are we even watching anymore? The automative scientist? There's a reason isekai transitions only go one way, and when it doesn't, the newcomers always bring their powers with them.Al, who has been left as his younger self, is continuing the last objective he was set up with; to find Ed. Even though we know that, it feels very much as though he, and every other character in the original world, is moved according to convenience.Even though no one should know anything about the other side of the gate or what is happening, somehow everybody is in the right place at the right time to fulfill the role required of the them when the conflict occurs, with very weak setups. Some might as well not have been there.Winry for example happens to be there just at the one moment Ed needs her, and it feels like his needing her is literally written in exclusively so Winry will have a role, especially as she has zero consequence at any other point during the film. (Which, might I add, is frankly ridiculous, aside from being Ed's mechanic, she and Pinako are Ed and Al's only family, and should be the most important person in either world to both of them following each other.) The fact that despite her brief appearance her existence was entirely inconsequential is absurd, and she's not the only one who appears just so we can gawk at characters we already know and cherish for a few moments. Just about everyone from the original world, with the exception of Al, Wrath, and possibly Mustang (who is inexplicable for other reasons), have no effect on the story whatsoever, and might as well not have been there.In the new world, conveniently for the character designers, apparently 50% of Ed's acquaintances are doppelgangers of people he knew in the old world, but interestingly enough, they do to an extent have their own personalities, and aren't just carbon copies of the versions we know.Probably my favourite character is Noah, a gypsy girl who I'm sure looks like the doppelganger of Rose, but it's never mentioned (even though she's also judged by her race the way the people of Lione nearly were) so I just assumed she is intended to be an original character. Probably. Although it kind of falls apart at the end, she has a genuine purpose within the story, and is a likable character who's feelings the viewer can understand and sympathize with. Because of Ed she is given a space to grow, and by the end of the film she has undergone several experiences that we see have changed her significantly when compared to who she was when we first met her (even if the introduction was pretty cliche).Several other new world characters have both purpose and development, to varying degrees, and the political state of post war Germany is well integrated into the story and the lives of everyone involved.Enjoyment:Even with it's 3D armour and other flaws I was really enjoying The Conqueror of Shamballa until it ended without anything I could call a reasonable conclusion. Part of it is just my wishes for the continuation for the story, but, without spoiling anything, it's also to do with the fact that, aside from being cliche and wrought with convenience, again, the 'conclusion' also seems counterproductive to the initial conflict that Ed is dealing with, which is the one thing which we all really want to see resolved. The fact that it did not do this was a massive let down for me, additionally so because this conflict is then entirely discarded to to it's half-assed resolution.This film felt very much like three steps forward, two steps back.Overall:I realise I've been dumping on the film quite a lot in this review, but I would in fact recommend this if you enjoyed Fullmetal. Equally though, I wouldn't push anyone to watch it when they could just move on to Brotherhood if they wanted to see more of the Elric brothers, and witness the original conclusion intended by the author.

I ignored the specifics at first and just enjoyed the ride. Eventually I put the pieces together.The film really digs into the idea of an alternate universe. Several characters and their parallel universe twins are present in the world similar to our own.It's kind of a historical anime since it takes place in the early 1900's and makes reference to...Nazi Germany.I'm not sure what role that psychic lady played in the film. She had the ability to read minds and was being chased by the bad guys, but it didn't even look like they needed her.The fight with little wrath and that fat blob was the star action scene. Fast and powerful movement. It was short but good.I didn't understand the suits of armor. Were they human? Possessed? They moved like zombies but bled and collapsed when shot, so they weren't empty.

I would've liked if he went back to his world. I didn't like its story, there were so many more original stories that could've happened.

I don't like where the story leaves Ed and while I love that him and Al were reunited, it leaves a lot to be desired.

It is one of my favourite endings to a series of all time, yet follows \'Conqueror of Shamballa\', a movie that aims to be more than a last hurrah for these characters - rather serving as the \'true ending\' of the show.But the story it tries to tell here can only be described as completely underwhelming. The only thing to wrap up per se is the reunion of the Elric brothers, which without doing so serves a major factor...as to why the original ending works so well, following the constant idea of \'equivalent exchange\' that is mentioned in every episode of the show. In achieving this goal we are introduced to a further exploration of Nazi Germany in which Edward currently resides and the bunch of non-characters that reside in it.I must say I do like alternate world Alphonse, but when you have more development into a fictional version of Fritz Lang over your main villain some things need to be reconsidered. Plus who even was the guy in the prelude? He\'s there for a display of typical show antics and then isn\'t mentioned again until the very end of the film?? As for re-occuring characters it\'s just a case of ""woah look here they are"", it works in the shows logic that to open such a gate between worlds sacrifice would be involved, but to just off a character such as Hoenheim like that I can only find stupid. Sure Wrath\'s death is emotional but he\'s back for all of 5 minutes before it happens, I think as an anime original character there was a bit more potential to squeeze out of him when his character has done such a 1080 since the last time we saw him in the show.But I think the greatest sin here is Ed and Winrey reunite for all of 2 minutes before they\'re separated forever. She is the main love interest of this show, Edward talks about her in his sleep, yet all they do is hug, exchange a few words and Ed is ready to instantly throw everything out of the window again just to nobley close the gate for good. The gravitas of this invasion isn\'t really felt because of how little time the fight lasts for, we see one casualty and then it\'s just a piece of cake for Roy, Ed and Al to destroy the ships and send the villain back to Germany.There is a ton of ways they could have written this to serve as a happy resolution to the Elric brothers journeys, but instead they wanted to keep this darker tone which results in this movie feeling like a royal waste of time that achieves nothing. Whilst they are re-united under the guise of brotherly love, it\'s quite astounding to think both of them can rationally so easily ditch everyone else in their life for good in an ending that only feels as to take away from the greatness of the original. as to why the original ending works so well, following the constant idea of \'equivalent exchange\' that is mentioned in every episode of the show.

Huyao Xiao Hongniang: Wangquan Fugui,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33209/Huyao_Xiao_Hongniang__Wangquan_Fugui,"[""This review will cover a little bit from S1 as well as this season.This arc is a lot better in terms of storytelling I think, S1 was chaotic and the comedy aspects of it was overwhelming (that, or I got used to the style). I believe it might be quite hefty for someone who have not been exposed to Chinese mythical fantasies and its mechanism, especially with the add on of modern internet humour. I found it difficult to follow at the beginning.Moving on! The Wangquan Fugui arc is where the real business happens, it’s based on Fugui and Qingtong. It followed a same...vibe from S1 but with a bit more structure.

I mean did you see their faces? the guys look like a bunch of...losers and perverts, and guess what, they really are like that.Sound:The voice acting is very good, and the Bg music is well blended with the comedy part... I've also noticed the Op themes which are very very funny, just like Maeno's &quot;Propeller&quot; songStory:Well the bulk of the anime lies in the story and characters... well it's not a plot driven anime, not the kind that focuses all it's power on a goal reached at the end, nope it's the kind of story that i like to call &quot;lifestyle story&quot; cos it shows the day to day routine and problems the characters get into...Character:..and belive me when you have two perverts with loud mouths and tons of energy who do nothing else but exagerated practical jokes to other people like dressing-up-games, bullying, blackmail, stealing money, farting and all sorts of stupid plans (Maeno and Izawa.. they are one of the most original and best couples out there) ... then you have the sickest most twisted and perverted little quiet type of guy (Tanaka)... a big and really good-inside person that has the worts BO (Tanabe)... a Casanova kinda guy (Kinoshita), two evil teachers with some psycho problems, a secret Loosers Club organization with the sole purpose of making the hole school look bad so all the kids can be as stupid as the members of the secret club... and a love story between a counscios guy and a sadistic girl which has some anger management problem (Takeda and Kyoko)... well what more could you want? some sado-masochism, cross-dressing, nudity and lots more.Value and Enjoyment:Well don't worry this isn't a hentai and it could never bee since the show is about everything it can be exept romance... but still i wouldn't recomand it to kids.. this is more of a &quot;toilet comedy&quot; like American Pie... but for a teenager with a sense of humor this is a real goldmine... and can be rewatched over and over again just for the humor.It's just strange how few people have seen this one, well since the animation isn't good and the girls aren't really cute i guess that the bulk of anime viewers didn't try it, since they were looking for cute panty shots and lots of cute girls falling in love with one spineless normal guy.. people can be soo shallow... lol but then again how can you call a guy that enjoys this???Good and Bad points:+funniest show ever (in a carefree but twisted perverse way)+some of the most original characters ever (like no other you have ever seen)-bad animation (although i found it apropiate)-has tons of offensive and grows out material for the sensitive ones (not that i cared)Well i laughed soo hard at this one that i couldn't keep my ass on the chair and i developed some agonising abdominal pain.. i recommend this to all the insensitive guys out there who wanna just laugh... losers and perverts, and guess what, they really are like that.Sound:The voice acting is very good, and the Bg music is well blended with the comedy part...

Right about the first five minutes, where you lay your eyes on the characters and how they behave, you will immediately have a notion of what to expect for the rest of the series. And this is where you make a choice. You can choose to preserve your sanity and perfectly normal IQ level or go down that crazy roller coaster that is this series.Needless to say that you already know what turn I've taken. And I don't regret it, far from it. PPC is the perfect metaphor for all the...craziness that somewhat in our lives flashes trough our mind in one situation or another. Bear in mind that these &quot;situations&quot; are not the common ones, as you can see by the Age Rating (ranging from PG-13 on this website to Mature).Every single one of these characters are brought to life and, whether their personalities are more or less demented, they express it perfectly as they go on with their daily affairs neglecting each and every moral law that is known to man.Routine is simply a concept that maybe it hasn't reached that small room where the PPC spend their days doing everything else than practicing Ping-Pong.Reaching the more technical part, every series needs a couple of technical characteristics that support the action. PPC, albeit not being generously gracious on what it does, both the sound and the art do their job. The art is raw and contributes to the dastardly look of the show, keeping the ambiance set. The models are fairly well animated tending to the date of the show but don't expect any jaw dropping material. Also don't expect any moderation on part of the animators. There is alot of explicit material and nudity (it literally flashes through your eye, as the animators tend to focus alot of attention on letting you know that that those contents are there).

Pee pee po pee pee po po."", 'First of all I would like to say, I never really expected this anime to be that great. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Here\'s why...At some point a while ago, I got rather bored of watching the regular series that I tend to watch. Not for the fact that what I was watching I thought was bad- but I wanted to step into a darker territory of anime that I hadn\'t experienced. So what I did was, I googled ""worst anime ever""... Somehow, I managed to find this... This hilarious yet unbelievably crap masterpiece that had been panned elsewhere on the net as being really...bad- the worst thing that japanimation had ever spawned, supposedly.Now, you see the plan was this- find an anime and get some real laughs from how shitty it was to kind of change the atmosphere of what I had been watching. I\'d like to think that I had been watching some pretty decent series beforehand and that it was time to experience what the worst of the anime world could offer. So without hesitation, I started the series to try and get some light on this predicament I had decided to put myself in. Braced, ready for the ""abomination"" I threw myself in headfirst and began watching with bated breath.Only to end up laughing harder than I\'d laughed in a very long time.This series, quite frankly is the very pinnacle of ""stupid humour"". It\'s utterly ridiculous. At some points I was left unable to even grasp what I had just seen- I ended up going back and watching parts again thinking ""did they really just do that?"". Though, for an anime somebody said was bad, I can see why people would think this. There is a high amount of immaturity and I can easily imagine a lot of people being turned off completely by this anime. But truthfully, this kind of humour only adds, ultimately to how good it really is in the same sense. Honestly, it\'s very easy to comprehend how people will dislike this series because of the nature of the humour- for example I can\'t really imagine a lot of female audiences enjoying watching a drunken naked chick doing unbelievably provocative things with a carrot (yes, really), but the whole thing in my eyes, seems to fit together in one quite well rounded package of pure idiocy. Simply put-It\'s so shit it\'s good.What I would have to say is the main element that drives the entire series, without any shadow of a doubt, is the characters. All of the Ina-chuu Ping Pong Club members are just perverted losers, but together and put in some of the most insane situations- they give a fairly entertaining performance. Takeda is basically just (Insert generic main character here) who flawlessly screws up even the most menial of tasks without even realising, though still manages to maintain the position of being able to push the story along. Kinoshita is that one guy who somehow all the chicks dig, though he\'s such a dense imbecile that he doesn\'t take advantage of this and won\'t even quite seem to realise how much he actually fails given his status. In one situation, he even ends up getting tied up and thrown into a garbage bin. Tanabe is your wacky half-Japanese, half-American that is more grotesque in appearance than words can really describe and every now and then, will spout something in English spoken so horrendously bad in a Japanese accent that you\'ll want to cry. Tanaka is some kind of better-drawn pubescent edition of Shin-Chan that doesn\'t talk very much, sent from the nether-regions of a world we couldn\'t possibly understand to do some very, very weird things with animals. Maeno & Izawa are a serious package deal due to severity of their stupidity. Together, these two characters form the backbone of the humour in the show. Whether it\'s riding around dressed up as animals on panda cars inviting little girls for a ""ride"", cross dressing and pretending to be a married couple, erecting a giant turd statue, pretending to be the school doctors and sexually molesting girls in the process- whatever, they\'ve pretty much got this aspect coming out of their ears. The truth is, this doesn\'t even begin to cover it. Maeno, by himself is quite frankly one of the most unbelievable characters in many different indescribable ways. A couple of scenes involving Maeno were just so funny to me that I had to stop watching because I thought I was going to have a stroke.Aside from the plethora of morons that clearly brighten the viewing experience for many, there are a various number of characters that practically mean nothing and exist merely for convenience, or to remind people that the show can\'t just be about random insanity, dick jokes and a pervert\'s wet dream (rather, the show would be allowed to be a pervert\'s wet dream but our network won\'t let it happen). I find that these characters are nothing more than supplements to our main cast, creating the senseless yet somehow creative comedy environments in our show, but adding subtle moments of relief from this to convince us that we\'re not going totally insane watching it. Ultimately, there is no serious plot. At all. There are a lot of tits. The main characters are oddly charming retards. Some of such a great intensity, in reality people like Maeno and Izawa would be very at home in a mental asylum.The other aspects of this anime, when taken into account become a very different story. The ending, is nothing to get your hopes up about, I\'m afraid. The art direction of the show is quite poor, though given when this anime was released you can forgive it- because ultimately, I found that where things needed to look crappy, they looked crappy. Where things needed to look more presentable, they were. I don\'t think that the Art is a failure in this show. But it is definitely nothing spectacular, by any standard, especially todays. For some people, all you\'ll need to see is Maeno\'s badly drawn penis and if your first thought isn\'t telling you that this show really your thing, it\'s at least telling you that the Art isn\'t the focus on this show. You can expect it to be menial, something that overexaggerates the silly.Musically, the show delivers a little poorly. It is definitely an aspect of the show that I believe could have been improved upon, but yet again, it\'s not really of great importance. Music is fairly generic in places, though quite odd in others. In all fairness the show would not have delivered much differently if more effort had been put into the soundtrack, though in places it does start to show. After the first dozen episodes you can start to realise how much of the same music gets re-hashed into different scenes and it can really annoy some people, which is more than understandable. The OP\'s and ED\'s are fairly decent, they aren\'t the kind of thing which would really gear you up for the show- but that\'s okay- given the content, why the hell would anyone concerned with this kind of aspect of anime be watching this anime for that reason? I think it all levels itself out.In the end, this is an anime that as I\'m sure people have said before- is not for everyone. Personally, I enjoyed this greatly. I don\'t find many comedies very memorable as a person, but this was unlike anything I had ever seen before. This series really pushes the boundaries of how acceptable this kind of humour is in places, but for people like me- who enjoy this kind of thing every once in a while... It was nothing short of hilarious. I think that it\'s safe to say that a lot of times when this kind of immaturity is attempted in comedy it comes out in a very half-assed unfulfilling way, but this is a show that doesn\'t hold back- it\'s that part of us that wants things to be totally asinine and rude, with no real justification. If you enjoy total stupidity and perversion over-accentuated in a very amusingly random way, then step right up- this is definitely an anime that will have you in stitches. bad- the worst thing that japanimation had ever spawned, supposedly.Now, you see the plan was this- find an anime and get some real laughs from how shitty it was to kind of change the atmosphere of what I had been watching.

At last an anime where most of the characters are total bastards! It is quite similar to Green green, but regarding perversion, this goes further. It's not a hentai, though. It's more about toilet humour, psychedelic cross-dressing, small penises and a fair amount of boobs.This anime had me laughing out loud several times per episode, which is rare. I give it the same fun rating as Photon!AnimationOk, it doesn't look very fresh, but the character designs are good, and the animators must have set a world record in funny face creation.SoundSomewhat ok intro and outro tunes and the background music felt varied and suiting....The voice acting was good, but there may have been a bit too much hysterical screaming.StoryThe six members of the ping pong club mostly just goof around, with a new wierd delusion every episode. The only actual story components are a few romances and the threat of the club being shut down due to lack of members.So... not much of a story, which is a bit of a shame. In 26 episodes, there were plenty of room for one. The final episodes feels a bit disappointing. There should have been a better ending. Not that I expected one.Despite this, the consistency is actually quite high; little details like recurring characters, new friends, new haircuts and stuff are not forgotten between episodes.CharacterEver get sick of those tons of Shinji/Keitaro clones? This crowd consists of total bastards that are guaranteed to turn your anime world upside down!This feels wierd to say, but I actually found most of the characters' behaviour to be somewhat rational. I often have a hard time buying anime characters' motivations, but these guys feel kind of human to me. Well, except for all the insane stuff, of course.I liked all of the characters, but perhaps Maeno got a little too much screen time, and his voice can be really annoying in the long run (edit: Ok, just found out that Maeno shares voice talent with the monkey guy from Initial D. So there you have it).

Let me go over why this anime is bad, but why I LOVE it at the same timeStory: 2/10The Story in Ping Pong Club is practically non-existent. The series basically consists of a group of losers known as the boys Ping Pong Club. The first 2 episodes of the series are about the boys trying to keep their Ping Pong Club together, but after that the story is basically complete non-sense. While this in theory is...a bad thing, I honestly don\'t mind it here. I like that the story doesn\'t get in the way of the shenanigans, so I at least appreciate that we jump straight into the entertainment of this series. Still though, I\'m not going to call a ""story"" that only exists purely for the shenanigans to ensure & nothing else good.Characters: 9/10The characters in Ping Pong aren\'t deep at all & really only have 1 character trait. But in the case of this series, that\'s fine. This is a comedy after all, you don\'t need the character depth of something like Cowboy Bebop for a comedy series. So long as you can provide good comedic dynamics & genuine laughs. Me personally, the characters here almost constantly make me laugh. Rather it be Maeno in general, Takeda being the straight-man to the antics, Tanka being a sex craved lunatic, these cast of characters are eccentric & crazy but I love them.Art & Sound: 4/10The artwork on display is pretty vbad. Character designs are lazy, backgrounds are a blurry mess, the animation is lazy & stilted, It\'s not an overall good looking show. However I think this adds to my enjoyment of the show. It\'s kind of like Mad Bull 34 in that way. The art in that series is pretty bad, but that only makes me enjoy Mad Bull even more than I would.The voice acting is awful. But it\'s the right kind of awful to where it\'s entertaining to listen to. Characters scream at each other a lot, but I don\'t mind it here. Probably because PPC is self-aware of how idiotic & absurd it is, so it doesn\'t take itself seriously at all & is much more enjoyable because of it.Overall:9/10Part of me feels bad for giving this series such a high score. But I don\'t care, I fucking love this series. It\'s paced reasonably well, the characters make me laugh, the voice acting is the perfect kind of bad, it\'s overall just a series that\'s fun for me to sit back to & not take it remotely seriously. Ping Pong Club is simply FUN. For a comedy series like this, that\'s all I want. a bad thing, I honestly don\'t mind it here. I like that the story doesn\'t get in the way of the shenanigans, so I at least appreciate that we jump straight into the entertainment of this series. Still though, I\'m not going to call a ""story"" that only exists purely for the shenanigans to ensure & nothing else good.Characters: 9/10The characters in Ping Pong aren\'t deep at all & really only have 1 character trait. But in the case of this series, that\'s fine. This is a comedy after all, you don\'t need the character depth of something like Cowboy Bebop for a comedy series. So long as you can provide good comedic dynamics & genuine laughs. Me personally, the characters here almost constantly make me laugh. Rather it be Maeno in general, Takeda being the straight-man to the antics, Tanka being a sex craved lunatic, these cast of characters are eccentric & crazy but I love them.Art & Sound: 4/10The artwork on display is pretty vbad. Character designs are lazy, backgrounds are a blurry mess, the animation is lazy & stilted, It\'s not an overall good looking show. However I think this adds to my enjoyment of the show. It\'s kind of like Mad Bull 34 in that way. The art in that series is pretty bad, but that only makes me enjoy Mad Bull even more than I would.The voice acting is awful. But it\'s the right kind of awful to where it\'s entertaining to listen to. Characters scream at each other a lot, but I don\'t mind it here. Probably because PPC is self-aware of how idiotic & absurd it is, so it doesn\'t take itself seriously at all & is much more enjoyable because of it.Overall:9/10Part of me feels bad for giving this series such a high score. But I don\'t care, I fucking love this series. It\'s paced reasonably well, the characters make me laugh, the voice acting is the perfect kind of bad, it\'s overall just a series that\'s fun for me to sit back to & not take it remotely seriously. Ping Pong Club is simply FUN. For a comedy series like this, that\'s all I want.', ""I watch the first 4 episodes and thought it was pretty funny. The characters are completely over the top, but I usually don't have any issues with that. The following 5 episodes though were a total chore. The jokes are always the same. Every episodes are build on the same model.The anime might have been quite a novelty back then, but in 2011 I think you should spare yourself the pain to watch it. There are better things to do with your time.Sorry for the fans.

Series like High school DxD and etc. force Fanservice scenes & categorise them as Ecchi.

Aa! Megami-sama! (TV) Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1003/Aa_Megami-sama_TV_Specials,"['The three episode special of Ah! My Goddess should be looked at in two parts, Episode one and then Episode Two and Three.StoryThe first episode is a recap of the first twelve episodes of the TV Series with commentary from Keiichi and Belldandy.  The recap episode reuses previous animations and sounds and provides little new material for the show and involves no advancement in story.  The last two episodes take place immediately after the events in the TV Series.  The story progresses based on different side-effects the Goddess&rsquo;s exhibit after the series finale.  The second episode focuses mostly on Urd while...the third episode focuses on Skuld.  The stories of each are cute and silly, similar to many episodes from the TV series.  It will feel as if the TV Series hadn&rsquo;t actually ended.ArtThe art in these episodes are nearly identical to those of the series.  All of the scenes and characters are drawn brightly and are colorful.  The backgrounds are all drawn well, with just enough detail to feel natural within the show.  All three Goddess look beautiful and cute throughout the show.  Visually, Keiichi is one of the only characters I can&rsquo;t stand.  His character design at times just looks awkward and out of place in the show especially when surrounded by the Goddesses.  The animation is smooth, the lighting is well done, and unique/interesting camera angles help bring the stories to life.  By no means will the animation blow you away with stunning graphics, but it does more than what is necessary to get the job done.SoundThe openings for all three episodes remain the same as all the other episodes in the series, &ldquo;Open Your Mind ~ Spread Your Small Wings&quot; by Yoko Ishida.  While the ending of episode one is the same as the first 12 episodes &quot;願い (Negai)&quot; by Yoko Ishida while the other two episodes have the second ending &quot;Wing&quot; by Yoko Takahashi.  The sound effects are well done and accurate for what you&rsquo;d expect certain actions to sound like.  The Japanese voices match the characters very well and they do a great job matching the characters expressions or emotions.  The background music is fitting for the scenes and really blends in well with the show.  All in all it is an enjoyable listening experience.CharactersThis is one of my favorite parts of the show, I adore all the characters.  Belldandy fits in a motherly role quite well while Skuld and Urd have a fairly accurate sisterly relationship.  Keiichi on the other hand is caring yet a bit weak especially for a main male lead.  It all balances out well between the characters creating a lot of comedic moments as well as cute moments.  Although for episode two and episode three, the majority of the emphasis is put on Skuld and Urd instead of Belldandy and Keiichi and it is very interesting to see a different side of these two characters.  Since Skuld is one of my favorite characters, I adored these two episodes a lot.EnjoymentEpisode one is simply just a recap so there really isn&rsquo;t much enjoyment there.  The commentary between Belldandy and Keiichi is mediocre as well.  Rating solely on this episode, I&rsquo;d give it a 6.  Episode two and three though are much more fun simply because they are unique in comparison to episodes from the series.  They are each very light hearted which explore vastly different situations and scenarios than the series.  Both were very cute maybe even a little sad but nevertheless quite enjoyable.  If I were to rate solely on these two episodes I&rsquo;d probably give it a 9.  All in all the enjoy-ability of these two episodes should be equivalent to the enjoy-ability from the entire series.ConclusionThe first episode can pretty much be skipped, it doesn&rsquo;t do anything constructive with the story or even the characters.  It&rsquo;s only purpose would be if you had forgotten what had happened in the first twelve episodes.  If you enjoyed the series, the other two episodes should definitely be watched.  You can expect a very similar experience with these two episodes as you did with the majority of the Ah! My Goddess TV Series.  If you like Skuld and or Urd then this is a must see!  If you simply enjoyed the TV Series I would highly recommend this.  Similarly if you disliked the TV Series then you might as well not waste your time because these two episodes fit in perfectly as episode 25 and episode 26. the third episode focuses on Skuld.

I didn\'t see ep 1.Writing this, I assume the reader is familiar with Urd and Skuld.Art was good, like in the TV series. I didn\'t feel annoyed by the sound, so it was also OK I guess (but I didn\'t pay special attention).I think I can\'t treat ""Story"" and ""Characters"" as separete topics here, because they are so closely connected to each other, and they are what makes the OVAs so enjoyable.These are sweet little stories of friendship and love about my preferred series characters Urd and Skuld. I especially enjoyed watching...the suddenly changed persons and how they and their social enviroment responded to the changes of their physical appearances (Urd changed to kid, Skuld changed to adult). This also brought aspects of the unequal sisters to shine which were not seen in the series before.I liked these OVAs more than the TV series. For me, ep 2 is the best ""Goddess"" episode so far, and also ep 3 is well above series standard in my eyes.For appreciation of the characters, it probably helps if you have watched the TV series. Even if you don\'t consider it that great, I think you can still enjoy the OVAs. the suddenly changed persons and how they and their social enviroment responded to the changes of their physical appearances (Urd changed to kid, Skuld changed to adult).

In the final story, it becomes more of the bond between two human men, one of whom is the creator of the hybrid child. We get a sense of...how his project really grew to be his life, and how it changed the lives of the two men in the previous episodes.The characters are all different from each other, as is the relationships between human and hybrid child.Kotarou and Hazuki in the first episode bicker and banter, but when Hazuki's life is at stake, you see how strong their bond is and how far Kotarou is willing to go for him.

I went in completely blind, not knowing what the anime was and it pleasantly surprised me. I would suggest you to go in blind as well; that's the best way to enjoy it.But if you're still interested in knowing what it's about, here it is (without spoilers):Set in late...19th C Japan, the stories revolve around Hybrid Children (neither human nor machine) who look, walk, talk, grow and feel exactly like humans, except for the fact that they aren't really human. They're owned by their respective masters, who inevitably forge strong bonds with them. The first 2 stories focus on two different masters, their bonds with their Hybrid Children, their circumstances etc. The third story focuses on the creator of these Hybrids, his background and the reason he chose to create these dolls.Much like most of these reviews mentioned, I didn't expect the stories to be so, well, dark. Yaoi is not something you associate with death and destruction, you know. So that was something that made me appreciate the anime a little. Some of the scenes were beautifully done, esp in ep 4; they conveyed the mood of the protagonist's mind beautifully without putting it into words. The dialogues, even though fanmade subs, were pretty moving and I imagine they sounded even more beautiful in Japanese. The music too added beautifully to the entire atmosphere of the anime.The biggest gripe with this anime was its art form. First off, not a fan of the Junjou Romantic style of art. Second, pretty much every face in this anime was the same. Sometimes the hair and eye colours of different characters were the same, which ended up making me wonder if I was watching a continuation of the previous eps, or if this really was a new character. Poor animation on part of the animators. Apart from that, I found that story of ep 2 lacking a little. It focused more on emotions, while the plot moved very, very slowly. Another issue with the anime was how the jokes or funny moments were incorporated with chibi art forms. Really? When you're making an anime with such serious topics (or at least, non-frivolous topics) this chibi style of art form only takes *away* from the seriousness of the entire setting you've painstakingly built. They were jarring and completely unnecessary.Even so, at the end of the day, if you're a casual yaoi fan like me or a hardcore fujoshi - you'll like this anime because it really is something different that you seldom get to see in the yaoi genre!PS. Eps 1, 2 and 4 have after credit scenes.

I just couldn't  leave this anime without proper attention as I really want other to enjoy it. i fully recommend it for all anime lovers even if you don't like shounen-ai genre, as the story doesn't necessarily point at romantic relationships but other kind of interactions between people and hybrids.Story: first of all each episode concerns one story only so when u finish one it don't expect for continuation. first episode centers around first model of hybrid child and one hell of a handful  noble. it is cute, funny and very dramatic (almost...cried there). Second one wasn't as good as first (it's strictly my own opinion), but it shows how essential hybrid become for it's master and how he saved him. well as for third it was my favorite. There isn't any active hybrid however it tells the story of their creator, his feelings, friendship and rather dark past :)art: It is really well contrasted with each story. amazing colors and art overall. if u watched junjou romantica and hatsukoi you know how characters will be shaped. It really is good work.characters: all of them individuals no resemblance whatsoever.I loved all of them especially   Kuroda hybrid maker with foul character and bully (tsundere hunk :DDD) also izumi and hazuki were good too (lovely couple), ichi is more refined character. let's wait for another episode for others :))Sound: exactly how it should be!_is only words I can  say.overall it was great i reeeealy enjoyed each story. It is rather moody to watch so make up your mind to get a little teary. :)watch it (thumbs up) cried there).

Absolutely yes!In my opinion it is considered a masterpiece, I could not even wait for sub that I already have finished seeing in raw version. I read the manga in the past, but then upon hearing the news that it would become an anime I immediately had doubts, which instead have turned into satisfaction. It has really exceeded my expectations, despite already the manga was wonderful.Start by saying that I absolutely prefer it to the other of Shungiku Nakamura (""Junjou Romantica"" and ""Sekai-Ichi Hatsukoi""), perhaps because it is presented in a different tone. While the first two are romantic-comedy, Hybrid...Child is dramatic themes and gloomy.Essentially, it speaks of these dolls that with love and affection (but also negative feelings) grow to physical and mood.There are three different stories in this anime which correspond to episodes 1, 2 and 3-4.The first story revolves around Kotaro Izumi, a boy from a rich family, who finds a boy-doll (Hazuki) in the trash; despite his parents are against it, he does not give up and continues to care for him.The second story talk about Yuzu, another boy-doll, which is adopted by Ichi Seya. This story has an important meaning, especially because it tells us that in life things that happen isn\'t always happy, but also sad.The third story, my favorite and the most dramatic, portraies of friendship between Tsukishima and Kuroda (or maybe love?), they are two sons of chieftains important. Unfortunately the unexpected happen and Tsukishima must take responsibility for everything, but with disapproval of his friend.Then we can deduce that the protagonist of Hybrid Child is Kuroda, also because it appears in all three stories.Take me to the point of being moved is a difficult feat, but ""Hybrid Child"" has done it.The designs are very well made and the animations are quite fluid.Another thing that surprised me a lot, is the soundtrack: it\'s beautiful and it\'s put in the right place.Hybrid Child is really amazing although it only has 4 OVA.P.S: Sorry for my English >.> Child is dramatic themes and gloomy.Essentially, it speaks of these dolls that with love and affection (but also negative feelings) grow to physical and mood.There are three different stories in this anime which correspond to episodes 1, 2 and 3-4.The first story revolves around Kotaro Izumi, a boy from a rich family, who finds a boy-doll (Hazuki) in the trash; despite his parents are against it, he does not give up and continues to care for him.The second story talk about Yuzu, another boy-doll, which is adopted by Ichi Seya.

Okay. Be warned.This is actually my first review, but I thought this warranted it. It was an okay watch for the first episode. It isnt great, but it's not horrible. Overall just kind of a mediocre and shallow depiction of a romance between two teens/young adults. That is- until halfway through episode 2. I entered this expecting a parent-child relationship.  I mean, that is a type of love. But no. Adult initiates sexual contact with a child. Yes, I realize that the hybrid children or whatever are supposed to be objects and aren't human or whatever, but no plot conceits make this excusable. "", ""This anime is a masterpiece. It's original, beautiful, honest, and gut-wrenching. Please watch it. If you're into yaoi, if you're not, it doesn't matter, it deals with love in its purest form and it's wroth watching.Anime don't usually make me emotional, and I certainly didn't expect this one to. But from the beautiful music to the moving dialogue, the story moves fluidly through the episodes, separate but they all come together in the end. You won't regret watching it, so just do it.Warning: Feels, feels everywhere. "", 'Hybrid Child was a one-shot romance manga from 2005. It was written by Nakamura Shungiku. That\'s right, the same writer as Junjou Romantica, the worst shounen ai romance I\'ve ever reviewed. About five years ago, Studio Deen released an OVA based off of it. You might wonder why I\'m even giving it a chance, given Nakamura\'s other work but let me remind you that even Ikuhara Kunihiko has written bad stories before. And it is Valentine\'s week, so let\'s keep an open mind and check out some romance. Maybe this one is not rubbish.Story:The basic premise behind Hybrid Child is that the world has sapient...android/ human hybrids that grow based on receiving love from their owners. There are three different stories about it within the four episodes of the OVA. The first deal with a young aristocratic boy who finds a discarded hybrid child, takes it home and then they grow up together and fall for one another. The second deals with a man with a difficult past who finds some comfort in the arms of a hybrid child who looks like an eight year old. Gross. The third explores why the hybrid children were created with the tragic tale of some childhood friends and what happened to them as young adults.My biggest issues with the series are all with the second story line. The idea of having a jaded, damaged person get revitalised by finding a connection with someone more innocent and naive isn\'t a ad one in theory. It\'s not particularly new, but it\'s not a bad basis for a romance plot. However, the execution comes across as downright paedophilic. It\'s not even just that Yuzu looks like a child but he acts like one as well. Which just makes the attraction really creepy. One general issue is that the world building isn\'t very good. We know why Kuroda created the hybrid children but we don\'t know anything about how they\'ve change society. They seem to be basically used as maids or butlers but no one really addresses anything about them. At least it\'s better than addressing the questions in an egregiously stupid way, like Detroit: Become Human did but it\'s still just nothing.To its credit, the first romance is pretty decent. It\'s not anything special but it\'s passable for a short story. The third is a bit meh. It\'s one of those ""these people are combative because they love each other"" romances with a tragic twist. And you pretty much know where it\'s going after five minutes, but it\'s the only one that gets multiple episodes. Like Studio Deen & Nakamura just thought it needed so much effort for the very predictable plot line.Characters:Again, my big issue is with the characters in the second story and the way one looks and acts like a child while the other looks at him and thinks ""yeah, that\'s fuckable."" The first story has the strongest characters and dynamic, which isn\'t saying much considering the last is mediocre in those regards but is something. I actually kind of like the dynamic in the first one. Kotarou & Hazuki act more like old and dear friends than master and servant. They also show a willingness to sacrifice for one another, which is a nice touch.Art:The artwork is decent enough. A bit standard, but capably done. The thing that bothers me is still Yuzu being designed to look like a small child while having a romantic interest who looks very much like a grown man.Sound:They got some capable actors like Hirakawa Daisuke, Okamoto Nobuhiko, Ono Yuuki & others. The acting is perfectly solid. It may never be counted as among the best, but it certainly works well enough. Anze Hijiri\'s soundtrack is pretty good.Ho-yay:If you want to see some of that shounen ai action, there are some kissing scenes that are heavily implied to lead to sex and the whole thing is about that romance. So, lots of ho-yay to be had.Areas of Improvement:With four episodes to work with, just pick a story. While romance can work episodically, there\'s only one story line in this with good potential any way. So, I\'d just develop that more.Address the obvious questions. If you\'re going to have a romance bloom between a man and a man android he literally owns, you kind of need to address that ownership. Maybe have him struggle because he doesn\'t want to force anything and knows he\'s in a position of extreme power. There\'s also the question of just how sapient the androids are and how they\'ve impacted things.Better Build up. To use the good part of the OVA as an example, Hazuki kind of collapses out of nowhere and Kotarou takes him to a mechanic. A slower build where we as the audience see hints of trouble for a while before the collapse would strengthen the sense of investment quite a bit.Final Thoughts:Ultimately,\xa0Hybrid Child\xa0is, unlike Junjou Romantica, not garbage. The first story is pretty good. The second is just bad. The third is mundane. Combined, I\'d say that averages out to a mediocre experience. A mediocre experience that could have been something more if it had stuck to the one good story line. I\'ll give it a 5/10. android/ human hybrids that grow based on receiving love from their owners.

I've immediately watched it after learning the manga was written by the author of Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi and Junjou Romantica. After watching the first episode, I fell in love with the art and music. Every aspect of anime is gorgeous and touches your heart. However, I did not cry until I got to the last episode. I had prepared myself not to cry, but yet here I am bawling my eyes out. (my god. who and what hurt this woman so bad that made her write such a sad manga??) This anime is...definitely worth watching; don't let the boring, bland synopsis discourage you from watching.

It is one of the fews that have left a deep melancholy and impression, without mentioning that it is one of the few ones that made me really cry. The story focuses on the Hybrid Childs. They are androids (or humanoids) that react and develop to the love they are given from their owners. At a first instance, the topic of Artificial Intelligence and the esence of what makes or builds up human...beings rises into question, as these prototipes, who are neither machines nor humans, are able to interact and deal perfectly with human emotions. They also maintain a very strong bound with their ""owners"", who at the end they end up not performing these type of submission role, but rather a full equal one based on mutual understandment and affection.The anime itself is very short. It composes of four episodes and a limited number of 6 characters. Something I must really say about these characters is their wonderfull development. You can actually feel them, understand them, suffer with them. You are able to develop a mutual emphaty along the character, that for a very short anime this is something amazing. All characters deal up with topics such as mortality and the way in which death affects our relationship with themselves and with the other characters. Other one is the concept of identity. To what extent are these androids just a vague extrapolation of their owner\'s hearths? are their just the shadows of the feelings of these hearths? Therefore the question that if the owners are attracted to something that resemble their own feelings (their fall in love with theirselves??) rather than on an external individual also arises.This is a Boy\'s Love (Yaoi) anime, and I would like to precise that the argument itself is developed through this situation. I have always considered these types of anime as BL rather than ""gay"", because these characters do not follow the concept of homosexuality that we are used to. These characters do not pay attention to their sexual and gendre orientation, this is completely irrelevant. The reason why me, as a guy, like BL, is because characters just fall in love other characters at specific static situations, without any further specification. In respect to Hybrid Child, characters realize that they are in love when they have to face extreme situations such as Death or Ilness. This is is done in a marvellous ways, and in fact the anime is not very grafic, it is extremely emotional, to what I consider is a strength.In respect to music, I just can describe it with two words: emotional, sensational.To end this, I should definitely say Hybrid Child is one of the best animes I have ever seen. I can see it again and again, I will always end up with a strong feeling of nostalgia at the end of chapter 4.

Hybrid Child captivated me backwards, which honestly was a lot better than the other way around, like most anime does. (I\'m not the type of person to sit through a show once I start it just because I feel like I need to...if something really bores me, I drop it.) The first part was interesting, no doubt...it set the story up and introduced the main concept that would be fleshed out during the subsequent parts. However, it...wasn\'t what drew me in the continue watching. JUST the fact that there was plot was enough. I mean, that\'s literally the opposite of what the term ""yaoi"" stands for. The second part interested me twice as much as the first, despite the fact that I initally believed the two to be completely independent from each other. And, of course, parts 3 and 4 were the icing on the cake, and well awaited.That being said, the sort of disconnect between the four different parts is what threw me off. I watched them all consecutively, and the time periods/characters in each part, though all closely connected, could easily confuse a first time watcher, which normally would be okay but I have a feeling it wasn\'t intentional (especially for a yaoi, which is normally designed so that the audience doesn\'t have to concentrate too much on details). Additionally, the premise that the plot had could have been extrapolated further. I personally thought the central idea, hybrid doll children that is, was a fantastic one, and maybe a 12 episode series could have better cultivated its potential. But it\'s a yaoi, whatareyagonnado. Not much more I could ask for. The fact that the plot itself was so well executed for an anime of this genre and length struck me as pretty incredible.(Teetering between a rating of 7 and 8 due to the above stated reasons, I have decided on 7 because what does a number really mean, anyway?)I recommend for any yaoi fan or anime fan that doesn\'t mind a bit of guy-on-guy action.

Something that can make me laugh one second, then like the drop of the ball I\'ll be weeping like a baby. I don\'t know how they did it, as it\'s only 4 episodes and 3 separate storylines.As part of the SIHJR fanbase (Hybrid Child is from the same author,) I heard about this anime before watching it. I heard it was sad, that I was going to cry, so on, which I didn\'t necessarily believe. Last time I cried was watching Fullmetal Alchemist, and that took 60+ episodes...of build up! How would I cry over a course of 4 episodes?After watching the first episode, I\'ll admit I was pretty emotional. Not sobbing, but really emotional. The ending was pretty rushed, but I loved how Kotarou, the Hybrid Child, and Hazuki cared for one another. I also noticed a little resemblance between them and a certain couple from JR...Episode two came around, and I was like... ok, this is lighthearted. The ending to THIS episode was particularly heartbreaking though, without spoilers, it was a surprise. Nothing to really say here besides I liked Yuzu.Episode three... oh look! It\'s Seya from the second episode... and is that Kuroda? From the first episode? And who\'s this new guy, Tsukishima? They look like good friends! This episode took place before the Hybrid Children were developed, or more like when Kuroda was first creating them. This episode, man. It gives build-up, and then you watch the fourth episode in a blind rush, starting to panic.This show hurts, a lot. Episode four undoubtedly ruined me, I was a sobbing mess for probably a few hours. I don\'t want to spoil the magic but just know. I also want to mention how Tsukishima and Kuroda can resemble Ritsu and Takano from Sekaiichi Hatsukoi... and all of the reincarnation theories...One of the main reasons I was a crying mess was purely because of the OST. It\'s pure art. I often find myself going back to listen whenever I\'m writing or just bored in class, though I think I\'m numb from this show so I don\'t cry...The ending is great, it gives that right vibe about the show. There are additional scenes after the credits on episodes one, two and four so give those a look also for a bit of after story.The voice actors have done a particularly amazing job at this work. They all fitted their roles, despite being different from the Manga CD. Since I\'m not big into seiyuu, the only names I recognized were Hirakawa, Okamoto and Kimura but honestly, they\'ve all done amazing for fitting the anime.I really can\'t believe how they can make us attached to characters in less than 15 minutes by just giving us a bit of backstory and interactions, then drop a feels ball and ruin these characters in all the right ways. They did it though, they really fuckin did it.My only semi-gripe is the art of the show. It isn\'t amazing, though I admit I\'ve grown accustomed to the DEEN-Nakamura art style so I can tell the characters apart easily despite how they ""all look the same.""The animation can be lacking, but I still found myself looking in awe at the backgrounds and some frames of the characters. The backgrounds look amazing, but that\'s expected as so did the backgrounds from all of the other DEEN-Nakamura works. The chins are still square on certain characters as in typical fashion, which is the only thing I can possibly dislike about this work.Even if you don\'t like shounen-ai, give this special story a try. It\'s really just marvelous. of build up! How would I cry over a course of 4 episodes?After watching the first episode, I\'ll admit I was pretty emotional. Not sobbing, but really emotional.

Since I\'m not big into seiyuu, the only names I recognized were Hirakawa, Okamoto and Kimura but honestly, they\'ve all done amazing for fitting the anime.I really can\'t believe how they can make us attached to characters in less than 15 minutes by just giving us a bit of backstory and interactions, then drop a feels ball and ruin these characters in all the right ways. They did it though, they really fuckin did it.My only semi-gripe is the art of the show. It isn\'t amazing, though I admit I\'ve grown accustomed to the DEEN-Nakamura art style so I can tell the characters apart easily despite how they ""all look the same.""The animation can be lacking, but I still found myself looking in awe at the backgrounds and some frames of the characters. The backgrounds look amazing, but that\'s expected as so did the backgrounds from all of the other DEEN-Nakamura works. The chins are still square on certain characters as in typical fashion, which is the only thing I can possibly dislike about this work.Even if you don\'t like shounen-ai, give this special story a try. It\'s really just marvelous.', 'i have not gotten past the first ep yet but the first one if like really sad and if you have an eye infection that is already making you cry, you might be balling your eyes out a little. i over all like it and from what i have seen there is no sex but it is also kinda funny. the art style is not sh*t. if you want something sweat and loving but also short, hc is probably good.so honistly after the crying part i was just trying to meet the standerds to poast a revuw and this is just to also make...it longer. so if you were wondering i have pink eye in both eyes and i have been wakeng up and not being able to open my eyes lattly but i do have eye drops it longer. so if you were wondering i have pink eye in both eyes and i have been wakeng up and not being able to open my eyes lattly but i do have eye drops', ""So yes I might be kind've biased giving it a complete 10/10 because it really got to me but it was very very good. I loved how it wasn't gross, had a touch of humor, and it had overall very cute but sad relationships. I wish they made the series longer (that's always my complaint with every series haha) because I would love to see more sides of the characters, but it was great and touching. If you love a warm-hearted light romance story, I highly recommend this one. I even cried from the last episode but I really don't know why i cried over...it. I personally think I was over emotional haha but yah, good series! :) it. I personally think I was over emotional haha but yah, good series! :)"", 'Most know Shungiku Nakamura as the mangaka of Junjou Romantica, which in my opinion is her weakest work. Her Sekaiichi Hatsukoi was head and shoulders above JR, and one of my favorites. I’m quite fond of lost lovers finding themselves again. But the one story that grabbed me by the throat and made me cry rivers, was Hybrid Child.I first read this manga back when it came out fan-subbed, and it hurt a lot. I was expecting another rape/coercion story like her JR, but it was not. It was magical, fantastic and depressive. It made me putty and made me cry. I was devastated. So...being the emotional masochist I am, when I discovered it got adapted? I was on it like bees to flowers!First is that this story gained a lot by being animated. The colors, the camera pans, the OST, really enhanced these amazing short stories. It also helped me keep track of who is who, because this mangaka tends to make really similar dudes and I lose who is who. But it’s not just this one, I suffer of that a lot. I need color to help me, and voice is a nice bonus to complement it.Either way, the animators were true to the source and didn’t deviate from the plot of the manga, and like I said: I honestly believe it enhanced the original. This adaptation has gorgeous transitions, I’m a sucker for really good transitions. Heck, one of the reasons I was so enchanted with Haikyuu! besides the cute boys, was the way it was directed.This isn’t as known as her other work, probably because it’s short and short stories. But it is so worth it, if you haven’t read or seen this yet, I advise you to get on it!

I have never written any reviews but let me try this out with this BL anime.I\'ve seen plenty of BL animes so far, and this one honestly did have quite a different storyline than most of the ones I\'ve seen. The plot was actually quite interesting. I am giving this anime a 5 only because the plot jumped around a lot and it was pretty difficult to understand. I thought the deep and emotional nature of some of the relationships was cute and quite the tear-jerker, but again, I could barely understand what was happening.Not to mention the graphics were a bit awkward, and...there wasn\'t really enough ""boys love"" in the anime, for my liking anyway. I\'ve seen a lot better BLs. But, if you\'re running out of BLs to watch (like me), I wouldn\'t say it\'s the worst option, especially if you enjoy things like Junjou romantic or things like that. All in all, the plot was good and it jumped around a lot in the story, the relationships were emotional but didn\'t really have enough screen time, decent Bl, just not the best IMO. there wasn\'t really enough ""boys love"" in the anime, for my liking anyway.

I think the only reason I didn't is because the first two episodes, while related to the last two, weren't quite as cohesive as they could've been. That, and this art style is somewhere between art that I love and art that I think is okay.That's the last bad thing you'll hear about this anime. Oh my goodness, was it beautiful. A Hybrid Child is a doll that grows up as human when people love it. It's a very simple concept, but it really paved the way for some tremendous heartbreak and storytelling.The first and...second episodes, as I said were sort of disjunct with the (I think) main storyline of the anime. That being said, as individual stories, they were lovely. Each one had a very powerful message in it of unconditional love and forgiveness, respectively.The final two episodes, though, that's where the real stuff lies. I want an entire anime on the events of those last two episodes. The characters' relationships to one another were portrayed so beautifully, and the amazing voice actors in this anime really drove home the emotional aspects that come from the story.Overall, this anime is something beautiful. Whether you're a Shounen Ai fan or simply a fan of romance, I think this anime knocks it out of the park. It feels authentic, it's painful, it's funny at times, and most importantly, it'll make you tear up. If you're even a little bit interested, please try this anime out.

Indeed, underrated.I do not, somehow, understand why the BL fans do not talk about this summit of all the creation of BL animes that I have watched.

Sure, the OVAs are episodical, but each stories, encapsulated within 4 episodes, it smoothly injected the emotional gravity that scars the watchers from each narratives.It gets heavier.

At first I watch ova 1 and didn\'t get interested to continue on that day, bcs I think the story is so cliche, i mean the happy ending part. Then the next day I watch ova 2, and it decrease my excitement, I mean Ova 1 is more interesting than Ova 2 imo. The next...day when I have spare time I continued watching ova 3...and I have feeling like it has different ""aura"" (lol idk how am i supposed to say)..it is like it\'s different from ova 1 and 2..then I continue at the last ova which is ova 4.Then.....

In fact, I never originally planned on watching this - nonetheless actually liking it. I was pleasantly proven wrong. Since this was only four episodes, my friend who had previously seen the series recommended it. We ended up binge watching the four episodes together. To be honest, I didn’t know what to expect. What I got though, was something better than I expected. The story comes to life with an interesting plot. We’re introduced to the idea of a personified doll that withholds the ability to grow if love is received...from their masters. It’s referred to as a, “Hybrid Child” (hence the name of the anime). However, in this short lapse of time we’re also soon brought into the backstory of the creator of these doll-like-humans. It’s a ride, and I definitely enjoyed the ups and downs of this creation.There is one thing to be noted, though. I had previously assumed this would have a lighter note to it. Yet, I was quickly shown otherwise. This shounen ai has a darker and more depressing vibe to it. I found myself letting out ugly sobs by the end of the series. Don’t think that the sadness takes away from the anime, though. It instead brings more depth the plot and introduces another complex yaoi to the genre. After all, I found myself enjoying this thoroughly even though I usually tend to avoid sad anime.Let’s jump to the characters. Boy, this is a fun one. If you don’t want to learn about the relationships, then feel free to jump past this little paragraph. If you’re ready to learn a bit about the characters prior to watching (or after watching, I don’t know when you scan reviews (: ), then let’s go further. We are first introduced to the beginning characters, Hazuki and Kotarou. To be honest, I don’t have much to say on them, so let’s just jump to the next. We have our age-gap pairing. Usually, I avoid the idea of an age-gap pairing because it lacks morals. Yet, this pairing is cute and it focuses on the power of true love (not pure sex, mind you.) Here, we’re introduced to a character we’ll see until the end of the anime - Ichi. This brings us to the depth of the plot, and we’re brought into the better understanding of the creator of these hybrid children. It’s a sad ride, but we’re able to understand why he puts so much passion into the dolls. I love the characters here, and I have no complaints.Okay, surprisingly, I actually have a legitimate point to make about the animation. All of the characters have either two different head shapes that help you identify the ‘uke’ and the ‘seme’. With information provided to me by my friend, I’ve came to the realization that the animator is known for this style. It’s definitely something, but I guess that it isn’t really shocking considering that this is the normal for this animator. Just it’s something to note.Frankly, let’s jump to sound. The music usually goes over my head, and this is no exception. My friend who focuses primarily on the soundtrack is pleased by it, so that’s something. Usually I don’t really have anything to discuss here. I focus on the enjoyment it gives me, and since the music didn’t take away from the positivity, I thought the sound was perfectly fine.To conclude, I think this anime was good. I enjoyed it a lot, and I think yaoi fans will really love this one. Even though I hadn’t shown and prior interest in shounen ai, this made me love it. Definitely passion and love is poured into this ova series, and you’ll be able to spot it out. I recommend this - not only to yaoi fans, but also to people who are wanting to test the waters in this genre. I jumped in and I don’t regret anything. from their masters.

Arslan Senki (TV): Fuujin Ranbu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31821/Arslan_Senki_TV__Fuujin_Ranbu,"['The boy king’s journey continues. The sequel of Arslan Senki (otherwise known as Arslan Senki: Dust Storm Dance) is a show that fans will easily get attached to. It’s not just because Arslan Senki takes place in a diverse cultural world but also with exploring the journey of the titular character Arslan, one could not help but have high expectations from the boy.To be precise, the second season is noticeable for being only 8 episodes in length. Compared to the first season, that’s about 1/3 the run-time. Yes, you’re probably asking yourself something along the line of “then how will the story conclude?” The...answer is pretty simple: it won’t. The series is more about the journey rather than the destination. As such, treat the storytelling more as a way to showcase Arslan and his co. as they take on new adventures.That adventure begins with the war drama. Remember, Arslan Senki is more of a war story than a fantasy adventure despite having supernatural content. Arslan’s forces has their hands full in the beginning to deal with an invasion from Turan. While all this is happening, we are also introduced to a mysterious relic that Hilmes (Silver Mask) has his eyes on. A good deal of the first few episodes establishes the ruthlessness of the antagonists. In particular, Tokhtomysh (King of Turan) even delivers execution in order to draw Parsians into a trap. Anyway, I think the main point of the series is to establish the challenges Parsians must deal with to declare their independence. Arslan has also grown to become a well-respected leader known to even other countries. His maturity is shown with leadership, cleverness, and loyalty with his comrades. So much so, Gieve even returns with his services after going off on his own.One of the more dynamic elements of Arslan Senki are the characters. Even though the main characters are well-established at this point, we still have characterization and subplot focused on them such as Narsus, HIlmes, Etoile, etc. Sometimes, I find the subplots about these characters to be even better than the main story because it makes us understand them more. Furthermore, their role in the series has influence on the overall story. For instance, Narsus’ reunion with his old friend Shagad shows his cleverness. They have a relationship that I’d describe more as acquaintances rather than best friends. Furthermore, we can easily see Narsus’ own ideologies about certain sensitive issues such as slavery. On the other hand, characters such as Hilmes gives us a decent insight about his past in this sequel. It shows a more gentle side of his character rather than the one we came to see on paper as a ruthless warrior. Even Etoile gets a major role in one of the episodes to showcase her importance. On the downside, new characters such as Grahze can only be remembered for their action and hardly anything else. Other previously introduced characters such as Elam and Falangies gets less focus compared to the previous season.To say the least, the overall storytelling of Arslan Senki: Dust Storm Dance can feel a bit predictable. Now this might not be true for all fans but should be easily recognized for the plot about the pirates and merchant ship conflict. On the other hand, there are also episodes that are really important. As I mentioned before, the subplot context feels as though they have better storytelling than the main plot; Hilmes and Etoile being prime examples. Thus, it’s disappointing that the show itself is shrinked to 8 episodes to focus on the main story with what it already has to work with.On the technical front, the art style of the sequel has more or less downgraded. This includes some of the more complex battle scenes involving characters with jerky movements. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still ‘wow factor’ when it comes to fighting in the show. Daryun and merchant captain Grahze proves that quite well. However, it’s more about the character expressions that feels underwhelming. On the plus side, the background settings improved with a more adventurous feel. The introduction of sea and merchant ships also offers some neat naval battle that is refreshing.The soundtrack is still pretty similar compared the first season. It uses harmonic music to keep in pace with different scenarios ranging from simple conversations to intense battle scenes. Character voice mannerism is delivered well on most parts with Arslan being more noticeable for his maturity. One praise I would like to throw in would be Hilmes for his ability to portray personalities ranging from ruthlessness to sympathetic.So what should you expect from the sequel of Arslan Senki? If you’re looking for a masterpiece, then it’s clearly the wrong place to look. Even on paper, the pacing of just 8 episodes should trigger a red alert. Less characterization on certain other main characters should also be expected as well. However, the sequel still offers a good amount of storytelling with its existing characters. Remember, the show isn’t just about getting to the end goal for Arslan but rather his journey to reach it. And for that, I think it’s worth to take that journey with them. answer is pretty simple: it won’t. The series is more about the journey rather than the destination.

Arslan has also grown to become a well-respected leader known to even other countries. His maturity is shown with leadership, cleverness, and loyalty with his comrades. So much so, Gieve even returns with his services after going off on his own.One of the more dynamic elements of Arslan Senki are the characters. Even though the main characters are well-established at this point, we still have characterization and subplot focused on them such as Narsus, HIlmes, Etoile, etc. Sometimes, I find the subplots about these characters to be even better than the main story because it makes us understand them more. Furthermore, their role in the series has influence on the overall story. For instance, Narsus’ reunion with his old friend Shagad shows his cleverness. They have a relationship that I’d describe more as acquaintances rather than best friends. Furthermore, we can easily see Narsus’ own ideologies about certain sensitive issues such as slavery. On the other hand, characters such as Hilmes gives us a decent insight about his past in this sequel. It shows a more gentle side of his character rather than the one we came to see on paper as a ruthless warrior. Even Etoile gets a major role in one of the episodes to showcase her importance. On the downside, new characters such as Grahze can only be remembered for their action and hardly anything else. Other previously introduced characters such as Elam and Falangies gets less focus compared to the previous season.To say the least, the overall storytelling of Arslan Senki: Dust Storm Dance can feel a bit predictable. Now this might not be true for all fans but should be easily recognized for the plot about the pirates and merchant ship conflict. On the other hand, there are also episodes that are really important. As I mentioned before, the subplot context feels as though they have better storytelling than the main plot; Hilmes and Etoile being prime examples. Thus, it’s disappointing that the show itself is shrinked to 8 episodes to focus on the main story with what it already has to work with.On the technical front, the art style of the sequel has more or less downgraded. This includes some of the more complex battle scenes involving characters with jerky movements. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still ‘wow factor’ when it comes to fighting in the show. Daryun and merchant captain Grahze proves that quite well. However, it’s more about the character expressions that feels underwhelming. On the plus side, the background settings improved with a more adventurous feel. The introduction of sea and merchant ships also offers some neat naval battle that is refreshing.The soundtrack is still pretty similar compared the first season. It uses harmonic music to keep in pace with different scenarios ranging from simple conversations to intense battle scenes. Character voice mannerism is delivered well on most parts with Arslan being more noticeable for his maturity. One praise I would like to throw in would be Hilmes for his ability to portray personalities ranging from ruthlessness to sympathetic.So what should you expect from the sequel of Arslan Senki? If you’re looking for a masterpiece, then it’s clearly the wrong place to look. Even on paper, the pacing of just 8 episodes should trigger a red alert. Less characterization on certain other main characters should also be expected as well. However, the sequel still offers a good amount of storytelling with its existing characters. Remember, the show isn’t just about getting to the end goal for Arslan but rather his journey to reach it. And for that, I think it’s worth to take that journey with them.', 'I wonder what I expected out of this season. When I read that there were only going to be 8 episodes of content they originally planned on skipping, I didn\'t have much hope left for the anime. And somehow, it still managed to disappoint me.Arslan Senki introduced an interesting, while not all too new, story. It\'s a low-fantasy, presented somewhat cartoonish - the story was kept interesting with exagerations and unexplained magic and a mysterious antagonist, Zuk- I mean, Hilmes.In this second season, they decide to delve a little into Hilmes\' past - we get some character development, and given incentive to care about him....And that\'s really nice... if it weren\'t the ONLY character development throughout this season.The other characters from last season fall - no pun intended - completely flat. They are reduced to a mere herd of animals following and obeying their leader, Arslan and are pushed completely to the background. Arslan himself seems to be stuck at the character he obtained throughout last season, as well.There are some new characters, but besides those that are part of Hilmes\' backstory, there isn\'t much development either.The characters are the only thing that could have carried the story. So that falls flat as well. A lame, minor antagonists and an overall uneventful plot are the main focus this season, while all the interesting stuff is happening in the background - which is mainly the only reason I kept watching. But for the most part, all I heard and saw was a run-off-the-mill story, with one-liners you could have probably found in a book called ""Clichéd Dialogue in Fantasy Animes"".Narsus apparently knows all the enemy plans, as usual, but doesn\'t tell the viewer that he knows this, making all of his counter-plans seem like mere dei ex machina.If the art and animation had been good, I would have probably enjoyed this as an average anime, but the staff only seemed to have the budget for low quality shots and still images. The CGI was bad, but, with the exception for some fights and the finale, the best animation troughout the season.The voice acting decided to follow the this trend and all the characters spoke, beside for some returning characters, without emotion and only decent intonation - it was bland.The music, however, was good; it fit the atmoshpere and knew how to hype up scenes. The sound effects, as well, were on point.As we reach the end of the season, the story that had been unveiling on the background culminates, the animation gets back some of its life, and the characters some of their depth, giving me at least some hope for next season.

That\'s even longer than Claremont\'s amazing run writing the X-men. And it\'s not completely over. There\'s still a manga going. The novels were the brain child of Tanaka Yoshiki, which makes me somewhat wary since he also wrote the brain dead, rubbish series Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. In any case, the series had an OVA in the early to mid 90s and this two series anime from 2015-2016. It was...handled by Liden Films, the same studio that worked on Terra formars, which was also not good. Who knows, maybe this one will actually exceed my expectations and not be awful. In spite of having a name that sounds like the shit version of Narnia\'s protector.Story:The narrative is simple enough. The Kingdom of Pars is prosperous with a strong king to defend it. It also has a strong contingent of nearby nations that would love a piece of that prosperity. Including the borderline Theocracy of Lusitania. During his first foray into battle, Prince Arslan finds himself separated from his father while things around him quickly turn bad for the Parsian forces. He finds himself separated with only the loyal Daryun to rely on. And it seems like the only one who can unite what remains of Pars\' military and drive the Lusitanian forces from the royal capital is Arslan.The biggest problem with the narrative might just be that it drags a bit. There are a bunch of episodes where Arslan and his group sit back and do nothing while we witness the siege of the capital. And it really shouldn\'t take as long as it does since the way it\'ll end is obvious. Another prominent example is in the shift from the end of the first series to the beginning of the second. We see our heroes about to take a huge step only to rapidly back-pedal in what feels like a cheap ploy to get more content out of the concept.As much as it surprises me, I do have a lot of aspects of the series I\'m going to praise. In a far shot from that other Tanaka written anime, the strategy in this is actual well thought out strategy. It doesn\'t rely on one group being composed entirely of idiots. It relies on misdirection, terrain advantages, figuring out ways to rattle the opposing troops and other various things. I don\'t know if Ginga Eiyuu was just adapted badly or if Tanaka just doesn\'t know how to apply strategy to a sci-fi setting. In terms of political aspects, the primary issue is a lot more morally one-sided since it deals with slavery but Tanaka does a good job of writing it from the perspective of a culture where that\'s been their way of life and it\'s just starting to shift. Which is a big improvement over that other series that presented a more morally grey conundrum, but presented it very ineptly.The narrative actually somewhat reminds me of Nintendo\'s classic Fire Emblem series. With the way the prince has to flee while things go wrong in his nation and then has to find strong allies while dealing with intrigue from multiple angles. Except this started coming out before that franchise existed. I can\'t deny that the story unfolds in an intriguing way, even with the detours. And this is one of the few anime I\'ve seen that has a narrator and uses them effectively. A lot of the narrator\'s purpose is to show the passage of time between significant events while keeping the audience caught up on what the important characters have been doing. Thereby allowing the series to have greater scope without a huge amount of filler.Characters:One thing I really appreciate about the major characters is that they aren\'t just blind followers. Pretty much all of them start out with some kind of relatively weak reason to go to his side but then their dynamics start developing and they find stronger reasons to follow him. Which both shows a nice character progression and creates some powerful dynamics. The characters themselves are quite strongly written with enough background details to illustrate how they were shaped into who they are and complexity to them. That goes for the antagonistic characters as well. Especially Silver Mask & Guiscard. Which is another huge difference between this and that other Tanaka anime where the cast was massive but also very boring and one note. The only dude I remember vividly from that is toga guy and that\'s only cause he was so over the top.Art:The artwork looks fantastic. No awkward posing that no human would ever use. The character designs are well done. The armour and costuming looks good. Although Falangies\' might be overly fan-service oriented. The action sequences are phenomenal with amazing swordplay, quick arrow shots and just very dynamic movements. The backgrounds are strongly detailed, to top it off. Which is another huge difference from that other anime.Sound:The acting is really well done. Kobayashi Yuusuke, Hosoya Yoshimasa, Sakamoto Maaya, Namikawa Daisuke, Numakura Manami, Uchiyama Yumi, Koyasu Takehito, Kaji Yuki and pretty much everyone else does a great job. The only performance I can really single out as lacklustre comes from Sakurai Toshiharu who voices King Innocentis. His performance feels a bit out of place since he sounds a bit like the typical ""comedic fat man"" in a series where that doesn\'t really work. Iwashiro Taro\'s soundtrack is fantastic in both series.Ho-yay:There\'s a bit. Elam comes across as having a bit of a crush on Narsus at times, and vying for his affections against Alfreed. There are also moments where Daryun and Narsus come across as more than friends. It\'s not the case in the majority of their shared screen time, but it\'s certainly an ongoing thing.Areas of Improvement:A More Focused Narrative. While the diversions are entertaining, it would be nice to see the story get on with it a bit more quickly.Proper Clothes for Falangies. I get that she\'s supposed to come from a warmer climate, but it might help if she was properly dressed for combat and the weather.A less comedic performance for Innocentis. If this were a more comedic series, he would sound fine. But since it\'s not, a more nuanced performance would work wonders.Final Thoughts:I\'m actually flabbergasted. Given my previous experiences with both this writer and this studio, I expected to have a terrible time. I expected this to be a slog I had to force myself through to finish the review request. But I really enjoyed the series. It\'s the type of fantasy that reminds me of a Fire Emblem story in the best way. I would actually love to see it given a third series to finish things up and I\'m definitely going to chase down the manga to see the conclusion regardless. I\'ll give this one a solid 8/10.

Now that I'm looking at it scrupulously, it's more of a 4 or 3. Let me explain.My expectations are completely different than before. In Arslan Senki, I wanted to be introduced to the characters and their goals, to know more about the setting of the story and also the main conflict. Which was all done relatively well.Now for Arslan Senki: Fuujin Ranbu, I wanted to delve into the minds of these characters and see them evolve. Sadly, again,...they do not grow.Our main cast is still the same as before, they do not learn from their mistakes -- they don't make mistake to begin with. Arslan is still an innocent white snowflake without any awareness of the real-life dangers being overprotected by Daryun-oka-chan who's reduced to be the mindless brawl of his 'Highness'. I swear if I hear him yell 'denka' again I destroy the internet.But, pals, I had hope!When we've met Narsus' old friend, I thought I would finally get the development I've been longing for. Some backstory as to why Narsus is the way he is and how two friends parted on different journeys. Jokes on me, that conflict lasted two episodes with no explanation nor flashback about their relationship to show us how deep the betrayal was.And even when Alfreed's brother was introduced, I thought we could see some nice frictions between the siblings or even Alfreed revealing more about her past, anything that would have shown us her struggles or the reasons she ran. Something to make me care, ffs. They can all die, I would literally give no shit because they overlooked that emotional development. I cannot connect with this series because characters aren't real. They're funny and lovable and sure looks good but there is nothing more to them. I'm not as much engaged in the story as I was in Fullmetal Alchemist, for instance.Of course, the rest of the bunch is lessened to their previous role with no active participation in the advancement of the plot whatsoever.Everything in this series is freaking shallow. It's there for sparks and glitters, for cool moments that would make great AMVs. Nothing is deep, the characters are never challenged externally and internally. As a grand poet would say; they have the emotional range of a teaspoon.The only one that gets a little bit of backstory is our Zuko/Shouto boy. That makes me want to root for the villain, honestly.The animation found a way to become even worst. I didn't think it was possible but the overuse of dark contrast made it impossible for my screen to distinguish the dark tones from the light tones. The 3D still looks awful but now I'm used to it. Good news is: characters aren't legos anymore! They're freaking carton boxes. Fluidity was lost in favor of better background visuals. I don't know if it's a good thing though.I noticed nothing different in the OSTs and despite being sung by the same artists, the OP and ED have less impact than in the first season.If the eight-episode season didn't tip you off, you can still feel this season was rushed and is nowhere near the quality of the first season. It's not even a whole cour!There is little chance for a third season, at least not in the close future but I do hope we put all this overdramatic plot aside and focus on the characters. Because Arslan's epic journey is about him, not the super goody fights. I got to care if you want me to root for him or I'll go pray to that Yaldabotthing (bless you, dear) for all of them to die painfully.Yeah, I'm a resentful viewer. they do not grow.Our main cast is still the same as before, they do not learn from their mistakes -- they don't make mistake to begin with.

I’ll keep this review short and will include some minor spoilers.The second season of Arslan was a relief, mainly due to the fact that they shortened down the runtime of the show to a measly 8 episodes. The reason why I continued with Arslan Senki and decided to watch the second season was to get a sense of completion and a sense of fulfillment, knowing that this train wreck of a series has finally come to an end. I was wrong as Arslan...Senki: Fuujin Ranbu did not have any sort of resolution.The second season of Arslan Senki is below average as it has too many shifts in the narrative that make it hard to watch. In one episode we see the prince get exiled, and in the very next we see the prince being a human rights activist. Moreover, this season was so baffling, it had the audacity to manipulate its viewers into believing that anything interesting would happen in the 8 episodes. Nothing particularly interesting happened.The fundamental issue with Arslan Senki: Fuujin Ranbu lies within the structure of the show. Its runtime was reduced by 2/3rds and they tried to jump over their heads with the amount of content put into the show. Some parts that can be considered great setups are immediately ruined in the next episode, removing any sort of tension that this setup could have. For instance, at one point in the series, the king of Pars – tyrant Andragoras the third – returns to the remains of his kingdom, only to exile the prince. In of itself, this was a very interesting turning point as it could have explored themes such as banishment, starting everything from scratch and so forth. This great setup was almost immediately ruined in the next episode, where our demigod cast of superheroes can’t leave the prince behind and decide to escape the tyrant Andragoras the third’s regime – they’re loyal to the prince after all.The tonal shifts of this show are something out of this world and may lead someone to the brink of insanity. As mentioned before, these tonal shifts or shifts in the narrative completely direct the story in a different path which creates a feeling of inconsistency and a fragmented narrative. We have a subplot about some old artifact that can be used as a credential, we get to see the antagonist’s past and his love story, we can see the king returning from being imprisoned in Lusitania and we also see the prince being a human rights activist fighting against pirates; all of this somehow fit in 8 episodes. A better solution in my opinion would be to focus on one story and tell it from start to end. The first season wasn’t the best but season two could have concluded the story in better fashion.The characters are all the same, with the exception of some new and equally stupid characters being introduced. One such example is Narsus’ friend, Shagard – whom Narsus has been a friend with for a long time. Shagard is said to be a clever character and someone who has the same intellectual capacity as Narsus but unfortunately we never get to witness any of that. Shogard is just a greedy person who has made a business on slavery – which our protagonists do not agree with – because all people are equal and slaves are bad! Horrendous writing, that’s all I can say.As for the other characters, they’re the same. Arslan is still the same lenient and naïve child but they’ve decided to give him some philosophical inner monologues at times which honestly come off as pretentious. The other characters are exactly the same, and no one has changed in the slightest manner.Hilmes is an interesting character but he barely gets any screen time.The technical aspects of the show haven’t changed much, the animation is slightly worse except for the fights. The fights are honestly what give this show any merit of being watchable. They keep replaying the same medieval.mp3 soundtrack every time a fight happens, very lackluster and uncreative in my opinion. Some characters are off-model but who cares at this point?In general, it was good that Arslan Senki: Fuujin Ranbu was only 8 episodes. It was at least more entertaining than the first season despite being 2/3rds shorter. I hope they don’t continue with this train wreck of a series. It could have been good but was ultimately ruined by poor direction and plot armor among other things.

They keep replaying the same medieval.mp3 soundtrack every time a fight happens, very lackluster and uncreative in my opinion. Some characters are off-model but who cares at this point?In general, it was good that Arslan Senki: Fuujin Ranbu was only 8 episodes. It was at least more entertaining than the first season despite being 2/3rds shorter. I hope they don’t continue with this train wreck of a series. It could have been good but was ultimately ruined by poor direction and plot armor among other things.', ""This review is also addressed to the first season of Arslan Senki.Arslan Senki is a really interesting anime because it has something I really like. That is the similarity to some of the games I have played. The games that I mean are Suikoden, Dynasty Warrior, and Samurai Warrior. These games have different styles of play but have some similarities, that is they are strategy games.I really like how strategy games come about. Strategy games usually produce the unexpected. And it is really interesting because the usual anime can easily predicted (by me). And they apply this strategy game to this anime that makes this...anime so interesting.One more game I've played that has similarities with this anime is Mount & Blade. The game has similarities in terms of how war is carried out and the division of the kingdom. I remember how I used to wander around the world and take enemy forts and castles and make them mine. Also how I recruit friends and always bring them into war.This anime is really interesting to watch. Arslan, a fragile prince, initially became a great person. He along with his comrades that made him a great and wise person. This anime story is also well organized and makes me satisfied. One thing that makes me satisfied is that this anime hasn't ended yet. I thought they made eight episodes in the second season meaning it would be over very soon. Apparently not.Well that's my review. Hopefully they will make the season finale of this anime soon so I don't forget it and don't have to rewatch it again. anime so interesting.One more game I've played that has similarities with this anime is Mount & Blade.

It does manage to keep the exciting action and strategies from the first season, but beyond that it felt like it was going in a completely different direction. Firstly, while the first season was the story of Arslan’s growth in finding his convictions, that isn’t even a theme in this season. Rather, this season things get a lot more complicated and it feels like...the focus has shifted to being about more than just Arslan to being about the entire conflict and everyone involved in it. It’s clear that the protagonist is still Arslan, but this is no longer the story about his growth, or rather anyone’s growth, but rather just the tale of a large conflict and Arslan’s place in it. At the end of the first season, it looked like there were two factions in play essentially, with some infighting. This season, there are at least four distinct factions all vying for power, with various other players possibly having an effect as well. Things get much more complicated really quickly. Still, I would say this is a very welcome change. The core of Arslan’s growth felt like it was over so putting less of a focus on it and more so on other players definitely keeps things interesting. I especially appreciated the larger focus on Hilmes, on whom we get a lot more background and who performs actions beyond him simply being vengeance obsessed.The first big issue with that though is that all of this is tremendously rushed. The first season was 25 episodes. This season is 8 episodes. Though it’s doing a lot less, it still felt incredibly rushed where things changed too much too fast without properly developing these changes. It also felt strangely badly written at times, with moments such as Arslan randomly charging into an enemy camp alone and no one really objecting to that or the secret villain clearly showing that he’s the villain to the main cast but it being portrayed that this was only picked up on by the tactician due to his intelligence. Also, due to there being a lot more changing in perspectives, it felt like it got weird as the timelines don’t really match up how things were actually shown. The second big issue is that the ending isn’t really satisfying at all. The first season ended with what felt like the end of Arslan’s growth in a sense as well as a major victory, so it felt pretty satisfying. The ending to this season doesn’t feel like its the end of anything really, rather it ends right before a major battle. So while the first season ended at a point that while not the complete ending, it felt like it finished one of the main things it wanted to do and stopped at a point where it felt like an arc break. I should note that this is an anime based on an ongoing manga based on a novel series that began a long time ago that’s based on ancient Persian epic. This anime is most immediately based on the manga, but it differs from it quite a bit, and I think it actually passed it when this came out. So I feel like relying on the manga as the continuation and not caring as much about how the anime ends doesn’t really work as well as it does in most cases, and thus the ending of the anime being such a non-ending I feel has much more of an impact unfortunately. This season felt like it shook things up and left everything uncertain and then just abruptly stopped at a point where it isn’t clear at all what’ll happen next which isn’t satisfying at all.The art, design, and animation are similar to the previous season, mostly good but bad use of CG during big battles. The OP and ED are both pretty great, though I feel the OP makes the heel turn of a villain overtly obvious, which makes me question whether they intended for it to be a twist at all. Soundtrack is still pretty good and especially good at sounding heroic. the focus has shifted to being about more than just Arslan to being about the entire conflict and everyone involved in it.

Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9760/Hoshi_wo_Ou_Kodomo,"['Stories about the dead coming back to life are a dime a dozen these days, mainly because of the current fascination with zombies and vampires, but rarely do we see a tale that\'s more akin to the legends of old, where mighty heroes brave the perils of the underworld to be reunited with their lost love.Sorry, that should be a 12 year old girl. Let\'s try this again ...Stories about children having adventures in other worlds are a dime a dozen these days, but rarely do we see a tale that\'s more akin to the stories of old, where brave youths traversed other realms on...a journey that would teach them ... lots of stuff.Nope, that\'s not going to work either. Let\'s try putting the two together ...Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo, which apparently means ""Children Who Chase Stars"" but for some reason is called ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices From Deep Below"", is the latest work from acclaimed creator and director Shinkai Makoto. The story centres on a small town in the countryside, where a young girl called Asuna spends her time after school listening to the strange music that comes from the crystal radio that her father left to her before he passed away.Everything is peaceful until one rather eventful day ...At it\'s core, Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is an adventure covered in a philosophical blanket that doesn\'t quite fit, and it shows in many ways. The plot tries to blend a variety of themes, but it never really manages to do this with the panache of Shinkai\'s previous works. In addition to this, there\'s a childishness to the narrative that some viewers may find a little annoying, and quite often events are resolved in a manner that is very ""black and white"". Because of this the story lacks a good measure of catharsis, especially in comparison to ""5 cm Per Second"" and ""The Place Promised In Our Early Days"", and the film concludes with a rather lukewarm resolution.That said, the movie is interesting to a degree, but much of this comes from the way in which myths and legends regarding the underworld and resurrection are tied into the plot. Unfortunately, it\'s clear from the opening scenes that inspiration for the anime has come from a few very well known sources, and viewers may find that they spend more time playing spot-the-influence, and less time paying attention to the storyline.One of the first things that people will notice about Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is the very ""Ghibli-esque"" atmosphere it has, but while this perception can initially be ascribed to the rural setting and the young lead character, the similarities actually run a lot deeper. The scenery is a rather pleasant blend of Shinkai\'s trademark panoramas and the kind of countryside imagery that one might find in ""Only Yesterday"" or ""Spirited Away"". Once the action moves beyond the gate, the background art and the settings dramatically improve, and the audience is treated to the kind of vistas that one would expect in a Shinkai feature.Unfortunately the same can\'t be said of the design, and viewers may be forgiven for thinking that the entirety of the movie is nothing more than an homage to a certain well known studio. The characters are so stereotypically Ghibli in fact, it\'s easy to imagine them searching for Laputa or farming in The Valley of the Wind. The similarities even extend to the animals, and while several of the more fantastic creatures wouldn\'t look out of place in the forests of ""Mononoke-Hime"", the strongest resemblance (in more ways than one), is between Asuna\'s cat Mimi and Nausicaä\'s pet Teto. Sadly, the comparison can only go so far as the characters lack visual refinement, which is further compounded by the lack of gradation in the colour palette used for them.When it comes to the animation, Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is a long way from the best work produced by the long-running Shinkai/CoMix Wave Inc. collaboration. The action sequences are pretty decent for the most part, but the characters can sometimes move in a stunted manner, almost as if there\'s a degree of uncertainty about how each person should act or react in a given situation. In addition to this there are several scenes where the characters seem to have irregularly proportioned bodies, and viewers may find themselves wondering why particular events leave them with the nagging feeling that something isn\'t right.The theme song, ""Hello, Goodbye and Hello"" is a bittersweet ballad composed and performed by Anri Kumaki, and in all honesty it\'s a rather fitting song given the nature of the story. As for the background music, there\'s a rather nice mixture of placid or bittersweet orchestral tracks, light-hearted jingles and dramatic pieces, all produced by Tenmon - Shinkai\'s long-time compositional stalwart. Ironically, the movie excels when it comes to audio choreography, and with an array of high quality effects on offer it can sometimes feel as though more care has been given to making the feature sound good in a pretty setting, and not enough on developing the story.The script lacks a degree of intuitive flow, and the characters can sometimes state the obvious or wax philosophical for no reason other than to add a veneer of intelligence to proceedings. It\'s a sad fact that the dialogue can sometimes be stunted, and lacks the nuance that many viewers might expect. While some people may believe that this is due Asuna\'s age and lack of knowledge, the simple fact is that it highlights more than anything else how inexperienced Shinkai is with this type of movie. That said, the more than experienced cast have rallied well, but even with their ability to project emotion and personality, there are moments when they\'re unable to compensate for the heavy handed script.There\'s a strange dichotomy with the characters as on the one hand Asuna, Shun, Shin, and pretty much everyone else aren\'t really anything to write home about - especially if you\'ve watched certain Ghibli movies. On the other hand Morisaki Ryuji is a very interesting person indeed, and is reminiscent in many ways of a more humane Ikari Gendou. Unfortunately he also suffers from the same problem in that he isn\'t given enough back-story to support his actions and decisions, but then, that\'s pretty much the tale of Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo in a nutshell. Although there is some development for the lead roles, it\'s often sporadic as the focus seems to be more on the journey itself.Shinkai Makoto has made it no secret that the inspiration for this movie came from a story he read in elementary school, but it was during his sojourn in England in 2008 that the idea for the anime finally coalesced into something more concrete.Which, strangely enough, explains rather a lot.There\'s a childishness to the movie that doesn\'t quite fit with the major themes of the plot, and in many ways it feels more like Shinkai was testing the waters and his determination, which isn\'t actually surprising when one considers that Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is also his attempt to prove that he isn\'t a one-trick pony. While there are some positives that can be taken away from the feature, there are far too many things that have been ""borrowed"" from other films, and these make it difficult to see the movie as little more than an homage. In all honesty it would have been nice if Shinkai had the courage of his convictions and relied more on his own style (like he did with ""5 cm Per Second"" and ""The Place Promised In Our Early Days""), instead of trying to piggyback on that of another studio.That said, Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is a fairly easy movie to watch as long as the viewer doesn\'t delve too deeply, and it has a much lighter and more adventurous tone that Shinkai\'s previous offerings. In addition to this, if one considers it an experiment with a new type of story then it doesn\'t just become a reasonably entertaining feature, but also a glimpse into the mind of Makoto Shinkai, and that is a much more rewarding experience than the movie itself. a journey that would teach them ... lots of stuff.Nope, that\'s not going to work either.

This is how I would describe Children Who Chase Lost Voices.Although, to be perfectly honest, I do not entirely agree with the Ghibli comparison many have done. The similarities stop after a magical land, equally magical creatures and character designs that, with some small adjustments, could have come from any of Hayao Miyazaki’s flicks. The rest is characteristic Shinkai flair, albeit this time muddled with a severe identity crisis.On a first glance Children Who Chase Lost Voices does...not sound too bad. A girl named Asuna is about to be killed by a magical beast when a mysterious boy pops up and saves her. One thing leads to another and soon she is thrown into Agartha; a land unknown to mankind.This is a good set-up and it also tries to tackle subjects such as death and bonding. But the lacklustre execution leaves extremely much to be desired. It is hard to understand how Shinkai, who at least were somewhat coherent in the past, could end up doing this mess.The story never really makes any sense and Asuna’s drive, a character she had known for ten minutes disappearing for reasons unbeknownst me, is a really bad excuse for starting it. Every ten minutes, sometimes even less, we have drama cranked up to eleven even by Shinkai standard. In most cases these moments are variations of Asuna needing to be saved which does not help making the drama less tiresome after the tenth overblown scene.There is no room to for Children Who Chase Lost Voices to actually breathe and explore its own setting. Agartha itself is never properly established and neither are the people nor the creatures that inhabit it. There is some conflict, a large kingdom and so on… but these do not matter at all. This becomes almost pathetic when none of the main characters even question or act surprised at what they are witnessing. This is because they are only there to move the already non-existent story forward.As if to rub salt in the already fatal wound, Children Who Chase Lost Voices also suffers from a directing that I never would have guessed would come from Shinkai who is an experienced person. The movie has a lot of scene transitions and cuts which results in a very fragmented story. In one second there is a chase scene, another second it has ended and then all of a sudden we are in a town. This hurts the already unexplored setting even more! Add in the tedious drama I spoke of earlier and it simply does not mesh that well.And this leads me to the movie suffering from an identity crisis. It does not know what it wants to focus on. The setting is not important, the story is poor and the characters are shallow. Yet Children Who Chase Lost Voices incorporates them all in a hope of achieving something. But that something never shows itself throughout the movie. Even the themes, death and bonding, are thrown out of the window towards the end as a way to squeeze out a tiny bit more drama instead of something believable.Whether or not Children Who Chase Lost Voices was an experiment by Shinkai to try out something new or an attempt to emulate someone else’s success does not change the fact that this is a disaster.An utter disaster that makes me skeptical of his future works. not sound too bad.

One day she is attacked by a monster, who got lost on his way to a Princess Mononoke audition, but is saved by Shun, who is basically the pretty boy male lead from half of every single Ghibli movie ever (don't worry, the other half of the pretty boy male lead is role is taken up by Shun's younger brother). But then Stuff Happens that I don't want to spoil,...so Asuna has to travel to the magical land of Agartha with her mysterious substitute teacher, who is basically the villain from every single Ghibli movie...wait, actually he's not. He's more nuanced than that, and was far and away my favourite character of the movie.I'm sure the clever ones amongst you must have caught on by now that this movie is rather derivitave. Yes the movie takes many cues from Ghibli flicks, particularly Laputa which Shinkai has admitted to being a big fan of, but it plays around with the formula in enough new and interesting ways to stand out from the pack. Asuna, our female lead, does start out as rather irritatingly perfect, but as the movie goes on her loneliness and fears begin to come more to the surface. Plus it does this without ever being in your face about it. Yes, the characters sometimes have to point out the direction their character’s development is going in, such as when Asuna admits to her substitute teacher acting a bit like her father, but it flows well with the dialogue and doesn't feel the need to retread these same points over and over again.Then there's the substitute teacher, Morisaki, who I've already eluded to as being my favourite characte. He starts off appearing like he's going to be the standard deluded villain, intent on destroying all in his path to get to his goal. This is sort of what he is, but his reasoning is sympathetic and he doesn't act pointlessly evil for the sake of things. He's quick to draw his gun, but it's for his own safety and not because he just likes shooting things. His reasoning for going into Agartha makes him sympathetic too, rather than just being power-hungry or driven by sheer greed. But what makes him great is he also brings out the best in Asuna, elevating her to an interesting character in their own right. As the two travel through Agartha, they strike up a rapport like that of father and daughter, which was very fitting given what the two of them had lost in their lives. They became the family neither of them ever had and, while he was often harsh to Asuna, there was still the strong sense that Morisaki grew to care for her immensely. He's a human character with real flaws, as was Asuna, and their relationship was the real highlight of the movie.Animation-wise, the movie is stunning. OK, this is still Shinkai, and his tendency to focus on clouds remains completely baffling, but the world of Agartha is beautiful. It's essentially the same as earth, but there's enough touches here and there to make it seem alien. Morisaki and Asuna travelling through the countryside had this almost Lord of the Rings feel to it. The world can feel a bit barren at times, lacking magical towers and sparkles at every turn, but it fit the feel of the world. It was supposed to feel empty and dying. The other thing this movie nailed was the sheer scale of some of the set pieces. Where Ghibli films excel is in the fine detail, which I don't think Shinkai got quite as well in this film, but the scopes of some of the set pieces were jaw-dropping. Particularly I have to mention the giant hole in the world that book-ended the film and that multi-eyed monstrosity that was meant to represent the god of this world. And hey, since we're talking about monsters, special mention has to go to those skeleton-like creatures that swam on the ground like sharks of the shadows. They were flat out creepy.It's far from a perfect film though, and I particularly have a bone to pick with the music. The sweeping orchestral score has all the subtlety of a child smashing a spanner on a table to get attention. Because the same score is used for almost every single slightly dramatic scene, it robs the music the intense effect it's supposed to have on the more dramatic scenes. It's also a bloody long film, about 2 hours long, and takes a while to get going. It doesn't really pick up until the characters visit Agartha, and that takes almost an hour. This is partly down to Shinkai spending far too much time setting the scene, showing off the landscape of Asuna's home town. Which is fair enough, highlighting the ordinary world so it makes the contrast with Agartha that much stronger, but he really spends too much time on it. I really didn't need that shot of dragonflies having sex Shinkai, and could you please stop it with the bloody clouds? Yes, these scenes are incredibly important to establishing Asuna's character for the development that occurs later on, but it doesn't stop the scenes from being boring. And no, sticking in the fox-cat from Nausicca won't make these scenes that much more tolerable. That's just cheating.Plus since it's basically Ghibli, it carries over not only the strong points of magical worlds and amazing attention to detail that these films have, but also carries over the warts too. Towards the end it really starts to get a bit silly, especially when the giant monster thing swallows the main character and jumps down a bizillion foot drop in order to transport her, looking rather like a pregnant woman crossed with those robot things from Laputa. It even brings over the forced in environmental message that Miyazaki works into his films with the grace and subtlety of a hippo doing ballet. It did only got a passing mention and, while clunky, wasn't anywhere near as bad as Miyazaki's tend to be. Besides, the movie earns so many points by adding the much needed nuance to the main character and the sorta villain that I can forgive most of the mistakes it makes. Asides from the clouds. Please stop with the damn clouds.There is one final problem I'd like to highlight. There was something off about the pacing. The story was very well told and wove the themes of loneliness and loss in extremely well, but the transition from set piece to set piece was clunky, as though it was adapting a TV series and these were the gaps between episodes. As I said, it's a two hour movie which is really a touch too long, but I also wouldn't want to cut much out of it (asides from all the clouds). I think it may have suited a short Noitamina length TV series or OVA instead. You could have delved into some of the characters pasts a bit more, or told us more about Agartha. That was one thing I was a bit miffed about. There was an interesting conflict between Morisaki and the people of Agartha where he accused them of accepting their decay and being lazy, which tied quite well in with his own story, but it didn't really tackle the Agartha side of the story once he'd left.While there are plenty of flaws with the movie, I did end up enjoying it a lot. Not sure how fans of previous Shinkai films will take this, as it's a drastic change from them. I suppose the themes are kind of similar (or at least I'm told the themes are similar, I was too busy gnawing my arm off in an attempt  to stay awake to notice the themes of his previous films). But if you like Miyazaki's films, you'll like this. It's too long, take a while to get going, gets a bit silly at times, and someone needs to bop the composer over the head and tell him to lay off the full orchestral sweeps every once in a while, but it's a genuinely entertaining film with a well told story. And clouds. so Asuna has to travel to the magical land of Agartha with her mysterious substitute teacher, who is basically the villain from every single Ghibli movie...wait, actually he's not. He's more nuanced than that, and was far and away my favourite character of the movie.I'm sure the clever ones amongst you must have caught on by now that this movie is rather derivitave. Yes the movie takes many cues from Ghibli flicks, particularly Laputa which Shinkai has admitted to being a big fan of, but it plays around with the formula in enough new and interesting ways to stand out from the pack. Asuna, our female lead, does start out as rather irritatingly perfect, but as the movie goes on her loneliness and fears begin to come more to the surface. Plus it does this without ever being in your face about it. Yes, the characters sometimes have to point out the direction their character’s development is going in, such as when Asuna admits to her substitute teacher acting a bit like her father, but it flows well with the dialogue and doesn't feel the need to retread these same points over and over again.Then there's the substitute teacher, Morisaki, who I've already eluded to as being my favourite characte. He starts off appearing like he's going to be the standard deluded villain, intent on destroying all in his path to get to his goal. This is sort of what he is, but his reasoning is sympathetic and he doesn't act pointlessly evil for the sake of things. He's quick to draw his gun, but it's for his own safety and not because he just likes shooting things. His reasoning for going into Agartha makes him sympathetic too, rather than just being power-hungry or driven by sheer greed.

And clouds."", 'Disclaimer: As this obviously hasn\'t been subbed yet, and my Japanese is nowhere near fluent, it\'s possible that certain minor details in the plot might have escaped me. Please keep this in mind while reading the review.Makoto Shinkai\'s most recent work is something quite new for him. The main criticisms of his works has as far as I can tell been the character designs being to simplistic and rough, as well as all his three longer works being quite similar. Though I would contend the latter point, it\'s certain that Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is different, in both aspects. It would seem that Shinkai has...moved away from his tragic love stories with sci-fi elements and to something more Miyazaki-inspired. But does he succeed? (OK, I guess this isn\'t much of a cliffhanger considering my scores.)Story: Our heroine, Asuna, lives a relatively normal, albeit busy life somewhere on the countryside, until she one day gets attacked by a strange beast and saved by a mysterious boy. This leads to an amazing adventure in the strange underworld Agartha. Sure, this doesn\'t sound like anything new, but the progression of the story is quite interesting, unpredictable and exciting. All the characters have their own stories and agendas, and the film manages to involve us in all of them without losing focus. The climax is extremely moving in the way only Shinkai can manage, and nothing ever feels unnecessary or forced.Art: Art is certainly one aspect where one have high expectations of Shinkai, but he delivers anything one could want and more. Takayo Nishimura, the man behind the character designs in 5 cm/Second is back, but Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo looks distinctly different. The designs are still relatively simple, but bursting with life and charm. I would compare them to the designs found in Hayao Miyazaki\'s films, which certainly seems a plausible influence. In this way, Shinkai has ridden himself of what some people thought to be the weak point in his aesthetic, while still keeping true to the relatively simple designs he\'s always used.The rest of the art is amazing. The backgrounds, whether they\'re clouds and stars or forests and plains, are breathtakingly beautiful, and what\'s particularly interesting about Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo compared to Shinkai\'s other works is the setting. While he certainly has used nature before, there has usually been more focus on cities or space. In this film, both the Japanese countryside with mountains and forests, as well as the fantastic world of Agartha with its plains and ruins, are brought to life splendidly.Animation-wise there is nothing to criticize. The animation flows smoothly and beautifully, and Shinkai certainly knows how to work the angles and perspectives to get the most out of the scenes. This is very evident in many of the action scenes, and I was particularly impressed by a swordfight during sunset, the amazing colors of the background framing an intense burst of life with the ""camera"" flying all over the place, creating an incredible impression.Sound: Tenmon is back, and he\'s better than ever. Utilizing a range of instruments including his famous piano pieces as well as some wonderful violins, his music set the mood for the film perfectly. What struck me the most was the way the music could change mood in a heartbeat without seeming out of place, particularily evident in a scene where you first get the ""hero riding out to save the princess"" mood, and when the scene shifts to the damsel in distress, as it were, it seamlessly changes to an intense ""our friends are in great peril"" theme.On the voice actor side, Shinkai has managed to score some very talented people. All the three main characters are quite big names, and Kazuhiko Inoue\'s role as Asura\'s teacher, as well as Hisako Kanemoto as Asura herself both excel, and really do their part in making their respective characters believable. Miyu Irino as Shin and Shun is also a very fitting choice. However, one of the most impressive voice actors was Rina Hidaka as Mana, a character who doesn\'t use words, but conveys all her feelings with random sounds. A challenging role to get right, but Mana\'s character turned out perfect.Character:  Asuna, our main character, is a very busy girl. She lost her father at a young age, and her mother is very busy at work, so she does a lot of chores, while at the same time keeping up her perfect grades and finding time to climb the nearby mountain to listen to the radio her father left her. As the story progresses, she is faced with quite a lot of hardships, and one can see her progress through dealing with them. She is not quite sure why she\'s on the journey she ends up on, and seeing her discovering more about herself as she faces new challenges is quite moving.Morisaki is Asuna\'s new teacher, and one of the main catalysts of the adventure. He starts out mysterious, but one quickly learns of his goal and the lengths he will go to reach it. He\'s cold and blunt, but though he will not give up on his goal, he is also considerate of others, and his relationship with Asuna develops in quite interesting ways.Shun is a mysterious boy from Agaruta who, like Morisaki, starts out mysterious and cold. We learn that he\'s a conflicted and confused boy trying to find his place in the world, and he develops greatly during the course of the movie, finding great courage within himself.There\'s also a great supporting cast, such as Asuna\'s mother, who\'s very busy, but still manages to care a great deal about Asuna even after her husband\'s death. The previously mentioned Mana, as well as Shin, are also great characters for their purpose, but the one that really sticks out is Mimi, Asuna\'s cat, who follows her through the journey and whose vivid personality really makes one attached to it.Overall: Though I\'m a huge fan of his other works, it\'s great seeing Shinkai going in a new direction, this time aiming at a much larger group of people, from children to adults. The similarity to Miyazaki\'s adventure films is certainly present, in particular there were quite a few parallels to Mononoke-hime, but he still manages to keep his own unique style, including the extremely emotional scenes that he excels at. I certainly look forward to more Shinkai works, and would recommend Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo to anyone, regardless of whether or not you liked his earlier works. moved away from his tragic love stories with sci-fi elements and to something more Miyazaki-inspired.

A story of a kid sucked into a fantasy world of some kind, willingly or not, and embark on an adventure of a lifetime. These films have almost become a dime a dozen these days, so they really need to be excellent and memorable to become a classic. Sadly, I don\'t really feel like this one treads new ground.In this tale, we follow Asuna, a regular, independent teenage girl. We also meet a substitute teacher (Morisaki) and follow them through an underground world to play God and revive...the dead. Ambitious, you can call them, though it is an understatement. The concept of resurrection is certainly very interesting to explore, though this movie doesn\'t really do that, even if it is a main focus. It lead to a very anti-climactic ending. They made very quick work of the ending. They could have really explored more about resurrection and be more imaginative, but instead it felt lazy. Everything leading up to the end felt cliché and predictable, thus, a little boring.The characters didn\'t really standout, either, though they aren\'t terrible. Asuna is a fun little character, always happy and optimistic, though also a little bland. Morisaki was also a little boring, always serious and never letting loose. They could have played around with him a little but we got nothing. The same can be said about most of these characters. They\'re pretty one-dimensional and not very believable.Of course, I have to praise the art. ""Scenery porn"" as many like to call it. The landscapes are all very beautiful and detailed; they remind me of shows like 5/cm. It\'s probably (okay, definitely) the strongest point of the movie. The lighting can be really exquisite at time and DEM CLOUDS. I can jerk off to those clouds all day, but I digress. Being a movie, the animation is very good but not exceptional. Standard movie stuff.Overall, the music is nice and fits the scenes well. They used the music well, as well as silence for those tense moments. The only qualm I have with it is that it just isn\'t memorable at all. It\'s hard to recollect any song from memory. Voice acting is decent, but even they couldn\'t save the sort of bland characters.This movie is just another fantasy story that doesn\'t standout or offer anything new. It isn\'t really remarkable at anything, except perhaps the art. The story left more to be desired and a lot felt somewhat unexplained, especially near the end. I still kind of enjoyed it though. The characters were a little boring, but I still enjoyed their interactions with the new world.

The director clearly loved Miyazaki\'s films and knew that they worked, but had no idea as to why.  You\'ll see character designs, scenes, and shots that you can place to exact moments in Nausicaa, Totoro, and the like, but they\'re all in a string of events that seem to happen just because.  Seriously, the fucking ""Nausicaa\'s fox-squirrel jumps on her shoulder and runs to the other"" thing is done at least five fucking times.  Shinkai clearly noticed that Miyazaki films often have female protagonists, but he didn\'t...seem to get that they needed character and agency.  Seriously, our ""protagonist"" has no control over anything and virtually never tries to actively do anything, and she always needs to be saved by a man every time something bad happens.  There\'s even this unintentionally hilarious scene where someone tells her how she has to make a choice about whether she\'s going to cross into another world while he drags her there by the wrist.  And the music is some of the most baffling I\'ve heard in ages.  There\'s swelling dramatic music for almost everything, as if the director thought every other scene was the most dramatic, meaningful thing in the universe.  It starts becoming funny the third time it does this when it\'s just some character running somewhere for no reason.In short, it\'s a string of scenes that look beautiful on their own without context, but taken as a whole, it\'s an unoriginal, plodding mess.Oh, and there\'s a scene of two dragonflies fucking for some reason.  No idea what the fuck that was about. seem to get that they needed character and agency.

It does take quite a while before things really kick off, and not as much time is spent in Agartha as could’ve been, but it’s a minor problem.However, even with this the story moves at a rather fast...pace, leaving little room for any form of additional backstory, whether it’s about Agartha or about the characters pasts. This was really too bad, as there are some pretty obvious questions left unanswered by the end of the movie.(Several people have talked about this being a way too “Ghiblified” movie, but I don’t feel like I’ve seen enough of either director to really comment on this, though it does have sort of a Ghibli feel to it.)Art: (9 / 10)The art is absolutely stunning. The backgrounds, the characters and the various creatures all look simply amazing. From what I can tell, backgrounds like these are sort of a standard thing in Shinkai movies, and there are several moments where the camera will just pan over the landscape, allowing the viewer to really take in the beauty of the world that’s been created.The characters all look good, and the variety and detail of the creatures is very well done.The animation was very fluid and well done most of the time, however there were times when it just felt a bit off, or when there would be a bit too many/long scenery shots.Sound: (8 / 10)The voice actors did a pretty great job with their respective characters, and the music was very good as well. The music did a good job at “emphasising” the scenes, whether it be a sad scene or a more action-focused scene. The credits song, “Hello, Goodbye and Hello” by Kumaki Anri, is an amazing song, and really brought back all those feelings from the movie.However, there is a minor problem here, as well. Some songs, including an orchestral version of the credits theme, will play often, and I mean really often. Of course, if you don’t mind these songs, then this won’t be a problem, but it could reduce the effect they have on scenes later on.Characters: (7 / 10)The characters were mostly fine. They weren’t however all too great, to be honest. There is some backstory and development to certain characters, while some characters are barely fleshed out at all, and are only there to serve a very specific purpose in the plot. This was obviously a bit unfortunate, since I feel like there was certainly time for more time to be spent with the characters, and yet we’re left with this.Luckily, it’s not at the point where you can’t feel or sympathize with the characters; in fact, there are several times when this will happen throughout the movie.Enjoyment: (9 / 10)After all, I quite enjoyed this movie.

This was really too bad, as there are some pretty obvious questions left unanswered by the end of the movie.(Several people have talked about this being a way too “Ghiblified” movie, but I don’t feel like I’ve seen enough of either director to really comment on this, though it does have sort of a Ghibli feel to it.)Art: (9 / 10)The art is absolutely stunning. The backgrounds, the characters and the various creatures all look simply amazing. From what I can tell, backgrounds like these are sort of a standard thing in Shinkai movies, and there are several moments where the camera will just pan over the landscape, allowing the viewer to really take in the beauty of the world that’s been created.The characters all look good, and the variety and detail of the creatures is very well done.The animation was very fluid and well done most of the time, however there were times when it just felt a bit off, or when there would be a bit too many/long scenery shots.Sound: (8 / 10)The voice actors did a pretty great job with their respective characters, and the music was very good as well. The music did a good job at “emphasising” the scenes, whether it be a sad scene or a more action-focused scene. The credits song, “Hello, Goodbye and Hello” by Kumaki Anri, is an amazing song, and really brought back all those feelings from the movie.However, there is a minor problem here, as well. Some songs, including an orchestral version of the credits theme, will play often, and I mean really often. Of course, if you don’t mind these songs, then this won’t be a problem, but it could reduce the effect they have on scenes later on.Characters: (7 / 10)The characters were mostly fine.

Too easy to drop down to the banal repetition of precepts of the ancient sages or even go away from believable emotions, depriving the viewer of not just the answers, but even a simple empathy to heroes. No wonder that both in live-action and animation few authors dare to even approach it. In Makoto Shinkai\'s ""Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo""...this topic continues theme of parting loving hearts of his previous works, but it does so in an unexpected setting, clearly reminiscent of ""adult fairy tales"" of Hayao Miyazaki.The first thing one can say about the film - its visual component is simply breathtaking. These words can be applied to both animation and design. Previous films of this director were also very rich with details, but here, in fantastic Agartha, such attention creates a stunning effect. Every second the picture plays with light, colors and shapes, masterfully using 3D animation, where necessary, and creating fantastic immersive experience. And while the roots of many design elements can easily be seen, they acquire here such a new charm, that the movie holds the stage until the very end.The other sides of the film are more ambiguous. The plot takes a quick start, jumping at a gallop speed from scene to scene. The first 20 minutes take approximately the same pace of events as the rest of the movie. And here one of the director\'s weaknesses become evident, which he obviously did not manage to completely overcome - the inability to combine individual dynamic episodes into a smooth and solid sequence. Despite the fact that the beginning of the film shows us all that it should be in a prologue - everyday life of Asuna, her acquaintanceship with the other main characters and events that give impetus to the main plot, the absence of natural transitions not only evokes a sense of theatricality and staging of what is happening but also calls into question the reliability of experience and motivation of Asuna, who made such a difficult journey. It takes too little time to develop relationships of characters for a viewer to believe in such a strong attachment of them to each other, which is like a red thread going through the whole picture.Music only reinforces this impression. Shinkai\'s permanent composer Tenmon decided this time to move away from the calm and soulful melodies of the previous films, resulting in every second scene accompanied by loud epic composition. Such pathos really makes an impression when it is used moderately and appropriately. On the contrary, here we have an emotional soundtrack which is often does not correspond to what\'s happening on screen, and in the viewer\'s perception music moves into the background, not emphasizing the really important moments in the climax.As soon as the plot develops, it becomes increasingly clear how little of the potential of the film\'s setting is used. Information about the life and history of Agartha is being given dryly and very schematically. The same can be said about the past of the protagonists: the relevant scenes and remarks, though sometimes decorated like character\'s memories, rather resemble the notes in everyday conversation, the topic of which concerns something completely different. I believe there is only a single scene in the whole movie where country\'s people and villages are portrayed not as scenery, introduced by director just for the sake of the story. Unlike Idzoku tribe, which plays a key role in the storyline - in spite of their mystique, the origins and motives of creatures, so alien at first glance in this world, are left behind the screen.Nevertheless, the one can somewhat empathize to characters, because their desires are clear and understandable. Following along with the story till the end, we come to the message of the film. And I must say, I was expecting something more here. Of course, under the given artificial conditions set by the author, the actions of the characters can be easily divided into right and wrong ones. However, what was the point in all that mess if all the director wanted is to show us something so obvious while not digging into the main question? ""You are as naive as that visitor from the Upper World"", the village Elder blames Sin. In turn, we can blame of naivete the Elder and, further, maestro Shinkai himself, which brought up a global problem, but instead of at least try to solve it, hit the peripheral ethical issues.Summing up, I can not say that the film touched me. The unambiguous bright side of the movie is its astonishing beauty and concept. Shinkai could create a masterpiece on this basis, but it did not work. Instead, he made ""just"" a good adventure film, which can certainly take its place in the collection of every fan of animation. And it is not that bad, is it? this topic continues theme of parting loving hearts of his previous works, but it does so in an unexpected setting, clearly reminiscent of ""adult fairy tales"" of Hayao Miyazaki.The first thing one can say about the film - its visual component is simply breathtaking.

I mean come on, Heidi, Alm-Öhi, and Teto were in the fucking movie, not to mention homages to the God Warriors, Lupin/Laputa robots, and more.I can't say I didn't enjoy parts of the movie, but it would have been much better had it had a competent writer that didn't depend on tired cliches. It would have also been nice had it tried to be original, instead of just stitching together concepts from Miyazaki and Takahata's work.For what it's worth, the...art was really beautiful. art was really beautiful."", 'While the animation is absolutely gorgeous, Children Who Chase Lost Voices is a movie that lacks story content and character development.The characters have potential, put they fail to meet even half of that potential; leaving them boring and incomplete. Asuna is, in my opinion, an irritatingly unoriginal character who fails to create any sort of attachment to me, thus leaving me indifferent as to what may befall her.The story was dry and, while the concept was interesting, the execution was poor. They did not follow up on very important concepts regarding their world, and lacked logic or understanding.If you are looking for good...sound effects and animation, then this movie is perfect for you.

Like that film, it was produced by CoMix Wave Films. Is this film as strong as that one was? It has the same writer/director and the same production company so that's probably a good sign. And I only use the qualifier 'probably' because I've been disappointed in the works of people who I had previously known for making quality works before. Let's just hope this isn't one of those times.Story:Our narrative opens with our heroine, Asuna, going to her secret base after school to...listen to her makeshift radio. She hears a mysterious melody unlike any she's heard before. Not long afterwards, she encounters a strange creature when she's crossing the train tracks to reach her base. Fortunately for her, a mysterious young man comes to her rescue. He calls himself Shun and claims to come from the land of Agartha, which you my recognise from esoteric ideas related to the Earth being hollow. To be fair, those ideas can make for interesting fiction in spite of having no basis in reality. After her meeting with Shun, he dies of plot necessity and Asuna is just beginning to cope with the loss when she hears her teacher mention Agartha and how it supposedly holds the key to resurrect the dead. After returning to her base, she encounters a young man who strongly resembles Shun and, after a hectic series of events, finds herself in Agartha. What secrets will she find there and what trials will she face?The biggest flaw with the film is the ending. It's pretty formulaic and it gets rushed through. The film spends a lot of time on the setup and the journey itself and then tries to wrap everything up within a few minutes. There are also some plot points that aren't really resolved very well. I also have a petty complaint about the way they use “quetzacoatl”as a term to describe a variety of monsters. If you know your mythology then you know that the term comes from the Nahuatl name for the feathered serpent God and it just seems like a strange thing to use as a general term for a variety of creatures when the original term is so specific. It's admittedly a petty complaint, but it did bug me a bit.That aside, the film does do a lot of things well. The setup is really stellar. The world building is also really compelling and has a lot of good ideas going into it. The theme of loss throughout the story is handled really well. The climax, in spite of being rushed, does have some really strong setup and ideas behind it. I also do like that the film effectively illustrates the ways that Asuna is capable without stretching it to the point of being unbelievable.Characters:The film does a really good job of establishing characters who are believable and largely sympathetic and of developing them throughout with the three major characters all having their own story arcs that are connected thematically and that intersect, but that do ultimately remain pretty unique. Even the secondary characters are pretty fleshed out and do have verisimilitude. I will give Shinkai credit. The gent does know how to craft a compelling group of characters.Art:The visuals in this film are gorgeous. The creature designs are really interesting. The action sequences are well done. The backgrounds are stunning. Honestly, the art reminds me a bit of a Studio Ghibli production in its high level of quality and in its general style.Sound:The vocal cast is pretty strong. Kanemoto Hisako, Irino Miyu, and Inoue Kazuhiko all give good performances as the leads. The side characters have strong performances behind them as well. The music, both incidental and lyrical, is really good as well. Kumaki Anri's song is actually very good at supplementing the major theme of loss.Ho-yay:There really isn't any to be found in this film.Final Thoughts:Hoshi wo ou Kodomo is a really good movie. It's not perfect, the story has some noticeable issues but it also has a lot of aspects it does well. The music, acting and artwork are all very high quality and the characters are complex and endearing. All in all, it is well worth a watch. My final rating is going to be an 8/10.

So I hope you will find this review helpful and enjoyable. Alright, here goes.This is truly one of the best animes I have ever watched - hand down.The intensity and emotion behind each of the characters and their actions is overwhelming at times and these emotions certainly won't fail to move any person who has had any relation to love, loss of someone important or simply just a person who has the...felt the warmth of motherly love.Story: 9The story of this movie could - to some people - seem a bit rushed and somewhat not thought through completely. But I beg to differ as I don't think the story is what's most important to this movie.Anyway, I think the story is great and I like the fact that it doesn't beat around the bush but it constantly keeps focusing on the most important aspects of the movie. The development of the main character, Asuna, and her relationship to the other characters as we move forward in the movie.Art: 10The art was what was truly amazing about the anime and definitely its selling point. Nearly every scene involving the environment or the atmosphere around our characters was simply breathtaking and almost without comparison. In addition to these scenes being absolutely amazing there weren't just a few of them but this movie was filled with beautiful landscapes and sky sceneries. Especially the night skies are particularly beautiful.Sound: 10The sound was almost as amazing as the art and gave me goosebumps several times. It fitted perfectly with the sceneries and the movements and expressions of the characters.To sum up I don't think that the music could've been any better than it is.Character: 9At first the characters seem very classic and maybe a bit overused. The typical main character being a girl who's a bit lonely but diligent nonetheless. She meets a boy who saves her from an evil creature thus being her hero. But as the movie progresses you discover that a lot of the characters aren't really your every day run of the mill.Enjoyment: 10I was really entertained throughout the whole movie and it kept moving me. If not by character interactions then by the beautiful soundtracks or the amazing atmospheres created by the art and sound combined.Overall: 10So overall this anime gets a 10 from me. Great story, beautiful animation, perfectly fitting soundtracks and very enjoyable characters. Apart from a this, the movie had a lot of touching morals and enlightening views on life and death. Two very heavy subject which were handled with grace.I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I did, although I think it'd be almost impossible~ :3 felt the warmth of motherly love.Story: 9The story of this movie could - to some people - seem a bit rushed and somewhat not thought through completely.

Would I recommend it ?Definitively yes and yes.In a nutshell, the story of Hoshi o Ou Kodomo, or ""Children Who Chase Lost Voices"", is about a young girl, called Asuna who is having a quiet common life on the countryside. Her daily activity after school, is to go on a rock to listen to some self-constructed radio and watch the stars, but one day this radio is going to give her a music that she never expected. From here on starts the real story, where she will discover a new world and new people.Moreover, I was strongly surprised...to see how the director focused on the landscapes and the discoveries of the new world that Asuna will meet; besides, the duration of the movie is around 2 hours, which could have been shorter.On the story herself, I would recommend Mr. Makoto Shinkai next time to focus on the past of the characters and explain more in details their personalities or ambitions. As many Japanese anime movies, a part of imagination is kept in the story. The public can meet numerous silent parts (the central figures do not speak a lot), where the actions of the characters explain their believes and situation.I put a 7/10 for the story.Regarding the art, I appreciated the realistic style of the landscapes, clouds, (which are strongly shown in this adventure), even characters, to the imaginary style of the elements above nature such as the represented gods that you will encounter. This art brought me a terrible sense of nostalgia into my heart with the charming music, which melodiously accompanied it.It is my believe there was a good combination of the art used for reality and imagination, nonetheless there could have been a few efforts made on the daily-life\'s sceneries; instead of putting the main character, Asuna, in the countryside, she could have been in a town or at least discover an underworld where there would be more activities, rather than just landscapes all the time and a few beings.The last thing, I could say on the art is the conventional design of the characters, which in my opinion could have been different. Asuna, Shin or Shun looked quite similar to the Ghibli\'s anime heroes.Furthermore, the background music was fitting for the story and atmosphere; I particularly liked the last song on the generic with the ""hello, goodbye, hello"" lyrics, who made me feel a certain melancholy on the ending.In general the music did not especially catch my attention, but was clearly good enough to make the story go on an enjoyable rhythm.I put an 8/10 for the sound and a 9/10 for the art.Finally my favorite theme, the characters. My treasured person in this movie was Morisaki. He is the professor of Asuna and is in constant research to bring his wife back to life. Asuna seems to consider him once as her father, but he keeps changing sides, being the good and the bad guy. Nevertheless, he is one of the main figures of the movie and will reveal a terrible past, which can bring the lector to sympathize with him all along the story.Despite knowing that Asuna lost her father and is living most of the time alone, due to the hard work of her mother, we do not know her ambitions until the end. We do not know her past. It made me uncomfortable and I kept trying to imagine, but I thought the director could have improved this part. Otherwise, the sudden impact to change the side character, from shun to shin, one brother to another, would not have been necessary. It just makes the main plot more complicated and does not bring a suitable feeling to the viewers.For the characters, I put an 8/10.Beyond a shadow of doubt, I liked this movie. It tells a good story, combines a great musical score with a stunning art, and you can mostly relax on your sofa to watch it.

I actually fell asleep and had to rewind to see it all though, after making it to the end I realized I shouldn't have bothered. Despite being a very pretty anime the story overly complicates a simple concept while pretending to explain what is supposed to be happening and giving you characters that I just didn't care about. I think this movie will only appeal to people who don't mind overly dramatic tragedies. "", ""This right here is the definition of mediocre. I came into this movie with good expectations and was severely let down. It took 3 sittings before i could finish it.Lets start off with this movie's one and only strong point. The art and animation.  It's right up there with one of the most beautiful animations, paired with a pleasing art style. I felt myself hooked on the visuals of this movie. But that's where the fun stops.Most stories follow the same tension over time graph. Starts off slow, the tension gets higher and higher until it reaches the climax. Then it settles...down again at the end. However, Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo's tension was all over the place. It felt like it had 3-5 different climaxes, making it a not very enjoyable roller-coaster ride. The story was too fast paced and left me unattached and uninterested in the development of the characters and story. Parts where it was obvious the viewer should be sad or happy or on the edge of my seat, left me feeling nothing.The sound for this movie also felt lacking.

The story was too fast paced and left me unattached and uninterested in the development of the characters and story.

While the backgrounds were beautiful, every visual element and plot device was stolen from a (better) Ghibli movie. The characters\' motivations were poorly explained, it was cheesy and melodramatic beyond belief, and the plot was pretty much nonexistent. What little plot existed was ham-handed and and every moment of pathos felt like a parody of the scene it should have been. Let\'s just say that at the points where I was supposed to cry, I cried laughing. None of the characters were compelling or interesting, except perhaps the teacher, but I\'m not...really inclined to like him either since every scene between him and Asuna had an unfortunate pedophilic tone. And don\'t even get me started on Asuna. Possibly the most uninteresting character ever crafted. She has no flaws, and no personality except ""disgustingly sweet"". The plot meandered and lacked tension. All around, just a terrible movie. The monsters looked pretty cool though. really inclined to like him either since every scene between him and Asuna had an unfortunate pedophilic tone. And don\'t even get me started on Asuna.

The monsters looked pretty cool though.', ""One sentence review: A Ghibli-like adventure with a darker undertone.I was intrigued when I saw this movie as it's directed by Makoto Shinkai, known for his great works that does NOT involve adventure, so I decided to give it a go.At first, I thought that this movie would have a light adventure-y storyline. Well, not exactly light, but I didn't expect that this movie which seemed like a typical children's adventure fantasy movie to have such a heavy plot.For me, the storyline is unique, as it incorporates both adventure and mystery elements into the story seamlessly eventhough it's not tagged as a mystery genre show....Since the beginning of the movie, I felt that there was an air of mystery although nothing really mysterious has happened. The early part of the movie almost felt slice-of-life like, but the subtle odd hints that were shown ( A girl listening to music from a mysterious pendant on a cliff...The new eccentric teacher...) made this show felt mysterious.A bit later, a heavier theme would be explored: The death of a loved one.The three main characters all had lost someone very dear to them. Struggling to move on, they harbor the desire to bring their loved ones back to life, no matter what it takes. This movie shows how awful humans could be when they've lost their humanity to get what they desired. Yup...It's quite heavy. But above all that, it is actually a touching story of growing up and learning to say goodbye.The art is absolutely gorgeous. The use of shadows and lightings, along with the colourful blend of sceneries is sure to grab anyone's attention. Most of the landscapes, especially in the Underworld were very pretty.The soundtracks used really help to set the mood, and the ending song got me all teary-eyed. It was beautiful. The voice actors really did  great job bringing the characters to life.The development of the characters were quite decent. There were actually reasons why the characters behaved that way, like why Asuna's teacher were so determined to seek Agartha. However, there are some unanswered questions, like where did Asuna's father get that stone? Shin's background were also blurry and Shun's motive was blurry too.I really enjoyed this unique and heartfelt movie. For those who love the adventure and feels genre, try watching this :) Since the beginning of the movie, I felt that there was an air of mystery although nothing really mysterious has happened.

With a setting and visual elements reminiscent of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and character and monster design that you could insert into Princess Mononoke and not notice an intrusion, and a narrative structure and a plot following conventions from fantasy anime from that era (championed by Escaflowne, which the movie references visually at least a couple times,) it is clear for the long-time anime watcher that Makoto Shinkai is crafting a beautiful ""thank you"" card to the medium that inspired him to become...who he is now.It is also -as we all have learned to love and expect- breathtakingly beautiful in its large panoramic vistas of long-grassed fields and cloud-layered, color-tinted skies and his signature railway crossroads. The world is imaginative and vibrant and the action scenes beautifully animated and choreographed. Speaking of expectations, the theme of ""distance"" is heavily played but manages to never cloy.However, the movie falls prey to its own good intentions. Trying to include too many trappings and conventions of the medium he\'s paying an homage to, the result is not unlike that of a patchwork that had to sacrifice character development and proper, cohesive narrative to make room for all of it. The jerkiness in plot and character development make the story hard to believe and the characters hard to empathize with, giving the general effect of having cut most of the ""boring"" character-establishment, emotion-development, sense of wonder and personal reflection to give you all the thrilling plot-advancing bits it could pack in two hours.Without a doubt, this story would have been much better served as a 24-episode series than as a movie and that without adding much new, really: Just filling the blatant holes in the narrative and pacing the events properly. Having said that, I understand why this is a movie and not a series: its very own premise makes it wholly unoriginal and derivative which would make the series painfully unnecessary and redundant. As a (superbly visually beautiful) movie it stands as a statement of love and gratitude rather than as a rehash or a cash-in.At this point, I think it\'s necessary to acknowledge Makoto Shinkai\'s shortcomings as a teller of epic narratives, which we have seen in his other plot-driven movies. Hopefully, he\'ll become aware that his real kind of genius is that of the deeply personal, character-driven stories and manage to expertly make of that the focus of the big, sweeping epics he obviously loves to tell.I still wholeheartedly recommend this movie, specially if you are a fan of nineties anime and studio Ghibli. Its plot may leave you slightly unsatisfied but everything else will make you smile. who he is now.It is also -as we all have learned to love and expect- breathtakingly beautiful in its large panoramic vistas of long-grassed fields and cloud-layered, color-tinted skies and his signature railway crossroads.

Its plot may leave you slightly unsatisfied but everything else will make you smile.', 'I was kind of late to the party for this movie. But what the hell, I\'m giving this movie a very different point of view as an enthusiast of American movies. Now with that said, I\'m not totally oblivious of director Makoto Shinkai either. I have watched his previous 3 movies and have noticed a pattern among them, and compared to that pattern, this movie right here is a very different. A different movie requires a different viewpoint, right? Alright, let\'s jump into the story first...Story:If you haven\'t already, go read the story synopsis then come back here. The first arc of the movie is...a slow introduction to the leading girl - Asuna - living in a rural town. It\'s relaxing enough for me to start hoping that this Shinkai guy would finally make a movie with an optimistic tone for once. Well, this being a Shinkai movie, it takes no time at all to tell you the girl\'s lost her daddy. That scene is subtle, which is neat, which piqued my interest immediately. The movie slows down again to show her life, then suddenly... MONSTER ATTACK!!! Yeah, the movie never explained why that monster was there, which is what I\'ll keep in mind when giving score to the story. Anyway, the girl is rescued by a some dude that seems like he is a brother of Haku from Spirited Away (you remember Haku, right? That River Spirit dude?). He\'s not actually Haku\'s brother, of course, but he\'s no less supernatural than that guy. The dude - named Shun - tells our leading girl that he\'s from Agartha, whatever the fuck that word means. Moving on, the 2 bond a bit before the dude Shun inexplicably disappears! No wait, I take that back, the movie does explain that later. Anyway, Asuna is now saaaaad because another intimate acquaintance has left her. Yeah this is a Shinkai movie, alright.From this point on, the movie gradually picked up its pace quite a bit. A new character is introduced, which is Asuna\'s new widower teacher. Yeah, he\'s a widower, the story will get into that plot later, but for this arc, he is the Captain Exposition for the oblivious Asuna. Basically, there is a myth involving resurrecting dead people if you travel to Agartha, which is deep, deep underground. And he is a widower, guess what he intends to do with that myth? Turns out Agartha is actually real when Shun\'s brother, his actual brother named Shin came to the surface to snatch the crystal he left behind. This new guy Shin also looks like Haku, btw, just sayin\'.Now from the second arc, I will let you discover the movie yourselves, as it turns into a fantasy adventure movie. But without spoiling anything, I must say I am intrigued by the mythology of this fantasy world. And I bet you will too, once you see what Agartha actually looks like, what creatures live in it, you\'ll wish this movie is gonna spawn a grand franchise, which regrettably will never happen. There are these deity creatures called ""Quetzal Coatl"" (did I write their name right?) with a fascinating back-story about how they came to be in this world. Then there is the Itzou, some kind of shadow demons that maintain the balance in Agartha, vulnerable to sunlight and water (wait, they are like... vampires???) and keep the Surface Dwellers away. But most fascinating of all, a giant flying Ark! A freaking flying Ark! That thing should catch your eyes the moment it comes on-screen, and not only that, it\'s gonna play an important part in the last arc, which I won\'t spoil here.One thing I would like to praise Shinkai is his ability to build tension and keep it going. There are so many scenes in this movie, especially in the 2nd arc that I was on the edge of my seat worrying that this girl Asuna might not make it out alive. I mean goddamn, this is what an adventure movie should feel like, it\'s about putting your life on the brink of death and escaping through a hair\'s length. It\'s like watching The Adventure of Tintin, but with a vulnerable, defenseless protagonist. I mean, it feels breath-taking watching this girl and Shin escaping the Itzous by leaping across the colossal ruins in Agartha. There is another scene where Asuna is approached by those demons in their invisible forms, and it\'s so tense simply because it feels like an inescapable situation, almost like it was lifted straight out of a horror movie. Ah yes, horror, that\'s the genre you won\'t find much (if at all) in Western animation.And I\'m surprising myself by praising Shinkai for these merits. Before watching this movie, I was worrying that he could turn out to be a one-note hack who is good at nothing but sappy romance and he\'s gonna wear himself out the longer he keeps making them, like the recent Clint Eastwood movies. Well, as this movie shows, this guy has much more tricks up his sleeves to be reckoned with. I expect this guy to show more range in the future. Hell, he could tackle as many genres as Danny Boyle did and I would be still pleased (you know Danny Boyle, right? That guy that did a zombie movie, a kiddie movie, a hard scifi movie, a sappy drama movie, an inspirational survival movie and they were all good?).The movie has to get away from the action scenes at some points to return to its slower, dramatic parts. You will soon notice a running theme through many of these drama scenes. I\'m not gonna say it straight out what that theme is, but I will say that these scenes suggest their common morality in a very subtle way, unlike The Fountain (2005) - that movie pretty much hammered the message into your head. It\'s not heavy-handed, that\'s my point. The story also spends some length to flashback to Asuna\'s and the teacher\'s past. These scenes are quite touching, it may get you teared up a bit when you see how Morisaki (that\'s the teacher) became a widower.Now for the ending, it\'s appropriately climatic, and it\'s climatic without a lot of action goiing, the conflict between the characters is enough to carry the climax. And the solution to the climax, I love it. Knowing Shinkai, I was actually expecting it to go in a much sadder way. Without spoling too much, I will say this is actually a much happier ending than his previous movies. I walked out all of his 3 previous movie feeling sad, and was surprised by this ending. It\'s not totally optimistic, I mean, come on, a widower wants his waifu back, you know where this is going. But hey, considering Shinkai\'s track record, this is as optimistic as his movie can get.Quick note: There is notably less romance in this movie by Shinkai\'s standard, not that I\'m complaining, \'cause he sure made up for that with so much more goodness.For a good story, I like to squeeze all its flaws into one paragraph to keep the tone of the review generally positive. Yes this movie has flaws, I\'m not turning a blind eye to them just because the movie is so good already. First thing is the plot holes. Notice the plural word, I counted 3 plot holes and I\'ll make it short. #1: the monster appearance never got explained; #2: The town guards intend to drive the Surface Dwellers away (Asuna and Morisaki) but after fighting Shin, they stopped chasing those 2, as if forgetting their objectives; #3: During night time, the river tide in this movie is low, that’s backward from how river tide actually regulates. The second flaw is the whole half-baked Arch Angel black-ops sub plot, which thankfully didn\'t overstay its welcome to detract too much from the movie. That\'s pretty much it.This is an oddball in Shinkai\'s filmography, a lot of his signature elements took a back seat here, and that should be a warning to any of his fans not willing to adapt. Me? I love movie directors not because they can only do one thing right, I love them for doing MANY things right. And goddamn did this movie got so many things right that I tolerated its few flaws and even tolerated the fact that it was more optimistic than I expected (wait, is that a bad thing to begin with?). A rock solid 9/10 for the story should do the justice.Visual:Shinkai took a back seat for the character design of this movie and give more leeway to his character designer Takayo Nishimura. While Nishimura also worked on 5cm/s, this guy also did Konnichiwa Anne, which is obviously where he did the homework for the character design in this movie. The first Anne series  - Akage no Anne - was done by 2 Ghibli veterans: Isao Takahata and Yoshifumi Kondou. There you have it - the origin of this movie’s art style. And I’m glad that Shinkai is giving Nishimura more creativity control. Why? Here is the problem I\'ve always had with Makoto Shinkai: this guy can\'t design characters. If you go back and watch his previous movies, you\'ll notice how most of his characters look bland, uninspiring and at times, rough around the edges. I thought he just cloned his own characters across those movies to spend more work on the background and the CGI (which we\'ll get into later). Now with this movie, the characters do look more distinctive, or at least enough so that you don\'t mix up Asuna with her school friends. And they are more expressive in this movie too - one thing you can\'t say about Shinkai\'s previous movies. By Ghibli standards though, Shin and Shun look a bit generic and could easily be replaced by the prince from Tales From Earthsea and, as I\'ve mentioned, Haku from Spirited Away. But well, in the end, this is a good improvement in the character design for a Shinkai movie.Now for the main dish: The background. HOLY HOT DAMN is Shinkai on the top of his game for this movie. I mean, this is his talent, this is what he excels at beside sappy romance. The scenery, from the rural town to Agartha looks jaw-dropping, and consistently so. Just by looking at the meadow in Agartha, you would wish the movie would hang for a moment and ponder on that scene so you can admire it some more. This guy draws background so great and detailed that even the wood planks on the floor looks great (I\'m not even kidding). And that\'s just the wood planks, wait until you see the night sky. Wooo *shiver*Another thing to admire here is the lighting and shadow effects. Whenever a clavis crystal starts activating whatever magic it has, the whole screen is filled with eye-candy. Even when it doesn’t act up and only emits some dim light, it still grips your eyes looking at how the light from the crystal shine on the surrounding object. Then every now and then there are some light sources that just look so mesmerizing, like there is some flicker from the sun, or some unknown light from afar that catches your eyes so easily because this guy makes the whole screen pretty just from that. The shadow effect blends itself seamlessly into every scenes of the movie. Shinkai drew shadow not only to the characters, but to the smallest objects like the birds or down to the flower petals, so when there is high sun light and some flower petals floating around , they created some great god ray effects. And was it hand-drawn or CGI? I can’t tell, and this is why I love how this guy handles CGI: blend the CGI into the hand-drawn segments, instead of calling attention to the CGI itself.Talking about CGI, there are several panning shots in here using a combination of hand-drawn and CGI that took me out of my seat. The most notable one must be the fight scene between Shin and the town guard. You can tell Shinkai has a great sense of cinematography just from this panning shot alone, as it pans around the 2 fighters while they are doing complex choreography, the background and the foreground constantly changing, and the 2 of them kept on fighting while the viewpoint upon them changes every second. So many animators would sweat a bucket when they see these panning shots, as they require incredibly smooth hand-drawn animation, a sharp sense of space and movement and seamless synchronization with the CGI background. Yet this guy pulled it off like those challenges were never a problem with him to begin with. So my hat off to him, and I reward this movie a perfect 10/10 for the visual.Sound:Let’s just get this out of the way: Yes, Tenmon’s score is freaking phenomenom, alright? There you go, this Tenmon guy is becoming Hans Zimmer or Clint Mansell or something. I guess I’ll have to keep a second eye on this guy.I did praised Shinkai’s sharp sense of space just now, right? Well, guess what? He also applied that to his sound effects. A common trait I found in his movie is the clear distinction between sound effects from different distances. A slightest shift in distance will make a difference in the volume of the sound. This results in a great surround experience, if you can manage it, go watch this movie with a great audio system to get the most out of it. For a hand-drawn animated movie, this requires much more work than a fully CGI movie, and most anime won’t even bother with this aspect, they just play the sound effects like they all came from a flat board. So hey, many people won’t even give Shinkai credits for the sound design, so I’m doing it. What else to say about the sound effects here… oh yes, the variety! This guy did the sound effects to the smallest objects, just like he did with the background, so what you have is an array of sound effects ranging from a drop of water in the kitchen sink to helicopter’s machine gun to the moaning of the Itzou to a simple touch of a chopstick to the bowl. Once again, my hat off to the attention to detail of this movie.Not much to say about the voice acting, they all give a fine performance here. Another perfect 10/10 to the sound department.Conclusion:Are you watching this, Pixar? Are you fucking watching this? This is what Makoto Shinkai was doing while you were so obsessed with making Cars 2. I mean freaking hell, Cars 2’s awfulness has caused a stagnation in Western animation  in 2011, Oscar pick for Best Animated Feature seems hard this year. But I can tell, you put all of the contenders next to this movie (Rango, Winnie The Pooh and Arthur Christmas are my best guess) and they will all be pale in comparison. Of course Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is not gonna participate in the Oscars, but then who needs their approval? Shinkai doesn’t need an Oscar to prove his worth, he earned every right to spit on that Pixar movie and be fucking proud of it. This movie, honestly, has blown out my anticipation of Brave. Even though I enjoyed it in a different way from 5cm/s, there is no reason to brush it off as if it’s a bad thing. Yeah sure, it’s not a modern masterpiece like 5cm/s but this movie is still exciting,  thrilling, has plenty of heart to spend, occasionally touching, beautifully animated and fantastically scored. By the standards of a Western movie, this movie scores an excellent 9/10, and from my viewpoint, that’s exactly what I’m gonna give it, a 9/10. a slow introduction to the leading girl - Asuna - living in a rural town. It\'s relaxing enough for me to start hoping that this Shinkai guy would finally make a movie with an optimistic tone for once.

But well, in the end, this is a good improvement in the character design for a Shinkai movie.Now for the main dish: The background. HOLY HOT DAMN is Shinkai on the top of his game for this movie. I mean, this is his talent, this is what he excels at beside sappy romance. The scenery, from the rural town to Agartha looks jaw-dropping, and consistently so. Just by looking at the meadow in Agartha, you would wish the movie would hang for a moment and ponder on that scene so you can admire it some more. This guy draws background so great and detailed that even the wood planks on the floor looks great (I\'m not even kidding). And that\'s just the wood planks, wait until you see the night sky. Wooo *shiver*Another thing to admire here is the lighting and shadow effects. Whenever a clavis crystal starts activating whatever magic it has, the whole screen is filled with eye-candy. Even when it doesn’t act up and only emits some dim light, it still grips your eyes looking at how the light from the crystal shine on the surrounding object. Then every now and then there are some light sources that just look so mesmerizing, like there is some flicker from the sun, or some unknown light from afar that catches your eyes so easily because this guy makes the whole screen pretty just from that. The shadow effect blends itself seamlessly into every scenes of the movie. Shinkai drew shadow not only to the characters, but to the smallest objects like the birds or down to the flower petals, so when there is high sun light and some flower petals floating around , they created some great god ray effects. And was it hand-drawn or CGI? I can’t tell, and this is why I love how this guy handles CGI: blend the CGI into the hand-drawn segments, instead of calling attention to the CGI itself.Talking about CGI, there are several panning shots in here using a combination of hand-drawn and CGI that took me out of my seat. The most notable one must be the fight scene between Shin and the town guard. You can tell Shinkai has a great sense of cinematography just from this panning shot alone, as it pans around the 2 fighters while they are doing complex choreography, the background and the foreground constantly changing, and the 2 of them kept on fighting while the viewpoint upon them changes every second. So many animators would sweat a bucket when they see these panning shots, as they require incredibly smooth hand-drawn animation, a sharp sense of space and movement and seamless synchronization with the CGI background. Yet this guy pulled it off like those challenges were never a problem with him to begin with. So my hat off to him, and I reward this movie a perfect 10/10 for the visual.Sound:Let’s just get this out of the way: Yes, Tenmon’s score is freaking phenomenom, alright? There you go, this Tenmon guy is becoming Hans Zimmer or Clint Mansell or something. I guess I’ll have to keep a second eye on this guy.I did praised Shinkai’s sharp sense of space just now, right? Well, guess what? He also applied that to his sound effects. A common trait I found in his movie is the clear distinction between sound effects from different distances. A slightest shift in distance will make a difference in the volume of the sound. This results in a great surround experience, if you can manage it, go watch this movie with a great audio system to get the most out of it. For a hand-drawn animated movie, this requires much more work than a fully CGI movie, and most anime won’t even bother with this aspect, they just play the sound effects like they all came from a flat board. So hey, many people won’t even give Shinkai credits for the sound design, so I’m doing it. What else to say about the sound effects here… oh yes, the variety! This guy did the sound effects to the smallest objects, just like he did with the background, so what you have is an array of sound effects ranging from a drop of water in the kitchen sink to helicopter’s machine gun to the moaning of the Itzou to a simple touch of a chopstick to the bowl. Once again, my hat off to the attention to detail of this movie.Not much to say about the voice acting, they all give a fine performance here. Another perfect 10/10 to the sound department.Conclusion:Are you watching this, Pixar? Are you fucking watching this? This is what Makoto Shinkai was doing while you were so obsessed with making Cars 2. I mean freaking hell, Cars 2’s awfulness has caused a stagnation in Western animation  in 2011, Oscar pick for Best Animated Feature seems hard this year. But I can tell, you put all of the contenders next to this movie (Rango, Winnie The Pooh and Arthur Christmas are my best guess) and they will all be pale in comparison. Of course Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is not gonna participate in the Oscars, but then who needs their approval? Shinkai doesn’t need an Oscar to prove his worth, he earned every right to spit on that Pixar movie and be fucking proud of it. This movie, honestly, has blown out my anticipation of Brave. Even though I enjoyed it in a different way from 5cm/s, there is no reason to brush it off as if it’s a bad thing. Yeah sure, it’s not a modern masterpiece like 5cm/s but this movie is still exciting,  thrilling, has plenty of heart to spend, occasionally touching, beautifully animated and fantastically scored. By the standards of a Western movie, this movie scores an excellent 9/10, and from my viewpoint, that’s exactly what I’m gonna give it, a 9/10.', 'Alright. I hate this anime and here\'s why. This review will be spoiler free. Not that there\'s anything worth spoiling.Story 1/10The story, if you can call it that, can be described as a sequence of random events that have little or sometimes nothing to do with each other. The start of the movie is slow, which I thought was for world building and helping to build up to something great, but it was just boring and preceded hot garbage.If you do decide to watch this show, I want you to count how many times you ask yourself how or why something happens and tell...me the count because it is a horrifyingly high number. The ""plot"" was confusing, boring, and challenging to watch.Art 6/10The art was fine. There were parts of the movie that were quite beautiful and there were a few parts that were laughably terrible.Music 5/10I would rate the music lower, but there were some good tracks and moments where I enjoyed the music, and I would rate the music higher, but there were also bad tracks and multiple times where the music was straight up annoying. For example, the end theme was meme level bad. I\'ll leave the interpretation of that to your imagination.Characters 1/10The characters in this anime are extremely boring. Mimi was the only character I liked, but I mean, it\'s hard to mess up the cute animal character. Trust me they managed to do so though anyway. There isn\'t much else to say cause there isn\'t much to them.Enjoyment 1/10I didn\'t get a minute of enjoyment from this movie. The first half of the movie was spent hoping that it would get better, and the second half of the movie was spent waiting for it to be over and hoping they don\'t mess up anything else in the remainder of the movie. If you start feeling that way, don\'t get your hopes up. Every scene in this movie is a mistake.All this being said, I have to give this movie a 1/10. I have only given 3 1/10\'s in the 500+ anime I\'ve seen, so I don\'t give them out lightly. The adventure is almost pointless. You\'ll see what I mean if you watch. The romance is terrible. It could be the worst part of the movie aside from its incomprehensibility. The fantasy was alright. Certainly not worth dealing with the rest of the movie, but there were some interesting creatures. Instead of getting lost in this anime\'s world and being mesmerized by the magic of the fantasy, I was questioning why the fantastical things were happening to my dismay. Now, am I saying this anime is for no one? Not at all. The theme of this anime is centred around life and death. I love themes centred around life and death, but this movie executes them very poorly. There are a lot of deaths and birthing metaphors shoehorned into the movie simply due to the theme of the movie. In conclusion, I can\'t say everyone will feel the same way about the movie, 2 of the guys I watched it with rather enjoyed it, but I certainly can\'t recommend it to anyone either. me the count because it is a horrifyingly high number.

Watching other Shinkai’s movies, I realized that his story usually lacks something that made an impact for me, except Your Name of course. This movie still had this problem for me, but I think the execution was slightly better. There was a surprising amount of blood and violence in this one. The creatures also looked scarier than in his other films. Also the story itself was bleaker than usual, which I think made for a bigger impact.The problem with this story was about the main girl. I understood the loneliness that she had, and how she felt a...quick connection with Shun (not Shin). However, I think there should have been more time between them because the story seemed to be about how she had to move on from Shun. This made her relationship with Shin a bit confusing because I don’t know how they feel about each other. Also, the story with the husband was actually pretty solid, and one that I would remember more.Overall, it’s much better than I anticipated, although there’s still problems. 7.5/10 quick connection with Shun (not Shin).

The art style is captivating, especially with the use of light and shadows throughout. It's a beautifully fantastical world with so many twists. Watching the characters grow as they interact with each other is really great. Overall I did enjoy watching it.But there are so many scenes where I felt like I had to physically stop the film just to comprehend what the heck is happening. Just rattling off there's a scene where a little adorable cat is eaten by a creature in a really gorgeous and...tear jerking way, the main characters get eaten, there's a giant hole in the middle of the earth, multiple people die like multiple times like it's nothing, and that's just the tip of this very confusing ice berg. By far the most confusing is the adult dude (I forget his name) because I don't what his deal is. The whole movie is really just trying to figure out if he's a good protective figure to the others or a creepy adult that needs to be kept 50 feet from the nearest school.Basically no matter what you're going into this movie blind. At no point did I know what was going to happen next but by the end I was satisfied where I ended up. If you like more mythical films like the Cat Returns, Tales of Earthsea, etc you're probably gonna enjoy this film. tear jerking way, the main characters get eaten, there's a giant hole in the middle of the earth, multiple people die like multiple times like it's nothing, and that's just the tip of this very confusing ice berg.

I sensed the mood of Ghibli Studio's, Your Name and Evangelion, but it was not as successful as they were. The plot was good, if it had been handled better, it could have been a great anime movie. The setting and character drawings were beautiful. I didn't like their music at all, I don't even think there's any decent music in it. As a result, I think it is a waste of time and I do not recommend it to anyone. "", ""So it has been quite sometime since I've did a review so bear with me ^^; Its as ofv now 12:29am as I'm typing this lol and I've just finished rewatching this amazing film a fifth time, let's get this done!If you are familiar with Shinkai Makoto's work, Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo shares many elements common to his previous films. His tendency to use comparatively flat characters set in a stunningly rendered world; a story about the ephemeral connections between humans; and a gentle, non-invasive, soundtrack are all well represented here. The level of polish in this film seems evident of Shinkai's maturing talent as...a story-teller in the medium of animation, and reminds me of some of the best works from Ghibli.In particular, I was encouraged that in comparison to his last two films (Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Bashou and Byousoku 5 Centimeter), Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo does not rely on narration as a means of expressing the thoughts and feelings of his protagonists. As much as I enjoyed those films, it is difficult in the best of circumstances to properly translate feelings into one language. Their re-translation into english left me thinking that I was listening to particularly emo livejournal entries at times. The only place I felt this failed him was in establishing the depth of the relationship between Asuna and Morisaki.I won't be providing a synopsis. I am a firm believer that the story is far less important than how it is told. I will say that in contrast to what I expected, this is very much in the genre of adventure movies.  The themes of love and loss are still present, but their emphasis in the film overall was far more subtle than I had anticipated. While I think that it made the film more entertaining than his previous works, I must admit that upon reaching the end of Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo I did not feel the emotional rawness that Shinkai's previous works have left me with, and I find that I miss it but overall I really recommend it! a story-teller in the medium of animation, and reminds me of some of the best works from Ghibli.In particular, I was encouraged that in comparison to his last two films (Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Bashou and Byousoku 5 Centimeter), Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo does not rely on narration as a means of expressing the thoughts and feelings of his protagonists.

When I first saw Voices of a Distant Star in the early 2000s, I was amazed by how beautiful and touching it was, especially when considering that Shinkai initially did everything other than the music and female voice acting himself. The Place Promised and 5 Centimeters then showed growth for Shinkai as a director and displayed what he could do with a higher budget and more fleshed out staff. Fast-forward about a decade and I was blown away by Your Name when I saw it during its US theater run and it immediately became my #1 favorite...standalone anime movie. However, there were two big holes in my consumption of Shinkai’s work which I recently finally filled. The Garden of Words was a simple yet wonderful addition to Shinkai’s filmography, becoming my second favorite of his work. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about my feelings towards Children Who Chase Lost Voices.Before I watched Children Who Chase Lost Voices (Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo) I had pretty low expectations, but also had hope that it’d at least be a fun and pretty fantasy story. I’d heard many people describe this as being Shinkai’s attempt to create a Ghibli/Miyazaki-style movie and sadly that may have put an unfair bias in my head by the time I viewed it, especially since I’m kind of “over” my old love for Miyazaki’s work. But I did my best to go in with as open of a mind as I could and this movie still came out as my least favorite of Shinkai’s major works. Maybe even my least favorite of ALL of his works. I mean, at least his animated commercials are over quickly.But before I go too far here, let’s get into my category breakouts:-----Story - 4 out of 10-----What is there to say about the story? Well, I was rather bored throughout most of it. The setting is modern Japan maybe around the 1980s? There is also a fantasy world that is under the surface. A girl meets a boy from that world after encountering a fantastical beast and falls in love pretty quick. This eventually triggers a journey for her within the fantasy world below with her substitute teacher at her side. They meet some people and bad creatures along the way to reach a particular goal dealing with bringing the dead back to life. And that’s mostly it. It’s a rather basic story that is stretched out over a nearly 2-hour runtime and I could really feel it. The pacing of the story was mostly decent for what it was, but it didn’t have much momentum or feel like there was much meaning or feeling behind what was going on. Unlike Shinkai’s other work, I didn’t feel any personal weight behind the relationships between the characters or their feelings overall which is really odd. The theming and connection between scenes just felt off during the entire movie. There was also some integration with real-world history (such as Hitler) which felt very awkward. By the end I just didn’t care and there wasn’t any kind of payoff to tie everything together. I just couldn’t get into this.-----Art - 8 out of 10-----The main shining light of this movie. At least it was pretty overall. However, this is when the blatant similarities between this and Miyazaki films begins. The movie largely looks like it’s trying to emulate an older more classic style with its art and designs. I’ll get more into this in the “Characters” section, but most of the characters and creatures can be seen as nearly direct analogs to those in Miyazaki works. And while the art and animation is overall pretty, it honestly feels a little flat compared to Shinkai’s past work as well the works he seemed to have been inspired by.-----Sound - 5 out of 10-----For the most part, things just felt serviceable in the sound department. The voice acting was good overall and the music sounded alright. However, while the score sounded fine on its own, it also felt very intrusive at times. Whenever there was a big artistic shot of a landscape, a big epic booming yet generic-sounding section of the score would call out almost like a laugh track in a sitcom, like it was yelling at you saying, “Hey! This scenery is meant to be awe-inspiring! Be in awe!!” But unfortunately, it just didn’t have the desired effect with me. As mentioned in the “Art” section, while the visuals were pretty, they also felt a bit flat and I didn’t ever really feel that “awe” and the score seemed to try too hard to force the effect. While Tenmon’s music worked well for Shinkai’s previous movies, I felt like he was a bit over his head in scoring an epic tale and I’m kind of glad that Shinkai’s subsequent works used different people for the music.-----Characters - 5 out of 10-----In general the characters feel a bit empty. I rarely cared about them, although there were a few genuinely decent moments of emotional manipulation. But when it comes to the characters, this was the most obvious homage(?) to Miyazaki works. So here’s a quick rundown of characters from this movie as Miyazaki character analogs: Asuna was essentially a copy of Satsuki from Totoro with a touch of Nausicaa. Shun was business-casual Howl. Mimi was a total rip-off of Teto from Nausicaa. Pretty much all of the other creatures felt derivative in some way to things from Princess Mononoke. Shin was mostly a copy of Ashitaka from Princess Mononoke. And Morisaki-sensei was pretty much a combination of Jigen and Zenigata from Lupin III. I could probably draw more comparisons, but there are a few Miyazaki films that I haven’t watched, probably the most relevant being Castle in the Sky (I tried to watch it once but fell asleep, sorry). But yeah, while the characters had a few nice moments, they were very few and far between and drawing comparisons to Miyazaki characters is probably the most fun thing about them.-----Enjoyment - 6 out of 10-----So my personal enjoyment score (what I put on my actual anime list) ended up being a 6. I was originally going to give it a 7, but after thinking about it for a bit, that felt far too generous. Hell, even a 6 here feels a little generous. Again, while the visuals were rather pretty in general and there were some good moments, I was mostly bored throughout the movie. I didn’t get much of an emotional connection to the story or the characters and I really felt the time that I stent watching this movie. I still have some appreciation for what Shinkai did here and the fact that he tried something very different from his usual stuff, but it didn’t really stick the landing.-----Overall - 5 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----That brings me to the final overall score of a resounding “Meh.” While this is an interesting piece of work at times and it is indeed pretty (I’m really milking that aspect of this film), it just doesn’t make for much of a cohesive or interesting story overall and doesn’t have strong enough characters to carry it either. Again, I still appreciate this for being a piece with which Shinkai is trying something different and I think it helped him grow as an artist, but as an isolated work there just isn’t much here to love. It is easily my least favorite of his films and I am glad that he went back to something simpler and to his strengths when he made The Garden of Words. Maybe someone who is a bigger fan of Miyazaki works can appreciate this more, or maybe they would dislike it just as much because they’d see it as derivative? But if you’re a fan of Shinkai’s other works, I’d personally say this can be one that you skip unless you’re a completionist. standalone anime movie.

I didn’t get much of an emotional connection to the story or the characters and I really felt the time that I stent watching this movie. I still have some appreciation for what Shinkai did here and the fact that he tried something very different from his usual stuff, but it didn’t really stick the landing.-----Overall - 5 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----That brings me to the final overall score of a resounding “Meh.” While this is an interesting piece of work at times and it is indeed pretty (I’m really milking that aspect of this film), it just doesn’t make for much of a cohesive or interesting story overall and doesn’t have strong enough characters to carry it either. Again, I still appreciate this for being a piece with which Shinkai is trying something different and I think it helped him grow as an artist, but as an isolated work there just isn’t much here to love. It is easily my least favorite of his films and I am glad that he went back to something simpler and to his strengths when he made The Garden of Words. Maybe someone who is a bigger fan of Miyazaki works can appreciate this more, or maybe they would dislike it just as much because they’d see it as derivative? But if you’re a fan of Shinkai’s other works, I’d personally say this can be one that you skip unless you’re a completionist.', 'Well, Shinkai train mania wasn\'t very prominent in this.I have watched Hoshi no Koe, The Place Promised in Our Early Days, 5 centimeters per second, and this in row. And I felt this was probably the best.Story: 10I really felt the plot was great. It was fast paced. I felt that 5 centimeters made more of an impression on me because of the slower development though. After watching this, I realized Shinkai just does not like happy endings. There\'s no ""distance"" in the movie though, unlike his other works.Art: 10Shinkai lives up to his name. The animation was smooth, and the backgrounds were great. The...light reflecting off the swords in battle, the realistic water, all felt great. I did felt that 5 centimeters had better art, although that\'s probably just because it relates to the real world more and had a chance to really show detail. The animation was probably the best among Shinkai\'s works.Sound: 10Like this movie, I felt Tenmon was trying different elements as well. He departed from the usual piano scores, and a lot was based on more epic compositions. I don\'t know, maybe I didn\'t really like that, but it did fit the overall theme and setting of the film. I was kind of wavering between a 9 or a 10 for sound, but it was Tenmon so I gave it a 10. I hope that Shinkai-Tenmon partnership will be like Miyazaki-Hisaishi.Character: 9I gave this a 9 because the characters felt a bit overused. Sure, the villain wasn\'t cliché, but we have seen this kind of development a few times before. Asuna probably took a wrong turn at the Ghibli Studios and walked into this movie. However overused, they are still likable characters with realistic motives. A few characters could have been expanded a bit more, like the Ikozu, why her father had a Clavis, the Amaurot elder, and so on.Enjoyment: 10I suggest watching this at the highest possible resolution you can, because it is just that worth it.Overall: 10I am now an avid fan of Shinkai. I hope he can keep up this level of quality in his works and really surpass Miyazaki.This is my first review by the way, so... yea. light reflecting off the swords in battle, the realistic water, all felt great.

It will catch the viewers attention and incite them to go further through the story. It was fascinating at first. The way every details of it falls and gives more impact on how the story goes, how every information makes their way to be known to their audience is interesting. What I find lacking is its capability to sustain the kind of concept it started. No matter how...exciting a story was, the need to justify every bit of information that was shown to the viewer is very very important.The story takes place on a rural area focusing on a girl who has a hobby of searching for sounds on her self created equipment. One day, he met a guy who saved her life and that triggers her to start an adventure in a place known as Agartha. In real life, that place is said to be located in the deepest of earth and the only way to get there is through the North Pole, where there are civilization that is not known to us and a paradise can be experience. Well, not that I know if that is true. The concept of the story is interesting, the overall journey is thrilling. But yeah, the unanswered questions and loopholes will left you hanging.Characters: 8Asuna is a brilliant student with a hobby of climbing up mountains everyday to pick up sounds on her equipment. She is an independent one, in terms of houseworks and studies. She does things by herself and got suddenly attached by someone who saved her life. Along the story, it show how rash she can be with her decisions and just go with the flow. Thus, perfectly matches the age of her character. The other character that came along with her in the journey has much more conviction and purpose. He has a reason and will to stand against anything that will cross their way, just to have that thing he wanted the most and that is what makes him the best character for me. The thing about the other characters are the explanation on why they've done something in the first place. The lack of information makes them senseless and made their appearance just a part of something insignificant.Sound and Animation: 10The classical music at the start of the story is breathtaking. It was full of emotions and it feels like the scenario itself is inviting you on their world. It was so good to hear. With the voices of the characters matches their expressions, it was a great watch. Since this anime is an old one, the expectation on the animation is not too high. But the action scenes on it, the way it portrays the character, and the uniqueness of every other entities existing on the story is way too magnificent that you won't remember that this was created a long time ago.Enjoyment: 9Watching science fiction is life. It is great to see things that have even a slight chance of existing. It is great to think that somewhere, a different entity, species, place that we don't know of exist. I love the genre of the story and how their adventure take them to places they believe exists and see that they are correct.  Though there are some invalid actions and explanations, the whole adventure thing is cool and fun to watch.Ending: 8How the story ended is way too unrealistic even if the genre of the story itself is science fiction. Stories don't have a happy ending just because they want to. There are things that does not add up and that makes the ending too fairytale like. The one thing that caught my attention is the climax of the story which is unexpected, due to the fact that it comes out from something common. It will intrigue the viewer since they will think that they know and already predicted how the twist goes but it will fail them, and that is where the uniqueness came from. exciting a story was, the need to justify every bit of information that was shown to the viewer is very very important.The story takes place on a rural area focusing on a girl who has a hobby of searching for sounds on her self created equipment.

One of the qualities Makoto Shinkai\'s works is known for.Sound 9/10 - I wanted to give it a 10, everything was perfect, but the Ending Theme\'s singer pronouncing Hello as Hallo annoyed me. I was like ""dear Japanese people, you have the letter へ in your alphabet, you should have no problem pronouncing Hello.""Character 10/10 - Loved them. The old man could\'ve looked & sounded older, though.Story 6/10 - Watching this film made me feel sorry for Japanese people in general. They refuse to believe in the hereafter, yet still choose to fantasize about reuniting with the dead. If you are...a religious dude like me, you cannot help but feel this sentiment. Also, as far as I know, Japanese people have a bunch of different words for \'god\', \'angel\', \'ghost\', and \'jinn\' (e.g. they have \'kami\', \'tenshi\', \'yuurei\', \'youkai\', \'bourei\', etc.) but for some reason they always choose to only use the word \'kami\' to refer to all those different unseen entities. They mistake everything for \'kami\'. ""Sense to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away)"" also made this same \'mistake\'. Their theology has gotten messed up, it makes no sense if you look at the bigger picture of how their \'world\' supposed to work - be it the fictional realm in this film, be it Japanese people\'s actual traditional view about the actual world. No wonder religion has started losing place among their younger generation.Enjoyment 8/10 - Definitely enjoyed the art, the voice-acting, and the directing. Some scenes could\'ve been executed better, though ([Minor spoiler alert] e.g. the scene Shin came to save Asuna from Izokus, the timing was so off, I felt as though I was watching Dragon Ball for a moment, lol). And I personally found the ending a bit dissatisfying.Overall 8/10 - VERY good. Should YOU watch it? Kids will definitely enjoy animes like this. Adults like me who love to analyze successful director\'s past works will also enjoy this. If you are a teenager who hates semi-religious stuff, you\'ll probably hate this. a religious dude like me, you cannot help but feel this sentiment.

Rather our characters just have themselves a personal adventure and are done with it.The ending as well, while acceptable, leaves a bit wanting, as some details of it don't line up with what you would expect or hope for.All told still, I still was well enough entertained throughout and don't regret my time spent on it, and would recommend it to others. realistically become the hero.

His prior work, 5 Centimetres per Second, was superb. It was moving, it had a moral story. I could relate to it. I absolutely loved it.And this new work is going to have the same effect on me!...or so I thought.It certainly looked like Makoto Shinkai. It sounded like a Makoto Shinkai work. But it wasn\'t Makoto Shinkai. Let me explain.Art [10/10]: It can definitely be recognised from the art that it is a Makoto Shinkai film. The detailed depictions of the town and surroundings gave way to stunning vistas that reach far into the distance as I entered another world....The quality of the drawings was sustained throughout the film, and the art helped immerse me into the environment. If you like eye candy, you don\'t need to read any further in this review. Watch it now.Sound [10/10]: Tenmon\'s musical score once again complemented the art beautifully, blending in inconspicuously to further emphasize the mood of the world and the events that occur. The calm music gently moves to sharps and flats as intriguing and suspenseful aspects of the story were told. Silence was well used in appropriate places, and sound effects were used in varying degrees depending on the scene, to induce a sense of normality in the world as well as to raise suspense when it is needed.To enjoy the sound and art is enough reason to watch Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo. However, the character development and storyline would definitely leave you thinking ""so... what now?"" by the end of the film, detracting from the superb imagery that has become typical of Shinkai works.Story [3/10]: When watching the film, one can clearly distinguish the different direction that Shinkai took when creating the storyline; simply by recognising that the theme of \'distance\' is missing. Instead of a story about separation, time, distance, this focuses on memory and \'saying goodbye\'. And this deviation is one of the points where the problem stems from. Shinkai\'s expanding the genre of his anime by mixing other elements into it, and it\'s not working well.-Comparison with GhibliA girl gets in touch with another world, one different from the one she knows.She has a cat.There\'s monsters that serve to preserve the nature of the world.Sounds like a blend of Spirited Away, Kiki\'s Delivery Service and Princess Mononoke.Hey look! Even the theme of human pollution of the environment is there!Sounds like Ghibli.OK. Ghibli storylines are good, so that\'s not the problem. But this film tries to mix all these different aspects and themes into two hours, and this dilutes the message. I can\'t say that this film is about environmental conservation, even though messages about that are in there. I can\'t say that this film is about farewells either, even though messages about that are in there. There\'s a lack of focus or central theme.This is coupled with the lack of immersive features to convey suspense, grief, or other emotions that can be found in many Ghibli films. Sound was well executed, but anime techniques like vectors, shadows, camera angles and shots proved to be reinforcing Shinkai\'s trademark visuals rather than reinforce the story.Therefore, we can deduce this doesn\'t qualify as a \'Ghibli film\'.- Comparison with ShinkaiSo let us revert to the elements that made 5 Centimetres per Second so great. 5 Centimetres per Second focused on the lives of two people. We see their relationship develop then wither as the couple unsuccessfully tries to cling on emotionally to each other. Everything in the world was real and believable. The plot can actually occur in the real world, and this reality was essential in it becoming a ""tear-jerker"" film. We got to know the characters, and we got to see both sides of how they separate.Now apply this to Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo. Four central characters: Shun, Shin, Asuna, the Sensei. Asuna has met Shun for one day. There\'s no way they could be attached emotionally to one another. 10 minutes into the film we see a supernatural monster.This makes it not a \'Shinkai film\'. The seemingly random mix of Ghibli and Shinkai elements is the film\'s demise. There\'s a lack of a complication in the film, which in return leads to no resolution. By the end of the film, I thought ""so... what now?"". And I don\'t think Shinkai or Asuna know either. Ask Asuna herself (quote from film):Asuna: ""I\'m also going!""Morisaka sensei: ""Why?...""Asuna: ""Well... I don\'t know""Well, if she doesn\'t know what she\'s doing in the film, then nor do I.The lack of direction in the plot shines through in the scenes: the story does not cover both sides of the attempts to speak to \'the dead\' - we never see what Asuna says. And that\'s probably because, well, there\'s nothing to say. What is there to say to someone who you talked to for a day and will never meet again? However, Asuna\'s story is supposed to be the one we\'re following - since she is the first character introduced to us. The conclusion seems to be carelessly tacked on in order to finish the film.The plot of the film really doesn\'t allow the film to reach its full potential.Character [3/10]: The film is set up to be a classic Ghibli shoujo story - a young girl goes on an adventure, possibly to a different world, and gathers courage and friendship, changing along the way to reach a grand goal. So let us talk about Asuna (the shoujo) first.Asuna - Clearly, the Shinkai shoujo is supposed to be different from a Ghibli shoujo. In a Ghibli film, Shun\'s disappearance and Asuna\'s knowledge that she may see him again would be a catalyst for Asuna\'s determination, leading her on a grand adventure that helps her grow and realise her qualities - like a bildungsroman. However, Asuna clearly has no idea what she is doing - even after reaching another world. She even says so. Instead of holding leadership qualities, she follows her teacher until the end. She never grows. She never changes. She\'s dull and boring. Her reliance on others doesn\'t allow us to learn anything about her, and hence we\'re not attached to her in any way.Shun - He\'s heroic because he saves Asuna. And that\'s probably all we know about him, since he only appears for a few minutes at the start of the film, and for an even shorter timeframe at the end of the film. This is despite his status as one of the main characters in the plot.Shin - So he blindly follows orders from his village, he misses his brother, and he may be a bit attached to Asuna. But what are his qualities? We don\'t know. The film doesn\'t show us. It seems like he\'s just a plot device to get Asuna out of undesirable situations.Morisaki the teacher - conversely, we know about him the most. We have flashbacks of his backstory, we know where his motivation stems from, and we understand why he wants to achieve his goal no matter what the means. However, he\'s a minor character. He makes his introduction later in the film, when we have affixed the protagonist status onto Asuna and Shun. The storyboard design also followed Asuna instead of Morisaki in situations where they are separated.It seems like the film was originally centred on Morisaka, then bits were placed  at the beginning and end, and editing done, in order to make the film fit into the stereotypical Ghibli \'shoujo\' film.Conclusion:The film tries to blend elements of Ghibli, a successful animation studio, into the established Shinkai story. This in itself is not bad, but poor planning and execution leaves us with a seemingly half-hearted story without emotional impact, moral lessons or substantial themes.The art, however, is on par with if not exceeding Shinkai\'s other major works. The sound lets the world come alive.In short, it is still an enjoyable film, despite the lackluster plot and character development. Watch it for the art and the sound, but do not expect an engaging story. The quality of the drawings was sustained throughout the film, and the art helped immerse me into the environment.

And just pointing out, the summary on the main page is not consistent in the contents and isnt convincing enough for attracting more viewers to see the moie.Okay some thoughts on the movie overall:Story [7/10]: The story starts with a girl named Asuna who meets a boy named Shun. He comes from a distant land named Agartha (actually the underworld as its refered to as in the story- though a very beautiful one). He saved Asuna from one of the creatures which had surfaced from that land. They quickly become friends. But soon he disappers (dies)....After his disappearance Asuna come to learn about Agartha once again in her school during a lecture from a teacher. She investigates more by reading and also consults the teacher who mentioned about it in class.A series of quick events leads Asuna and the teacher to travel through Agartha. The rest of the story chronicles the experiences of Asuna and the teacher through the land and the purpose of their travel are revelaed. Its a fantasy story ofcourse so things outerworldly were expected. Just that the movie doesnt quiet elaborate on it smoothly. I mean there are gaps and sudden jumps so its a bit hard to sometimes digest why the characters are acting the way they are acting. But overall it wasnt as bad either. Concept of travel though underworld was interesting enough and could have been developed more. Maybe the manga will elaboarte more.Art [10/10]: I am giving this section a full 10 only for the breathtaking sceneries shown throughout the movie. The colours are soft and how to say maybe lucid. Yeah each landscape is like a masterpiece. The mountains, meadows, the skies in particular (I guess the director must really like looking at the sky- both daytime and night time) are just to grand and wonderful. The way the sunrays falling on the ground are pictured in every scene are too good. For the human figures- they were okay I guess. The way they were drawn reminded me of typical ghibli movie human figures. Creature of the underworld have been modelled mostly on different dinosaurs from what i could make out by watching. Other modern day animals were nicely drawn.Sound [7/10]: All voice actors have done excellent jobs and expressed emotions aptly. A bit disappointed in the music cause it was not too audible in the first place. Or maybe I have just missed it cause I was awestruck by the landscaping >.

However for me, the adventure-fantasy theme is what made me interested in seeing this film.  I know that this particular pair of genres aren't really that rare and there are plenty of other series that are way better than this but from my point of view, the story and plot is what makes it a bit unique from the rest. The title itself, Children Who Chase Lost Voices has a kind of drama feel and so I expected it to be somewhat covered in melancholy. Turns out that the...drama here, though untagged in most database, has a bittersweet taste and it feels like sorrow that you can accept. I loved the classic art style that this film has. It sort of gives you nostalgia from those older classic films and that is why throughout watching it, I felt like I have seen this before. The backgrounds are mesmerizing enough for it to pass as a work of art. The animation is very fluid and scene revolutions are well done. The music completes the image of every scene and compliments it beautifully. The ending theme did well too for it to be an acceptable ending. Since it's not much of a lengthy film, the attachment you make with the characters isn't so much and not all would be touched with the way the plot unfolds. I don't mind drama but I guess the film started off rough and confusing. I enjoyed this film but I think there should be a lot more to this than that. Though I'm satisfied with the conclusion, I didn't really get to grasp the main point. Not sure if I should recommend this to people who like these type of genres, but I recommend it very much to people who like to explore more. drama here, though untagged in most database, has a bittersweet taste and it feels like sorrow that you can accept.

He seems to be able to get a lot of human emotion from his characters, which very few people in anime are able to do, in slow moving films all within breathtaking animation. However, Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is not Makatos Shinkai's best work and has a little way to go before being considered a genius.The plot is Asun a 12 year old girl who is a perfect daughter and student but very much a loner. She spends her free time listening to her transistor radio powered y a special crystal on a rocky outcrop. One day...on her way home she is attacked by a monster only to be saved by Shun who tells her he his from Agartha deep below the earth and she should not meet him again. Ignoring him she goes to her rocky outcrop to see who she thinks is Shun but is his brother Shin looking for the crystal in Shin's radio. Attacked by helicopters and men with guns she is dragged to down to Agartha. One of the men with guns turns out to be her substitute teacher from school, Ryūji Morisaki, who is searching for Agartha so he can bring his wife back to life. Asun follows Ryuji and experiences adventures and danger on their journey.In some ways this film is about letting go someone you miss and moving on but it is not completely clear.In Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo I was left some what disappointed. I really struggled to get the emotion from the characters. In Makoto Shinkai films characters and their motivation normally shown through their emotions is everything. The only one I really felt it from was Asun's obsessive substitute teacher, Ryūji Morisaki, who can't let his dead wife go. It was explained why Asun was there was explained but I didn't get any feeling from her so I in no way felt much sympathy for her. The film showed her to be a loner and content with it. Shin seemed very much like Yōji Matsuda from Princess Mononoke and any personality traits got lost in the action sequences.Makoto Shinkai doesn't let us down with the art work or sound. They are still of the highest quality. The scenes of Agartha are stunning and the soundtrack fits the film perfectly.Another My Anime List review of this film says Makoto Shinkai should stop trying to be like Hayao Miyazaki and to be himself. This an extremely fair point as at times it has a Princess Mononoke feel.Despite the disappointment I felt and its flaws one thing is for sure Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo is still 10 times better than most anime out there. on her way home she is attacked by a monster only to be saved by Shun who tells her he his from Agartha deep below the earth and she should not meet him again.

Why? Why would he be called that? The compliment is effectively a result of Western media being incapable of discriminating wildly distinct filmmaking styles and its tendency to just label any breakaway success in Japanese animation as a competition to find the next Miyazaki.This sort of cartoonishly oversimplified heuristic thinking reminds me of a particular gag from The Big Bang Theory. If you’re unfamiliar, TBBT features an Indian (dots, not feathers) character, Raj, who has a crippling fear of...women, to the point that he literally becomes mute when in their presence. However, if he ingests alcohol, however little, he becomes very relaxed and able to speak freely. On one such occasion, when Raj is competing with another main character for the good graces of a woman they were both trying to seduce, he is troubled and at a disadvantage until he finds some alcohol. Once he has had a drink, he immediately starts to successfully flirt with the girl and develop great chemistry with her. To that, the guy he was in competition with bitterly remarks: “Do you believe him? Normally, around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him and he’s M. Night Charmalarmalan.”See, in spite of the show’s harsher critics, I’ve long defended it as not being the superficial mockery they purport it to be, and I’ve always been able to have a decent time with it and found it, dare I say, funny. It was this gag, however that changed things for me. It just hit me over this one joke. Why? Why is that funny? Why does that joke work? What do Raj and M. Night Shyamalan have in common to make that joke work? Is M. Night known for being a smooth talker? Is he known for being a ladies’ man? Is he known for being an alcoholic? No to all of the above? So, then the only connection is that they’re both Indian? That’s it? M. Night’s name was the only famous-enough Indian one you were reasonably sure your audience would recognize? That’s all there is to it? Yes. This dude is Indian and, uh, that guy is also Indian, so they’re like, uh, kind of the same, right? Sounds good enough to me. Run it!It's the same kind of cultural ignorance that Makoto Shinkai’s comparison to Hayao Miyazaki is borne of. They’re both Japanese and they both write and direct feature length animated films that make a lot of money. It comes down to nothing more than that. It’s as deep as a puddle. It would be the equivalent of calling every single Hollywood director who makes a moderately successful movie “the next Kubrick” or “the next Coppola”.That being said, to Shinkai’s credit, he’s seemingly always tried to distance himself from the Miyazaki comparison. It’s easy to find interviews in which he states that he not only is no Miyazaki, but that it’s foolish to try and copy him. He has stated in an interview that while Castle in the Sky was the first movie he paid to see at the cinema, and that he’s both a fan and admirer of Miyazaki-sensei, his style has always been pointedly different and not really comparable at all. Just in case we’re keeping track, he is indeed correct in saying that.Which then begs the question, why did he renege on all of that and make a Miyazaki rip-off? I mean, Children Who Chase Lost Voices is still arguably a Shinkai film at the end of the day, seeing as trains and shots of feet have made it into this movie, as well, but his signature identity is so faint, it’s nothing more than window dressing for an off-brand Miyazaki creation. The amount of direct references to Miyazaki’s work, both in the visuals and narrative, reaches an extent that greatly exceeds tribute and enters the realm of plagiarism, but with very little understanding of what to do with the elements it plagiarizes. We have Asuna, our archetypal Ghibli girl protagonist à la Chihiro, who we learn is generically kind, hardworking, curious, and adventurous, as all Ghibli girls are. That’s it. That’s her entire character description and development for the whole movie. She then meets, Shun, her classic mysterious and handsome Ghibli boy, à la Haku or Howl, whose entire point in the story is to be handsome and mysterious. We also learn she has a cute animal pet as a mascot à la Kiki’s Delivery Service, because of course she does. She also has a magic glowing rock à la Castle in the Sky. Then we have the dumb bad guys in uniform representing state violence à la Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Then we have the weirdly unnerving supernatural creatures à la Princess Mononoke. And then we have the aforementioned bad guys in uniforms senselessly destroying that which they do not understand and cannot value à la… basically all of the above. It’s virtually impossible to even enumerate all the little animations and facial expressions which are lifted straight from Ghibli films.However, just because you have access to all the same ingredients as Gordon Ramsey and all the same tools as Gordon Ramsey, son, that don’t make you Gordon Ramsey. The whole thing feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of Hayao-sensei’s work. Sure, Miyazaki films can be quite dark and violent for the standards of family entertainment, but they don’t exactly contain huge blood splatters from some dude chopping monsters in half with his sword, and the dudes with modern military gear and weaponry and helicopters clashed so badly with the film’s fantasy aesthetic, it just took me out of the experience entirely. To be clear, I believe the aesthetic clash was intended, but that does not obviate the calamitous effect it had. I may be harping on the Ghibli comparison a lot, but I feel it is incredibly misguided to wholesale copy the style of a man literally regarded as a god in the domain of animation.As an adult, I would posit that it’s entirely possible to have a decent time with the movie. For one thing, the background art and a lot of the visuals are breath-takingly beautiful, and for another, there’s really nothing offensively bad in it. I didn’t hate it. It just did not speak to me – at all.The closest thing I can liken it to is Tales of Earthsea. That movie was written and directed by Gorou Miyazaki, Hayao-sensei’s son. It is Ghibli’s worst rated film, but I wholeheartedly disagree with that consensus. It’s just as long and similarly slow, but Tales of Earthsea is a Ghibli film made by someone who understands the essence of Hayao-sensei’s work and decided to take it a different direction. Children Who Chase Lost Voices is a Ghibli film gone wrong made by someone who does not understand the essence of Hayao-sensei’s work, but attempts to imitate it anyway.All of that is to say that if you’re in the camp that hated Tales of Earthsea, you’ll hate this even more.Still, the film was a critical and commercial success, even if it doesn’t come up often when people talk about Shinkai-sensei’s work, so maybe you’ll see in it the same entertainment value that so many of his fans clearly did. women, to the point that he literally becomes mute when in their presence.

For me this really lacked the heavy interpersonal focus and emotional impact that his other films like 5 Centimeters Per Second, The Garden of Words and Your Name had.This was, as usual for this director, visually lovely and very colorful, and it's a creative fantasy adventure, but overall I just wasn't all that entertained.

It\'s really good.', ""Whenever Makoto Shinkai is brought up in discussion you’ll always hear at least one person accusing him of being a one trick pony. After only three features and still so early in his career I think that is a very unfair view to have of the man. Even if you do accept this opinion of his work to date, being a one trick pony is not in of itself a bad thing. So long as you’re making amazing works of creativity it doesn’t matter. And make amazing works of creativity is exactly what he has been doing.From watching the trailer to Children who Chase Lost...Voices I knew going into this movie that it would be a departure from his previous works. It was only after I’d seen the movie that I realised how much of a departure it was. So much so that if I’d seen this movie not knowing Shinkai directed it I wouldn’t have known it was one of his movies at all. Just as I look for the Miyazaki signature in his movies so did I look for Shinkai’s signature here, and it was a struggle to find it. I can’t help but think that this movie was less a natural creative process for him and more a response to the naysayers who think he can’t do anything else. Artists should produce work based on what naturally comes to them, not what comes about as a result of pandering to critics.This movie feels so desperately like he wanted to show critics that he could do more than romance stories, and this concern with wanting to try something new was unfortunately to the detriment of the movie as a whole. I feel it’s quite sad that Shinkai felt he needed to make such a drastic change to his style when making this movie. As someone who is an avid fan of his works it pains me so much to say this but, this movie has problems and as a result I’m quite critical of it. I’ve always maintained the personal policy that to be fan of something, anything at all is to not be an apologist, to recognise and accept when something you like is waning. To put this movie on par with Shinkai’s first three features would be disservice.I do wish to say out right that while I did enjoy this movie I would put it last if I were to rank his works to date. Also at the screening of the movie I actually had the honour of meeting Shinkai himself. I had a brief chat through an interpreter, got a signed poster and was glad to meet such a great artist and personable individual. I feel that this should be kept in mind while reading what I thought of it, and that even the excitement of briefly meeting the man whose works I’ve thoroughly enjoyed didn’t do anything to effect my objectivity nor stop me from noticing the flaws within this movie.I’ve no problem with a director trying something new but it shouldn’t be at the expense of what makes them great at what they do, this should be true of all artists. For example I’m not sure why he felt the need to change his signature character designs and animation style and the musical pieces weren’t as instantly memorable as the others from Voices or 5 Centimetres. Ghibli movies manage to maintain signature character designs and music while trying all kinds of different stories. Shinkai didn’t need to change that aspect of his film making while working on this movie. If it were just cosmetic changes that would ok but its so much more.What really matters and what it always comes down to is plot and characters. To sum up it plainly, this movie lacks focus. One thing I’ve always liked about Shinkai is his minimalist approach to story telling. You can still tell a different type of story while maintaining a minimalist style. While this style is somewhat present in the first act it disappears soon afterward. The unfortunate result is a movie that doesn’t know whose story it’s supposed to be. And with some minor rewrites there are characters and respective plot points that are simply not needed. The most glaring example of this is the brothers Shin and Shun, there’s no reason at all why these two characters couldn’t have been the one person. It completely breaks the follow of a movie when you have two characters filling what is essentially the one role in separate halves of a movie.In Shinkai’s pervious works he has managed to convey beautiful stories with small casts, each character had a purpose and it worked. As part of the new direction for this movie he decided expand to a larger cast of characters. The problem is the most of these characters either serve no real purpose in furthering the plot or appear so briefly that you wonder why they were included at all. Like apparently Shun and Shin have a sister named Seri, who was included in a scene for some reason. Another example would be Asuna's mother, instead of being the background parent like is generally case and what works for these types stories, the point was made to focus on the fact that she is a nurse who works lots of hours.There are also some plot decisions that didn’t really make any sense. About halfway through the movie Asuna gets captured by these shadow creatures. As it turns out they wanted to kill her. Ok, so why the elaborate kidnapping scene, why bring her to another location and wait for her to wake up if killing her was the end goal. Then we have Mimi, a cute little cat who accompanies Asuna on her adventure. Instead of keeping Mimi as a simple companion like Teto in Nausicaa, Shinkai decided to include a plot point involving the cat that was completely unnecessary.As I mentioned before the movie seems to have a hard time deciding whose story it’s supposed to be. At first you would assume it’s Asuna’s story as the whole first act is setting her up to be so. Then in the second act we get this guy Morisaki who is travelling with Asuna to Agartha to find a way to reunite with his wife, when his story began to dominate the movie I began to wonder why Asuna was even on this adventure first place.Depending on the kind of anime fan you are, there is potential to question the appropriateness these two characters travelling alone together given their age. It probably wouldn’t be so obvious if it weren’t for a slightly creepy scene at the conclusion of Morisaki’s quest. Given the kind of stories that can be found in anime I’m willing to bet that there are people that either didn’t question this or didn’t even notice it. But the very existence of the Morisaki character brings us back to my original point of Shinkai’s telling good stories with small casts. This movie really should have simply been Asuna travelling with Mimi and Shin across Agartha, and that would have worked. No brother Shun and no Morisaki and his wife storyline. The movie would have worked so much better and would have complimented Shinkai’s style had the script been written to not include either of these characters. It would have attained the focus the movie so desperately needed.Unfortunately Children who Chase Lost Voices was just too ambitious in scope for the kind of storyteller Shinkai is and ultimately it doesn’t hang together. As I said before it pains me to be so critical of this movie because I’m such a fan of his previous works. And even though it’s the wrong approach to take when trying to be impartial about a movie, I went into the screening of this movie really wanting to like it. Part of being fan is to recognise when your favourite works are missing mark and to not be afraid to admit it when it does. Be it anime, movies, TV, music or video games. Sometimes they’ll create great works and sometimes they won’t, and sometimes they’ll never return to when they were at their best. It’s just the way things go.To end on a positive note I do think Children who Chase Lost Voices is worth your time and I will definitely buy it at some point, and maybe my opinion of the movie will improve after a second viewing. Here’s hoping Shinkai’s next work will be a return to form for this amazing director. Voices I knew going into this movie that it would be a departure from his previous works. It was only after I’d seen the movie that I realised how much of a departure it was. So much so that if I’d seen this movie not knowing Shinkai directed it I wouldn’t have known it was one of his movies at all. Just as I look for the Miyazaki signature in his movies so did I look for Shinkai’s signature here, and it was a struggle to find it. I can’t help but think that this movie was less a natural creative process for him and more a response to the naysayers who think he can’t do anything else. Artists should produce work based on what naturally comes to them, not what comes about as a result of pandering to critics.This movie feels so desperately like he wanted to show critics that he could do more than romance stories, and this concern with wanting to try something new was unfortunately to the detriment of the movie as a whole. I feel it’s quite sad that Shinkai felt he needed to make such a drastic change to his style when making this movie. As someone who is an avid fan of his works it pains me so much to say this but, this movie has problems and as a result I’m quite critical of it. I’ve always maintained the personal policy that to be fan of something, anything at all is to not be an apologist, to recognise and accept when something you like is waning. To put this movie on par with Shinkai’s first three features would be disservice.I do wish to say out right that while I did enjoy this movie I would put it last if I were to rank his works to date. Also at the screening of the movie I actually had the honour of meeting Shinkai himself. I had a brief chat through an interpreter, got a signed poster and was glad to meet such a great artist and personable individual. I feel that this should be kept in mind while reading what I thought of it, and that even the excitement of briefly meeting the man whose works I’ve thoroughly enjoyed didn’t do anything to effect my objectivity nor stop me from noticing the flaws within this movie.I’ve no problem with a director trying something new but it shouldn’t be at the expense of what makes them great at what they do, this should be true of all artists.

It was beautifully animated and the music fit it perfectly (I really loved the main theme「Hello, Good Bye, and Hello」). Like all Shinkai films, it makes you really appreciate how beautiful the artwork is, but at the same time, you wonder who hurt him in order to produce so many films with either lost or broken love in them. This film also made you think about life and death, as well as human morality. All in all, a good film, but just not one of...my favourites. my favourites."", ""Its a good movie, but not great. It has pacing issues, and wouldn't suffer from an extra half hour of footage. The only real problem that I have is that Asuna falls for Shun/Shin in almost no time, again its a pacing issue. Other than that, it was a great movie, not quite on par with Spirited Away, its close relative, but satisfying and entertaining nonetheless. Interesting plot, mythology, enemies, and a good feeling that this is exactly what I would do in Asuna's place, in that things are in motion way beyond her level of understanding and she is merely whisked along, doing what...she believes to be right all the way.Overall, its two hours that is worth your time she believes to be right all the way.Overall, its two hours that is worth your time"", ""Makoto Shinkai is the new kid on the block when concerning hip new animation. Having made introspective films like the 5 centimetres per second and the somewhat confusing but equally well animated 'The Place promised in our early days', its fair to say that Shinkai is becoming a great animator in his own right.'The children who chase lost voices from deep below' however is probably going to sit alongside 'the place promised in our early days' for great animation but an ultimately, frustrating story.The film's premise and overall tone is loss and dealing with loss. The recurring motif of people's desperation to find new...space to fill the void of the lost one is good but the character dialogue lets it down. This is actually a common criticism of most of Shinkai's works. He does best when focusing on a few characters taking out supernatural elements that do nothing but trivialize the notion of loss to begin with. The exposition heavy writing also defeats the purpose of a film to show instead of telling.That doesn't mean I don't want comic relief or some light heart to offset the tone but the jarring contrast in this case is the archetypal grizzled man's heart is cracked by a naive girl's views. That isn't a bad genre trait but here it does nothing to actually advance the plot.Couple that with some dry exposition to reveal character motivations and you have a somewhat flimsy plot to justify exploring a pretty cool place. Sadly the supernatural world they visit is heavily Miyazaki inspired. Scarily so. Although no one animates a shadow or grass as good as Shinkai does, so kudos to that.My advice? Watch the far better 'Laputa in the sky' or if your a Shinkai fan, watch 'The Garden of Words' or his painfully-becoming apparent masterpiece, '5 centimetres per second'. space to fill the void of the lost one is good but the character dialogue lets it down.

If you like films like Laputa, Princess Mononoke, or Nausicaa, you will probably find something to like here, as it\'s clearly trying to emulate that style, and while it largely fails to match up to any such natural comparisons, I can\'t really call it a bad film.At the least, it\'s a very pretty movie.  While the characters don\'t have the same sort of life and distinctive visual appeal as their Ghibli progenitors, they do come close, and the landscapes and backgrounds are absolutely stunning.  The monsters and magical beings that are...encountered along the way are, like the characters, not quite there but close, and they show a decent amount of creativity as well as their obvious influences.  The film sounds alright too, though I always find sound somewhat hard to rate.Unfortunately, the film stumbles in two of the most important departments: Story and Character.  For characters, we have three leads throughout the majority of the film: Asuna, who is something of a naive, nice everygirl with fairly confused and inconsistent motivations; Shin, our harsher mystical fighting-type boy also with confused and inconsistent motivations; and Mr. Morisaki, who mercifully doesn\'t have the same problem with confused and inconsistent motivations and instead suffers from the fact that despite the fact that his story is possibly the best told with the most emotional gravitas, it doesn\'t get the emotional focus it needs because he\'s more of an antagonist type (even if I wouldn\'t call him a villain).And I think this brings me to the critical problem with the movie, that underscores most of the rest of what it does wrong: the film is trying to be and do too many things at once, when one thing would have been more than enough.  The closest thing the film has to a good, well-rounded plot is Mr. Morisaki\'s quest, but since the film is more focused on Asuna it doesn\'t have the room it needs to be really compelling.And while Asuna is the focal character and you sort of get that she\'s probably a nice person it\'s a little difficult to follow her because nothing ever adds up.  At the start of the film, she\'s listening to a magic crystal based radio and hearing a mystical song, which could have been a plot hook all on its own if they bothered to develop her past ""nice girl"" with some curiosity and adventurous spirit.  After that, it looks like she\'s forming a strong bond with another character, but that gets halfheartedly not-quite-discarded for the meat of the film too.  Once she\'s in Agartha she has two potential motivations to go on the magical quest served to her on a silver platter, but she never addresses either of them.  The film tells us she felt a calling, tells us that she\'s lonely, and never really addresses why this causes her to make the choices that she does, which ultimately leaves her just along for the ride.Shin, meanwhile, at least has one consistent desire, but her pursues it in a very scattered way and his reasoning and actions don\'t ever seem to add up.  One scene he has a serious issue with honor, doing his duty, and paying his debts, the next he\'s more of a softie who doesn\'t want to see an innocent brought to harm.  I suppose that could work, saying he\'s grown or formed some sort of bond, but it\'s not treated that way; we aren\'t really let in on how he\'s changing or even that he is really changing so when he says and does things at odds with his stated purpose, it\'s just jarring, especially when he indicates a resentment he never seemed to hold.And even beyond the arcs of the characters, if you can call them that, the movie has a lot of elements that start nowhere, go nowhere, and never seem to add up.  There are scenes, even entire threads of plots, that seem like clues to a mystery that doesn\'t exist.  For instance, Asuna\'s magic crystal from her dad would seem to indicate that one or both of her and her father have some connection to Agartha, and we even get some tantalizing hints as to what that connection could be, only for it to never be mentioned, addressed, or the pieces put together in any way, much less one that would be logically and emotionally satisfying.  We get a lot of mini-scenes and talks, however brief, about these supposedly deep philosophical ideas... which could be deep if the entire movie picked one and tried to focus on it.  Instead it\'s sort of about the cycle of life and death but it also throws in an anti-war bit that could have been played up to a strong main status instead, and  halfheartedly tries to suggest maybe an environmental message sort of that never gets followed up with, and so on.It sort of makes me sad, because there are bits of great movies in here.  And I don\'t just mean the great movies that clearly inspired this mediocre offering, but great movies that could have been.  In one alternate universe there\'s a great movie about Asuna\'s crystal radio and how it draws her into this intrigue about a spirit world connected to our own, that spins a tale of global conspiracies and dying gods and humanity growing up.  In another alternate universe there\'s a film about Asuna\'s journey to the world of Agartha, a world to which she is more deeply connected than she realizes, that has a lot of great and beautiful things to say about identity, and finding your place.  In another alternate universe there\'s a movie about conflict and greed, that follows up on the snippets of Agartha\'s history we get in our version, that tells a great epic story that touches on the flaws of human nature.  And of course there\'s the alternate universe with the great film that\'s closest to what we\'ve got, that actually follows through with the emotional gravity of telling this tale about life and death, grieving and letting go.  And there are more besides those that taking some elements of this thing a different direction could really make shine.But in our universe, rather than getting a single, brilliant, great film, we got Frankenstein\'s monster: Cobbled together out of great parts, or at least parts with great potential, but  in the end a shambling, patchwork sort of thing that doesn\'t do any of its components justice, coming out as truly less than the sum of its parts.This is a film that wants to be epic and deep, but doesn\'t know quite how to do it, and so instead ends up flat and epic only in the potential it squanders.Yet despite this, as I said at the beginning, there\'s enough to like here that I can\'t really bring myself to call it a bad film.  I was entertained watching it, and don\'t really resent the two hours I spent that way.  It\'s Diet Miyazaki: nowhere near as fulfilling as the real thing, but still likable and full of beautiful, creative vistas, so if you\'re really in the mood for a somewhat melancholy magical adventure and have it at hand, I\'d say go ahead.

It\'s her favorite past-time activity when school is out and this is where she meets an important catalyst for the rest of the movie.  Upon her track to her favorite spots up a hill/small mountain to her getaway shack she created she runs into two ""unearthly"" ""creatures""  One is more of an ancient/prehistorical beats (mutated looking bear is closest relative) and also a boy named Shun.  Shun tells Asuna it will be alright and tries to save this ancient animal from hurting Asuna or himself without killing it.  To Shun,  It is a gatekeeper of his world of Agartha.Shun left his home world to find what he was looking for on the surface and to retrieve the Cristas (keys) that Asuna is wearing.  His life expectancy is at its end and Asuna did not know that.  She only just begun to realize that the mystical world of Agartha may exist.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and give it an overall 8.7', ""I really like the movie and the story entertained me. I especially like the dark theme of death and loss.My main negative point is: They travel to Agartha after 40 minutes! The introduction takes too long, they should have spent more time in Agartha. Unfortunately this leads to some themes not being explored or explained enough.But apart from that, it's a great movie. Agartha is a very interesting world. The artstyle is amazing, as always in Shinkai's movies! You could just pause at a random scene, print the screenshot and use it and hang it on your wall like a piece of art. "", 'So this girl sees these monsters and is saved by a boy from the underworld. And she goes there, and she is chased around by some freaks and… WHAT IS THE POINT IN ALL THIS?Disappointed! This is how I felt after I finished this film. Wanna know why?1) The directorMakoto Shinkai is quite famous for his tragic romantic tales. Voices of a Distant Star and 5cm per Second are amongst the few romances even an uncaring bastard like myself enjoyed. So it was reasonable to expect yet another film regarding a tragic romance. Because, duh, Shinkai never made anything else. And to my amazement he...now did. And it wasn’t good.2) The studioStudio Comix Wave is new but has made an impressive work so far. The thing is, with this film it feels like it is trying to rip-off Ghibli Studio instead of trying to find an identity or style of its own. I had to check three times to make sure this WASN’T a Ghibli production. I mean, IT IS SO ALIKE! In my mind there can be only one Ghibli and now I see someone trying to become its copycat? This is an outrage! Yes, pretty damn good visuals and soundtrack, but they all look and sound like a damn robbery from one of the most famous studios around. I couldn’t enjoy the overall film because of it.3) The storyYou think the similarities to Ghibli stop only at the visuals? Heck no, the story itself was a mix of various Ghibli works. At the same time it is hardly as captivating as those films, with far less context, complexity, interesting situations, and plot. So not only it is an imitation, it is also a bad one. If you just sit back and think of the plot of the film you will immediately realize how linear, simple, and eventually forgettable it was.4) The charactersNot even one of the characters in the film is memorable or interesting. They all play their generic roles to the fullest yet none of them manage to stand out from their counterparts in a myriad other children fantasy stories. To the most part all you see is the heroine being chased around by monsters and being saved by a handsome fighter from a magical land. It couldn’t get any cornier. I saw fifty times more in the far similar premise of Escaflowne, where everyone there was far more complicating than he appeared to be at first. And in case you try to excuse it by saying this is a movie and not a series to demand drastic character development, then I will reply that in this case a movie should not be full of useless characters. Yet look at this, there is a whole school filled with children, a whole village filled with people, a WHOLE MAGICAL LAND FILLED WITH CREATURES and you get NOTHING out of them. They are just standing there, irrelevant to the main plot, and boring since they are not doing anything.5) The motivationThere is no clear goal for most of the movie. The characters are running around almost apathetically, without really caring or making us care about whatever they want to accomplish. And even when they accomplish it, it feels hollow and pointless, without nothing interesting for you to remember about. There is absolutely no emotional engagement with whatever is going on in it.6) PlausibilityFurthermore, the movie hardly tries to convince you of whatever happens. Monsters attack our world, the army attacks them with helicopters, and nobody in the surrounding areas besides the heroine takes notice of them. And then the movie ends and she returns and her mother has apparently popped in the story, and she keeps living her life like nothing matters. SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ALL THAT?Although most viewers will probably just stare at the cool visuals and vote this a 9 or 10, I am a far harder to please man. I expect emotional engagement, development of the initial concept, some plot twist to be taken back for a few seconds, some characters who manage to escape their stereotype, something that doesn’t feel like a lesser rehash of older productions. Well I got none of the above in this one. It was hollow, boring, and made Makoto Shinkai to look like a failed Miyazaki wannabe when he always had his own style and identity. His specialty always was tragic romances, he was so good at it, he had no reason to stray off to something far more childish and stupid like this. Although he tried to pull of something similar here with the myth of Izanami and Izanagi, he failed completely to make it plausible and engaging. His previous works were all quite realistic to the most part, without silly magical powers to offer panacea to any problem encountered. But this? This is a stupid romantic fairy tale for little girls (yes, girls, not even boys) and one so generic that you will forget as soon as you watch the next generic fairy tale that comes along. Heck, watching a low-budget stupid Barbie 3D movie is more than enough to get over it!COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED! GO BACK TO REALISTIC ROMANCES SHINKAI! LEAVE BEHIND THESE STUPID MAGICAL LANDS! And above all DON’T TRY TO GROW A BEARD AND ACT LIKE MIYAZAKI! BE YOURSELF! now did. And it wasn’t good.2) The studioStudio Comix Wave is new but has made an impressive work so far.

It is far from a bad movie, but I was expecting so much more. ', ""I did not want to write this review, but I am so disappointed that now I have to. Makoto Shinkai is fucking overrated. He has made one good movie: Your Name (2016). Everything else he made is shit, a good-looking turd, but still a piece of turd. His art style is eye-pleasing, I won't deny that, but his stories are so dull and messy that I can't even imagine that he is the same guy who wrote Your Name.Children Who Chase Lost Voices (CWCLV, dumb title) is, in my opinion (and in many others), an attempt to create and capture the charm of a Miyazaki...film. There are direct and indirect parallels between this movie and Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke. Aspects like the look of the characters, the world design, and the themes seem derivative of (but not as good) Ghibli films. The music is boring. The characters are one-dimensional. The fantasy backdrop is unfinished and shallow. Everything is so dull and unoriginal, non-sensically messy and pretentious—it's an absolute disappointment.SPOILERS AHEAD (If anyone cares)Asuna (the protagonist) does nothing in this movie except be a damsel in distress and the complete opposite of her initial setup character. She was there because of circumstances. The movie tried to make a big deal out of this, but the answer was always plain and simple: She was, literally, dragged in there and the story. What was the lesson? To forgive someone who literally tried to kill you and your friend and put their wife's soul inside you? I thought they were going to be filling the roles of father and daughter in each other's lives. But after that ending, I don't want him anywhere remotely close to her. If only they did not ham-fisted unnecessary characters in their story and instead spent that time fleshing out the essential ones.I know that it's not meant to be realistic. But come on, use that fucking gun, at least on those shadow crawler thingies. And this is not the only nitpick that annoyed me. There are a lot of other moments where they don't pay any attention to the details, which takes me out of an already sloppily written and bland movie. The dialogue is unnecessarily philosophical—Like you are a child, why are you talking like this? And if you are talking like this, why are you so dumb regarding everything else?At least Shinkai tried to do something different in this one, and that's as far as my praise goes. It's so annoying because I know that he is talented, but he has put himself into a corner by writing the same type of stories again and again, especially with Your Name and Weathering With You. I want him to make something new and original, more thought out with better world-building and atmosphere and better multi-dimensional characters, as he did in Your Name. Let's see what he does with his new one. This tho is--Not Recommended. film. There are direct and indirect parallels between this movie and Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke.

Some people think its awful, one even giving it a 2/10 (no offence to this person but if this is a 2/10, I'm sure sure how realistic their 10/10s are). Some people have mixed feelings seemingly not connecting with the story, characters or general vibe of the film and then there is me, i thought this was so so close to a masterpiece and i will try to explain why.First off, the animation.  Its a Makoto Shinkai film, of course it has incredible animation, but the world depicted here...is stunning.  Everything, as always, looks gorgeous.  This film however, for me anyway, had a certain charm that others, including Your Name, Zuzume and 5 Centimetres does and I find it very hard to explain it.  I think the world here is so varied in its tones, colour and atmosphere you can't really ask for more.  Also, i,m starting to see a theme in the depiction of cats in Makoto's films and that is Cats.  There seems to be a significant character in most films i have seem that is a cat in his films.  Still, the animation of these cats varies and this one in particular plays just as much of a key role as the one in Zuzume.  Most people would probably disagree with this statement, but i feel they are equally important.  Animation is 10/10.Secondly is the music and my goodness is this perfect.  I wont talk too much about the music as most of his films contain fantastic music that has very little negatives, this films is an exception, it has no negatives.  I thought the music her was stunning.Finally the story and the only part preventing this from being a perfect 10/10.  For me this is so so close to a 10 i've been thinking about it for the last 3 days.  Considering my lengthy contemplation, it cant possibly be a 10.  Regardless of this, it is a fantastic story.  Out of the Makoto films i have seen so far; 5 Centimetres, Your Name, Zuzume, Weathering With You and this, i feel this is the largest story told of them all.  Yest despite this possibly having the largest amount of content to get through, it does so with impeccable pacing and wonderful character development.  So much happens here and with every passing moment you never seem to be able to guess what happens next.  The journey we do on is rather emotional one to that manages to build fantastically to an 'Oh my god NO!' moment and them kind of drops down from it to a somewhat satisfying conclusion but I felt it built the emotion up to high and climaxed a little to soon before the finish.  One of the criticisms given to this is that Asuna is on this treacherous and at times life threatening journey for little reason.  Seemingly these people forget that most of anime consists of characters do the most dramatic for little reason.  I however think the reason is more than justified.  We have a girl who is alone, who is 11, has lost her father, her mother is barely home due to her job as a nurse, who is forced to grow up way beyond her years who then meets someone that takes this pain away for a brief moment and then she is back to being alone again.  Trust me, when viewed through this lens, anyone who has ever felt alone, will understand.As I said in the preceding paragraph, this is so unrelievedly lose to a 10.  For me, out of Makoto's films i have seen, this is the second only to Your Name and it comes so very close to equalling it for me. is stunning.  Everything, as always, looks gorgeous.

Prior to watching this my whole experience with his work was sadboi cuck shit (5 centimeters per second), sadboi foot shit (The Garden of Words) and Freaky Friday (I forget which movie this one was…it probably isn’t important), none of which seemed even close to anything Miyazaki had ever done, yet within the first 10 minutes of this film I understood that this was a Miyazaki clone....I’m not going to say too much on this point as Digibro (fuck…it’s Digi-Nee) already did that in her (or should I say his video since Digi identified as male when he made that video) Makoto Shinkai video but it feels wrong to not address it at all.That being said, the film is surprisingly morbid for a Ghibli clone, especially considering how the early tone, while still a bit dark didn’t seem too bad. The girl met a jumpy boy and they just had a gay old time together. Then about half an hour later some spoopy boys are coming to fuck her up. Seriously. What happened.Well, an old guy in glasses’ wife died and he’s still not over it so he’s taking it out on this innocent child. Pretty much immediately you can tell what the message of the film is going to be, which I don’t think is necessarily a bad thing. This is a Ghibli cone after all, and I don’t think thematic subtlety has ever been a strong point when it comes to Ghibli films. And despite Digi’s insistence that there is nothing more to the theme’s in Shinkai’s film, I would beg to differ.Birth is a far more subtle element of The Children Who Chase Lost Voices than death is within the narrative, yet this juxtaposition does wonders for the overall thematic placing. It’s especially notable towards the end where this Quetzalcoatl swallows the two kids and lovingly strokes it’s belly like a pregnant mother before bringing them down the cliff that Gendo almost died trying to climb down. If Gendo wasn’t so eager to bring the dead back to life, he would have had a much easier trip down the mountain, and considering how he seemed to have just barely entered the portal thingy, it’s not like he saved that much time in the process. Choosing life over death is clearly the message that Shinkai was trying to present to his viewers, and despite how bluntly he portrays this message, I find the overall result to be a relatively charming film.Despite all this, it’s not like I don’t understand why you might not like it. The initial portion of the film, setting up Agartha seems unnecessarily slow, and while I find that once they reach the fantastical land the film immediately livens up, you shouldn’t have to wait half an hour for your film to start.Furthermore, the relationship between Asuna and Shun never really felt that engaging, so the idea that I should care about her entering Agartha because of this always felt kind of forced.This Review is actually the script to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRoWQs6lIfkCheck that out and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more reviews like it. I’m not going to say too much on this point as Digibro (fuck…it’s Digi-Nee) already did that in her (or should I say his video since Digi identified as male when he made that video) Makoto Shinkai video but it feels wrong to not address it at all.That being said, the film is surprisingly morbid for a Ghibli clone, especially considering how the early tone, while still a bit dark didn’t seem too bad.

What happened.Well, an old guy in glasses’ wife died and he’s still not over it so he’s taking it out on this innocent child. Pretty much immediately you can tell what the message of the film is going to be, which I don’t think is necessarily a bad thing. This is a Ghibli cone after all, and I don’t think thematic subtlety has ever been a strong point when it comes to Ghibli films. And despite Digi’s insistence that there is nothing more to the theme’s in Shinkai’s film, I would beg to differ.Birth is a far more subtle element of The Children Who Chase Lost Voices than death is within the narrative, yet this juxtaposition does wonders for the overall thematic placing. It’s especially notable towards the end where this Quetzalcoatl swallows the two kids and lovingly strokes it’s belly like a pregnant mother before bringing them down the cliff that Gendo almost died trying to climb down. If Gendo wasn’t so eager to bring the dead back to life, he would have had a much easier trip down the mountain, and considering how he seemed to have just barely entered the portal thingy, it’s not like he saved that much time in the process. Choosing life over death is clearly the message that Shinkai was trying to present to his viewers, and despite how bluntly he portrays this message, I find the overall result to be a relatively charming film.Despite all this, it’s not like I don’t understand why you might not like it. The initial portion of the film, setting up Agartha seems unnecessarily slow, and while I find that once they reach the fantastical land the film immediately livens up, you shouldn’t have to wait half an hour for your film to start.Furthermore, the relationship between Asuna and Shun never really felt that engaging, so the idea that I should care about her entering Agartha because of this always felt kind of forced.This Review is actually the script to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRoWQs6lIfkCheck that out and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more reviews like it.', 'Hot take: this is still my favorite Shinkai film, and the one that made me explore the rest of his filmography. While this film is flawed, this is the one from him that emotionally resonated the most for me.I\'ve called it the depressing ""Spirited Away"", since it takes the concept of that movie but focuses on heavier subject matter of loss, grief, and regret. Some of the plot elements are half baked or incomplete, but this show has a vibe that has stuck with me upon first viewing.I also believe this has the best animation of all his films. His later films have a...modern and glossy look to them that rely more on CGI. His earlier films on the other hand were janky as they were still working with new technology and a lower budget. The animation for this film is right in the sweet spot of fully utilizing the technology without relying on it as a crutch. It looks amazing on blu-ray.On top of that, this film contains the best score from his films. The scale of this world they enter feels so grand and large with the music soaring it\'ll give you goosebumps every time. Half of the credit for the emotional scenes should go to the score.  I wish he continued working with this composer.As mentioned, the biggest flaw is the story elements. While you do connect with the main character the entire way and understand her motivations, everything around her is somewhat underdeveloped. The ending is abrupt; I wish the resolution was expanded on a little more.If you are not a fan of Shinkai at all this likely won\'t win you over. However, if you are a fan of Shinkai, I would not overlook this one. modern and glossy look to them that rely more on CGI.

It felt kind of like ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" meets ""Princess Mononoke"". Although the action felt a bit off when it occurred later in the film, it was very cool to watch from an animation standpoint. I really like Asuna fought for herself. I think the idea behind the story was that a lot of cultures share ""trip to the Underworld"" stories, but the Orpheus and Eurydice reference made me happy. I also love how this wasn\'t a Westernized cultural adaptation. They used Izanami and Izanagi and really worked with...Japanese mythology.On the other hand, the movie is frequently like someone pressing fast forward and skip constantly. Characters jump to conclusions a lot, and their reasoning is never explained. There are a couple of unexplained plot points. The epiphany of the story is not fully explained. Yes, epiphanies are typically ""oh, I get it now"", and everyone understands, or ""this is ambiguous - you can take a number of things from it"". But other than an EXTREMELY vague thought about the price of the impossible not being worth the cost, I have no idea what is supposed to come out of this film. This also fits in a genre of fantasy story that I really don\'t like. It\'s related to the ending.The art was gorgeous. The shots of sky were all-around gorgeous, and the details were amazing.I loved almost all the characters in this film. I really liked Asuna. I liked Shun. I liked Shin. I even liked the teacher. Asuna is inquisitive, smart, sweet, and resourceful, and she has her own type of strength. I wish we\'d learned more about Shun, and his and Shin\'s backgrounds; why are they given the tasks their given, and what happens to Shin after it all? They\'re the only two loose ends.Overall, it was a good film. You\'re going to have to suspend your disbelief for a lot of it, and don\'t watch it when you\'re sad. It\'s pretty and fun. A nice fairy tale/adventure romp. Japanese mythology.On the other hand, the movie is frequently like someone pressing fast forward and skip constantly.

This film has it all: adventure, romance, and a healthy dose of confusing plot points.The story follows a young girl who embarks on a journey to find her missing father, meeting various strange characters along the way. It's like Alice in Wonderland, but with less tea parties and more ancient relics.The style of this anime is truly breathtaking. The animation is so beautiful that you'll forget all about the fact that you have no idea what's going on. The colors are vibrant, the landscapes are stunning, and the character designs are...well, they're...definitely unique.Speaking of characters, we have the typical anime protagonist who starts out as a clueless child but eventually becomes a strong, independent young adult. Then there's the mysterious and brooding love interest who has a tragic backstory. And of course, we can't forget about the quirky side characters who add some much-needed comic relief.The music in this anime is simply sublime. The haunting melodies will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. It's like they took all the best parts of a Studio Ghibli soundtrack and made it even better.Overall, my enjoyment experience with Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo was a rollercoaster of emotions. Confusion, awe, and a slight headache from trying to keep up with the plot.

They are one of the best i have seen. There are interesting themes (death, loneliness, conflict, mythology?) which the movie had attempted to cover. While I like the movie, it seems rather incomplete. The movie starts off strong with our main character being saved by a boy named Shun, who is from a land underneath the earth called Agartha. I'm not sure about it but i read somewhere that the name Agartha comes from Buddhism. The main character then herself goes to this land with her teacher,...where she sees a whole new world in which the people who live there despise the people living on the surface of the earth.The movie feels rather empty in a good way, the visuals kind of suck you into the movie's world. The theme of death was beautifully depicted in the movie. The movie in my opinion felt short because it didn't conclude well.But there are positives too like:the visualsThe themesThe characters were okish, the main character is decent, her teacher honestly was the worst in the movie but it's understandable.Overall I would say watch the movie if you want an escape, since the movie does a really good job at itI would say a 7/10Thank you if you made it this far hehe. where she sees a whole new world in which the people who live there despise the people living on the surface of the earth.The movie feels rather empty in a good way, the visuals kind of suck you into the movie's world.

The normal comedy bits are there with Ryo doing more perving at the leed female as well as a poke at what exactly Kaori carrys round with her all the time (death of evil Ryo she had a explosive bra, but no lighter to light the fuse) honestly she must be really strong, but there are bits that are just awesome (how do you get into a speeding train using a rocket luncher and a mini), so its a really good film that will kill a hour and a half of our time that is recommended.One sentence summary.City hunter doing Speed (the film that is)Who its for?City hunter fans mostly, but action film fans will get a kick outa it not as good as the last one I watched, but still in the ""Good"" area of things with some really good stand out bits (how to stop a train from going off a broken bit of track with one bullet was different).

Bleach Movie 3: Fade to Black - Kimi no Na wo Yobu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4835/Bleach_Movie_3__Fade_to_Black_-_Kimi_no_Na_wo_Yobu,"['Cliched? Overbearing? Far too full of machismo? Has more plot holes than a colander?I must be talking about Bleach.The one thing that has always bugged me about most of the long running shounen anime is how creatively deficient they become over time. Bleach, like Naruto et al, is a prime example of the ""anime-turned-cash-cow"" phenomenon that seems to be occurring more and more these days, and this latest effort, Fade to Black: Kimi no Na wo Yobu (FtB: I Call Your Name), represents the series at it\'s worst.Since this is a movie, I won\'t go into the details of the story proper as I...don\'t want to give anything away. That said, I would dearly love to know how and why Takahashi Natsuko, who wrote the screenplay for shows like ""The Daughter of Twenty Faces"" and ""Moyashimon"", and worked on the script for the first two seasons of ""School Rumble"", could ever claim that the screenplay for this movie was some sort of achievement? The plot, which any long term, reasonably intelligent, watcher of the series will know is more of a secondary consideration these days, actually had a lot of potential. But, like so many other things that Bleach has touched upon during it\'s long run, the more interesting things are never explored as there MUST be a scene where Ichigo comes flying in to save the day. People don\'t really watch shounen anime for it\'s cerebral nature, but there such a thing as going too far in the other direction.Anyway, the plot is full of holes. Period. There isn\'t any real way to hide or disguise that fact, and frankly, the movie doesn\'t even try. Here\'s one example, and this one has bugged me for so long that I\'m throwing this question out to everyone. Seireitei is supposed to be protected by a barrier of some sort (if I remember the whole rescue Rukia from certain death arc correctly - oh wait, that describes 70% of the episodes), so if that\'s the case, how the hell do the bad guys keep getting in? In particular, how does something like a hollow from Hueco Mundo get in to Seireitei? One would think that they\'d guard against that in particular, especially after the whole Aizen thing.The movie touches upon a number of themes, the typical shounen themes of friendship and never giving up are there, but the driver for the story is Rukia losingher memories of being a shinigami. One would think that this was simply a case of supernatural amnesia, but for some reason the cause is able to affect existence on a near unviersal scale. If that\'s the case, then the cause of Rukia\'s memory loss is potentially more powerful than Aizen, the Captain Commander of the Gotei 13 Yamamoto-Genryusai Shigekuni, all of the Bountos, the Vizard, the Arrancar, and just about everyone else in the world.See what I mean about holes?As it stands, the movie is actually better if you don\'t know anything about the series, which is unfortunate as I thought the whole point of things like this was to add to the whole instead of being a glorified advert for the series (congratulations marketing department, you win this round).The art and animation is decent enough on the whole, however there\'s some glaringly obvious problems, one of which is the fact that the characters look angry or constipated for a lot of the movie (especially Ichigo, even when he\'s ""happy"" he scowls). The faces are sometimes unnaturally distorted when the character is feeling some deep emotion (grief, for example), something which is only exacerbated with close ups of the character in question. There\'s also a number of scenes that feature something I call ""unnatural body position"", which simply means that on occasion the characters will look ""odd"" in some manner (the most common one I\'ve seen involves the shoulders - watch and you\'ll see for yourself).Animation-wise the movie manages to at least attain some respectability. The characters do move quite well, and the various combat sequences are pretty decent, but Bleach fans will know that the series is capable of much better than can be seen in this movie.Most people will be familiar with the voice actors, especially if they\'re regular viewers of the series. The cast do a decent job overall, but in the end this is still just another episode of Bleach so there is a distinct lack of passion in the characters, however this is mainly due to the scripting and screenplay rather than the cast\'s acting ability. Morita Masakzu (Ichigo), for example, has a problem in that his character is supposed to be almost perpetually angry at something, and lives with a huge chip on his shoulder. This may seem like an interesting character at first, but after playing the role for this long without any real development to Ichigo as a character, it\'s understandable how one would be ""bored"" by now.Which leads me neatly on to the characters themselves. Oh look, the gang\'s all here (minus Chad, Orihime and Ishida - surprisingly). The problem with Bleach as a whole is that it never really looks at developing it\'s characters in any meaningful way, and this movie is no exception to that tried an tested (on morons), method. As a single movie it can get away with lacking anything in the way of real character development, even though there was a feeble attempt to highlight the ""bond"" between Ichigo and Rukia. As part of the greater series though, the lack of any real progression makes this seem more like just another episode of Bleach - it\'s just a bit longer than normal.I will admit that as an action movie this isn\'t too bad. If the purpose of the movie is to ""entertain"" then it does just that - barely. One of the problems with Fade to Black is that it has a tendency to ramble at times, especially during the conversations (no one seems to have heard of getting to the point). There\'s also a distinct lack of urgency about the characters, almost as if they\'re trying a bit too hard. Since this is a movie I can forgive a lot more than I would have if this were a series episode, and it\'s only because of this that I didn\'t give Fade to Black a lower score.On the whole though, this is not the best effort to come from the Bleach stable. Diamond Dust Rebellion was actually superior to this in many ways, so this is effectively a step down for the series. That doesn\'t mean it\'s not enjoyable, it\'s just that there\'s an almost juvenile feeling to the movie, almost as if it was designed to cater to wide-eyed 13 year old fanboys than the more hardened anime fan.It\'s sad, but it seems like Bleach has finally run out of steam. don\'t want to give anything away.

Never a dull moment and my only complaint is that the movie wasn't 5 hours long.  It was so good I wanted more, which is a mark of a great anime.Overall for Bleach fans, or even first time viewers; you need not see the show to enjoy the movie.

Perhaps my expectations were a bit higher than they should've been for some reason...I thought it was going to be better than the movie 2 was but in reality they were about the same this time around being only a slight upgrade. Nevertheless I never found myself bored or uninterested and while the story was unsurprisingly pretty generic it was still a fun time. The plot, which I won't spoil was actually better this time...around, having some more layers to it than I expected it to, which was good. I liked how it focused itself up on Rukia's past and there was a thing that happened to the characters which added depth to the story as well. The fight scenes were actually coriagraphed very well, the best one being the small skirmish between Ichigo and Renji which was executed beautifully in my opinion. However in the movie it feels like the creators just shoehorned in all the Captains and Lieutenants into it just to show them use their bankai and other powers as a way to add action into the movie. I think this could've been done more cleaverly using specific characters more important to the story instead of just everyone. As for the villains, I thought they worked fine. The female was rather annoying in the beginning but towards the end I actually found pitty towards her and the other antagonist. As well as having some minor plot holes and things that should have been explained or went into detail further, I thought the pacing was very good and for the most part everything flowed crisp and clean. Overall the plot had good structure. On another note, the animation was a signifigant improvement, especially the zanpakto transformations and fight sequences were very good. The shadows and sweat, everything was much more detailed and the surrounding area of the seireitei looked very smooth. This time around the movie didn't have a exclusive soundtrack, but the music from the show itself is pleasant to listen to as always so I didn't mind it.Overall I liked the movie enough, it wasn't a huge improvement from movie 2 but it's a good time at that. It looked and sounded good...delivered a good enough story with some plot holes, things that should've been explained more, but some nice looking fights with functional villains. If you're a fan of Bleach, you probably won't be obsessed with this movie but you'll definitely like it and enjoy it the whole way through. If you liked my review give it a thumbs up!

Thanks (:"", ""The movie is rather worthwhile to watch. So I'm going to try not to spoil for anyone so you guys can watch it for yourselves. First of all, the story was mediocre. It didn't really contain the BANG! movie watchers would want to have and even seemed unworthy of the long wait for the subs to come out.However, I loved the art. As always, Tite Kubo is a great artist, although his story might not be great, looking at the characters is always cool. The sound was not especially good, and I wouldn't say it was too bad either. I'd give it a fair really,...if you ask me. I much rather the action scenes have more boom and bang but it was okay.The characters were original... but I didn't really enjoy Homura, who was quite bitchy about everything. Shizuku was a great character though but he played a rather subtle role so it didn't really work out. I didn't particularly enjoy Dark Rukia though. The character progression was too fast, it was like they were trying to rush everything. That's one part of the movie that was really a letdown. They should have let Dark Rukia get more screen time. I think the movie was fairly enjoying, although I wouldn't say very. It was crafted such that it can be appreciated and watch a few times over but its not really the kind that you'd whip out when you're yearning for a great movie. Overall, I think the movie was quite good, thanks to the art, sound and enjoyment level, although the plot and character development still lacks in some areas.But what can I say? Just watch the movie yourself and you'll understand what I mean. if you ask me.

Thankfully Ichigo Kurosaki and Kon, a plush lion, remembered her thanks to a letter and go to Soul Society to safe her. Due to a crisis happening in the world of the shinigami that leads to a lot of misunderstandings with allies considering Ichigo as an enemy.Basically the movie is about stopping the real badguys which are two siblings and rescue Rukia while also helping everyone to regain their memories.Simple concept...and a simple premise which sounds great. Rukia and Ichigo's relationship are some of the best things about Bleach and having allies being enemies now gives the opportunity to see some fights we didn't see in Soul Society arc that could have happened. That is pretty much the main appeal of the movie and before its release it was advertised who will Ichigo encounter and fight.Sadly that is also the weakness of Fade to Black and what many prior Bleach movies suffered: too many characters. Of the main characters that Kubo usually like to push but not really only Ichigo and Rukia are involved. No Sado. No Ishida. No Inoue.Even then the cast is still crowded with the directors wanting Ichigo to get some favorites as his allies back to safe Rukia such as Renji. But considering the movie has only a runtime of about 90 minutes, nothing really stays long enough to leave an impact.There are a bunch of powers used. A bunch of Bankais released. Seiretei gets endangered by something big like in the previous movies. It is pretty much a mess, even if the animation and soundtrack are stellar.Honestly fanservice itself is kinda a mixed bag since whenever the captains release bankai or Kenpachi removes his eyepatch, we will see a generic slaughter you have probably seen for the 3rd time if you are watching Bleach movies in order. Even down to the disrespect put on Soifon having her make an amateur mistake so someone saves her.The enemies have the power to cut memories, bonds and a weird teleportation technique which might not be teleportation. It is weird and confusing. The memory cutting ability never plays a role in combat and while the final fight is entertaining to watch, it just doesn't stick even with the homage to episode 1 of the anime series.Speaking of homages, there are a lot of nods to the first two Bleach arcs.  We see also how Byakuya acts a bit different from his usual self we are used to and Rukia trying to figure out who she is.Other characters aren't much different despite their memory loss.The antagonists may be the weakest part of the movie. They are siblings who have a tragic past and have personal connection to Rukia, but they aren't very likeable. Especially the elder sister who is the only one calling the shots while the brother does what she says. He reasons sometimes but doesn't feel like he has any agency as a character himself.Overall this movie like all Bleach movies can't reach its full potential. It can't decide if it wants to tell a compelling story or put a bunch of fan service to fill the much needed runtime that could be used to give the younger brother more agency. And the ending while being symbolic is very confusing in why it worked and if other characters couldn't have done the same thing if Ichigo just told them. and a simple premise which sounds great.

I have to say, after the Second outing I was hoping that the Bleach films would continue to improve, but unfortunately the third film falters again, and while it has it's fair share of enjoyable material, it's just not as fun as it should be.Normally in a review I'd start by talking about the story, but god knows if the story to this one makes sense. There's some kids that are...I dunno, something like Bleach's version of the Nobodies from Kingdom Hearts, and they steal Rukia's heart and memories, and make everyone forget...her because...god, I dunno. Anyway, it makes everyone forget her and Ichigo, so Ichigo tries to save her but because no one remembers him he has to fight a bunch of people all over again just like the Soul Society arc, only about a thousand times more lame. And then Rukia starts to become a hollow or something...I really don't know. The story in this one is an absolute mess, and while I know it's supposed to an excuse to have cool fight scenes, I just couldn't care because I was trying to make sense of this absurdly convoluted storyline. I can deal with convolution to a point(hell, I loves me some Square-Enix games' storylines, and those are about as convoluted as you can get), but this one was just unbearable. The art and sound were okay, and the fights were above average, but I really couldn't say I'd recommend this one for anyone that's not a hardcore Bleach fan. If you want some okay action, go for it, but if you're looking for a satisfying story then look elsewhere. her because...god, I dunno.

Regardless, i enjoyed this movie. Though its a filler movie, its got some interesting bits of information on certain Bleach characters. This movie was also the most destructive as the soul society gets destroyed.The movies plot was not the most original but tolerable. Art wise it remains the same as the other Bleach movie though new angles can be noticed if you pay attention to detail. The soundtrack is possibly the best compared to the other Bleach movies, of course thats my own personal opinion/taste. If you are a...Bleach fan then this movie is a nice side story and well worth your time.Its worth a watch. Bleach fan then this movie is a nice side story and well worth your time.Its worth a watch.', 'Well what can I say for this movie.This is the 3rd Bleach movie.In the start of the movie there is something strange hapening in the Seiretei , then when Rukia comes to help she is being stolen.After that everybody forgets about her , unles Kurosaki Ichigo and Kon.From then on Ichigo and Kon face all of the people in the Seiretei.But as everybody doesnt know about Rukia , even she loses her memory as well but only when she starts to be a shinigami. ', ""So Bleach, the good old Bleach, one of the most important Shonen series right now. Bleach Fade to Black is the third movie of the Bleach franchise being preceded by The Diamond Dust  Rebellion and Memories of Nobody. First and before all, if you don't like the series then I doubt you will enjoy this movie.Story: As a side story the story of this movie doesn't relate to the main story. By some odd reason Captain Mayuri is experimenting on something and somehow a white liquid appears and start freezing shinigamis. Meanwhile, Rukia Kuchiki who was in Soul Society at that time is impacted...by a weapon and she loses all of her memories and all the people that know her also lost the memories of Rukia... Well, almost everyone, the only one that wasn't unaffected was Kon and some minutes later Ichigo. Ichigo embarks on a journey for discover what happened to Rukia. I'll put to the story a 6 out of 10.Art: The same as the anime but it adapts pretty well on the events that happened to Soul Society. 7/10Sound: The same seiyuus and same music but some new ones that really goes well with the movie. 7/10Characters: well, again the same as the anime so you will see the impatient Ichigo, the mother caring Rukia, the cold Byakuya, etc. 6/10Enjoyment: For being a movie based on a Shonen serie you will see alot of interesting battles. Even if you don't like Bleach, you cannot say that the fights are quite good and we can see characters that hardly appear on the manga or in the anime fight so thats a good point of its favor. 7/10Overall: The story isn't that interesting but the enjoyment of watching Ichigo, Renji and others fight for save Soul Society and at the same time save Rukia's memories is what gives life to this movie. It isn't as interesting as the second or first movie but it holds great; although it is forgettable. The only thing I didn't like of this movie is how Ichigo over abused of his bankai (although he tends to do that in the main series) and that Ishida, Sado or Inoue didn't appear at all nor are mentioned. 7/10 is the overall for this movie. Good for watch and waste like two hours but not worth watching again. by a weapon and she loses all of her memories and all the people that know her also lost the memories of Rukia...

The animation is very good and the characters that are included in this one are all worth their contribution. The best of the four movies in my opinion because of it's basis. A recommended watch if you were a fan of the series and especially if you were interested in the two main characters, Ichigo and Rukia, relationship. An interesting plot and overall worthy watch. Out of the four movies it's plot and concentration in the connection of Ichigo and Rukia share is...it's strength in my opinion and what made it the best of the four. it's strength in my opinion and what made it the best of the four."", ""I honestly don't know what I was expected with this movie, but I was highly disappointed nonetheless. Fade to Black was actually highly boring to me. Now, I don't know if it's because I watched  The DiamondDust Rebellion right before I watched this one but I can honestly say that this movie wasn't entertaining at at all. To be honest, the storyline didn't really make any sense.Now I don't want to get into any spoilers for the movie because that's not allowed, but the ending was terrible (along with the rest of it). The explanation for why the bad guy(s) of film did what...they did honestly made no sense to me. Their entire motivation was actually kind of stupid.I really want to know who though this (filler) movie was actually a good idea. I fully stand by the 3 that I gave this movie. Now if you want to watch this, go right ahead. I won't stop you. But I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone. they did honestly made no sense to me.

Does that mean it’s worse? Better? Which is it?Both.Fade to Black is executed much better than DiamondDust, and feels more engaging from a narrative structure point of view, but the concept is much weaker.We are once again introduced to a MacGuffin. It is an apparently dangerous creation of Mayuri’s and the villains steal it. Why is it dangerous? I don’t know. What does it do? I have no idea. I don’t even think it’s ever given an actual name in the movie, which makes calling it a MacGuffin somehow even more appropriate. Alas, the main...reason for me calling it that is because it seems to just, uh, do whatever the plot needs it to do at any given time. You wanna attach it to yourself and make yourself stronger? Sure. You wanna use it to do the Dragon Ball Fusion Dance? Go ahead. You wanna put it in this other nondescript contraption and bring about the apocalypse? Why not? It can do fucking anything.Accordingly, we once again receive an apocryphal backstory for a beloved character. This time it was Rukia, however, and that’s where the problems start. Toushiro is a sidecharacter with no backstory to speak of. As such, giving him one doesn’t feel grating. Rukia, on the other hand, by virtue of being the literal deuteragonist of the franchise, has backstory coming out of her ass. I at no point thought to myself: “Man, of all the Bleach cast, you know whose past I’d like to know more about? Rukia’s! Tell you hwhat, the main series sure did leave me wanting.” Whom does this serve? Who asked for this?She did not need any more previously-unknown backstory to be revealed in a surprising twist that doesn’t make any sense. Honestly, it just comes off as unnecessary fat. Besides, even if it didn’t serve to convolute Rukia’s origin story, the timeline doesn’t add up. The canonical information we have about Rukia’s past growing up in the Rukongai leaves no opportunity for the events suggested by the movie to take place.Regardless, the movie effectively begins with the villains erasing Rukia from everyone’s memories. Cue drama.I will reiterate that even though the concept of Fade to Black is weaker, the execution is much better. At the very minimum, we are given a good reason for Ichigo to be the protagonist – not a great reason, mind you, but a good one. Due to his spiritual connection to Rukia, what with his powers coming from her, he is the only one who is able to eventually remember her existence.This is neither here, nor there, but I got the distinct impression that, at this point in the Bleach story, Pierrot did not yet know Kubo intended to ultimately make Ichigo hook up with Orihime, so they were laboring under the delusion that Orange Naruto would eventually end up with Rukia. A lot of scenes in this movie felt as though they were ever so subtly laying the foundations for that.Naturally, the plot once again revolves around manufacturing conflict between Ichigo and the Soul Society, except that rather than a vague rip-off of the Rukia rescue arc, given that we’re actually trying to rescue Rukia this time, it’s explicitly the same arc all over again. The crux of the conflict is that everyone in SS has also forgotten who Ichigo is and once again call him “ryoka”. I was mildly entertained by the concept of him trying to make these people, who are his friends and allies, remember who he is. Even more engaging was watching the Soul Reapers themselves cope with the inconsistencies in their memories.Update on the Supreme Commander: Still useless? Yes. Still creating pointless friction just to be an asshole? Yes. Funnily enough, upon being informed that Ichigo received his powers from another Soul Reaper sharing hers with him, he immediately exclaimed that such a transgression constitutes a capital crime. I burst out laughing at that point. Oh, yes, please, by all means, let us dredge up that old drama all over again. I’m on pins and needles.Your enjoyment of Fade to Black will be largely contingent of how you feel about amnesia (and the like) being used as a plot device. If you like it, you will have a good time. If you don’t, you won’t.Speaking of memories, though, take this as a public service announcement. If you are an action story writer, you might be tempted to write a big climactic fight between your protagonist and one of their friends or loved ones. The reason said friend or loved one is fighting the MC can be anything from amnesia, to magical corruption, to mind control, to any other some such contrivance. If you then make the entire fight boil down to the protagonist not actually fighting back, because they don’t want to hurt this person, so your main character is just on the defensive the whole time periodically saying lines like “Remember who you are! Wake up! This isn’t you! You’re better than this! Come back to your senses! Fight it! Resist it! Remember [insert piece of backstory trivia here]!”, then stop. Just stop right now. Get some help. Put down the pen and go get a day job, because this gig isn’t for you.As a not-at-all insignificant aside, something that was somewhat of a minor cosmetic problem in Memories of Nobody, becomes full-blown kink wish-fulfillment in Fade to Black. The main threat the villains pose to the Soul Society is by way of using some gizmo to activate a doo-hickey that makes mountainous amounts of uncontrolled spiritual energy run amok in Seireitei. Now, that part is... fine. The problem is that this wild spiritual energy takes the form of giant snakes made up of white goo, which break, crash, and splash all over the place covering everything and everyone in white goo... It looks like... Ok, come on, bro, you know exactly what it looks like. We’ve all seen enough hentai to know exactly how that sort of thing is animated, and this is just... fucking identical.It looks so much like cum, I refuse to believe it’s mere coincidence. Pierrot tried to be funny and get away with something cheeky here. During the second act, you get to see the aftermath of the initial outburst. There are loads of smatterings of puddles and ropes of hardened white goo all over the rooftops and walls and shit. It is such an insanely evocative image, that I am almost convinced that one of the animators literally jerked off on a table or a wall, and unironically used that visual as a basis for the background art. I’d be willing to bet money on it. There’s just no way. I mean, get real, the snakes don’t even look like snakes anymore during the 3rd act. They straight up look like gross dickheads – I’m not joking – and they spit out white goo... The honest-to-God climax (no pun intended) of the movie is the main cast literally fighting against giant dicks shooting cum!This isn’t my fault! Miss me with the projection shit. I’m not taking responsibility for this. My mind is not in the gutter. Studio Pierrot are just a bunch of degenerates.One of the villains also annoyed me something fierce. I’m talking about the kind of villain who has every expectation to get their way, and acts incredibly callous when it comes to causing death and suffering to others, but otherwise behaves in the most genuinely cutesy and innocent way imaginable. The moment, the second anything even remotely threatens their peace and happiness, they will instantly drop to their knees and cry tears of deep personal tragedy, as though they’re the victims of some great injustice. It calls to mind the image of a petulant old child. The most recent example of a similar villain that I can think of off the top of my head is Jack the Ripper from Fate/Apocrypha.In all fairness, villains like these can be used to great effect for an extremely cathartic pay-off moment when they get righteous comeuppance for their extreme levels of hypocrisy and for the pain they’ve caused others. Where this type of villain loses me is when the narrative expects me to sympathize with them. Fade to Black not only presents them as pitiable and sympathetic, but goes a step further and even grants its villains undeserved redemption at the end. “Oh, they’re just kids who didn’t know any better!” It’s your fucking job to know better before you start a genocide.Easily my favorite part of the movie was the fact that, for the first time since his introduction and character arc resolution in episodes 6 and 7, Kon is given something to do. For some reason that is never explained, he is the only one who retained his memories of Rukia and never lost them, not even temporarily. Why? How? Couldn’t tell you. This is straight up just a plot conceit. The fact that he is a mod soul does not satisfactorily explain anything, because Ururu and Jinta, the 2 kids from Urahara’s shop, who are also mod souls, forgot about Rukia and Ichigo just like everybody else.Kon doesn’t play a huge part in the plot, but he sticks around for the duration of the film as a mascot. I enjoyed that. He’s a fun character to spend time with.All in all, I am hard-pressed to say that there’s any reason for anyone but the most hardcore Bleach fans to watch Fade to Black. It won’t add anything to your enjoyment of the setting or its characters. Rukia’s extra backstory doesn’t change or enrich her in any way, just adds convolution, and the final fight between Ichigo and the main antagonist is probably the most pathetic, most disappointing display of a superpowered battle I’ve ever seen. reason for me calling it that is because it seems to just, uh, do whatever the plot needs it to do at any given time. You wanna attach it to yourself and make yourself stronger? Sure. You wanna use it to do the Dragon Ball Fusion Dance? Go ahead.

Wake up! This isn’t you! You’re better than this! Come back to your senses! Fight it! Resist it! Remember [insert piece of backstory trivia here]!”, then stop. Just stop right now. Get some help. Put down the pen and go get a day job, because this gig isn’t for you.As a not-at-all insignificant aside, something that was somewhat of a minor cosmetic problem in Memories of Nobody, becomes full-blown kink wish-fulfillment in Fade to Black. The main threat the villains pose to the Soul Society is by way of using some gizmo to activate a doo-hickey that makes mountainous amounts of uncontrolled spiritual energy run amok in Seireitei. Now, that part is... fine. The problem is that this wild spiritual energy takes the form of giant snakes made up of white goo, which break, crash, and splash all over the place covering everything and everyone in white goo... It looks like... Ok, come on, bro, you know exactly what it looks like. We’ve all seen enough hentai to know exactly how that sort of thing is animated, and this is just... fucking identical.It looks so much like cum, I refuse to believe it’s mere coincidence. Pierrot tried to be funny and get away with something cheeky here. During the second act, you get to see the aftermath of the initial outburst. There are loads of smatterings of puddles and ropes of hardened white goo all over the rooftops and walls and shit. It is such an insanely evocative image, that I am almost convinced that one of the animators literally jerked off on a table or a wall, and unironically used that visual as a basis for the background art. I’d be willing to bet money on it. There’s just no way. I mean, get real, the snakes don’t even look like snakes anymore during the 3rd act. They straight up look like gross dickheads – I’m not joking – and they spit out white goo... The honest-to-God climax (no pun intended) of the movie is the main cast literally fighting against giant dicks shooting cum!This isn’t my fault! Miss me with the projection shit. I’m not taking responsibility for this. My mind is not in the gutter. Studio Pierrot are just a bunch of degenerates.One of the villains also annoyed me something fierce. I’m talking about the kind of villain who has every expectation to get their way, and acts incredibly callous when it comes to causing death and suffering to others, but otherwise behaves in the most genuinely cutesy and innocent way imaginable. The moment, the second anything even remotely threatens their peace and happiness, they will instantly drop to their knees and cry tears of deep personal tragedy, as though they’re the victims of some great injustice. It calls to mind the image of a petulant old child. The most recent example of a similar villain that I can think of off the top of my head is Jack the Ripper from Fate/Apocrypha.In all fairness, villains like these can be used to great effect for an extremely cathartic pay-off moment when they get righteous comeuppance for their extreme levels of hypocrisy and for the pain they’ve caused others. Where this type of villain loses me is when the narrative expects me to sympathize with them. Fade to Black not only presents them as pitiable and sympathetic, but goes a step further and even grants its villains undeserved redemption at the end. “Oh, they’re just kids who didn’t know any better!” It’s your fucking job to know better before you start a genocide.Easily my favorite part of the movie was the fact that, for the first time since his introduction and character arc resolution in episodes 6 and 7, Kon is given something to do. For some reason that is never explained, he is the only one who retained his memories of Rukia and never lost them, not even temporarily. Why? How? Couldn’t tell you. This is straight up just a plot conceit. The fact that he is a mod soul does not satisfactorily explain anything, because Ururu and Jinta, the 2 kids from Urahara’s shop, who are also mod souls, forgot about Rukia and Ichigo just like everybody else.Kon doesn’t play a huge part in the plot, but he sticks around for the duration of the film as a mascot. I enjoyed that. He’s a fun character to spend time with.All in all, I am hard-pressed to say that there’s any reason for anyone but the most hardcore Bleach fans to watch Fade to Black. It won’t add anything to your enjoyment of the setting or its characters. Rukia’s extra backstory doesn’t change or enrich her in any way, just adds convolution, and the final fight between Ichigo and the main antagonist is probably the most pathetic, most disappointing display of a superpowered battle I’ve ever seen.', 'Perhaps my score of an 7 intrigues you? Because everyone else has pushed it to the side like you do your asparagus or brussell sprouts (if you like these, then please think of the vegetable you hate most)?Honestly folks, were we really thinking this movie would be something other than fan service? Come on! It\'s so typical for shounen, especially long running shounen to mass produce pieces of work that highly resemble your Great Aunt Babette, the one who\'s always pinching your cheeks, or commenting on how big your...ahem. Well I\'m sure you get the picture. It\'s meant to be a filler! I can\'t help...but do this, but these movies are ranged in the area of the Naruto movies (which are by FAR the tackiest things I\'ve ever witnessed). Although Bleach gets a certain amount of respect from me, in that it is much more mature than Naruto. Anywho, for the review.Story: Seriously, there\'s not much there. It\'s all action and Ichigo screaming Rukia\'s name and fighting some kids who have a history with Rukia and managed to get into the Soul Society to cause some serious damage. Does this sound original to you? Didn\'t think so. Your probably wondering how these two white kids got into the Soul Society as well as why they waited until NOW to find Rukia and make them \'theirs forever.\' Don\'t bother. This movie is here to serve the masses. Don\'t let this crush your soul! Welcome to the world of shounen.Art:...um what\'s there to say? It\'s the same as the show (except for those despicable episodes they call the Bount arc (fillers, EW)!) I mean the characters all looked the same to me. Although I got to see Urahara without his hat on for an extended period of time and was highly pleased. Look, there\'s nothing special to it. And I\'m not all into the art unless it WOWs me and this movie didn\'t wow me with anything special. It was just Bleach\'s look.Sound: Okay so I was moved by the music. I take anime music very seriously and it\'s usually my deciding factor for just about anything. And I don\'t know what it was about this soundtrack but I was moved folks. Absolutely pleased. I was giddy with joy whenever I heard the music. It\'s dark and compelling. I believe it fit perfectly well with each scene the music was incorporated with. It\'s definitely what made me like this movie so much.Character: None of the humans are here (Chad, Orihime (thank god), Uryu). It\'s all Shinigami, all the time. Large doses of Rukia, of course this movie is about her, Ichigo, Kon, Kisuke, Renji, Toushiro, Byakuya. We even have smaller doses of Rangiku, Ikkaku, Yumichika, Ukitake, Cherry blossom man (because I cannot for the LIFE of me ever remember his damn name!), Old man commander, ?Shuuhei? (hmmm...purple hair, black mark on face, resembles Ichigo), Mayuri, Yoruichi, Soi Fon, and Kenny of course (I laughed when he went berserk), and quite a few more. I mean, seriously. Can we say FAN SERVICE?Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this. Haha I know sounds contradictory right? Well I knew what I was expecting when I went into the movie. Hell I even expected something a little less (more goopy mush if you really want to know) and was surprisingly delighted when I was given exactly what I wanted. Hinting at Ichigo and Rukia and a walloping 90 mins of action, a plot you have to read between the lines to find, and all of our favorite Bleach Shinigami.So if your a Bleach fun SUCK IT UP and just watch the damn movie. Don\'t go in all ""Oh my god, this one HAS to be better."" Your gonna be disappointed folks.It\'s all the same stuff.

Same shit, different day.Get over it and move on.', 'The guys who made this movie combined the best elements of the previous 2. The good part of the first movie was the twist about memories and the good of the second was the focus on a character from the series instead of a filler one. So, expect another theme about the importance of memories and lots of centering on the characters. The second movie was about a tragic event in Hitsugaya’s past, this one is about Rukia’s. And yes, it does feel good as a premise as far as filler missions go. The plot was otherwise simple and predictable as it usually is but...at least the main idea of lost memories was enough to care about whatever dramatic attempts this movie had.Production values being so damn high means that even the cheesiest battles looked fine and offered some good choreography at the final dual. Adding cinematics like turning the image slowly to grey or having a sad eerie sound during the flashbacks gave a boost to all those moments where the action just seemed pointless. Also, it felt like a “memberberries” situation, as many flashback scenes are actually taken from the series, including filler arcs. So, it was a sort of summary of what has happened so far and tribute to the evolution of the relationship between Rukia and Ichigo… before it was scrapped for that lame Inoue rescue mission. In any case, you better not watch this movie before the series as it reveals a lot of important events. It still feels weird at times as Rukia and that filler girl had huuuge eyes and the way lips are drawn is a hit or miss. Still, very good overall. And let’s add to this the atmospheric music themes and the very catchy ending song too. Those finer touches actually helped me stay awake through the otherwise cheesy plot.There are still the usual clichés you find in any fighting shounen movie. It is still to the most part a parade of special attacks and the “Let’s save Soul Society for the millionth time” theme is present for once more. And as I said, beyond the initial interesting premise of the story, the plot is cheesy as hell. Soul Society is in danger; Ichigo to the rescue, everyone fights the minions and lets the lead take on the boss. Plus, it gets lamer with one more addition. Remember how in American superhero crossovers the heroes always fight each other when they meet? Just for the heck of it? Well, it is the same with this movie. Ichigo gets to fight EVERYONE he meets as they are supposed to have forgotten him. And yes it makes sense to do that but it gets dull if 50% of the movie is spars between good guys that never result to anything other than advertising their transforming swords. The rest of the story is about a super hollow created by Mayuri, that erases the memories of someone in EVERYONE’S minds… which escapes in the bodies of two children who can teleport… who were trapped in Hueco Mundo for a century… who return to find their good old friend Rukia and punish the tyrannical Shinigamis… and pretty much invade like the defenses in Soul Society are made of rice paper and turn everything to nice wax statues. Damn, movie villains seem to have 10 times the destructive power of the series villains.Ok, if you try to make sense out of it, you won’t find any. This is Bleach we are talking about; remember? Plot holes bigger than Menos Grande are present as we were never really told what the hell was the main enemy. A hollow that could transform from a tiny snake, to a scythe that erases memories, to a gargaduan tentacle freak that turns people to statues? For real now, that thing was supposed to be a simple Hollow? It owned most Espada. And what the hell was that glowing bottle thingy? And how could Urahara go to Soul Society if a barrier was supposed to prevent him from doing so?All I can say is that unlike the previous movies where Ichigo just storms in and beats the villain in a flash, here he is not able to do that right away as the villain can teleport and holds Rukia and two children as hostages. This made things more interesting to watch. Still, the conclusion was predictable and cheesy so don’t keep your hopes up. He finds a way to win even without using his bankai.In all, the story in the first movie is similar yet far better. The drama of the two children fades away pretty fast without any sense on part of the plot. Half of it is pointless duals and the other half is Swiss cheese. Also, the movie assumes Ichigo’s schoolmates or the Arrancar threat don’t exist so that makes it to stand alone and being unable to fit in some filler moment. Ok, theoretically it can be placed after the filler arc concerning the past of several captains as we get to see Mayuri without his mask. Then again, fillers in this series defy time and space so you can place it anywhere you like.Still, the cast is more entertaining than in the other two movies. Although the focus is on Rukia we get to see Mayuri going insane in his lab, Kenpachi going amok in battle, Renji showing care about the person who he doesn’t remember and many more. Thus, at least as far as characters go, they feel less dry than in the previous movies. Heck, they even brought Urahara in the action and had Soi Fong in a half-naked, half-yuri scene. Oh, and Kon was also there to be the comical relief that goes all emo on the loss of Rukia. Very pleasing moments. Not great but still better than before.As for the new characters, those two kids? They had no idea what they were doing. Trying to find their names by making Rukia forget them? WTF? All whining and no meaning. Senna kicks their butts in personality and she was a much weaker fighter without even remembering anything. There is no way you can sympathize them. You can hate them for causing all this trouble out of whining and for torturing poor Rukia like that. Oh, and Rukia? She reverts to the passive damsel in distress who is need of Ichigo to come and save her again. Come on, this got old. Ichigo is always about saving girls than protecting the world from cosmic horrors. The entire Soul Society had turned to a hideous wax statue and all he cared about was saving a chick. Ok…Value and enjoyment ain’t much for the various reasons I mention. This third attempt made some steps forward (more focus on multiple characters) and some backwards (lame whining new characters, plotholes big enough for the Enterprise to fly through). It is still an average time killer if that is all you want. at least the main idea of lost memories was enough to care about whatever dramatic attempts this movie had.Production values being so damn high means that even the cheesiest battles looked fine and offered some good choreography at the final dual.

They even have things tied to Rukia forgotten, like Renji's bankai. It's a nice touch. The soul reapers are dumbasses though, so it's accurate to the show. It's like the soul society arc. The only one with any intelligence is Byakuya, because he unlocked his brain after the soul society arc.The fight at the end is paced well, you can tell what's going on, as opposed to The Diamond Dust Rebellion that kind of became a mess toward the end.

And as a fan, it kinda hurts.There were a lot of gaps throughout the film where I totally lost attention o the things happening as every 5 minutes I would gloss over a freaky flashback of some other Bleach filler that had some similarities of what's going on that it stopped being enjoyable before it even unfolded.Overall (7.26/10):With one movie left to go, it's both sad and happy for me, for once, I get to finally set my Bleach journey to an end (at least until the Anime returns) and happy in the sense that I'm gonna finally take a break from this massive burnout I got during my binge-watch.

Bakuten!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43756/Bakuten,"['When I looked up that Bakuten would be a rhythmic gymnastics anime, I confess I was suspicious. Actually, I was afraid. Last year we had Taisou Zamurai, a show that even with a budget and problems in getting made because of the work of the Mappa studio, was an anime that exceeded most general expectations, even though it was quite limited. But why would this cause me to be surprised to have a new anime that follows the same kind of sport? Well, it is the goal orientation that differentiates the two anime.Unlike Taisou Zamurai, Bakuten focuses on several characters actively connected to the show\'s...sport. This group interaction is a demanding quality of the very construction of each of the characters, since it is Rhythmic Gymnastics, a sport where athletes perform in groups, usually with 6 members. Not only is this formatting fully utilized in the show, but the anime also creates, verbalizes, and positions itself in other groups, from a rival school, to even with the College Club coach himself. Futaba, the protagonist, is an inexperienced kid who, like everyone else, creates a bond out of appreciation for the unfamiliar sport. It is not unusual to think about this. Often, out of prejudice, we imagine that a type of sport has a remarkable quality only in one of the sexes. For example, it is constantly noticeable that we see people saying that Soccer is a sport only for men, or that Volleyball and Handball is focused on women, but Bakuten acts in the opposite way to these social restrictions and creates a new atmosphere within the anime. The show subtly dispels these erroneous ways of thinking and produces a breakdown of expectation in the audience. Futaba, along with us, experiences this sense of integration within the anime without being expository or overdone.If on one hand Bakuten presents a highlight in its accurate setting, the show creates a great process of immersion and interaction between the characters. In fact, much of what happens in the anime comes from the dormitory. Onagawa, Shichigahama, Tsukidate and Watari are the ones who live daily with Futaba within the locality, which at the same time is a process that creates a greater trust inside and outside of the tatami. Misato is the sixth character on the team and enters after the first regional championship, precisely because he feels blocked in the sport, as he has too much personal responsibility. And one cannot only talk about the current athletes. Kurikoma is the cutest character in the show, being the club assistant. Finally, Shida is the club manager and coach of the team. He was similar to Misato in many ways. In fact, the resemblance was so great that it was frightening. Shida was a brilliant gymnast. Maybe the best at that time. However, his self-centeredness did not allow him to trust and believe in the evolution of younger and unprepared people. Futaba is the essential channel for Shida\'s overcoming.However, an anime like Bakuten needs movement and impact, doesn\'t it? That\'s right! The biggest problem in expecting quality from a show like Bakuten is the form and effect the anime causes during the climax of its actions and gestures. Zexcs studio is not really a safety when it comes to offering a quality in their shows. In fact, opening their anime page and coming across things like Diabolik Lovers is not a positive for Bakuten. Even with that, it was a studio that evolved dramatically and displayed incredible competence and skill in the overall ornaments and choreography of the characters. The use of computer graphics (CG) is great within the show and attention is also focused on the more superficial details. Within a gymnastics show, mistakes and penalties happen all the time. The anime bravely ensured this and made a great production in the very rich moments. The show brought with it an aspect of realism, which also allows it to show that even if the club has a great evolution with time, it is necessary to train more and more, to reach the National tournament, for example.Going back to the characters, I have to applaud the author of this show. The formation of the main group was different at first sight, but a friendship formed over time. As the show expands the future of the characters, the past is recounted impressively. For example, Onagawa is one of the founding students of the club at the high school. He suited up to be the club\'s famous ""number one"" and put together a primitive team with Shichigahama and Tsukidate. However, his quality as an athlete is evidently not easy to achieve. His own process of transformation within the show is visible in the second half of the show. Since the entrance of Misato, the boy wonder, Onagawa has felt charged to evolve in order not to be ""outdone."" Even though he could try and train much harder, he reserved himself mentally and gave his activities a rest (with a fake injury), to rehabilitate himself and help the whole group. Misato, along with everyone else, was inspired by the sport through Shida, but at the same time that gymnastics has taken him to great places and awards, he has an internal frustration. Without his parents, he has lived with his aunt ever since, which has given him a sense of importance with people. However, the same responsibility he carries does not help him emotionally inside the tatami, because of an accident in the sport two years ago. This internal block did not lead to Misato\'s evolution. Even if he was a brilliant athlete, being second in the National tournament, being too resilient and thoughtful, and charging himself too much are aspects that formed his mind and created a self-defense. This hard and rigid shell was only really broken down from the moment Futaba encourages him and provides emotional support during the episodes. Even though this only materialized in episode 9, from the very beginning the two helped each other. The union of this duo with the rest of the team is not only a great choice, but it allowed for different themes and views on what the sport really means to each one.I should also point out the comedy of the anime. Bakuten is not entirely focused on training and competitions. Many striking moments come from a joke, an entertainment or a joke. Even during intensive training with the Shiro High School team, our beloved group keeps its jovial essence and creates a gentle and liberating atmosphere. The hide-and-seek episode for example was one of the funniest in the show for me. All the pressure level created because of the championships is softened and ironized in a single episode dedicated especially for this moment. (I still want to know who is the scary character that appeared to the boys, it gave me a fright, Lol).Finally, many moments make for a great show like Bakuten. The staff\'s work is a great proof of artistic evolution and allows us to broaden our attention and our gaze on animes with different themes than the common ones. Remember Mashiro no Oto? Then, Bakuten is another show that knew what to do from the very first episode, created sublime moments, and surprised in numerous aspects, from the formation of the characters, to even the apexes, which demanded of the studios. Shin-Ei was a studio that improved its own reputation with Mashiro no Oto. For Bakuten, Zexcs was most responsible for this great technical execution of an original anime. It\'s really a pleasure to have followed 12 episodes with quality. I look forward to the movie of the show, which can offer us much more! And long live sports! sport. This group interaction is a demanding quality of the very construction of each of the characters, since it is Rhythmic Gymnastics, a sport where athletes perform in groups, usually with 6 members. Not only is this formatting fully utilized in the show, but the anime also creates, verbalizes, and positions itself in other groups, from a rival school, to even with the College Club coach himself.

And I was right. It is. In the first episode, we get to watch a performance held by the boys of Ao High. The animation in this anime switches consistently from 3D back to 2D, since there's a lot of formations and movement during the performance. This switch doesn't affect the art style too bad, so it works out. I don't really mind the...input of CGI during the performances. I'm sure it makes the animation process much easier since there's a lot of vertical movement. Then again, I appreciate dance, animated or not. The animation is well-done too; one scene that made me realize how much I liked the animation was when Futaba was carrying his duffel bags. His little waddle was cute and realistic.The camera work/angles are amazing on top of the soundtrack. Sport anime soundtracks hit different. The story itself is so wholesome. Shoutarou Futaba is an incoming high schooler who is inspired by a performance put on by the boys at Ao High School.All of the characters are cute. My current favorite is Watari, the green hair dude.

A good watch covering a niche sport. It's not very deep and follows a lot of common tropes and stereotypes, but it follows them well and overall this anime is enjoyable to watch. For more detail, please keep reading and see my recommendations at the end.When starting Bakuten I was expecting very little but ended up pleasantly surprised. The overall level of this anime ranges from average to good with very little in the way of any major negative points. At most a few personal nitpicks which I will cover. For me the biggest draw is the overall enjoyment....Call me a bit of a sucker, but I do like the stereotypical sports anime. MC is your average (usually teen) Joe Blogs, he sees or encounters a sport that he has never seen before and is blown away by the experience, and the anime follows his journey in learning about and developing his skills for said sport. The story itself is interspersed with supporting characters, a rival character / team and some small personal side stories for said side characters. Bakutenn!! doesn't deviate far if at all from this. Again, I am a bit of a sucker for this formula. The MC being brand new means you get to learn alongside them as they do, so you do not feel completely left out when they start talking about sports terminologies. As a badminton player I can relate as I've had similar experiences and met people with similar experiences within the sport. Some people may not enjoy it as much due to how generic the formula can be, but that is completely understandable.The characters themselves are enjoyable but generic. The MC being a blank slate, so you get to insert yourself into their situation. On the team there's the muscle jock, the calm and quiet guy, the nerdy happy-go-lucky guy, the brooding guy, the aloof guy etc. It doesn't push the boat out and if you've watched other sports anime you'll see the similarities (and also recognize the voice actors), but as mentioned earlier while it does not push the boat out in both story or characters it uses them well, and they are enjoyable to watch. It's because the story is a bit generic that I feel safe in writing an early review, as I don't think it will hinge on the story.A major plus for me was just how positive this anime was. The overall level of positivity was refreshing. Maybe it's been other recent anime I've seen, or maybe lockdown is finally getting to me, but the positivity in this anime was infectious. I liked seeing the characters help each other through their situations, and their enjoyment rubbed off on me as I was watching them. There's no major dramatics or dark twists. It kept things nice, simple and upbeat. A good change of pace for myself.The only negatives I could mention, and I'd say they are more personal, would be the sound and art. The sound in terms of the OP and ED and BGM is good, if a bit forgettable. I won't remember it down the line, but I didn't mind hearing it. I will say the sounds of the gymnastics floors and crash mats is rather well done in this anime. The art is the only thing I have a gripe and it comes down to the use of 3D. I don't hate 3D but I like consistency. For the big gymnastic performances it will switch to 3D to show them off. It makes the movement more fluid with longer, continuous scenes, which makes a lot of sense, but I found the change from 2D to 3D a little off-putting myself. Not a major negative and one I was happy to overlook, but just something to keep in mind.In summary; I gave Bakutenn!! A solid 7/10. It's not genre defining, but I think it fits within the genre of niche sports anime very well. An overall enjoying watch and time sink.For a further recommendation if you liked Bakutenn!! I have to point you in the direction of Ballroom e Youkoso. Another niche sports anime following ballroom dancing. Following a similar formula as the one I mentioned above but with 24 episodes allowing the characters and story to be a bit more fleshed out. Personally one I prefer more to Bakuten!! in terms of overall quality.For a slightly different second recommendation, I will go with Kono Oto Tomare! While this anime is a music focused anime, I find sports anime and music anime hit a lot of the same notes (hah) with their formula.  With Kono having 2 seasons, and a similar number of episodes to Ballroom, it's a bit more fleshed out. Similar to Bakutenn I enjoyed its positive approach and it was also very fun to watch.Thanks for reading my review. Call me a bit of a sucker, but I do like the stereotypical sports anime.

And you can just tell that he absolutely loves Rhythm Gymnastics but they really did not deserve such a good OST.The characters have no personality and are literally just cardboard cutouts. The main character is like literally any other sports anime protagonist, in that he saw the sport and admired the team and decided that he wanted to do the sport.There is literally no flavor to the characters and the story is very standard. Except for episode five, whatever the heck that...was.The shift into the CGI is jarring and pretty terrible. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the 3D CGI in general, but it's just..... bad.

The 2D and scenery is pretty, but other than that it's not great.The character designs are also very similar and they all kind of have the same face.Honestly I'm very sad because I was very hyped for the anime before it came out, but it just didn't deliver.

At first I wasn't a big fan of the 3d animation, but honesty has grown on me. The soundtrack is good aswell.One thing that I really liked about Bakuten was the character development and just the characters in general. Each character has their own unique personality. And its funny how they all have conflicting personalities yet their bond is so strong. Overall I would give this anime a...1000000000000000000/10 1000000000000000000/10"", 'Having heard the show was about rhythmic gymnastics, I was a bit sceptical on how it would go. I didn\'t have any expectations entering the show and was left feeling pretty light hearted.I hate to admit it, but Bakuten is just a ball of sport anime tropes and stereotypes. It has everything you can imagine, from the situations right down to the typical characters. That\'s not to say it\'s not enjoyable, just that it\'s not anything new. The only difference is that it tackles a totally different sport. A ""fruity"" one as some would say.The animation is really nice, solid 8, maybe even...9. I didn\'t notice anything weird about the movements when they\'re performing, but maybe that\'s just because I\'m not good at spotting things like that. The soundtrack is also an 8, I love the OP and ED. The story itself is pretty generic, but still heart-warming. Filled with inspiring moments, competition that have mirror-like personalities to the main cast, injuries etc. it\'s what you\'d expect of a sports anime.The MC is also quite generic compared to most MC\'s of sports animes. He\'s really nothing special, and pretty average, actually. Then you have the genius best friend, who\'s obviously been doing this his whole life. An aggressive/scary teammate, one who\'s calm and keeps the captain in check, a competitive captain and another member obsessed with a particular idol(?). No one really sticks out. (Though pretty interesting that some of these personality types were interested in gymnastics, I never would\'ve guessed. They\'re what you\'d expect of other sports teams though)But I still enjoyed it. It\'s nothing special, hence the 6. I wouldn\'t watch it again, but if you\'re a fan of the sports genre, I\'d recommend this after listing off other sports animes. It\'s a change of pace from other sports, that\'s for sure. The animation is insane sometimes, and I love the theme of ""soaring"" and ""flying"" that they associate with gymnastics. Bakuten definitely has its moments, and for a rhythmic gymnastics anime, it\'s not too bad. Overall, I didn\'t find this a waste of time and I found myself thoroughly enjoying some parts :) 9.

I\'m really not a fan of sports anime, except for Yuri!! On Ice I\'ve dropped every single sports anime I started watching. But Bakuten!! really got me! (I actually feel like people who liked YOI for the story/sport might actually really like this anime as well!)Though the story isn\'t really anything special or different from other sports anime (random guy picks interest in a sport after seeing someone doing it very well), you can\'t help but enjoy the whole series. The characters are endearing, each with their different personalities and...quirkiness, but their interactions are so cute and hilarious most of the time, you just can\'t help but like every one of them, even if they\'re from the opposite team. The animation is top tier, I got interested in it when they dropped a video of their routine on the first episode and I got so shocked with how good they used the CGI for presentation parts, the fluidity of movements, the whole fact that they switch from 2D to 3D and back so nicely and in a way it complements the story and doesn\'t bother the viewing at all. Even the 2D scenes are extremely well made and so far I don\'t have any complaints about flaws in animation or continuity.The soundtrack is also something to be talked about, all the songs are really nice and complement the story extremely well, the OP and ED are also no-skips, the opening actually being sung by Centimilimental, the same ones who sang Given opening.So far this has been a top tier anime and an extremely pleasant surprise in my sports anime history, the episodes are very well-paced (I especially like the filler episode kinda horror-themed, felt like a nice breather and was so hilarious), you can feel the emotions and conflicts with the characters very closely and, honestly, I had never felt goosebumps while watching a ""match/presentation"" scene as I did with Bakuten!!, I was super into it and on the edge of my toes thinking about how well they would do in their routine.So far, 9 out of 10, but if the other episodes are as well made quality and story-wise as the ones thus far, I might actually change my score to 10! quirkiness, but their interactions are so cute and hilarious most of the time, you just can\'t help but like every one of them, even if they\'re from the opposite team.

The senpais have distinct personalaties, but the two kouhais are just the same story, genius aloof guy, and entusiastic guy.If you're a fan of gymnastics take a look, but don't go in think will be another yuri on ice. "", ""Overall: 6I really enjoyed this show, but it's nothing special. If you're looking for a nice 'lie down and mindlessly watch' kinda anime, I'd really recommend this one. It's visually appealing and not hard to follow. The reason for my average score is because that's what it is, average. Let me explain.Story: 4The story is exactly what the synopsis says, and the same overused trope in anime. Student stumbles upon a club, becomes fascinated in it, and joins the club to try to do what they do. They don't really add much to that basic plot, which makes it repetitive. It's not inherently bad, but...it does nothing special, nor tries to. At least not in the story.Art: 8The art style itself is also very average. However, it is nicely animated, bringing life into the movement. Typically, the shots show the main group talking to each other, but they're not animated with one movement. They're all animated separately with their own seperate actions, which I find nice. The animation really shines when they're performing. 3D programs are used for the wider shots, but it's split with 2D animation when character expressions are important.  When animated, It's very fluid for the budget it was probably given as a seasonal anime.Sound: 8I am a huge fan of the op and ed of this show. The op was made by the same band who made much of Given's music, and I love all of their music. This is no exception. The music perfectly shows the audience how the characters feel when they're performing. The ed is also very calm and reminds you that this is just a simple, relaxing show.Character: 3They introduce too many characters. The main 6 characters are necessary, even though some of them have little personality. the coach and manager are nice background characters with enough individuality to make you like them. The characters in their rival team are mostly completely unnecessary, with the exception of Mashiro, who has a connection with another character. The entire rival team is just reflections of the main cast, and it's hard to keep track of everyone. The only characters who are really expanded upon are Futaba and Misato, who have a sweet relationship. The four others in the main team all have one thing (object or activity) that is their personality. It's extremely flat and unoriginal.Enjoyment: 7Regardless of the criticism, I enjoyed watching this anime every week. It was a nice way to just lie down and mindlessly watch.Overall: 6This anime, as I have stated before, is very average and unoriginal. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I am excited to see how the newly announced movie turns out. it does nothing special, nor tries to.

I\'m happy about how this anime wasn\'t popular enough to have a fanbase as annoying as SK8 that took down my experience every time I got on twitter.With this theme, I was prepared for something full of queerbaiting and shallow sport (which is no demerit to me), however only the second part happened. Of course, no one wanted a anime video lecture about male gymnastics, but it was always a subject that I was interested and followed.That\'s why disappointed me how easy it was for the protagonist, who was not a genius and had...never practiced the sport before, dominated everything so fast to the point that 12 episodes have already been competing with the boys who have been doing it for years. My thinking is that a baby steps mode would be best for this case, after all it\'s not as simple a thing as ""tag you\'re It"". The short number of episodes ordered gives the need for urgency, but i didn\'t buy so well.The generic dramas they are inserted are sometimes nebulous and shallow, but they are quick to explain why they are that way. For me the most interesting thing was the teacher who was a talented star thay after an injury finds himself lost in a world where he must live as a normal and almost hopeless person. Just the kind of person he disliked so much, brutal.It implies to me how much the boys who make up the team are not even close to having that impact. The bespectacled boy who just nods and talks well about the hot red-haired captain (Free! Mood) is completely forgettable even though he\'s been there from the beginning. The green haired boy is a total waste, his mob personality is very funny and I hope he will be exploited in the future. Shotaro is what we call a dreamy protagonist who doesn\'t have that much talent, but tries very hard to be excellent, so he can inspire new kids to get into the sport. He\'s satisfying. Unlike the team star, he is shallow and predictable like a transparent door. The direction can\'t even explain how he is so above average as they say, the only trick used is that horrid white-haired character who appears to be annoying and talented, as we\'ve seen in other animes of the genre.I don\'t like to judge with so few episodes, I know that in the future new characters will be developed, but I hope they will be treated in a more intelligent way. I also doesn\'t like the animation style they used at the time of the presentations, but it\'s very acceptable. The final performance is one of the most beautiful things of the year, with the brawny, sweaty boys glowing in the gym lights after so much battle. Here was managed to convey the feeling of reward for having seen all the episodes, cheering for them fly.Keep flying boys, and bringing artistic gymnastics to more boys who might be interested in something so beautiful. never practiced the sport before, dominated everything so fast to the point that 12 episodes have already been competing with the boys who have been doing it for years.

I only watched it because I was recommended it. Turns out it wasn't a bad experience at all.Like most sports anime stories the goal for the team is to make it to nationals. Pretty standard story formula. However, this anime focuses more on the characters rather than the plot itself. It explores the reasons why each character is doing artistic gymnastics and their motivations for working so hard. It focuses more on Shoutarou and the ace prodigy, Misato than the rest of the team.The scope of the plot is...relatively small considering Shoutarou is literally a beginner in rhythmic gymnastics. I had concerns about how the anime was going to pace itself when the main character was a complete beginner but to my surprise, the show manages to do a lot with 12 episodes. Part of the reason why it was able to work with the concept of having a beginner was because it focuses on the characters. The rival team that was introduced definitely was able to flesh out the dynamic of the characters and add different interactions for the characters. Unfortunately, most of the characters on the other team are only slightly developed and don’t add too much to the story. The important ones being the captain of the other team and more importantly the ace, Mashiro serving stronger roles.The atmosphere of the story can be described as lighthearted yet perfectly captures important moments where characters can really feel the weight that they carry.CharactersThis is where the story really shines, it manages to explore and flesh out each character from the team. We learn about their goals and motivation for doing rhythmic gymnastics. We find out that most characters were inspired by other people doing rhythmic gymnastics, making them want to start the sport. While the characters are likable, they don’t differ too much from characters we have already seen before like a dense simple-minded captain, a quiet nerd that is good at studying, a guy that just goes with the flow, and a loud guy. Not to mention that they also have their own individual interests to flesh them out as well. I really liked the dynamic of the character interactions between Shoutarou, Misato, and Mashiro. With Shoutarou and Mashiro being total opposites in terms of experience and Shoutarou and Misato being the opposite in terms of personality.I also want to say that food definitely played a big part in this story. The idea of food bringing people together isn’t adding anything new, but it just adds to the sense of bonding as a team and spending time together. Not only can we see them spending time together in practice, but they also spend time outside of practice getting to know each other. This is able to bring them closer as a team and be more realistic.The art and animation are nothing special and at times the art can be a bit subpar especially if the characters are further back in a scene. CGI is used for rhythmic gymnastic dance routines because otherwise, that would be too costly to draw by hand. Honestly, I don’t dislike it when the routines were done with CGI. I had to admit that I was drawn in when there was a dance routine on the screen. The CGI does stand out slightly meaning that you can definitely tell that it’s CGI that breaks the immersion of watching the anime.The sound doesn’t really stand out in any way and I’m also not the type of person to pay too much attention to soundtracks or opening and endings. The opening was average and nothing too memorable and the same thing could be said about the ending. One thing about the sound that I did notice was when they were doing a dance routine, each time that they landed or tumbled it did add to the experience of watching them dance.I also appreciated that the show didn’t rush the story to be a stand-alone series because that would have been a mess. Glad that they're creating a movie to wrap up the ending of the story.A big part of enjoying sports anime is having an interest in the sport that it focuses on. I personally wasn’t going to watch this and I was going to drop it after 3 episodes, but I’m glad I gave it a chance and finished it. It turned out to be a very enjoyable watch that didn't try to achieve too much. Solid 7/10. relatively small considering Shoutarou is literally a beginner in rhythmic gymnastics.

What a ride, a pleasant one.For something so simplistic as its plot focused on rhythmic gymnastics, this show truly conveys a lot of emotions and experiences that are hella enjoyable, and that makes it one of the greatest shows of the season imo.The story, as I said, it's very simplistic yet effective: the rhythmic gymnastics club and their journey to the junior tournament. For the introduction of the club members to their coach and manager- hell, even their rivals; each of our main characters had their own little backstory that added a spark to the story. Certainly, the show focused a lot...on those details, like the interactions between characters, their growth, and how to relate to each dynamic. The friendship between the team members and their struggles seemed pretty real, it made me feel the lightness the show's aesthetic and storytelling had conveyed. I really appreciate how the show was more focused on their character's development rather than solely just the sport. Also, the show's sense of humor is very amusing haha I just love the way they carried the whole Mysterious Coach's Wife and the hide and seek episode.There are still some unanswered questions like Misato's parents or details for the Shiro Highschool Team members but I'm pretty sure that they will eventually have their own lil arc once the movie comes out or even future seasons.The art is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed it so much! When I found out that Zexcs was the studio in charge, I couldn't help but hesitate. They are known for Diabolik Lovers, and I'm pretty sure that is something very overwhelming if you know about the show lol. However, there is undoubtedly a major improvement from DL saga and Bakuten: the character designs, the artstyle, the aesthetic, in general, was a total upgrade and how they decided to implement CGI was pretty satisfying. I guess everyone worries a lot about CGI but in this show is well used.I'm still amazed about the panoramics and visual effects for certain moments. From Shotaro's first impression of his current team to his sensations while doing the handstand with Mashiro, the visuals were almost magical and made me feel chills every time Shotaro discovered something. That also applies to the show's more sad moments! The setting created for those moments was so well done... I'm still thinking about his conversation with Misato, Misato's struggle with a certain part of the choreo or Shichigahama's determination scenes.I would like to also give major props to the choreography team! The show couldn't have been possible without the amazing choreos shown here. Each choreo seemed to fit perfectly with the vibes of each team and that's a fantastic aspect to remark along with the music. Surely Shiro HS Team had a very spicy performance, one of my favorite routines in my very vast one of anime performances.Now, bringing back the characters, I felt really engaged with every single one of them, and it may be due to how each character had a special characteristic in their personalities. Surely, our MC, Shotaro, is an emotional little bean, discovering a whole new world in the field or getting to know his teammates and rivals. How he acted in certain situations and interacted with the cast was so charming... Same for Misato! I'm used to your typical character with a stoic personality or resting bitch face but, somehow, with how cold-minded was Misato, seeing him flustered or nervous about something was very amusing~ I may be biased but the whole show made me appreciate the way characters behaved.I would talk about the rest of the characters- For real! Each one of them is special- for a long time but I want to mention two things regarding characters: Mashiro was such a good character, his range from being this cute fluffy boy to a serious and passionate athlete amused me. And lastly... The confrontation in the tournament between both captains... That was so damn attractive and that says a lot. It's the way each character embraces the positiveness of competition, how their rivalry is healthy, and share the same goals that make these tense moments so good. Not gonna lie, the confrontation made me a big Takase fan, since my boy Shichigahama was already best boy lolSo, in the end, Bakuten was amazing. I'm pretty sure this show can be considered a comfort one, with how fluffy, funny and relatable it was. I would totally do a rewatch of this show on a very bad day just because of those facts. And you, people, should watch it too! That's an overall 9 out of 10 and I will probably rate it a perfect 10 if I rewatch this show enough times to convince me that it's a masterpiece lol on those details, like the interactions between characters, their growth, and how to relate to each dynamic.

They carefully thought out what's best for every scene. When it calls for a dramatic scene, the atmosphere changes, and they do it well showcasing that. The music (sound) was perfect! I fell in love with the overall soundtrack, including the OP and ED. It captured the atmosphere really well! Especially the opponent's performance. (I forgot the name of the school tho lmao) It...was fiery and I got goosebumps watching it. The art is also great here. I know some people think that CGI is a minus for an anime show. But this show handled it really well! The way they blend CGI with 2D animation during the performances wasn't that bad at all! It was fluid. I caught myself mesmerized and dizzy because of the angle shots BUT I STILL LOVED IT! HAHATo be honest, I didn't expect much of this show. I saw Skate-Leading Stars and that show kind of sucked for me especially when it comes to the performances. But I decided to give it a shot because of the sport; Gymnastics. The other gymnastics anime that I loved was Taisou Samurai. The obvious difference is that Taisou Samurai showcases a solo routine while Bakuten!! required a group or a team. I loved Taisou Samurai and I thought it was one of the hidden gems last Fall 2020. So is Bakuten!!Overall, I love it. Give it a try. was fiery and I got goosebumps watching it.

So is Bakuten!!Overall, I love it. Give it a try."", ""I don't know if anyone else got the vibe that Bakuten!! was a mix of Haikyuu!! and Prince of Stride, but that's certainly how I felt. It felt like that tone of Prince of Stride and the character relationships and major plot points of a kind of knock-off Haikyuu!! Even so, there was, for me, a lot of originality in this series. I'm gonna start off with the demerits this anime gets because I very much liked this anime despite those, so it seems fitting to start with the few things I didn't like.For one, the characters were absolutely not as developed as I would...have liked them to have been, but given that this anime has a 12 episode run, that's not surprising. Actually, I felt like the major points of these characters' personalities more or less filled the gaps. Still, I would have liked to see more done with the character relationships. That's equally the case because Bakuten!! isn't quite the same as other sports anime. There aren't tournaments for this team to participate in where they're doing performance after performance, and the performances are simply improvements on what's already been shown. But that's the nature of rhythmic gymnastics--it's not like baseball or volleyball. That being said, with all the extra space in this anime between performances, taking a more concentrated look at the characters would have helped it when it felt slow.I'd like to say that I disliked the super CGI animation of the performances, but actually, the very first performance shown in this anime is what convinced me to watch the whole thing. It blew me away because of the choreography, and so I didn't really mind the style of animation.My gripe with this anime is actually the reason I love it so much: the characters. Even though their relationships didn't get highlighted as much as they might have with a longer run, I still felt drawn in. I think that's because this isn't really a main character kind of anime. Certainly there are parts where Misato or Shoutarou take center stage, but for the most part, it's an ensemble cast. That makes it easy to want to come back to these characters and see how their struggle to make it to InterHigh is going. I also felt like the high-stakes emotional aspects of this anime were done fairly well for it being such a simple plot. There are a couple places it falls flat, but there are a few moments that actually made me quite emotional or nervous or happy, and I didn't expect that from an anime like this.Everything else around Bakuten!! is your typical sports anime. The goals are the same, the team development is the same, and I don't think anyone will be surprised by the ending. However, Bakuten!! still draws on emotion well and creates a set of characters that are worth the time to follow and love. I look forward to the movie because getting to see this group again excites me. have liked them to have been, but given that this anime has a 12 episode run, that's not surprising.

That being said, with all the extra space in this anime between performances, taking a more concentrated look at the characters would have helped it when it felt slow.I'd like to say that I disliked the super CGI animation of the performances, but actually, the very first performance shown in this anime is what convinced me to watch the whole thing. It blew me away because of the choreography, and so I didn't really mind the style of animation.My gripe with this anime is actually the reason I love it so much: the characters. Even though their relationships didn't get highlighted as much as they might have with a longer run, I still felt drawn in. I think that's because this isn't really a main character kind of anime. Certainly there are parts where Misato or Shoutarou take center stage, but for the most part, it's an ensemble cast. That makes it easy to want to come back to these characters and see how their struggle to make it to InterHigh is going. I also felt like the high-stakes emotional aspects of this anime were done fairly well for it being such a simple plot. There are a couple places it falls flat, but there are a few moments that actually made me quite emotional or nervous or happy, and I didn't expect that from an anime like this.Everything else around Bakuten!! is your typical sports anime. The goals are the same, the team development is the same, and I don't think anyone will be surprised by the ending. However, Bakuten!! still draws on emotion well and creates a set of characters that are worth the time to follow and love. I look forward to the movie because getting to see this group again excites me."", ""I mean who doesn't love a good sports anime.I personally really enjoy sports animes so I wasn't very surprised to have enjoyed this as much as I did. However I was thoroughly impressed by how well they managed to animate the gymnastics itself since it isn't the easiest thing to animate I would imagine.Honestly if you like sports animes you'll probably get a good kick out of watching this, definitely recommend it. I'm surprised it didn't garner more attention like Sk8 or Haikyuu, I'm still passive aggressively trying to get my friends to watch it though...Oh, and of course the characters were all...fun and loveable which I find is absolutely crucial for a good sports anime! fun and loveable which I find is absolutely crucial for a good sports anime!"", 'Hard work beats talent!

There is lack of tangible “combat” in tournaments because readable variation in competence is just not possible with the sport in question. In Haikyuu ball hit hard and score goal ooh aah aah!! Sometime block!! Lanky boy ooh ooh! Then oOUT OOOUTTT Ahhh AhOooHh!! Haikyuu, Kuroke No Basket, Baby Steps and other such ilk just have far more understandable systems of scoring, owed to them by their more directly combative sports.I think this is the main problem of this anime for me. It doesn’t make a great “sports anime”, and it’s only a somewhat decent slice of life anime with a sports tint. It lacks the most compelling elements of both genres. Though it does get close in the presentation at times. I also don’t want to be overly harsh because narratively and pacing wise, this was no misery to watch.

It's yet another sports club anime with a newbie at it's center, a way strong rival school and ensuing shenanigans whenever it's not about the sport. Oh and of course there's the obligatory 'But this is the last year we can do this with our Senpais!!!' Nothing new really but its execution is solid and you easily get dragged along on the journey.That is in part thanks to the characters. All with their very distinctive personalities which make them easy to understand without seeming superficial. People argue and are confronted with personal issues and they...learn from those things and our main team grows together quite a bit.The rival team has great personalities as well though. While we don't have enough time with them to get to know them as well as the main team, they do each have similar personality types to one of our main team with at most 2 exceptions. Misato's counterpart is vague at best while Futaba's counterpart is straight up oposite to him in nearly every way.Anyway, characters aren't the only thing that makes this anime work.The art and sound design are fairly nice and the animation as well is quite good. I'm not a big fan of the CG used to animate the routines but it isn't bad or anything.My only big issue with the animation is the camera-handling during performances. Personally, I think the camera moves way too much to be able to keep up with what's going on. I had trouble appreciating the routines that were thought up because I could barely keep up with what was happening which lead to me feeling underwhelmed. I appreciate the close-ups of the members faces at some points and I understand that during the tumbling parts you want to put the focus on those that are doing the tubling but with too many changing angles and sometimes swithing camera lenses and all the moving around I feel it was just too much. To me it felt like it was taking away from the amazement and beauty mens rhythmic gymnastics can have.Take that complaint with a grain of salt though as I am used to seeing those performances from a very much unmoving camery angle thanks to watching a bunch of videos online.At the end of the day I still enjoyed the ride and would certainly call it an anime worth watching. learn from those things and our main team grows together quite a bit.The rival team has great personalities as well though.

The characters are fully fleshed out and each have their own personalities.We get to enjoy the wonderful humor and I always find myself chuckling or laughing loudly at the jokes given in each episode, as well as appreciate the seriousness when things become serious.The animation...of gymnastics is especially beautiful, I really really have to give credit to the hard working and talented people who helped to animate the gymnastics scenes.

I still remember the time the moment the show hooked me to itself, it was same with shoutarou, when he was watching all his senpai's performing despite not fulfilling the require members for competition. You really have to give it to the people behind this anime, for how they decided to put the dancing gymnastic moves on the screen.

This really is an example of a piece of work in which a simple story well presented and executed translates to a warming, and wholesome series where one can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the charade of fun and happiness.Bakuten!! is set in the ever growing sport anime genre. Unlike the frequently used sports like basketball, tennis, soccer, Bakuten!! takes a detour to a sport rarely discussed (well, not on mainstream level) with gymnastics; rhythmic gymnastics. The setting and plot subtly blows away the fog of societal norms where a sport is tagged by gender, without explicitly focusing its whole attention...on it. Gymnasts tend to often have female athletes being discussed in all of its topics and men always associated with track and field events. But when introduced to the first episode and first performance of the series, it simply shows that sports is for everyone; and this thoughts leads us to the general and overarching theme of the series: desire.""What do I want to do?"" ""Who do I want to be?"" The show makes it clear from the beginning that no matter how small or grand it is, everyone definitely has a form of desire within them. These are some of the very first dialogues thrust to us into the series, which kicks off with the main protagonist of the show: Shoutarou Futaba. Futaba, throughout his junior high days, was a fan of sports but never really made it big for himself in whatever sport he took up. He was a benchwarmer at best. He comes across a few gymnasts on his way in school going somewhere and got word that a rhythmic gymnastics high school tournament was ongoing. He decides to attend on a whim since he\'s an enthusiast of sports. Of course when he got there, his mind was blown away. With the amazing CGI animation that perfectly captures the movement of such athletes in the anime, it was without a doubt amazing not to Shoutarou alone, but some anime viewers as well. In his final year of junior high, he decides and opts to join the school in which their performance made goosebumps run into his veins.Shoutarou is now used as a mechanic to explore the other characters and themes throughout the series. The setting lays a foundation of the same ambitions from people both from two different sides. Those that are new or have been a rhythmic gymnast for a couple of years (the high schoolers), and the ones who have vast experience in the field and as adults, may have one regret or the other (though Bakuten!! really focused on one adult specifically). Shoutarou is introduced to the small male gymnastics club with very few but eccentric members. This also basically shows how the sport isn\'t a global spectacle compared to the likes of soccer, basketball, etc. From the ever loving Yakuza movie fanatic, to an idol lover, to the stoic and somewhat unsociable one, the club was few in members (literally to the point of not having the standard number for a team) but they all had their stories which where briefly discussed and this leads up to the abovementioned main theme of the series: desire.The club maybe as I mentioned had lovable characters that just made you love the series as you progressed. Sometimes it may be seen as comedic relief but who has done and said dumb things when they were high school lol. And these students form one side of the flip coin; the newbies of the sport. To balance this, an adult with prior experience in the game is fixed into the story. This is where I feel the story excels even more. Giving such an experienced individual into the series gives it a somewhat mature tone that balances the generic madness of high school teenagers. The club members grow to take the advice and wordings of the coach as they see him as someone they respect and has a better knowledge in the field than them irrespective of their determination. And the coach (adult) sees himself as a younger version in the young talents and foresees what may have gone wrong during his time and makes amends to better himself for him and the people around him.The animation of the series and the OSTs go hand in hand. The casual animation from start to finish maintained its quality alongside the suiting CGI movements incorporated in their routine and stage performances. The soundtracks during routines and performances are harmony and perfect synchronisation with their movements. Just the thud from the mat they bounce off gives a suiting feeling. Oh, and the opening and ending sequences? Yeah, that was gorgeous. The OP sets the jovial tone for the episode you are about to hop onto, and no matter how the episodes ends, whether on a high note for the characters or not, the ED will always be pleasurable entering into the next episode (I binged it, so that\'s how I felt really).Not everything or story out there has to be a masterpiece to be enjoyed. Simple stories tend to give the warmest of feelings within some viewers. It\'s not a very high stake anime compared to its counterparts, but it\'s a wholesome show one can watch if you have nothing to do.Thanks to those who read from start to end.

It' one of my favorite genres. but i felt like he sports anime these days are less sports and more drama. What with Skate Leading Stars, Wave Surfing Yappe, and so many others who just conveniently skipped the sport part, it was refreshing.The anime hitches you from the very beginning, so there's no doubt that you want to watch it from the very first episode.

(we musn\'t forget the exclamation marks) was initially just the seasonal sports anime that caught my eye. As a casual sports anime enjoyer, of course I wanted to go check it out.Initially, I didn\'t have very high expectations for the anime itself, since gymnastics and such don\'t have a very good record, but I still wanted to give it a shot anyway. It actually did pass my expectations, and turned out to be a lot better than I first imagined.Story: 7Bakuten\'s storyline isn\'t really anything special in my opinion, boy wants to join a club after seeing one of their...performances, the club had limited members, boy joins said club once he transfers to high school and learns the sport. At first, I felt quite bored actually since it was kind of like a template formula sports anime use, especially with the cliche metaphor of the birds ""soaring"". However, what makes me give this show a 7 in story was that it was unique in a way where the plot didn\'t need a mysterious or sad backstory for the protagonist/s to keep the audience going. It was refreshing to see just the protagonist, Shotaro Futaba, genuinely have a loving and supporting family. He wasn\'t this flashy character that had a unique skillset or distinguishing features, and Bakuten handled that type of protagonist well. The show felt down to earth (apart from the extremely fast learning from the protagonist, but that can be ignored) and genuinely felt relaxing to watch. It wasn\'t too intense, and that\'s what I like about it.Art: 9The art and animation just felt great. It felt great to finally see this type of anime be animated well, where the choreography could be captured in an apleasing manner for the audience. The art uses bright colours and simplicity which matches the positive tones in the show. The CGI performances for the gymnastics choreography was great, I felt some of the choreography felt limited for each performance therefore not making any of them stand out especially, but that is a minor issue that is outshined by the smooth CGI.Sound: 6The sound and music was fair, nothing really stood out to me however it wasn\'t bad either. I would have liked to see a variety of genres of music for each team that performed, but it\'s acceptable.Character: 7The characters in the show don\'t get too much development, but the one that I felt got a good amount of attention was the coach. (I\'ll be going into minor spoilers in this section of the review). The coach was definitely one of my favourite characters in the show, I found the joke behind his wife pretty funny and his backstory was definitely interesting. I really like how down to earth the coach is, the message being spread that people can 100% change. It feels like this sort of concept isn\'t used too often, of course we have Kageyama from Haikyuu, however his character was more focused on changING. The Coach we see in Bakuten has already moved on, and has suffered consequences from his past mistakes. I absolutely love that he then uses his knowledge to teach others and he does care for each of his students. In my opinion, the coach felt like an incredible character, someone who I can say ""Yeah, I wish I had a teacher like that"". There were other characters that got some development, however I won\'t go through each one. I do wish the two ""main characters"" got more development, though there will be more content of Bakuten so I hope to see development there. I can see that Bakuten does attempt to develop some characters, and so far they\'ve done a good job in making them relatable and realistic. Again, I do want to see the main characters have more gradual development.Enjoyment: 8Overall enjoyment is the key to Bakuten. The anime was so refreshing to watch, was down to earth, and conveyed positivity in a sensible, non-dramatic manner. The overall dynamic made me happy to continue watching the show every week. However I\'m not quite sure if it would be a bingeworthy show since I watched it weekly, but I did look forward to watching each episode and making me feel happy walking out of it.Overall:Bakuten probably won\'t leave a huge impression on me considering the setup of the storyline and the limited focus on the main characters, however I felt good watching it and is worth watching if you enjoy a peaceful yet entertaining watching experience. performances, the club had limited members, boy joins said club once he transfers to high school and learns the sport. At first, I felt quite bored actually since it was kind of like a template formula sports anime use, especially with the cliche metaphor of the birds ""soaring"". However, what makes me give this show a 7 in story was that it was unique in a way where the plot didn\'t need a mysterious or sad backstory for the protagonist/s to keep the audience going. It was refreshing to see just the protagonist, Shotaro Futaba, genuinely have a loving and supporting family. He wasn\'t this flashy character that had a unique skillset or distinguishing features, and Bakuten handled that type of protagonist well. The show felt down to earth (apart from the extremely fast learning from the protagonist, but that can be ignored) and genuinely felt relaxing to watch. It wasn\'t too intense, and that\'s what I like about it.Art: 9The art and animation just felt great.

The MC didn't have any character and personality in him until the last three episodes, But still, the show was decent and enjoyable was the most part of it, the art and camera angles during their competition were really good and CGI was also decent enough.

The characters are a lot of fun and have great design. The story moves at a quick pace, it doesn’t feel slow but it also gives time for the main character (mostly) to grow. The music compliments every scene. So far, I’ve only seen the first 6 episodes, but the show feels very fresh and light-hearted. You can tell how much care and attention went into every episode and I really love watching every new installment. I truly think it deserves more attention. Hopefully my review will convince someone...to at least give the first few episodes a try because this hidden gem shouldn’t be hidden anymore. to at least give the first few episodes a try because this hidden gem shouldn’t be hidden anymore.', 'If I were to describe Bakuten!! in a sentence, it would be wholesome but generic. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I admittedly have a bias towards sports anime.The story isn\'t something we haven\'t seen before sans the sport of rhythmic gymnastics. The premise is very reminiscent of Haikyuu. However, because of the small team there aren\'t as many characters, and the show goes a bit more in depth about their hobbies and personalities as a result. The coach also gets a bit of backstory. Lots of team bonding also ensues. Overall it\'s a very refreshing change of pace from the usual formula and strikes a...good balance of seeing the sport as well as the characters personal lives. It\'s not all that ""shippy"" either. Instead, it feels like a love letter to men\'s rhythmic gymnastics.Interestingly, the characters are not defined by their personalities so much as by their backstories and the things they do in their free time. There\'s a wota, a guy obsessed with yakuza movies, a dude who experiments with new recipes for his family business and another who enjoys arranging greenery. These interests are all played up for laughs on more than one occasion. But they\'re all similar to one another in a way: incredibly earnest, hardworking and competitive. No tsunderes or resident smart asses here folks. They\'re also all bound together by their love of the sport. Are they very deep? No. But I\'d argue that they don\'t really need to be.The art is where things get a bit dicey. The standard 2d animation and action sequences are great. Then there\'s the CGI used during their routines, which is... rough. It\'s an odd choice that I personally takes away from the complicated jump sequences and dance moves involved in each performance. Maybe it was due to time or budget constraints? Who knows. It\'s a small niggle, but I don\'t think it\'s a huge detriment to the overall show.I don\'t usually focus all that much on sound, but the music here is fantastic. I don\'t know much about the composer, but they seem to understand gymnastics and what is appropriate for each situation. The same music is not reused over and over for different routines, which is a common gripe I have with more artistic sports anime(dance, gymnastics, ice skating, etc.). I must give kudos for the effort and consideration shown here. Bravo.Overall, I enjoyed this very much. However, as I stated previously, I do love a good sports anime. If that also applies to you, I\'d say that this is worth a watch. If you enjoy the camaraderie that comes with shows like this, I\'d likewise recommend this. For everyone else... give it a chance.

I started this anime as I was coming into this season after finishing Taisou Zamurai by Mappa, about gymnastics which I liked a lot lot, that is when I added this to my PTW. Incredibly happy that I did.Beauty in terms of animation. Soundtrack is just as beautiful and fitting as the animation. But the thing that will stick with me are the characters, the variety, the motivation, the situation and all of it coming together to form one team. The coach\'s character was the most fascinating of all...of them, and loved him throughout the run. The monologues at different stages were so good. I do not care for so called ""tropes"", until the story is strong enough to include them but not rely on them. This show may have used some tropes, but the execution of the voice acting, animation and soundtrack, char design was excellent. A strong 9/10 for me, as it personally relaxed each time I watched it, made me emotional, but in the end the words from the coach also gave us a moral to include in our life or think about.""THE FUTURE IS IMPORTANT, AND YOU SHOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO COMPROMISE YOURS, RE-EVALUATE YOUR PATH AT TIMES TO SEE IF YOU ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

Birdie Wing: Golf Girls' Story,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50248/Birdie_Wing__Golf_Girls_Story,"[""This show is good enough that it got me to round up my lesbian friends and play mini-golf. That’s the short review, but I can go long as well.You should know going into this that I despise real golf and everything it stands for. But lucky for me, Birdie Wing is not a show that respects its sport. In the very first episode, our main character declares “I don’t play golf. I hit a ball with a stick for money.” She's so stupid. This *show* is so stupid, the kind of stupid you get out of 2000's anime and can't help but adore. It's also...the most fun I've had out of a seasonal in years.Birdie Wing’s production details have been a hilarious mystery to unravel. Original sports anime are quite rare, so I was baffled as to how this show even got made until I started digging further. Bandai-Namco is our production company, which quickly becomes evident with the tongue-in-cheek Gundam product placement. But behind the scenes, Birdie Wing is inexplicably being financed by HTC’s virtual reality branch. On top of the anime, this partnership will result in a “metaverse museum” and a Nintendo Switch game.So how well did they use their VR bucks? Well, Birdie Wing’s production values are never excellent, and CG is understandably used to cut corners on the golf courses. However, the character designs are superb, with plenty of unique outfits for the main duo. The animation can be limited at times, but it hits when it needs to, with absurd golf swings and imposing shot angles. The Osamu Dezaki-styled dramatic watercolor freezeframes are an excellent homage. It’s pretty clear that someone on the production team has a waifu, as Aoi is animated way better than everyone else.Perhaps the greater miracle is that Birdie Wing is good. Everything I mentioned above ends up being a pretty sketchy foundation for a show,  and since it’s an original, the screenwriter attached to the project matters a lot. They ended up bringing Yosuke Kuroda on board, whose writing credentials include girls-with-guns kinda-yuri Madlax and the extremely pornographic combat definitely-yuri Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid. So we’re getting lesbians, and we’re getting ridiculous over-the-top action scenes. Somehow, I think he was one of the best possible picks for this.His script does the impossible and makes golf entertaining. We get a main character who despises her sport and tears it apart with brute-force power and precision. We get a seedy underground golf mafia arc. We get a roulette of increasingly depraved older women in said mafia. We get golfing abilities described with brazenly pornographic innuendo, delightful over-the-top melodrama, classic sports anime rivalry, and maybe even an assassination or two. And most importantly, we get delicious, delicious yuri-bait.Look, I’m a lesbian first and a golfer last, so I’m going to be real with you. This is a “show, don’t tell” kind of yuri. There’s plenty of plausibly-deniable romance scenes, but you won’t be getting any confessions up-front. However, actions speak louder than words, and when Eve hits a ball so far that Aoi can see it from her flight about to take off, and Aoi makes vows to meet her again while wearing a Char cosplay on a VR golf course, that’s the kind of stuff that counts for me. If I’m reading the foreshadowing right, there’s a nonzero chance that they’re going to be revealed to be sisters in the second season. It would be a laughably bad move, but given the unavoidable skeeziness of some of Kuroda’s works, I can’t say I wasn’t ready. Also this show does the delightful women’s sports anime thing where most of the side characters pair cleanly off with each other.I’m so glad this show exists, and that it’s somehow the opposite of a soulless money-grab given its circumstances. I could care less about the planned tie-in content landscape, but what matters is that Birdie Wing the anime is made out of love. In my ideal world, we would have one of these every season. Sports yuri is the good stuff, and I can’t wait to see the golf butches being teased for Season 2 in action. the most fun I've had out of a seasonal in years.Birdie Wing’s production details have been a hilarious mystery to unravel.

Cute girls, over the top golfing scenes and great character interactions make Birdie Wing a fun watch for even the biggest of golf haters.Admittedly, coming into this season when I saw the promo art for Birdie Wing, I was not sold on it. Yea there were cute girls and some nice art, but who the hell wants to watch golf, right? Boy was I wrong. Like 99 percent of seasonals, I tuned into Birdie Wing and from the very first episode I knew we had something special brewing here. The epic and tense golfing matches,...the drama, the stakes, the waifus, etc. It was all just everything you need in a sports anime. I instantly fell in love with Eve as an MC and she quickly became one of my picks for waifu of the YEAR, not just season. She and Aoi’s rivalry was a treat to watch develop and even made me want to go out and learn how to golf.While I did really enjoy the story, just when I thought I was getting the hang of this show, it throws a literal curveball at us with an absolutely ridiculous(in a good way) mafia plot which culminates in a pretty surprisingly dark end to the first 75 percent of the show. There’s so much wacky action in Birdie Wing that makes it a glorious and fun journey. My honest recommendation is to turn your brain off and try not to think too much about it. Enjoy the ride and try to learn a thing or two about golf!Eve and Aoi are amazing characters and they’re both top 10 waifu material for me, but the other characters in the show are great as well. All bring a little something special to the story and help Eve to grow whether as a person or golfer. I think as an anime original show, it can be difficult to have a really all around solid cast, yet Birdie Wing managed to pull it off along with an engaging story. Credit has to go out to Banco for the job they did here.I really hope that we get a manga adaptation or a gacha game or something to expand the story of the girls. The anime started a tournament arc right at the end of the season which was really not enough time to adequately wrap everything up as well as tie up the loose ends that Eve left as a result of what happens at the end of that mafia arc. It’s rare that anime original stuff get second seasons and I don’t think Banco animation are known for it, but I would absolutely love to see more Birdie Wing in any capacity as it will no doubt be one of my top shows of the year and one of the best sports anime I’ve seen. I will certainly miss Birdie Wing Tuesdays.Birdie Wing gets 10 Blue Bullets out of 10.Edit: Looks like Banco have all but confirmed a second season, let’s gooooo the drama, the stakes, the waifus, etc. It was all just everything you need in a sports anime.

This is an original property not based on a manga, VN, LN, etc. The script writer of Excel Saga just decided one day that he wanted to make a women\'s golf anime in which professional women\'s golf is heavily tied to the mafia. The mafia places bets on the golfers in order to settle disputes and the golfers compete in a massive underground lair based on the NERV GeoFront from Evangelion. This anime is fucking insane. You never know exactly what you\'re going to get from script writer Yosuke Kuroda. Sometimes his...batshit insanity actually manages to work splendidly, as is the case with Excel Saga, Trigun, and Hellsing Ultimate. Unfortunately, he\'s also penned some duds like Goblin Slayer, Jungle de Ikou, and Valkyrie Drive Mermaid.Kuroda\'s writing quality and consistency invokes the opening lines of A Tale of 2 Cities. ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.""How do you convince people to watch an anime about women\'s golf? No seriously, I\'m asking the reader! I know 6 guys offline who watch anime and I\'ve failed to convince any of them to watch a single episode of Birdie Wing despite begging them for 2 months straight.I know everyone else is going to mention this, so I may as well address it. Birdie Wing is officially the gayest sports anime ever made! Yuri on Ice has NOTHING on Birdie Wing. Yuri on Ice is the story of a depressed, down on his luck skater who has to recapture his passion for the sport and bounce back. He kind of has a thing for his coach, but there honestly isn\'t a lot of sexual tension in most of the scenes they share together. Birdie Wing feels like the main 2 girls are going to throw their clubs to the ground and frantically start making out in basically every scene they share. There was even a meme article called ""There is literally no heterosexual explanation for Birdie Wing"". However, Birdie Wing isn\'t tagged as a yuri. It was never advertised as a yuri. The studio has never said that it\'s a yuri. I thought that surely if this was intended to be a yuri, they would have said so at some point during Pride Month and yet they didn\'t. So, was this accidental? Is it all a joke? What the fuck is this? I have a hard time believing that this was done on accident. The first Top Gun was probably an accident. Birdie Wing was almost certainly on purpose, so I can only conclude that this is a stealth yuri that doesn\'t want to advertise itself as such. Possibly to avoid it getting banned in certain countries. That\'s honestly my best theory. Now fans in Indonesia can buy Birdie Wing. Fans in Saudi Arabia can buy Birdie Wing. Fans in Russia can...pirate it like you guys always do anyways.Finally, I\'ll get to the conventional part of the review. Birdie Wing is a mixed bag overall. Firstly, I\'d like to start with the positives. The characters are really fun. The plot takes turns going from predictable to being utterly insane. Birdie Wing is often laughably ridiculous, but that\'s the point and it doesn\'t take itself too seriously. I also really like Eve and Aoi as a couple. They are so cute together! The OP is also amazing, and I\'ve not skipped it a single time. On the negative side, Birdie Wing\'s sheer stupidity can be off-putting to many people. I\'ve never had to work this hard to sell my offline friends on an anime. Usually, I can get at least 1 of them to watch any given anime. The CG is also pretty egregious at times. This was not made on a high budget and certainly won\'t be winning awards as the prettiest looking anime of the season. Lastly, the relationship between Eve and Aoi at this point is simply bait with no official confirmation that they\'re actually a couple. I will actually be pissed if Eve and Aoi don\'t kiss at some point in S2. For the show to bait THIS hard and then chicken out because they\'re afraid of the show getting banned in countries that don\'t legally purchase or stream anime anyways would be pretty shitty.Would I recommend Birdie Wing? Yes. This is definitely one of the must-watch anime of 2022, for the absurdity if for no other reason. I found it highly entertaining, and I hope anyone who I convince to try it out will be entertained as well! batshit insanity actually manages to work splendidly, as is the case with Excel Saga, Trigun, and Hellsing Ultimate.

I know 6 guys offline who watch anime and I\'ve failed to convince any of them to watch a single episode of Birdie Wing despite begging them for 2 months straight.I know everyone else is going to mention this, so I may as well address it. Birdie Wing is officially the gayest sports anime ever made! Yuri on Ice has NOTHING on Birdie Wing. Yuri on Ice is the story of a depressed, down on his luck skater who has to recapture his passion for the sport and bounce back. He kind of has a thing for his coach, but there honestly isn\'t a lot of sexual tension in most of the scenes they share together. Birdie Wing feels like the main 2 girls are going to throw their clubs to the ground and frantically start making out in basically every scene they share. There was even a meme article called ""There is literally no heterosexual explanation for Birdie Wing"". However, Birdie Wing isn\'t tagged as a yuri. It was never advertised as a yuri. The studio has never said that it\'s a yuri. I thought that surely if this was intended to be a yuri, they would have said so at some point during Pride Month and yet they didn\'t. So, was this accidental? Is it all a joke? What the fuck is this? I have a hard time believing that this was done on accident. The first Top Gun was probably an accident. Birdie Wing was almost certainly on purpose, so I can only conclude that this is a stealth yuri that doesn\'t want to advertise itself as such. Possibly to avoid it getting banned in certain countries. That\'s honestly my best theory. Now fans in Indonesia can buy Birdie Wing. Fans in Saudi Arabia can buy Birdie Wing. Fans in Russia can...pirate it like you guys always do anyways.Finally, I\'ll get to the conventional part of the review. Birdie Wing is a mixed bag overall. Firstly, I\'d like to start with the positives. The characters are really fun. The plot takes turns going from predictable to being utterly insane. Birdie Wing is often laughably ridiculous, but that\'s the point and it doesn\'t take itself too seriously. I also really like Eve and Aoi as a couple. They are so cute together! The OP is also amazing, and I\'ve not skipped it a single time. On the negative side, Birdie Wing\'s sheer stupidity can be off-putting to many people. I\'ve never had to work this hard to sell my offline friends on an anime. Usually, I can get at least 1 of them to watch any given anime. The CG is also pretty egregious at times. This was not made on a high budget and certainly won\'t be winning awards as the prettiest looking anime of the season. Lastly, the relationship between Eve and Aoi at this point is simply bait with no official confirmation that they\'re actually a couple. I will actually be pissed if Eve and Aoi don\'t kiss at some point in S2. For the show to bait THIS hard and then chicken out because they\'re afraid of the show getting banned in countries that don\'t legally purchase or stream anime anyways would be pretty shitty.Would I recommend Birdie Wing? Yes. This is definitely one of the must-watch anime of 2022, for the absurdity if for no other reason. I found it highly entertaining, and I hope anyone who I convince to try it out will be entertained as well!', 'One of the issues while assessing the quality of an anime is that it is always assumed that the people behind the project are trying to deliver a product that is intended to be, at least, entertaining and profficient. The problem of Birdie Wing is that behind the shock factors and subversive absurdities there is an extremely bland progression, with endless tensionless episodes, awfully forced comedic gags, and an uninteresting artistic direction, defined by stiff characters gestures and an awful artificial green color that my eyes cannot but cringe to. The reality is that the anime is obviously not trying at all on those aspects,...and it will subsequently enter the category of “Too bad that it could be good” type of shows that some people are obsessed about, for better or worse. To elaborate this, there are three fair warnings before even starting this anime:-\tThe golf aspect is garbage, they never try to do more than skeletal montages of people using superpowers to create entertainment out of it. The cause of this decision is that the production thinks that golf is boring, so they tried to do a Mario Golf type of anime, or another reference, I don’t know about that stuff. Maybe they want to promote a game, I don’t care.-\tMost episodes are a drag at face value, they normally feature one or two moments that could give you a sincere laugh or a sudden shock, but most of the time they are just mundane dialogues interpolated with some scenes that try to wake up the viewer by blasting you with a surprise-\tBy using the two definitions above, the only correct way of watching this anime is to laugh at the decisions that the team behind this anime made, not the content by itself. Whether the entertainment out of that is valid or not depends on the individual.Going to the details, the premise of the show is basically the journey from poverty and delinquency to legit golf competition of the main girl. This is apparently unoffensive at first, but the anime manages to make it an explosion of absurdity by using the implications of her wealth position, as the logic of being able to even do such transition doesn’t add up unless certain requirements are completed. The next paragraphs have some mild spoilers to explain why this anime is not just random stuff, but why it also sucks.The first important detail about the premise is that it is trying to portray the rivalry about two girls that live in diametrically opposed positions in the scale of privilege, and it tries to portray such rivalry through a sport where they must face each other, to finally converge into a friendship relationship of mutual respect and love, as they both grow of each other. This is the first subversion, as golf is a sport that is normally associated with an elite, with wealthiness, and having no connection with the sport or being poor is just a high hurdle that is hard to jump.Those two main characters are Aoi, a Japanese girl, and Eve, a European girl (?). As you may guess, Eve is the one that is poor and Aoi is the one that is rich, because that is how anime works. As the subversion exists, the anime tries to give a proper answer to the fact that Eve could even be good at golf. The solution is generating an underground system that enables Eve improvement, despite her overbearing family responsibilities and her incapability to enter the circuit. Therefore, the mafia aspect is not as nonsense or random as it may seem, it is just a logical consequence of how to establish a proper reasoning behind her opportunities.Once given this reasoning, the mafia aspect and the mysterious trainer start to make some sense. Underground gambling, fraudulent tourneys, real estate corruption, all of them enable Eve to be able to break free from poverty through golf, because otherwise she wouldn’t have the resources to begin with, criticism towards social mobility. What this seems to propose is that, with the current state of things, there is no other option but to incur in such shady operations. Eve’s trainer also represents the basics of how education manage to empower the character to be able to compete with those who had proper advantages produced by an actual infrastructure, the presence of such legendary golfer in that context is fixed by a set of coincidences, as people in the situation of Eve could just find such opportunity by a strike of luck and an actual interest to be good at their craft, the value of education and motivation in disadvantaged communities.The underground activity also brings parallels to different perspectives about the same development. Rose represents those who find comfort into staying as the biggest fish in a small tank, while Vipere represents those who have no qualms about cheating the system to survive. As Eve develop her golf and find the light at the end of the tunnel, she must now stay away from her past. The system that allowed her to get out of the slums is also biting her back.As a matter of summary, Eve is Chief Keef. RIP NipseyIf this anime was just a mafia anime with golf, then it would be an interesting ride, the underground antics could have a better emphasis and the characters would be able to develop a multitude of hardships that come from modern issues. Sadly, for anyone who has no interest on mediocre yuri attempts, the anime stops using this concept at the final third of the anime. The last arc of the anime is just a bunch of pathetic golf montages that abuse a joke that has been tired in the second episode of the anime and the cast simping or hating on Eve.While one can see this ending of the cour fitting, as the struggle of Eve has been finally overcome and she can reap the fruits of her effort, the reality is that this final stretch can be just enjoyed by laughing at some ridiculous decisions of the anime (Or by shipping, I don’t kink shame). Awful lip syncing, slideshows with awkward music, jokes about the laziness of the writing, reusage of material, over dramatic shots, the anime just have nothing else to say and start to do dumb stuff to wake up the viewer, the momentum just hit a full-stop when they must dedicate themselves to golf. Maybe the caddie of Eve and Aoi could now represent a new element of overcoming the status quo, as Aoi must face her mother and the weight on her shoulders and the caddie must showcase her talent against the odds, but their gags and developments are just too mundane to be enjoyable, as they are barely anything but sporadic statements about their feelings.As a conclusion, if Birdie Wing tried to be an enjoyable anime that makes golf a fun experience, then they completely failed, as the golf aspect is simply the worst part of the whole experience. It is not equivalent to the typical sport anime that develop tension, knowledge, and more importantly, interest about it. Birdie Wing instead look for elements that could bring entertainment and drama in-between the golf matches, entertainment that takes a nosedive once the unique and absurd aspect of the show disappears, and the trail of entertainment is composed by tropey silly power-ups. Sadly, if I want to see a rich girl and a poor girl being rivals and developing a hilarious comedy with an honest friendship I would watch others shows, and if I want to see a golf anime that use this kind of superpowers I would rather sleep. and it will subsequently enter the category of “Too bad that it could be good” type of shows that some people are obsessed about, for better or worse.

Gotta have my hard-boiled mafia golf lesbians.You probably won\'t like this anime if you\'re expecting realistic golf or slice of life. It has everything but those. I am also probably missing a ton of action anime references, but even I can tell this anime loves them. And that\'s evidence Birdie Wing has heart.The golf ball is CGI. Think it\'s to draw attention to the ball, because whenever I watch golf or baseball or any sport with tiny balls, I\'m always wondering where the ball is. The car scenes are full 2D and well-animated, so it\'s...not like the animators don\'t care. The golf scenes aren\'t bad either.When it comes to the story, I\'m particularly interested in the family and the caddies. The main characters seem to have interesting histories we don\'t know about yet. Groundwork is laid out excellently.The music is great. It opens up with jazz, music sounds fantastic during tense moments, the ED wraps up cleanly, and the OP lyrics... are really something.Has the same feel as Bee Train\'s ""girls with guns trilogy"" so if you\'re a fan of that, you might want to give this show a try. Birdie Wing certainly pierced my heart this season. not like the animators don\'t care.

Birdie Wing certainly pierced my heart this season.', 'Have you ever wondered what a an underground crime syndicate involving under-15 year old female golfers would be like?No. Of course you haven\'t. But Birdie Wing delivers this fantasy you never knew you needed.When it opens with girls in disguises to rig a Under-15 Girls golf tournament, you can\'t help but be captivated. But as it transitions to secret midnight golf faceoffs at railway yards, you will be undeniable hooked.Once they have your attention, the plot only thickens. With golf Mafia bosses striking mysterious deals, swindlers rigging putting challenges under overpasses, and an emotional rollercoaster for an immigrant family, Birdie Wing offers a unique take...on sports anime as a whole. And this unique take still offers classic, feel-good sports anime tropes such as competitive rivals, hardwork/determination, and comradery.Somehow, every shot for these golf girls is high stakes, but at the same time its feels like a casual sport. The competitions are fierce, and I can feel the power of the plot pushing every ball towards the whole; yet I still feel joy and love for the great game of golf in every swing. How they make me fear the Syndicate villains while still enjoying the game of golf, I cannot understand. The balance this anime finds is quite impressive; developing an intense drama while making me feel happy at the end of each episode. I can\'t help but want more.Quite frankly, I think I will be taking notes on the golf strategies seen in this show, and bring them to the course. Next time I hit the links, I fear I will gather every golfer\'s attention while shouting ""Blue Bullet"" as I smack a drive that travelers shorter than the 14 year old girls in this series. But maybe not, as I do not have the pressure of the Mafia and corrupt policemen on my conscious.The sheer ridiculousness of this anime is enough to keep anyone away, but I\'m afraid once you\'ve started watching, you will have no choice but to finish it to the end.

Watch at your own risk.', 'A golf show? About the story of complete opposite spectrums of stories of golf girls? Not to mention that the strokes will result in birdies and soaring on wings like eagles? Hell yeah, sign me up because I\'m about to experience some wack-shit plot that doesn\'t take itself seriously, yet is self-aware enough to try to be at the very least fun! Okay okay, in all honesty, Birdie Wing: Golf Girls\' Story is a fine lil\' show that is a fairly niche original show that does have a fair few surprise elements if you actually take the time to appreciate what it\'s trying to exhibit...in its entirety.The way that Birdie Wing tells its unorthodox-yet-unequivocal story of golf girls is IMO, nothing short of decent, but thanks to veteran scriptwriter and series composer Yousuke Kuroda, has some ingenious storytelling that showcases the setting of the sport that is golf (that I believe this is the first full-fledged show to showcase the sport) in both being the usual and unusual premises of life and thrill. The golf girls\' stories of Eve and Aoi Amawashi, two girls growing up in two very different lifestyles, yet have one common interest, and that is to play golf the way of their own know-how.Let\'s cover Eve\'s side of the story first: the proud and unabashed girl with an exhorting personality, playing golf with a bullish style, because she lives in an environment identical and similar to that of poor habitual slums and immigrants whom don\'t get as much coverage and care from their own government, where money is hard to find, and the only way to earn more is to participate in underground games of unusual golf courses, where the sport is all they have to put their bets on the line. The adage of ""Finders (winners) keepers, Losers weepers"" is honestly the best way to sum the type of game that Eve plays her golf with, whether is it with fellow punters or even against the Mafia with even more skillful players that more often than not, have a trick up their sleeve. But this all pales in comparison to the corny ""special attack"" names that Aoi dubs her power of ""Rainbow Bullets"", where it\'s just power for show, but it has a purpose for being outlandish that is the centerpiece of Eve\'s character to eke out wins, even at the expense of miracles.And then there\'s Aoi Amawashi, or should I say: the Juliet to the female Romeo (just to show off that Yuri feel) that always presents a formidable challenge to even the most skillful players. Unlike Eve, Aoi doesn\'t have any kind of ""superpower"" that can match Eve\'s level of idiosyncracy, but she has a simple ""superpower"": her wistful smiles that are like silent draws of blades to cut at her opponents. The kind of girl with a sass personality that has people taken notice of her because of her connections to the rich men\'s world and being part of the golf club at her school of Raiho Girls\' Academy, but it\'s not until she shows off her capabilities, that she\'s like a lioness or a tigress awaiting to prance on her prey and eat away at their advances, the amicable kind of person where her unkempt psychology will make or break people. These two are honestly the kind of Yuri-pandering couple that I didn\'t know I needed, and yet manage to balance the Wild West of story elements with the all-too-usual modern setting, which keeps this show fresh from the tried-and-true ""wash, rinse, repeat"" predictable formula. And yes, this show does get predictable, but at least it keeps you on your toes to anticipate what are the next strokes around the course.This ain\'t a golf show of just the golfers alone, and this is where the caddies come in to help spur both Aoi and Eve into their ever-growing ""red thread of fate"" of coincidence and camaraderie in distinct ways. For Eve, this comes at the support of her friend Lily Lipman and her sister Klein Clara who\'s the owner of an illegal bar, and living with 3 orphaned immigrant children in the Nafres slums, an area that\'s controlled by the Mafia under the go-between head Rose Aleon. This is also further cemented by Lily being the energetic, cheerful good-hearted goofball that serves has her caddy being able to pinpoint the accuracy of stroke shot to lead Eve to victory, though Eve proclaims that she isn\'t needed most of the time, being very reliant on her Rainbow Bullets for power strokes. And it is with absolutely no doubt that the underground world can seem messy with many connections that could result in the bet of one\'s life taken away, but it\'s the same environment that allows Eve to thrive being at her very best. This is the same for Aoi being your stereotypical golfer participating in high-profile golf tournaments and exerting her status as one of the premier young-age skillful golfers ever to grace the heated competition and leaving everyone behind in the dust with her perfect strokes. And for that, Amane Shinjo as Aoi\'s caddy, she\'s the analyst character that is a professor of intel at detailing on her rivals and courses to give her best friend the unrivalled advantage, and for the most part, she\'s the type that you would most certainly expect to act that maintains an upright serious fervor. Seriously, relax, dear Amane, have fun and be in the moment with your best friend who\'s also having fun golfing. I\'ll admit that the supporting cast feels like there\'s too much, but contrary to the usual, this is also akin to the usual golf settings to help push both Aoi and Eve into the best version of themselves, and that is playing golf in total exhilaration. That\'s a resounding notion if you ask me.BN Pictures (that stands for Bandai Namco Pictures) hasn\'t really had a ton of experience producing anime, from the safe likes of many childrens\' shows to taking on the final phases of Gintama\'s adaptations, to the most recently the studio\'s flagship series: Mairimashita! Iruma-kun a.k.a Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun, and the golf course outing here is just decent with a lot of repeating frames that only add to the insanity of the show that\'s par for its course. And under the direction of the somewhat wonky director Takayuki Inagaki who\'s only done less noteworthy shows (I still hate the anime adaptation of 2008\'s Rosario to Vampire, that shit lingers in my mouth even 15 years later), the more recent of which is Summer 2018\'s Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro a.k.a Chio\'s School Road (which is undoubtedly his best effort so far), and it\'s safe to say that his directorial inputs in this show does cock up some wavering storytelling that at times, don\'t make sense, or even worse, rushing the process to get from point A to B. Regardless, this show doesn\'t need an outlandish director just to make things work, and for all the effort that Takayuki Inagaki did here, it was just enough for a self-contained experience. Also, since this is Bandai Namco at it, there\'re references if you look hard enough: from the Gunpla mechs that serves as Eve\'s gifts to Lily, to Aoi\'s ""Pak-kun"" Pac-Man golf ball.But what I believe makes or breaks the show is in the music department, which easily surprises the hell outta me to declare it in its goodness. For one, Kohmi Hirose is a well-established J-pop singer that easily stood out in her primetime of the late 90s being one of the most vocal and multi-million seller singers of her time, the people of Japan affectionately calling her the ""Winter Queen"" because of her record-breaking single in 1993 and also tying to that, the sponsorship with the skiing goods company Alpen. And since this is yet another sport of golf, you need not lean too far to know that the Winter Queen is back for another song, but to put it in the best summing way possible: Birdie Wing doesn\'t deserve Kohmi Hirose. All I can say is that ""Venus Line"" is a mind-boggingly incredible, amazing and catchy OP song that perfectly fits the show\'s thematics, and after the first few listens or so, raises up to be one of the sleeper banger songs of the season. Tsukiyomi\'s ED is just fine, and Hajime Takakuwa once again did one hell of a very good job showcasing why he\'s one of the top sound directors with works like Black Clover and Kono Oto Tomare! credited to his name.All in all, to say that Birdie Wing: Golf Girls\' Story ""is a mood"", you\'re definitely right it is, but I can understand if some people don\'t vibe the show the way that it represents itself as it is, and this is completely fine. While I for one, can just see this as some mind-numbling decency that strikes the fun strokes when it can, everything else around it are just for show and serve no purpose other that over-the-top drama to add to the plot. Whatever it is, you\'ll just have to accept the give or take that this golf show just isn\'t for everyone. It\'s a niche show for certain people whom are looking for pure entertainment more than anything else, and I respect Birdie Wing for what it encompasses to give its allure, and that\'s just more than enough.If you like it, there\'s Season 2 coming next Winter, so there\'s more enjoyment to behold! Until then, this is what we have, and I\'m hoping that it will be a lot better than the set-up season here turned out to be. in its entirety.The way that Birdie Wing tells its unorthodox-yet-unequivocal story of golf girls is IMO, nothing short of decent, but thanks to veteran scriptwriter and series composer Yousuke Kuroda, has some ingenious storytelling that showcases the setting of the sport that is golf (that I believe this is the first full-fledged show to showcase the sport) in both being the usual and unusual premises of life and thrill.

And for that, Amane Shinjo as Aoi\'s caddy, she\'s the analyst character that is a professor of intel at detailing on her rivals and courses to give her best friend the unrivalled advantage, and for the most part, she\'s the type that you would most certainly expect to act that maintains an upright serious fervor. Seriously, relax, dear Amane, have fun and be in the moment with your best friend who\'s also having fun golfing. I\'ll admit that the supporting cast feels like there\'s too much, but contrary to the usual, this is also akin to the usual golf settings to help push both Aoi and Eve into the best version of themselves, and that is playing golf in total exhilaration. That\'s a resounding notion if you ask me.BN Pictures (that stands for Bandai Namco Pictures) hasn\'t really had a ton of experience producing anime, from the safe likes of many childrens\' shows to taking on the final phases of Gintama\'s adaptations, to the most recently the studio\'s flagship series: Mairimashita! Iruma-kun a.k.a Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun, and the golf course outing here is just decent with a lot of repeating frames that only add to the insanity of the show that\'s par for its course. And under the direction of the somewhat wonky director Takayuki Inagaki who\'s only done less noteworthy shows (I still hate the anime adaptation of 2008\'s Rosario to Vampire, that shit lingers in my mouth even 15 years later), the more recent of which is Summer 2018\'s Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro a.k.a Chio\'s School Road (which is undoubtedly his best effort so far), and it\'s safe to say that his directorial inputs in this show does cock up some wavering storytelling that at times, don\'t make sense, or even worse, rushing the process to get from point A to B. Regardless, this show doesn\'t need an outlandish director just to make things work, and for all the effort that Takayuki Inagaki did here, it was just enough for a self-contained experience. Also, since this is Bandai Namco at it, there\'re references if you look hard enough: from the Gunpla mechs that serves as Eve\'s gifts to Lily, to Aoi\'s ""Pak-kun"" Pac-Man golf ball.But what I believe makes or breaks the show is in the music department, which easily surprises the hell outta me to declare it in its goodness. For one, Kohmi Hirose is a well-established J-pop singer that easily stood out in her primetime of the late 90s being one of the most vocal and multi-million seller singers of her time, the people of Japan affectionately calling her the ""Winter Queen"" because of her record-breaking single in 1993 and also tying to that, the sponsorship with the skiing goods company Alpen. And since this is yet another sport of golf, you need not lean too far to know that the Winter Queen is back for another song, but to put it in the best summing way possible: Birdie Wing doesn\'t deserve Kohmi Hirose. All I can say is that ""Venus Line"" is a mind-boggingly incredible, amazing and catchy OP song that perfectly fits the show\'s thematics, and after the first few listens or so, raises up to be one of the sleeper banger songs of the season. Tsukiyomi\'s ED is just fine, and Hajime Takakuwa once again did one hell of a very good job showcasing why he\'s one of the top sound directors with works like Black Clover and Kono Oto Tomare! credited to his name.All in all, to say that Birdie Wing: Golf Girls\' Story ""is a mood"", you\'re definitely right it is, but I can understand if some people don\'t vibe the show the way that it represents itself as it is, and this is completely fine. While I for one, can just see this as some mind-numbling decency that strikes the fun strokes when it can, everything else around it are just for show and serve no purpose other that over-the-top drama to add to the plot. Whatever it is, you\'ll just have to accept the give or take that this golf show just isn\'t for everyone. It\'s a niche show for certain people whom are looking for pure entertainment more than anything else, and I respect Birdie Wing for what it encompasses to give its allure, and that\'s just more than enough.If you like it, there\'s Season 2 coming next Winter, so there\'s more enjoyment to behold! Until then, this is what we have, and I\'m hoping that it will be a lot better than the set-up season here turned out to be.', ""Birdie Wing Golf Girls’ Story makes the impossible possible. It made me enjoy my least favorite sport, and it has everything I could ever want from an excellent sports-romance hybrid anime.High-stakes tournaments? Check.Lesbian romance? Check.Badass heroine? Check!Hilariously campy tone? Check.Catchy soundtrack? Check.Mafia conflict? Check?Clever writing? Check!Golf sakuga? BLUE BULLET!...I’ve never seen anyone take golf as seriously as these girls, which makes it so amusing. Eve, also known as “Rainbow Bullet,” is a teenage golfing prodigy who plays in high-stakes competitions against the best-of-the-best. She becomes entangled in the underground world of bidding on golf to provide for her found family. In these over-the-top competitions, losing is not an option. The story has no elegance or assumptions of intellectualism, but it is hilarious, adrenaline-inducing, and refreshingly new. I laughed through most of each episode, and when I didn’t, I had a smile on my face. I’m sure that’s how they intended viewers to consume it. Though the characters take themselves seriously, the show definitely does not. Birdie Wing’s premise and presentation scream rule-of-cool rather than pretentiousness commonly associated with golf. When has there ever been a sci-fi anime about lesbians golfing to save their family from corrupt cops and the mafia?Most surprisingly, Birdie Wing is quite class-conscious for an anime about teenagers playing golf. A willingness to embrace absurdity is required to tackle classism and gentrification through the lens of an adrenaline-fueled sport. And I mean it. These golfing tournaments are filled with shouting, catch-phrases, ridiculous twists, fierce competitiveness, and golfballs flying at the speed of a bullet. Despite juggling an over-the-top plot with an appropriately serious tone, it miraculously manages to be far better than expected. Golf is a costly sport, and it draws in snobbery. The idea of a working-class teenage girl supporting her single mom and family of five kids through one of the most exclusive sports is so ridiculous it just barely works. Golf was undoubtedly the best sport to tell this story because the juxtaposition of the heroine’s home life, class status, and even her three worn-out golf clubs, with her wealthy opponents and luxurious golf courses, encourages analysis from a socioeconomic perspective. The anime as a whole has a consciousness of class and race, so rarely seen in this medium.Eve’s rival-turned-love interest Aoi is a foil to her class status. Aoi is introduced in a plane sitting in first-class, monitoring golf competitors, whereas Eve is making ends meet fraudulently disguised as the professional golfer she’s reading about. Note: The anime never frames Eve as a villain for crimes she commits because it is for the sake of her family; she’s a person with practical issues despite the bizarre premise, not some morally grey anti-hero. The further into the anime, the closer they become, and the second season will doubtlessly focus on their relationship as a power couple. Eve's irreverent attitude reflects Aoi's playful approach to the sport, their charming relationship is loaded with chemistry.Only in Golf Girls’ Story would it be possible for a villainous Snake Woman working for the golf mafia to have a redemption arc, become part of the team, and assist Eve’s family in finding a new home and getting her siblings their citizenship. I was pleasantly surprised by this part of the show because it was great to see ethnic representation in anime. It is very uncommon for anime to cast people of color who aren’t subjected to racism by the writers. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it is an explicitly progressive text, but it comes close, especially by portraying the cops and bourgeois as caricatured villains and indefensible trash.Even the upper-class golfers it does make us sympathize with are based on their personalities rather than defending their class status, suggesting their flaws and inconsiderateness are caused by it. For instance, Eve is late to a golf match with Aoi because she is caught up in a high-stakes match that could decide her family’s fate. Rather than waiting longer, Aoi leaves and is seen on a plane in first class as Eve hilariously fires a golf ball so fast that Aoi can see it from her window seat. Once you abandon all sense of logic, you can see how it is an unsubtle metaphor for Eve matching Aoi’s pace despite their wealth inequality. Challenging the status quo of snobbery inherent to the sport is the meaning underlying every conflict. The on-the-nose metaphor even extends to their caddies: Eve’s uses a pen and paper, and Aoi’s has a tablet that calculates everything necessary to succeed, yet they are equally matched.Even the so-so art quality is bolstered by dynamic direction, imaginative storyboards, and visual storytelling. The artists, without a doubt, use the low budget to the best of their abilities. The outdated CGI environments are well utilized as establishing shots. A few highly detailed freeze frames convey a laughably campy tone to mask a lack of animation during dramatic dialogue. Right down to the exaggerated transitions effects show how much consideration went into every category. Everything Birdie Wing: Golf Girls’ Story aims to accomplish is achieved with flying colors.

Meanwhile, Main Character B (Aoi Amawashi) is a friendly Japanese socialite who was professionally trained since age 4. Naturally, the two meet one day and fall in love—I mean play golf.

After what seems like eons being trapped in the Gundam and Love Live salt mines, finally do they come up with another wacky original. I thought, man, it\'s just Golf, quite possibly the most boring sport in the whole world, how could they pull it off. And boy oh boy how glad I was to be proven wrong.First off,  the gritty noir faux-European setting one would associate more with Bee Train than Sunrise didn\'t clue you in, then the fact that half the series takes place in Nafrece would let you know all you need...to know. This show, like Bee Train\'s ""Girl With Guns"" trilogy, is written by none other than Kuroda Yousuke, although with a lot less angst (think somewhere in between Valkyrie Drive and Madlax).And wouldn\'t you know it, our main character Eve, sprouts out nothing but gun metaphors when she golfs. Oh sorry, ""golfs"". There is very little connecting this to the actual sport of hitting a ball with a club. Sure the characters talk about finesse and technique, but in practice it\'s no different to Donkey Kong swinging his club in Mario Golf or whatever. And it is glorious. Just absolutely glorious to behold. The show is very confident and proud of its stupidity and wears it like a badge of pride throughout. And the best part is, it (mostly) takes itself seriously. All that gritty noir mafia business, they all tie into a silly underground shifting mecha randomizer golf game! Apparently in this universe everything important ties back to golf somehow. The owner of the biggest conglomerate in Japan is Golf. The Nafrece Mafia is Golf. Eve ""sells herself""(?) with Golf. Golf Terrorism? You bet! And don\'t forget Golf Lesbians.

I’ve gone to the driving range several times, spent some days out at the links (both voluntarily and when I’d rather not), and have even tried watching the Master’s on television. Even after all these years, actually playing the sport itself just bounces off me like rubber. I can see why it has the appeal that it does, but I think it’s fair to say that I’ve given golf more than my own fair share of time and chances. There comes a point where you must shake your head and...admit that something’s not worth pursuing as a hobby or activity any longer. It’s a shame, but that’s sometimes the way things go.BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story was therefore a show that I was taking a major chance on. There was, however, reason to be hopeful – earlier this year, a 15-minute OVA called Sorairo Utility featured a slice-of-life take on golf, which I found pleasant, even if a little bit flawed. A thought then occurred to me – it is possible that golf and I were going to have a magical reconciliation, that I would gain new appreciation for the sport and see something within it that I had somehow missed all this time? I doubted it, but I still nevertheless decided to give this new series a drive.Eve is a blonde-haired golfer who takes on various golfing challenges. She earns money on these challenges with her “bullet” style of golfing, which doesn’t adhere to any of the techniques or refinement that one expects from a typical golfer. Her playstyle however attracts the attention of the young golf champion Amawashi Aoi, and Eve challenged to a hole on the range. After losing, Eve finds herself excited and wanting to challenge Amawashi again. She’ll have to deal though with other golfers desperate to knock her off her pedestal, as well as deal with her boss who holds a mafia-esque grip on her.In effect, BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story is a shonen in sports clothing, all done for a sport that, in theory, complements the idea the least. One of golf’s appeals is the relaxed nature of the whole, an underlying classiness and etiquette that is meant to be adhered to. It is a sport that requires patience and calculation, which allows one to stop and take the time to enjoy the setting and the company you’re keeping. It’s supposed to be encapsulated by the visual imagery of the course, expansive and lushly green with its bodies of water…so long as the bunkers and rough don’t eat your golf ball alive in the process. With the bombast and sense of extreme escalation that shonen is known for bringing to the table, golf is one of the sports that doesn’t sound at all ripe for making into a larger-scale spectacle.The show attacks that very mindset head-on, best demonstrated with its main character. Eve’s very manner of being is the polar opposite of everything that you reasonably expect from a golfer. Her attire looks like it was hastily thrown together in the dark, no doubt a result of her struggling financial situation both for herself and the family that she’s helping to care for (Gundam model kits included, evidently). Even her hair is largely unkempt, flowing down but without a ponytail or other way to keep it tidy. It makes for a perfect mirror to her personality: abrasive, blunt, and always ready to reach for her driver and destroy whoever lies in wait.And destroy them she does – despite her unorthodox style of presentation, it makes for highly-effective golfing. The training she underwent caused her to develop what she calls “Rainbow Bullet” golfing, in which she attacks the courses with a series of strong, blasting swings that take on particular effects to get the ball in the hole as quickly as possible. While she’s quite skilled, her style is also rife with risk, leaving the ever-lingering question behind of when, or if, the method will fail her. But when it clicks, the look on the faces of her opponents usually comes in two delicious flavors: resignation, or absolute fury at their sport being “desecrated.”Contrasting Eve is Amawashi, the perfect posterchild for the golfing world. Not only has her play been recognized (not to mention commented upon and envied) by her peers, but she also has the perfect smile and temperament to match. Much of BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story’s drama comes from these two girls from two different worlds colliding on the day of their fateful encounter, the results of which leave lasting impressions on both. In that sense, the show adopts the classic shonen trope of friendships being forged on the “battlefield,” establishing the kind of spontaneous connection that defies explanation or description. Their dynamic is a walking example of the old adage that “opposites attract.”That attraction is spilled all over the anime. In an effort to leave the audience with the yearning to have the two see each other again, the show manages to concoct various do-or-die scenarios for Eve in the mafia’s vicegrip, or play up the melancholy Amawashi feels since she cannot see the person who has thrilled her more than anyone else (much to the consternation of her caddy, who’d sooner throw Eve off the side of a cliff if she could). There is no attempt here to hide yuri baiting, whether it be conveyed through actual dialogue or when the anime decides to temporarily adopt shoujo-style bubbles with a glowing border and many sparkles. In this case, the bait is part of the appeal – BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story fully commits to its desire to go over the absurd threshold and not look back. The result is that the “romance” between Eve and Amawashi is odd and fun.Odd and fun, wonderfully enough, refers to much of the other cast as well. With the mafia backdrop, there is no shortage of rich, pompous slimeballs who delight in using a dignified sport for their undignified operations. The web of how the mafia operates, both in external effects on the world and with its internal politics, is something that series composer Kuroda Yousuke clearly had fun reveling in. The labyrinth runs hilariously deep, with so much goings-on that the golf matches both act as plot threads to move things forward and fun little digressions when the narrative isn’t spending time teeing up its next crazy situation. No matter what situation is present at the moment, its always stupidly enjoyable.Though the animation could, at best, be considered “acceptable” given that it’s not particularly excelling in any respects. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the character models, occasional use of CGI, or the backgrounds and layouts. The visual element suffers from mostly just being unimpressive, and at times the lighting and compositing gives things an unusual sheen, even in the sunlight. Musically, the series doesn’t really have anything to offer either, as the tracks themselves seemed to exist more as placeholders and ways to fill space rather than incorporating anything noteworthy.But more than any of that is just the sensation that I couldn’t help but feel that I wondered into the wrong country club. I mean that in the best way possible. Everything in BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story’s existence is over-the-top and impossible to take seriously. It is a mosaic of ideas where everyone involved in production seemed to ask themselves, “Why the hell not? Throw it in!” and ran full-tilt with that ideology. What should have been, under virtually all other circumstances or conditions, bugs in the design instead became features. The series is a chimera of hilarity and that indescribable feeling of enjoying something that, by all accounts, should not exist.As I’ve hinted at throughout the course of this writing, that, I think, is part of the reason why the show worked for me – in a way, BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story is the thematic antithesis to golf despite taking place within a golf framework. Eve’s sheer brutality and unrefined attitude functions as a fun contrast to the more prim-and-proper Amawashi, and the fact that so much of Eve’s circumstances is rooted in a kind of seedy, golf underworld is bizarrely entertaining. I was left with so many questions as to why things transpired the way that they did, but always with a wink and a nod rather than a headshaking disappointment.I was quirkily amused by its silliness and occasional ineptitude such that I couldn’t help myself but have fun. How else would one plausibly explain why an entire mafia underworld golf course is in the subterranean basement level of a real estate office, taking place in a gigantic wind tunnel and with mechanisms in place to randomize the course however you see fit? I suppose in a way it’s rather sad that golf had to take such a perverse angle on itself to capture my attention, but, nevertheless, capture my attention it did!BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story embraces its absurdity by taking the finesse of golf and making it more rugged. While in many respects it fails as a piece of entertainment given the animation, compositing, and music, its characters and the story they inhabit are such an odd bunch that it manages to hold itself together. I fault no one for saying this show is garbage, since I can’t even bring myself to disagree that much; but as a piece of entertainment, it amused me in a way that real golf never did. I won’t be grabbing a five-iron anytime soon, but I certainly won’t be forgetting this show anytime soon, either. admit that something’s not worth pursuing as a hobby or activity any longer.

With the mafia backdrop, there is no shortage of rich, pompous slimeballs who delight in using a dignified sport for their undignified operations. The web of how the mafia operates, both in external effects on the world and with its internal politics, is something that series composer Kuroda Yousuke clearly had fun reveling in. The labyrinth runs hilariously deep, with so much goings-on that the golf matches both act as plot threads to move things forward and fun little digressions when the narrative isn’t spending time teeing up its next crazy situation. No matter what situation is present at the moment, its always stupidly enjoyable.Though the animation could, at best, be considered “acceptable” given that it’s not particularly excelling in any respects. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the character models, occasional use of CGI, or the backgrounds and layouts. The visual element suffers from mostly just being unimpressive, and at times the lighting and compositing gives things an unusual sheen, even in the sunlight. Musically, the series doesn’t really have anything to offer either, as the tracks themselves seemed to exist more as placeholders and ways to fill space rather than incorporating anything noteworthy.But more than any of that is just the sensation that I couldn’t help but feel that I wondered into the wrong country club. I mean that in the best way possible. Everything in BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story’s existence is over-the-top and impossible to take seriously. It is a mosaic of ideas where everyone involved in production seemed to ask themselves, “Why the hell not? Throw it in!” and ran full-tilt with that ideology. What should have been, under virtually all other circumstances or conditions, bugs in the design instead became features. The series is a chimera of hilarity and that indescribable feeling of enjoying something that, by all accounts, should not exist.As I’ve hinted at throughout the course of this writing, that, I think, is part of the reason why the show worked for me – in a way, BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story is the thematic antithesis to golf despite taking place within a golf framework. Eve’s sheer brutality and unrefined attitude functions as a fun contrast to the more prim-and-proper Amawashi, and the fact that so much of Eve’s circumstances is rooted in a kind of seedy, golf underworld is bizarrely entertaining. I was left with so many questions as to why things transpired the way that they did, but always with a wink and a nod rather than a headshaking disappointment.I was quirkily amused by its silliness and occasional ineptitude such that I couldn’t help myself but have fun. How else would one plausibly explain why an entire mafia underworld golf course is in the subterranean basement level of a real estate office, taking place in a gigantic wind tunnel and with mechanisms in place to randomize the course however you see fit? I suppose in a way it’s rather sad that golf had to take such a perverse angle on itself to capture my attention, but, nevertheless, capture my attention it did!BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls’ Story embraces its absurdity by taking the finesse of golf and making it more rugged. While in many respects it fails as a piece of entertainment given the animation, compositing, and music, its characters and the story they inhabit are such an odd bunch that it manages to hold itself together. I fault no one for saying this show is garbage, since I can’t even bring myself to disagree that much; but as a piece of entertainment, it amused me in a way that real golf never did. I won’t be grabbing a five-iron anytime soon, but I certainly won’t be forgetting this show anytime soon, either.', ""More than the sum of its parts. Worth your time. 10/10 (I like golf, and golf girls, so slightly biased)Now to fill the FIVE HUNDRED character minimum, I will first be grabbing another beer.This is a fun anime that is executed well. I think the story is great, the crime/underworld take is very unique and makes the exposition interesting. After that its fairly straightforward with focus on training/playing, its well done and that's all it needs to be, its a golf anime. My only gripe is that the dialogue can be VERY direct at times (i.e. x speaks y now just because, like ok). Otherwise...its a relaxed, fun anime that I look forward to watching. Here's to hoping for S2, but that's probably a pipe dream. its a relaxed, fun anime that I look forward to watching.

And I have enjoyed that time more than I expected.Plot: Two rival golfers pushing each other to the peak of their games. One, Eve, makes a living from the seedy underground golf circuit. The other, Aoi Amawashi is a 15 year old Japanese golf prodigy  whose parents were both at their top of the game. Eve golfs as a way to live, paying the bills for herself and the group of orphans she cares for with two other girls. She uses her...strength to literally shoot her way through trouble, she is known as “Rainbow Bullet”. After 3 episodes, they’re just starting to establish Eve and Aoi’s rivalry. Hopefully there is more from this apparent mob that runs the underground golf circuit.Art & Sound: It’s fine. Most of the actual golf shots are CGI, which is somewhat expected. For a sports anime there are a lot of still reaction shots (then again that’s half of sports/battle anime). But they animate the grass and the girls swinging the clubs very nicely. I mean it’s not KyoAni or bones, so it’s not going to be jaw dropping. The actual character designs are solid, nothing too exceptional. I like the OP and ED, catchy and upbeat. The background music is fine, not intrusive and sets the tone well. I have no idea if it’s just because it’s scoring a golf anime but the music at times reminds me of the Wii Sports Golf OST.Overall:While I have enjoyed my time with this show so far, I still wouldn’t recommend this unless you’re into an absurd anime about girls who are able to shoot golf balls between trains and call their shots weird attack names (ie. Blue Bullet). But if you’re open to the idea of a show that takes one of the dullest sports and adds some of that anime brand stupid to it, then this could be the perfect fit for you.

I was wrong. I was so, so wrong.I like to think that this show's genesis started with a production committee telling an animation studio that they wanted a story about crazy golf, but the writer had never heard of crazy golf. So instead of ramps and miniature windmills we find ourselves in a world where the criminal underground makes decisions based on the outcome of high stakes golf matches. Since Birdie Wing has no interest in subtlety, these matches...take place literally underground. Golfers shout the names of their special golfing moves. There is psychological golf warfare. There's a nymphomaniac snake woman with fangs and questionable personal hygiene. The protagonist's scar-faced golf coach is voiced by Char frakking Aznable himself. Sounds crazy? I haven't even mentioned what happens when the golf mafia doesn't like the results of a match. Let's just say rocket launchers may be involved. I won't spoil the most jaw-dropping moment in the series; just make sure you keep watching after the end credits in episode 7.Birdie Wing occupies that special zone of anime madness perfected by Fist of the North Star, where it simultaneously serves up deadly serious drama and over the top lunacy in equal measure, and you're never 100% certain if the people making it are in on the joke or playing it straight.

Her perspective and ambitions are challenged and changed completely when she meets another junior golfer her age, who is also an aspiring professional.Birdie Wing has everything and the kitchen sink, from shady organizations that engage in life-and-death gambling, to rainbow-colored and specially-named golf club swings that make them seem like some kind of ultimate attack, to corporate ambition and greed. It dangles the prospect...of the main character building a meaningful relationship with her foil in front of the viewer like a carrot, while also juggling a plethora of whacky twists and turns. It does this all while maintaining a serious narrative about one of the most irrevocably boring sports in existence.The writing is not merely entertaining, but it is so ridiculous that the show must be seen to be believed. It is a spectacle and has several serious character moments that simply cannot be taken seriously at all. It is unintentionally funny and unpredictable. The pacing is good for the entirety of the season and does an admirable job at keeping the level of intrigue high. The animation is fine for what it is.The characters are decently written, have a variety of traits, and continue to develop as the series progresses.

For one, the show manages to do the impossible and make watching golf actually interesting by being as over the top as possible, with different techniques being treated like moves in a shonen action series complete with their own names that Eve shoots out loud when performing them. The first eight episodes of the series mainly explore the world of Nafrece, a country where for some reason the criminal elites love to gamble using illegal underground golf games. It's reminiscent of other great action-packed crime anime like Michiko & Hatchin or Great Pretenders...with a sports-themed twist to it.The problem is that once Eve leaves Nafrece for Japan, the show just devolves into a run-of-the-mill sports anime that feels like it belongs in a completely different show. On one hand, the high school arc is by no means bad and I think it would have made a good sports anime in a vacuum, but it's incredibly anticlimatic when it's coming immediately after the extremely high-stakes scenario that the last arc took place in. And while I understand why Eve would want to leave the dangerous world of underground golfing behind to make an honest living as a professional like her love interest Aoi, from a storytelling perspective it's effectively the equivalent of the plot shooting itself in the foot. How is the audience supposed to care about in a regular high school tournament when Eve was partaking in a literal golf match to the death just a few episodes ago? It's like if you were watching a monster truck rally but two-thirds of the way through the drivers got out of their trucks and switched into bumper cars. And to add insult to injury the first season just abruptly ends in the middle of the tournament and we'll now have to wait almost another year to see the conclusion of the arc.Personally, I think this story would have worked so much better as two separate golf-themed anime, one being a more standard sports anime set in a Japanese high school and another exploring the world of underground Mafia golf in a Brazil-esque setting. Overall, I still think that the show is worth checking out just for the first eight episodes alone and thankfully the show will be receiving at least one more season to potentially redeem itself. with a sports-themed twist to it.The problem is that once Eve leaves Nafrece for Japan, the show just devolves into a run-of-the-mill sports anime that feels like it belongs in a completely different show.

I mention this up front for two reasons: it's a blessing deserving of the most joyous of canticles, and it helps calibrate expectations for this week's episode. It's a season finale in name only, going about its typically bonkers Birdie Wing business without any concern for placing a punctuation mark on the end of part one. In a sense, it's relieving. This means the showrunners always planned to have a second cours and thus wrote the...show with that in mind. We even get a normal episode preview despite the incoming six-month gap. But it also means there's no heart-racing cliffhanger or explosive developments to whet our appetite for part two—unless, of course, you count Aoi and Eve flirting harder than ever before.Birdie Wing tells the opening act of the doubles tournament in an intelligently truncated fashion. We already know who the big players are thanks to the past several weeks of buildup, so there's no need to focus too much attention on the early fodder. Rather, the show uses this time to show us that, despite their reality-bending level of talent, Eve and Aoi are far from infallible. They're winning handily, but they're making mistakes that will cost them if they play that way against Koran or Nada. While that's typical tournament arc fare, it's made that much better with the knowledge that these rival high school girls are even scarier golfers than the mafia-affiliated ones. That's the correct way to scale power levels.This episode is most intriguing, however, when it steps away from the young pups in the competition and starts peeling layers away from the adults' backstory and motivations. They're every bit as melodramatic as anything else in Birdie Wing, with impending deaths, power-hungry CEOs, legendary golfers, and drunkard coaches peppering the cast. Eve and Aoi's story right now is an extension of these past conflicts and current grudges. Eve's carrying on Golf Char's frightful legacy whether she wants to or not, while Aoi sees her father in Mizuho's carefully prepared form. Winning this tournament will require both of them to confront the specters of the father figures, who each remain veiled by a thick curtain of mystery. This tiered, multi-generational storytelling tack is a smart, time-tested way to flesh out characters and their narrative (Evangelion is a great example), and it'll help set up whatever's in store for the next arc as well.But that's enough about stodgy old fogies and the problems they inexorably foist upon the next generation. Let's talk about what really matters: Eve and Aoi being cute idiots together. The opening is a perfect example, with Eve planting a peck on Aoi's cheek and playing it off like it's a normal Nafrecian custom (Nafrece, recall, is a stand-in for France). In truth, Eve knows exactly what she's doing, and she's just a demon who loves watching Aoi squirm. What is that if not the definition of true love? Their rapport on the green is similarly great, as they drive each other to golf better and goof off in equal measure, much to consternation of their caddies. These growing pains, however, are the whole reason for tournament arcs. They're learning how to be partners. If it takes wagering hamburgers and kisses, then that's just the cost of doing business, and by business, I mean flustering your golf girlfriend to high heaven.There's not much else to comment on this week, aside from taking a moment to appreciate the individual things Birdie Wing has done consistently well throughout the season. The writing is obviously the star here. Yosuke Kuroda lovingly embraces all the absurdities of these characters and their world, and he embroils them in deceptively complicated conflicts while peppering the proceedings with plenty of snappy humor and playful genre affects. Both he and the entire cast have a lot of fun with the script, and it shows. Director Takayuki Inagaki deserves a lot of credit too, stretching the modest production values with eye-catching (and sometimes hilarious) postcard memories and enough dynamism in framing to complement the over-the-top flair of the writing. He also storyboarded all but the last two episodes by himself, which is no small feat. The soundtrack by Hironori Anazawa and Kotaro Nakagawa, meanwhile, is probably the most unsung hero, or at least I wish I had taken more time to highlight it previously. Those bright, jazzy horns have become iconic. The character design from Kei Ajiki works extremely well too, from the gaudy serpentine clownshow that is my beloved Vipère, to the more mundane yet all the more frightening menace that emanates from Mizuho. Sometimes, Birdie Wing feels like an anime displaced by a few decades, but if so, that only means it has sturdy bones that have weathered the slings and arrows of the industry.Before the spring season commenced, I certainly didn't foresee being blown away by a cult classic in the making about high tension aboveboard and under-the-table golf girl shenanigans, yet here I am, thirteen weeks of slack-jawed disbelief later. While the premiere alone convinced me of Birdie Wing's quality and potential, there was no way to know whether or not that opening drive would sustain enough momentum to carry an entire cours' worth of fairway fracases. Well, now I know, and I can't wait to see how high Eve's Blue Bullet takes us in six months. See you on the back nine! Or back thirteen.

Both he and the entire cast have a lot of fun with the script, and it shows. Director Takayuki Inagaki deserves a lot of credit too, stretching the modest production values with eye-catching (and sometimes hilarious) postcard memories and enough dynamism in framing to complement the over-the-top flair of the writing. He also storyboarded all but the last two episodes by himself, which is no small feat. The soundtrack by Hironori Anazawa and Kotaro Nakagawa, meanwhile, is probably the most unsung hero, or at least I wish I had taken more time to highlight it previously. Those bright, jazzy horns have become iconic. The character design from Kei Ajiki works extremely well too, from the gaudy serpentine clownshow that is my beloved Vipère, to the more mundane yet all the more frightening menace that emanates from Mizuho. Sometimes, Birdie Wing feels like an anime displaced by a few decades, but if so, that only means it has sturdy bones that have weathered the slings and arrows of the industry.Before the spring season commenced, I certainly didn't foresee being blown away by a cult classic in the making about high tension aboveboard and under-the-table golf girl shenanigans, yet here I am, thirteen weeks of slack-jawed disbelief later. While the premiere alone convinced me of Birdie Wing's quality and potential, there was no way to know whether or not that opening drive would sustain enough momentum to carry an entire cours' worth of fairway fracases. Well, now I know, and I can't wait to see how high Eve's Blue Bullet takes us in six months. See you on the back nine! Or back thirteen. Or however many more episodes we're blessed with."", ""To Eve: The way you golf is ridiculous.Eve: To me, it’s the proper way to golf.Birdie Wing: Golf Girls’ Story is Decent to watch. I'm not calling it “Mid”. It just had ups and downs from start to finish.Plus, I never would’ve thought that golf in anime is pretty entertaining…unless you put some absurd amount of things that Anime could do. Like, a Baddie Snake Woman, moving Facility that can make the world crumble, Mafias’ betting all their money to golf, VR that is identical to real life experience. You name it! There’s more things to say, but I’m not here to diss the show.Yet.I’m...here to find out what got me to like watching this show.First and foremost. The intro.I already found that the first three of the episodes were somewhat decent to watch. Because I was talking to my brother and told him, “Dude, Idk man. Golf in Anime f***ing slaps”. It already shows how the characters build up to their background stories. And how great they use the OST and Animation. It was great.Until I watched episode 4, 5, and 6.This is where everything changed my perspective from watching the show.It introduces new characters where Eve is living in a life of poverty. BUTOn Episode 4, Mafias were introduced. Underground Pro Golfers. And a huge facility is made just for golfing. It got me thinking. WTF is happening. Onto episode 5, VR is somewhat big. Even professional players are taking it. And lastly. Episode 6. Eve’s instructor named Leo was introduced. Snake Woman became Eve’s caddy. So much trusting a person in a mafia people. And Leo, Eve’s instructor. He used to teach Rose right before she loses her arm(one of Eve’s rivals in episode 7).With an abominable amount of games. Finally, Eve won her underground tournament which led to having a loathsome amount of money. So after winning a mafia game, Eve gets targeted by the Mafia Boss.And here she must set a new arc.Arriving in JapanWhile she runs away from her home country.

Ichina replied, “I’m still studying English”. Eve in out of nowhere said in Japanese, “You from around here?” Ichina questioned her, “You can speak Japanese!?” And Eve replied to herself in Nihonjin, “I guess I can. Why, I wonder?”**I paused for a moment. And straight up bursting laughter. I was dying from laughing. And It got me thinking. (I need to write a review on this. I need this so badly.)At this point, I don’t even know if this show is valid for its sports genre. Sure it is pretty entertaining if they focused on golfing and with rivalries, but it just went like. **?What?**And what also got me thinking in every episode is the “Mr. Incredible becoming Uncanny” meme.

Golf is not the most riveting sport in the world (I actually quite enjoy it, and even I admit it is not the most exciting). That said, what better place is there than anime, where any and everything can be taken up to 11, to make such a non-riveting sport into a wacky, fun story all about it? Enter Birdie Wing.As the synopsis suggests, the intertwining of the arcs of the two MCs, Aoi and Eve, is the focal point of this story. The contrast of their prefaces is hardly...original between Aoi, the renowned child prodigy, and Eve, the disgruntled vet who fought her way to the top. As it is with most facets of this anime, the golf motif makes such elements feel quite original. What makes this duo, and many others like it, so endearing is that though they're both so different in circumstance and personality, they get on the same wavelength in a very natural way. In this case, they are both unstoppable forces in the world of golf, but are such forces in entirely different ways. They both respect each other's game highly and quickly recognize their differences when it comes to their play styles, making for a fulfilling rivalry. The yuri bait starts to pile on at points, but such tends to be the nature of anime sometimes with a two-girl MC duet.The story across these 13 episodes exists in two distinct halves. For spoiler reasons, I will avoid covering the exact topics. The two halves are quite different, with the first expressing a sense of urgency and emotional intensity that is lacking in the second. Though some darker topics are touched upon, the story itself is not particularly deep or profound. Both main girls are introduced right at the very beginning, but Eve is the main driver of the story early on. The first half ends in a way that leaves some of its plot points open to potentially return to in Season 2. Though the second major arc lacks the intensity of the first, it is still decently enjoyable. Aoi and Eve start to share the screen more and their chemistry really starts to take off. In addition, a whole new wave of characters is introduced, helping keep things fresh. That said, the change in story direction from the first to the second half is quite jarring, especially considering how much more emotionally packed the first half is. When considering the two halves as an entire package, many elements feel disjointed. This change is also felt in the cast of side characters introduced in the beginning and those introduced at the second half. There is a good variety to the cast, but there are many sorts of characters that will never meet, simply due to how separated those two plot points are. That notwithstanding, there is a big positive in that, the spin on the actual golf being played is different between the two, keeping the on-screen product from getting stale.Since this is a sports anime, it is very important that this distinction is made now. This is a golf anime, but this is one of those entries where keeping the on-screen product factually accurate to the sport it is portraying is never a priority, a practice done in the same vein as entries like Kuroko's Basketball and, more recently, Blue Lock. That said, it is not so far gone that it lacks the finer strategies of golf, mainly thanks to the visual and audio cues. While some may find issue with this, it could also be seen as this show's greatest strength. This show is not afraid to express its unconventional ideas in the slightest. The characters’ actual playstyles are not too unique, using the tried and true method of ‘shonen-ifying’ for lack of a better word, meaning their playstyle is expressed as some sort of supernatural power. Again though, the X-factor this show has in this regard is due to the golf devices. I have never heard of a golf swing being so rigorously compared to firing a gun, and I doubt I will hear such a thing anywhere else. Other story beats, like the mafia settling business through games of golf, are just as fanciful. Those elements and others all feel wacky and almost nonsensical, but at the same time, the all-encompassing style of golf gives this show a feel of fun as well as its own flavor that is hard to easily replicate. So many elements here are so out-of-the-box that they feel fresh and exciting, leaving a novel sense of anticipation. On the other hand, such an approach leads to the more serious parts of the story feeling almost out-of-place at times.Visually, this anime holds up. The art style is clean, if not a bit generic. The fidelity and detail are passable, though there is a general low-bugdet feel to a lot of the backdrops. The balance of color is mostly clear and consistent, though it can be a bit over-saturated at times. Given that the cast is almost entirely female, there is good variety to the designs. The sense of fashion is also solid, with the golf motif once again leading to some more unique designs. The aforementioned contrast between Aoi and Eve also applies visually, helping set in that sense of variety. The visual aspects of the golf being played are not consistently dynamic, but they are good enough to get the point across. Characters' swings are fluent and smooth for the most part. The distinct visual effects that accompany players’ 'powers' that come with were also fine albeit a bit generic. In terms of the courses, there are some more realistic designs and some completely not so at all, but both types looked good. The shades of green across all of the courses, realistic or absurd, are steady and consistent, helping maintain the color balance and keep the saturation between the character designs and the backdrops consistent.Sound design is also solid. The voice acting is very good. Though many of the side characters are voiced by names not too familiar, Asami Seto and Akari Kitou are two super-heavyweight names who both bring their A-game here. Their respective performances as Aoi and Eve truly take this pairing to the next level. The music is good but not as much so, though Venus Line is a banger of an OP. The OST is good and has a decent variety of sounds, but it needs more songs. There are some serving as character themes of sorts, but others are rehashed with not enough consistency to when they were used. The sound effects have decent depth to them. The metal clang of the club hitting the ball, the soft thud of the ball hitting the green, the swaying of the wind as the ball travels through the air and many other effects all almost serve as the main devices that remind the viewer that no matter what foolishness may be occurring on screen, it is still at least some form of golf. The ‘powers’ also get their own effects, which have a similar sort of strong 'pop’, but some do not feel as surreal as they could or should be.As enjoyable as this show is, it hardly moves the needle in any substantial way. A common theme in this review has been the golf themes and motifs are what make this anime stand out. Though this could be interpreted as its major strength, it could also be seen as a fresh coat of cherry-red paint hiding a dull gray interior. It does take some dissection, but a lot of the story beats can come off as quite generic with the golf removed. Again, generic does not mean bad, so though it is not a non-issue, it is not a problem that detracts too much from potential enjoyment. It also helps that the second season actually does not have this issue, as the story starts to come full circle there, but that's for a different review.Though this show will hardly make any sort of great wave, Birdie Wing is a perfect example of simply having a good time with an established set of ideas. It takes a lot of risks with its novel spins on tried-and-true ideas and reaps the rewards. This anime has a strong sense of its identity in the face of its unorthodox progression. Even with some of the scenarios lacking in true originality, credit is due for the creativity applied to still succeed in making them feel unique, as outlandish and even downright nonsensical they can get. Though generic it may be after taking away the ‘golf’ skin, the execution still works out well here. There is no shortage or substitute for the excitement in the watching experience, even with the all-around mid-budget feel. The characters are fun and their developments are unpredictable and enjoyable. The audiovisuals are not ground-breaking by any stretch, but have a consistent quality. Even with how much there is to like, in all honesty, though the show itself is quite good, there's not too many elements to it to truly draw viewers in. I found this anime because I was interested in the golf motif and I would definitely recommend it to those with a similar sentiment. original between Aoi, the renowned child prodigy, and Eve, the disgruntled vet who fought her way to the top.

Oh, and they have names for their ""moves"".The characters are really really lovable, and the moment to moment story is not only really good paced but interesting.We can really see how the writers can create an atmosphere of upcoming conflit without being pushy, and making all characters involved interesting in this situation.The soundtrack is top notch, it melds really well with action scenes. Can be sometimes repetitive but since the track is good, does not seems much big of a deal. You...can really see something good is going to happen based on the track choice alone.Plotwise, its does not innovate, it just do it properly without rushing or being a slug like some sports shows.Never imagined i\'d be hooked on an Golf anime, but this one really a treat and deserves more attention. can really see something good is going to happen based on the track choice alone.Plotwise, its does not innovate, it just do it properly without rushing or being a slug like some sports shows.Never imagined i\'d be hooked on an Golf anime, but this one really a treat and deserves more attention.', ""Birdie Wing is a surprisingly engaging show about the world's most boring sport; golf.I'm surprised how engaged I got with all the matches and genuinely cheering for Eve and hoping she could get out of her bad circumstances with her family. The stakes of them losing their only home gave what could easily feel like repetitive golf matches the necessary tension. With the addition of her beginning to reach higher and care for her craft Eve was given plenty to work with as a character. Gave her some good depth.The characters definitely are the highlight of this show. They're all very charming with unique, eye...catching designs. Golf clothes are typically stereotypically ugly in things so it was fun to see the actual types of designs that professional golfers would wear. Well, for the ones who were normal golfers anyways. As much as I liked Vipere she is an outlier clothing wise lol.I also went into this not expecting it to be angling towards yuri, I hope it continues in that direction as I loved Eve and Aoi's friends/rivals relationship and would love to see it get expanded on more.My only real complaint is that the first season feels like half a season. It ends really abruptly and at a strange point that feels like it should be midseason rising tension. I haven't had a chance to watch the second season yet but if it ends the arc successfully I'll probably boost this first season up to a 9.Edit: Season 2 is a hot mess, score adjusted accordingly. catching designs.

I enjoy playing it, watching it, the whole culture surrounding golf, and will wait in line for hours to get US Open tickets, and someday dream of heading to St. Andrew\'s -- the home of golf -- to play a round (even though I suck at golf personally). So on that alone, I was hoping Birdie Wing would be a fun watch -- because it\'s a golf anime, and we don\'t see that often! I therefore expected a typical sports anime with cute girls doing golf and it being well animatedI didn\'t get that. But what we got instead is even better...than what I hoped.Essentially this is less ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" and more ""Rounders"" to use IRL movie references. There\'s an underground golf mafia, a girl (Eve) who only plays for money, and who eventually runs into another girl (Aoi) who is seen as a prodigy and together, they pledge to eventually play a round with eachother. Along the way, there\'s a neighborhood that needs to be saved, illegal orphans living in a bar who depend on Eve\'s ability to make money on the underground circuit, and enough lesbian energy that has me praying that doujin artists can keep us satisfied until s2 comes out in January.Heck, the fact that it has people who aren\'t that interested in golf -- or for whatever (dumb) reason hate the sport -- excited about the anime makes me think it could get more young people fascinated by the sport by showing it in a new, cool light. That would be a win for both sides wouldn\'t it?So yeah, if you love golf or are just interested, this is the anime for you. Come for the golf, stay for the thinly veiled yuri and mafia shenanigans. You won\'t be disappointed. than what I hoped.Essentially this is less ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" and more ""Rounders"" to use IRL movie references.

You won\'t be disappointed.', 'What a bizarre experience this Anime has been.From having a story with an awkward Spanish-Teledrama vibe to having bonkers so-bad-it\'s-good moments. From trying hard to justify the ""Golf"" concept to basically going ""Heck it! It\'s Yuri on Greens Motha\'F\'ers!"".Idk y\'all...I liked it. It\'s like a guilty pleasure I can be proud of. With that being said I\'ll have to admit... Story\'s poop XD So this review will likely be more negative than a positive one.STORY:Golf was just the chosen gimmick, nothing more. It could have been any sport, any competition, any kind of battle, just simply ""anything"" and the story they told would\'ve still ended...up being the same. It was more of a Trash-Talk battle with the one who gets the final burn, winning or a battle of feelings where the one who has more regrets, insecurities, and weaker resolve, loses. But credit where credit is due, they did manage to make it seem Golf is a factor in the story by involving it in dialogues more often than not. Just a shame that they didn\'t make the actual Golf match shenanigans interesting enough.

""Shoot through your opponent\'s heart with one shot. Destroy your opponent\'s spirit so they won\'t dare challenge you again"". The idea of a protagonist not just winning a match on their better day, but winning decisively and strong to be etched in the opponent\'s memory, rendering them courageless to face them again is one helluva strong point... if only the competition aspect of the Anime was good enough to make use of that *sigh*CHARACTERS:When a story is bad, the only thing that could save a show is the characters.EVE Aleon (the protag) fortunately has a striking personality for a protagonist; straightforward, somewhat abrasive, competitive, risk-taker, and confident. It sometimes helps in making the Golf matches a bit interesting with her aggressive and stubborn play-style being her weakness when she\'s already being deemed as a strong Golfer by her opponents and spectators.AOI Amawashi\'s story has already been set up way back in the first half of the season but they saved it for the next season, likely to be the main plot for that.

It was more of a Trash-Talk battle with the one who gets the final burn, winning or a battle of feelings where the one who has more regrets, insecurities, and weaker resolve, loses. But credit where credit is due, they did manage to make it seem Golf is a factor in the story by involving it in dialogues more often than not. Just a shame that they didn\'t make the actual Golf match shenanigans interesting enough.

Despite being an anime original, it’s actually well-structured and paced unlike many anime originals (talking to you Carole and Tuesday).The story is actually pretty fun as long as you suspend your disbelief. I mean, women’s golf matches in illegal mafia betting matches with millions of dollars on the line. I totally thought this plot point would be eventually forgotten in favor of development of later story arcs, but this show actually manages to make the plot points about...the mafia relevant, and wraps it up in a meaningful manner before continuing on with the story. It reminds me of one-outs or Kengan Ashura, which is very good. However, at the same time, for how ridiculous the story is, it does break its own logic. I’m glad that for the illegal betting part of the anime that involved the mafia, it felt like there were actual stakes involved, but it also over-dramatizes the almost comedic mafia matches. Again, the show isn’t exactly going for realism when women’s golf matches are the target of mafia betting, or when a 15 year old girl is hitting 300 yard driver slices. In one match, the loser almost gets killed by hitmen but survives. So far so good: a good taste of the potential consequences, but the story not taking itself too seriously. As indicated even in the escape sequence, the person gets out in an almost comedic fashion.This is where the story breaks its own logic. The second match, both Eve and her opponent piss off the mafia, and hitmen are sent after them. Her opponent dies, yet Eve manages to escape scot-free. In fact, Eve basically knew that she was going to die, and did nothing. Just so you know, while Eve escaped the country, her family didn’t. Why didn’t the hitmen go after her family to hold them hostage or something? Because the story wanted to wrap the damn arc up, that’s why. In fact, barring the plot hole, you’d think mentally, Eve would be pretty devastated because someone she knew died. Kind of like Joe from Ashita no Joe, this should be a pretty damning blow to her mental state, maybe to the point where Eve would quit golf for a while. What does this story do? Nah, Eve just travels to Japan to continue fighting strong opponents. Plus, her family’s living the good life back at home! Again, not looking for too much realism in a show like this, but damn, it’s kind of hard to do that when it changes the tone of the story for nothing but an over-dramatic death that didn’t need to be included, when in reality, most characters have no consequences for their actions.What about characters? Eve is a solid character. Raised in the slums as an illegal immigrant, she got “mysteriously trained” in the ways of golf by an ex-pro. With a mysterious past, professional training, and hardcore talent to boot, she takes on the world of golf! She’s arrogant, plays an aggressive style, and is the perfect character for such a mundane story about, well, golf. Her rival, Amawashi is the “aloof genius,” where she’s been blessed with talent, born into a family of professional golfers, and has been trained her entire life to be a good golfer. They have good synergy with each other, with completely different pasts and personalities, the only thing they have in common is that they play golf and are insanely good at it. In the beginning, they only played with each other because they found each other to be interesting, but later on, they became friends. The interactions between Eve and Amawashi are not bad at all for the time invested, and there’s also their caddies, which add into the mix of relevant characters. I did find the way that Eve got so profoundly interested in Amawashi to be weird. For her personality, it felt pretty off, but you gotta do what you gotta do to accelerate the plot I guess.That’s not the main reason why I found the characters to be decent though. It’s the fact that both Eve and Awamashi are not Mary Sues. I initially thought they were going to be irritably annoying for how perfect they are at golf. Hitting birdies, hitting the same exact position every time, never missing putts, I thought they were just going to be the best golfers with no weaknesses. Thankfully, despite them being very good, and at a near Mary-Sue level, they actually still have competition. People can challenge them, and even Eve and Awamashi make mistakes sometimes.It makes them actually feel human, which I just sometimes cannot see in a lot of these anime original female protagonists.Does Birdie have an accurate portrayal of golf? Absolutely not. Going under 12 is insane in golf, and people in this show do it like it’s natural. Or you know, getting eagles, putting it in the hole nearly every time, and so on. Or how about driving 270 as a woman? Just like any shounen show about sports, a lot of things are exaggerated to increase the excitement of golf. In the first arc, where Eve participates in mafia betting, it certainly does the job. Add in tense, close golf matches, and they’re good. However, Eve eventually moves to Japan in the second arc of the show, and starts doing high school golf with Awamashi, essentially abandoning illegal betting. The fact that Eve gets to play with Amawashi also kind of blows off a lot of the tension and buildup. Going to use Ashita no Joe again, but the fight between Joe and Rikiishi was hyped up for so many chapters before Joe got to fight him. In Birdie, Eve just flies over to Japan and plays with Awamashi in the same school.Plus, while the other characters that are introduced in the second arc are not bad opponents to be excited about, there never really is a showdown, and they don’t get nearly enough screen time for you to actually care about the other characters. It would have been nice if Eve retained some of her golf betting roots, and just kind of went up the ladder in Japan in underground golf before eventually becoming a tour pro or something. But I digress. None of the matches in the second arc are particularly interesting, as it’s more about the build up of the upcoming tournament, but frankly, the show just fails to make full use of the what, 5-6 episodes that they had? In those 5 to 6 episodes, Eve and Awamashi only fight nobodies, and 2 rival characters are introduced. The show could have certainly just had an exciting match involving one of those rival characters in some way. While some of the episodes are useful for worldbuilding, there’s also a decent chunk of time, at least episode’s worth, where all the relevant characters are golfing against nobodies.There’s also animation. Clearly this show wasn’t given a lot of budget, but I don’t think it hindered my viewing experience. Sure, it’s annoying that there’s a lot of re-used animations, or TON of frames where people just do not move and only talk. This is where golf comes into play, as you can basically just have a ton of shots of a ball soaring through the air, which is super easy to animate. However, no CGI was used for the players playing the actual golf, so it’s a pass for me.I would have given a solid 7 if the show ended in the first arc despite the flaws it had, but the second arc kind of just failed to hook me in. I’d probably watch the second season, since the show has potential, but ultimately, there’s too many issues for me to give it a higher score. the mafia relevant, and wraps it up in a meaningful manner before continuing on with the story.

That being said that pacing is all over the place so far and the show is trying to figure out what it wants to be still.Story so far: Eve and Aoi are two people who live in different worlds.  One of poverty and needing to gamble on golf to make it day by day and then Aoi an upcoming golfer from Japan being backed by a big company.

It looked so unnatural when they had her dress up in proper golf attire for that first tournament, but the contrast only added to the effect of how she usually dresses. I loved the little ""bang"" she gave to one of the other girls after showing off just how far she outclassed them.Her rival is great in how aggressively cheerful she is, while simultaneously being just as ruthless on the greens. They\'re rivalry and chemistry is one of the shows greatest strengths, and you can\'t help but want them to just be able to play each other and enjoy their golf. All through the opening arcs they keep not getting to fulfill the promise of another proper match, but rather than feel blue balled it just leaves you wanting more.The absurdity of the mafia determining huge land development deals by betting on the outcome of a single underground golfing match, and then playing that match on a secret and literally underground course that uses crazy elaborate technology to retract itself and randomize to another course is just the icing on the cake of this great show. If that isn\'t enough it\'s got golf vampire supervillains, robot arms and plenty of sexual tension between all the female cast. The character writing is so good that even after the mafia arc is over it manages to hold your attention.The season ends mid-tournament, so hype should be high going into season 2. The stakes are high for them to win, as it\'s hinted that the coach is probably in bad health and wants to see them win with what time he has left, as well as Aoi\'s mom having aspirations to make her the youngest pro golfer as fast as possible. Can\'t wait to see where it ends up, and again, can\'t recommend this show enough. 10/10 like 4-5 hours.The main character is instantly likable for her cocky attitude and crazy golf skill to back it up.

The characters also have special moves which they say the name of without fail every time. Sometimes, side characters will remind you what these special moves do, in case you missed all the other episodes that explained what those were. It also happens to be homoerotic af.So apply all that to Birdie Wing and...you get a sports anime that is meant to be consumed like crack. It's bad for you, but it's addicting once you get started on it. Each episode makes you wonder why you keep coming back, is it the super catchy intro that made you want to vomit the first time? The Mary Sue protagonist that hits every stereotype but hey she rocks every outfit she wears? The plot that doesn't really matter or make sense, because it's just a vehicle for any kind of gayness to ensue? The extremely laughable CG that makes you wonder how much budget they got?Let's be honest. After you watch the first episode, you know what you sign up for. You watch this show because you want to turn your brain off, have a good laugh, and consume some mfing gay shit. This anime isn't gonna be winning any awards, but it's entertaining in a sense that you know the people who made this thing are probably in it for the same reasons you are. They probably had a lot of fun making this anime because it's not meant to be taken seriously.My only complaint is that they end the season right when the tournament arc was about to start and that's fk'd up. But hey, season two is confirmed, and I'm definitely watching that shit as it airs. you get a sports anime that is meant to be consumed like crack.

Sound effects for the hobby of golf as well as just all this music that fits the vibe helps to make it stand out.I do also like just all this character design and animation. So many nice bright colors and sakuga moments and pleasant to look at characters.The story is a bit of one that may take itself too seriously at times, but...still an otherwise enjoyable ride that I did enjoy. still an otherwise enjoyable ride that I did enjoy.', ""Birdie Wing is a mediocre show that attempts to straddle the line between romance and action/comedy and fails to excel at either, petering out somewhere around the halfway point of the season.The two main characters – Eve, an underworld golfer that makes money on shady bets, and Aoi, a high-society optimist who’s simply better than any of her peers – meet through coincidental circumstances through mutual love of the game and then proceed to fail to develop their characters any further in any way. They’re already at “full power,” as it is, having their perfect shots that easily win them every golf game they're in,...and have no way to grow even when occasional opportunities present themselves. An intentional lack of knowledge about the courses they play, opponents they're up against, or even the golfing formats they’re playing is seen as reaffirmation of the characters’ positive traits – “that’s our Eve, so stubborn, that's how she plays golf” – instead of what I saw it as; a willful, boring, and frankly increasingly irritating lack of development that failed to create any tension or provide any new opportunities.What’s really galling about all this is that the anime starts out reasonably strong. The golf is treated almost shonen, with named “attacks” to the swings, ridiculous special effects, and results that defy physics like breaking through a tree branch on a swing but the ball still going straight towards the hole. It’s stupid, but there’s a type of fun to that too. But just when you get used to how silly it all is, these elements faded away. Eve stops slamming the ball through the boxcars of a moving train and starts just, you know, hitting it kind of hard on a normal fairway. “Oooh wow that went 260 yards!” doesn’t have quite the same impact as her previous shenanigans. The same consequence happens with Eve’s underworld plotline, with her having to win impromptu bets that felt like they had real stakes. But those just end at some point and she fills out the rest of the show just doing well at official school tournaments. Birdie Wing tried to sell me with its shenanigans, and it succeeded to an extent, but then seemingly got bored of telling that kind of story, to its detriment.With all these elements gone, all that was left was the yuribait relationship between Eve and Aoi to try to carry the second half of the show. Aoi clearly was serious about wanting to be around Eve, but it wasn’t ever all that clear to me if Eve felt the same way or is just hanging around her because Aoi is good at golf, and she wants to fight strong opponents. Either way, this wasn’t the focus of the story, which instead was about golf played straight. I hope you like watching doing the same drive over and over again in slightly different tournaments, episode after episode. “Blue bulletto!” loses its impact after the 7th or 8th time.The show just unceremoniously ends 13 episodes in, in the middle of a tournament, in the middle of a hole even, after introducing some serious golfing opponents upcoming on the schedule. And that's it, show over. There’s no tension, cliffhanger, or resolution whatsoever. It’s like the show just went on commercial but never came back. Ridiculous. I have no idea why they thought such a non-ending was appropriate. Was there a problem with the budget, with the pacing? Or was this intentional? If they show’s creators believe they have created a strong enough scenario such that I am on the edge of my seat waiting for season two then they are sorely mistaken.Also the opening song sucks. It's really, really bad. I had to mute it every single time. I've never disliked an OP this much. The rest of the sound design is fine but whew yeah points lost there.Birdie Wing is kind of pretty and bright and it makes me think of a nice, sunny day. I don’t hate it.

Despite it’s about golf, it feels like a mecha series. It feels as if they are more trying to fight in mobile suits rather with golf clubs. There all sorts of cameos such as Turn A Gundam and Victory Gundam Gunplas did one of the characters is into, the characters can read each others minds like Newtypes, their golfing styles and strikes get ridiculously portrayed as exaggerated powers, both Amuro and Char’s voice actors are in this, and one of their protagonists is a fiery...woman that resembles Tomino’s protagonists, especially Kamille.The rivalry between Eve and Aoi reminded me many times about Joe and Rikiishi from Ashita no Joe. Eve is a underground golfer who gambles high stakes in golf challenges for money. To her, she isn’t a golfer, but someone how only hits a ball with a stick for money. Aoi is incredibly adorable, though her appearance is deceiving because she is the type to crush you with her smile during games: the innocent tyrant. Such as with Joe and Rikiishi, the two become rivals, lift each other up with inspiration, and make a promise.To say this is just another golf anime, is to be dismissive. I could not find a single unlikeable character in this series. Despite that it doesn’t have huge production values, you can feel the passion that went into this. the plot twists are ridiculous and always entertainingly hilarious in just how absurd this anime can get. It’s not meant to be taken so seriously considering that many of the players, especially Eve, often bend reality with how they play their golf. Despite the over the top episodes, the main protagonists make it clear and meaningful what their motivations and goals are as they develop.Eve feels as if she were a mixture of Yabuki Joe and Kamille Bidan. She gives me the same feel as they do. Her childhood was rough, and traumatic. To survive and support her friends that became her only family, she helped some of them get out of the terrible things they had to do to make it, by picking up golf only as a means to make money. To her, she could care less about this sport, and she didn’t even consider herself a golfer. Because of her upbringing as a golf mercenary and strict training, she developed a quick temper, and shows no fear in the face of her enemies and when she is in danger. She supports the thrill of life endangering gambling, and embraces an informal and violently free spirited way of life that does not believe in bowing down or compromising. As a golfer, she doesn’t realize it, but she is paving her own path towards going pro. Her philosophy fascinates me because she is an oasis of uncrushable determination, confidence, all while being very confrontational and predatory with others. She does mean well, however.Still, Eve is not a one dimensional character. This anime is the story of how she comes to love golf. She starts to open up as a character, and slowly begins showing a softer and more friendlier side. This is all because she met Aoi. Aoi’s skill as a talented golfer woke up something in Eve, and she began going as far as to start taking golf seriously in order for her to be able to challenge Aoi.The series focuses a lot more on Eve, though there is still a bit to say about Aoi. Her parents were both famous golf prodigious who own a golf club brand. They raised her since the age of 3 as a golfer in order for Aoi to inherit their skills. Aoi became a force to be recommended with, despite her charming, innocent, and constant smile. As a result, she got bored of her 12 year old winning streak.She runs into Eve one day, and for the first time in her life, felt the rush of finally meeting a good enough threat and rival, and it gave her life and motivation. She came to absolutely admire Eve’s golf, and desperately followed her and demanded they make a promise to challenge each other. Her caddy, who is by the book and very strict, doesn’t support this as she sees Eve as a wild animal, and sees no good in Aoi associating with her.There are times where Eve and Aoi get separated, and you can see their rivalry build up as they can’t focus when apart. They need each other. Their golf needs each other. And the serious likes to play with how close they are becoming.Behind the scenes, there’s mafia activity going on. The stakes run high as assassination attempts get made, and gambles between mafia bosses who use golf players as pawns and toys to bet on. Many times, the bets involve the players putting their lives or bodies on the line. Eve is going down this tragic path. On the other hand, there are those who already experienced this life that don’t want Eve to suffer the same fate.The music, of course, hits well when it tries to uplift scenes were the players use creative moves to try and strike the ball towards the green. It can be a bit electronic, jazzy, and many fun insert songs get used throughout.Coach Amuro is determined to make these two go at it. At the same time, there is something tragic he is hiding about himself, and time is running out.Leo is a mysterious man who showed up one day and taught Eve his golf when she was young. Personality wise, he is essentially Char Aznable if he were to become a golfer instead of a Zeon soldier.Luckily, a second season of this will appear for the 2023 winter anime season. That’s quite a while. I look forward to seeing just how much more ridiculous this hilariously entertaining this anime can get.

D-Frag!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20031/D-Frag,"['It ended. I really ended. After forcing me to laugh so hard every episode, it disappeared just like that. Well, I\'m not going to talk about the emptiness in my life or how desperate and lonely i\'am after watching the last episode, but instead, I\'m going to give you all some insights on the anime by writing this review.I\'m going to start by the story first. To be honest, it\'s kinda\' hard writing about the main idea of the story. Why? BECAUSE IT DIDN\'T HAVE MUCH OF A STORY. Okay here it goes.High school country delinquent, Kazama Kenji thinks that he got what it takes...to be the strongest and the sole ruler of Fujou High. Kenji, despite of having no special traits whatsoever and frequently considered to be a norm, is the leader of the infamous “Kazama Gang”. Together with his two long-time friends who are also in the gang, it seems that nothing could possibly go wrong. That is until one day, the gang bumps into a Game Development Club consisting of four ‘unique’, or to be frank, strange -elemental freak- girls with their overly brute and outrageous behaviors. Kenji could probably be able to say goodbye to his hopes and dreams by the moment he was forced (I really mean by force) to joined the club.Despite of what i wrote above, this anime isn’t about any of those ‘ruling the school’ thing. This is the story of a boy who believes that he, himself is an ‘infamous’ delinquent at Fujou High. Instead of acting like one, he spends his days of high school slacking off and playing meaningless games in the club that he was forced to joined. Sometimes he also acts like a good guy and the others will say ""aren\'t you supposed to be a delinquent?"".Reluctant at first, he soon finds the club and it’s member to be exciting and interesting and also often defends it from the others who tries to destroy(disband) it. Well maybe not, but one thing for sure is that Kenji isn’t living a normal high school life.D-Frag is an example of an anime that actually has no meaningful plot at all. It mainly (almost every time) revolves around Kenji, playing board games and throwing limitless funny punch lines at everyone around him until sometimes he literally ran out of breath. Yeah, i think that’s all i can say about the story, nothing more. But that’s not the point. What makes this anime to be considered a very entertaining one is that such plot contains such humorous jokes that surely hit the mark every time and aren\'t predictable. Behaviours that you don’t see every day will make you burst into tears of happiness.The artwork in this anime is not what you can say as a masterpiece, not even close. It’s plain, simple, but still very comfortable to see. It seems that Animes such as these aren\'t in a need of great and extraordinary art. Character’s design are very enjoyable and hilarious to see. Ranging from cute to roguish, bald to long-haired... i don’t really know how to describe in words coz\' i find that some are ‘indescribable’, well maybe because they\'re just a bunch of random people.Voice actors did a great job in their voice acting. They make a great impression on how the characters are. What really caught my attention is definitely Kenji’s punchlines, so random yet so funny to hear. Not only the voice acting, the soundtracks fits the anime perfectly too. The Opening is very joyful, cheerful, energetic, and funny. It really makes the mood before watching the anime. The ED is sang by the seiyuus and that makes it even more interesting to hear.Characters is what to be called ‘unique’ or maybe simply random. None of the characters have a normal personality as that of a high schoolers and it effectively supports the comedy which is the main focus of the anime. If you’re hoping for character’s developement, you\'re looking in the wrong place, my friend. Character development in this anime is so small that it could be considered as none..... But you wouldn\'t even mind anyway :D.ScoreStory : 8Art : 7Sound : 8Characters : 8Enjoyment : 10Overall : 9D-Fragments or D-Frag! or ディーふらぐ! is a very funny and enjoyable comedy-anime.

There isn\'t much of a story?No, this is not that simple.Creating a comedy requires more skills than one might think. Especially for a theme like D-frag, one needs to be very thoughtful. This is not just senseless laughter found in nichijou, or a laughter at the dumbness of baka to test. This gets a game as casual and simple as king\'s game or the war of thumbs and create something funny and interesting. Nobody wants to watch two men playing the game of thumbs, but in this, yes you do. The ability to make something boring funny is a grandiose skill that requires much attention and imagination.Another criterion that I absolutely loved was the continual unfolding of funny behind stories and mysteries that just cracked me up. I cannot explain this without spoiling, so I will go on.Story was a work of art. Many will disagree and say there was no much of anything for story, but this, like I said, need to be given a whole new method of grading.Art: 9Sure, the animation is not the best in the world, and we can\'t help but notice the rainbow colors of the hairs.However, these are not necessary factors when making a comedy.What D-frag wanted and needed was an animation where one could easily crack up, or be caught in adorableness, and this type of animation was its soul mate. Instead of hiring IG entertainment or Ufotable, the simple and ""chibi"" animation was what it really needed.But this alone wouldn\'t get the anime 10, so I gave art a nine. A fluent movement in unnecessary scenes are also a factor to crack people up, but unfortunately D-frag didn\'t contain this element. For that I gave art a 9.Sound: 8Starting from the seiyuus this time, in contrast to how I usually grade the sound. The sound is in three parts: BGM, OP/ED and voice over.The voice actors are some of the greatest in the world. For Shibasaki Roka, who needed both the yandere-type voice and cute-type voice, there were not too many in the anime history who could do both but the jack-of-all-trades voice actor hanazawa kana. Roka\'s voice requirements overlapped well with Sengoku Nadeko of monogatari series, and there was no better candidate than Kana in this voice over. Then, as for our main-character delinquent, we have katsuyuki konishi, the prime voice actor of delinquents. In addition, for the voice actor of sakuragaoka, a girl-like boy who had to sound both like a boy and a girl, we had the voice actor of hayate, shiraishi ryoko. We have the woman who changed Japan towards cuteness, aki toyosaki, for the best girl, along with takao in the story, funabori. Not to mention of course, they all did their jobs admirably. Even the extras\' voice acting was admirable. However, there were times when the voicing was a little awkward--especially when kazama played the straight-man role. To begin with kazama\'s voice actor is not aced in straight-man role. Also, the times when the voice actor shouted ""ba-ka!"" weirded me out a little bit. Still, kazama\'s voice actor did his job splendidly and the ba-ka was understandable for the genre of the anime, so I gave voice acting a 9.As for the opening, I at least hated the song. However, as we learned from a certain song called ""Platinum Disco"" and the opening of ""Haiyore Nyaruko-san"", there are songs which deserves A+++ for the music quality and other songs which deserves A+++ for catchiness, and this opening is the latter. Still, the song could annoy some people off, so I gave this an 8.The ending, on the other hand, was in between quality and catchiness. It was both easily remembered in the ear and sang well. Still, the song was not good enough to be given a 10, so I gave the ending a 9.Lastly, the BGM\'s were done splendidly. They weren\'t cliche or repeated over and over. They were used thoroughly and well. Some songs inspired urgency and even awe and a BGM that does the right job deserves a 10.So all in all, I gave the sound a high 8.Character: 8Don\'t you just love all characters?We have all characters with their own appeals, especially Takao and Funabori, who are not in the main 5 characters but are more famous than the main 5\'s. I cut it off also because of that--the main characters are not given enough attention, especially Sakura. She, although being a part of the club, shows little significance in the whole anime. I also cut off points for the teacher characters that appeared at the last second.Enjoyment: 10BUT WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT ALL THESE?D-Frag certainly cannot be a masterpiece, considering each categories carefully.However, they can make people laugh like no other, and they don\'t need any of these categories to do so. The story? WHO CARES! The art? WHO CARES! The sound? WHO THE HELL CARES!!! The characters? WHO IN THE HELL CARES!!!!! D-Frag is simply fun. It does not bring up the nonsensical exaggerated comedy in Nichijou, or the eternal dumbness in baka to test. They are fun because they are. Even if the story is nonexistent, even if the art is premature, even if the sound is annoying, even if the characters aren\'t fully developed, D-Frag can turn the tables and create enjoyment out of it.Overall: 9D-Frag is certainly, without doubt, the best anime of the spring/winter of 2014. There might not be stories to be awed at, or arts to be awed at, or sounds or awesome character developments to be awed at, but this definitely is an anime that you can be awed at.It most definitely needs more attention. If you haven\'t watched it, you should immediately start watching.Then, happy anime-ing and may the anime be with you. this is a comedy like nichijou where nothing makes sense but everything is funny, I\'ll grade this differently.PS.

The premise seemed unappealing and boring, with a generic setting that didn\'t promise anything spectacular. Nevertheless, intrigued by the title of it, I began watching it, and I can say I was pleasantly surprised. D-frag is comedy/harem anime, though it is not your typical ecchi/comedy anime out there. So what makes it hilarious? I will try to explain it below.~Story~First of all the comedy is based on the manzai, where a ""Tsukommi"" (straight man) retorts the actions of the ""Boke"" (funny man) who creates a funny situation. This is...quite frequent in japanese comedy shows, and being a personal fan of this type of comedy, naturally appealed to me. However, if this type of comedy doesn\'t appeal to you, then this may be not suitable for you.D-frag focuses on the delinquent Kazama Kenji, who with the help of his gang, the ""Kazama"" gang, intends to take over his school. This doesn\'t go as intended and in the process he is forced to join the game creator club (temp), composed of the most strange girls. From here on audiences observe how Kazama deals with the bizarre club members, leading to absurd and hilarious situations. These range from typical everyday life situations, to the same events a lot school comedies have to offer, such as territorial fights or festival games, naturally taken to the extreme absurdness.D-frag has little story to offer, besides the actions of the game creator club (temp). The story is split in mini arcs, each with enough comedy to make you laugh, making it perfect for this type of anime. It also tagged with the romance and harem category, though the harem aspect is not the main focus of this show, neither is the romance. Moreover, it is used to enhance the comedy.~Characters~Being a comedy based anime, D-frag has a lot of characters to offer, each with its own charm. As it is a harem too, there are a lot of female characters but these are not detrimental to the anime; which is to say, it doesn\'t exhibit an excessive focus on the females. Personally speaking, the protagonist Kazama was of the most interesting character as it was not your typical main protagonist. He doesn\'t take romantic interest in the female lead characters, neither does he always accomplish his goals, in fact he is often helped by someone, which is bonus.Other character that stood out, and is my personal favourite, was the teacher Sean Conne Conne, who clearly represents the actor Sean Connery. His character, moral values and actions are very refreshing to the anime, besides enhancing significantly the awe factor of this character. Naturally, character development is nihil in this anime, in addition to the fleshing out of the characters.The secondary characters also play an import role D-frag: these have all certain personalities that makes it easy to distinguish from the others. While the protagonists create absurd and hilarious situations, these are often enhanced and supported by the actions and comments/retorts of the secondary characters, and vice versa. There are also different factions present, each with their characteristic attribute, for example, the baldies or music bands. The good thing is that these are all simple and not such impressive characters, they\'re in fact simple people even though the anime portrays them as ""badass"" characters.~Animation and sound~The animation quality of D-Frag is nothing outstanding, though well executed, what is to be expected from a modern show. The art style of D-frag was toned down a bit from the manga, which was at first rather lackluster, and is a welcoming change. Character designs are varied, yet are nothing remarkable. The facial expressions were well done, which was of importance for the comedy gags, as without them it would have been worse.The soundtrack used in D-Frag was nothing outstanding and it could get repetitive at times, yet there were some compositions that fared well with the different sketches and situations it was trying to portray to the audience. The voice actors performed their roles well, fitting with their character\'s personalities, as in addition enhancing the comedic element of the anime.~Enjoyment~I personally enjoyed D-frag a lot; It made me laugh throughout the whole duration with hilarious and absurd situations, as well as the wide assortment of characters. There were naturally some gags that got old or were predictable, besides of having no story direction whatsoever: this was nevertheless a small drawback. So if you are interested in watching a comedy anime with an enjoyable harem, or just are searching for something to watch, D-frag may be something for you. Just don\'t expect any deep characters or story.Thank you for reading. quite frequent in japanese comedy shows, and being a personal fan of this type of comedy, naturally appealed to me.

With the title D-Frag!, I thought this would have something to do with a hand grenade. Nope. It's one of those one-guy-bunch-o-girls-in-club anime and I was putting it off until one of my friends suggested it, claiming it was hilarious.Story: 8/10Sigh. Not again... The plot definitely did not interest me at all. I've watched plenty of shows where a guy goes into a club with a bunch of girls in it, yadeeyada. Despite the synopsis being so bland, I found that the actual...plot was progressing at a nice rate. The setting actually moved outside of the club room (phew) and there were a variety of conflicts that the protagonist faced.Art: 8/10The art is definitely very average. Typical school uniform, typical characters all with different hair color, and typical school setting. The art also tends to focus a lot of attention on the head of the characters. I don't particularly like how the hair is colored - it uses gradient, you'll see what I mean if you plan to watch this. Nothing particularly stands out... until those fantastically inputted little, special scenes. The art will suddenly catch your attention and I guess it is because of this contrast that I paid closer attention to the show.Sound: 8/10The background music does not stand out too much, which isn't a bad thing. This show is very light-hearted and most of the time, if not all, it fits with the scene. The little sound effects are nice. Voice acting is also great, but personally, the male protagonist screaming all the time gets to me.Character: 10/10WOAH THERE. Yeah, this anime gets a perfect score for character. Each character is unique, all weirdos. Maybe there's one character here and there who have the generic behavior of all school-related anime but the variety of personalities is extraordinary. This anime somehow makes even the minor characters of the show stand out. It's quite genius, actually. This anime may not stand out much in terms of the other criteria, but I fell in love with all the characters - even those who only appear for a max of two episodes.Enjoyment: 9/10Each episode did not fail to elicit laughter from me. The oddity of all the characters along with the random plot and plot twists combine to create an anime that does not fail to please. For a school anime, this one does not fail to deliver entertainment.Overall: 9/10Do give this a try and if you want to test this anime's waters, try two episodes, not one. I felt the first episode does not truly represent the rest of the show. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a little chuckle and fall in love with the characters. However, if you cannot handle the male protagonist screaming for half the episode every episode, this may not be for you (take into consideration that some people enjoy this screaming!). plot was progressing at a nice rate.

This anime will make you laugh so hard that the twelve episodes zoom by way too fast. I definitely recommend this anime to those that enjoy a protagonist who tries to act badass when he really isnt and really weird characters.Story - In terms of the story, it is very weak as expected of a comedy.It\'s focus is on the Game Creation Club and doesn\'t seem to progress anything further than that. There is some romance to it, but overall it is just comedy. Even though it sounds so bland and boring, you tolerate it because the ride...itself is really fun.Characters - The characters are all so lovable and funny. They each have their own way of telling jokes. The main protagonist is angry at everything because everyone acts so foolishly that it\'s cute. The members of the club have their own ""types"" (Fire type, darkness type, lightning type) and they take this sort of stuff so seriously that when someone as sane as the main protagonist approaches the scene, you can\'t help but agree with him. The fact that you can relate so well with the main character, who is in a situation in which every character he meets, including his best friends, is out of control makes it a soothing experience.Art/Sound - I love the opening theme. It matches the humor of the whole anime. It\'s all about having fun. They also match the amount of energy that is  put into this anime.""We\'re a group of geeks with ambition, despair, and angler fish... just kidding""It\'s really quirky too.The art style is also really comedic. Characters make the weirdest facial expressions and in general it makes everything funny/cute.Enjoyment - If you enjoy a good laugh, definitely watch this anime. You won\'t even worry about the plot, you just want something else to happen so they can just act themselves.Overall - Story is obviously bad, but the whole comedy portion has been nailed. Definitely watch this for the sole reason of comedy. itself is really fun.Characters - The characters are all so lovable and funny. They each have their own way of telling jokes.

D-Frag or D-Fragments is one of the anime that I enjoyed watching in the winter season anime as stated in my previous Noragami review. However, I didn\'t enjoy this anime fully as I did with most anime that I have watched.D-Frag was directed by Seiki Sugawara and was produced by Brains Base who did some wonderful anime like ""My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU"" which is a high school slice-of-life comedy just like the anime I am reviewing now.STORY (5):The...story takes place in a high school setting. A student Kazama Kenji was forced to join the Games Creation Club by its members. So what you are going to expect from this anime is how Kazama Kenji gets to bond with the members in the Games Creation Club who are all girls.Of course, there are some funny moments. Those moments to me are fun to watch but it didn\'t make me laugh out loud. The best moment is in episode 6 when Hachi Shio makes a love triangle with Roka & Kazama. I really watched it and never get bored.This anime builds up tension in the later episodes which I see in most anime I watched. Like when the later episodes, they show a rival group and the battle begins. If an anime is awesome, then the anime must surprise me from the start to the end. However, this anime failed to do that.ART (7):The animation is refreshing to look at especially when it comes to the character designs. For example, Roka Shibasaki\'s design is very cute but sometimes can be normal in some situations.SOUND (7):Both the opening and ending songs were very addictive.I don\'t have to mention the opening song because I have said it in the introduction.The ending song was addictive. The song starts with Batsu Game. Batsu game means punishment game. The ending song is ""Minna no Namae wo Irete Kudasai"".CHARACTER (6):Every character has their unique personalities. I am fine with all the characters. At least the characters never show me any annoying traits (ie. crybaby, arrogant, whiny). However, the characters didn\'t stand out well enough for me to love them.There was one character who looked a lot like Harima Tenma from School Rumble and that character I am referring to is Hiroshi Nagayama. He wears dark glasses like Harima Tenma but his hair style looks different from Harima.Ataru Kawahara wears glasses but he is interesting as a masochist who can tolerate pain. Next time, I would host a show with him (if he is real) to be an assistant in ""Rate the Pain"". Nah, just joking.Roka is very cunning and she always tricks Kazama into doing things for her. Like for example, she can manipulate people by showing her cuteness and her creepiness. This is very similar to Yuragi Hakoniwa from Noucome. She is cute but can sometimes be very intimidating.Chitose Karasuyama reminds me of Yozora from Haganai with her sadistic attitude.I seriously find that most of the characters resemble like some of the characters I knew from previous anime.CONCLUSION (6):Although this anime has its fun moments. They weren\'t enough to surprise me in one single bit. The comedy wasn\'t strong. I wasn\'t laughing out loud throughout the anime but the animation was interesting to look at.The story didn\'t take me by surprise. A comedy has to make a person laugh out loud. If a comedy has failed to make a person laugh out loud, then the comedy is dull. Just like french fries, when you order a french fries and you take a bite and found that there is no salt in the french fries which makes them dull french fries.However, if you found the comedy very funny and entertaining, that\'s good. If you can relate with the characters better that\'s also good. In fact, I did appreciate the effort that Seiki did in making this anime a good comedy. But sadly, this anime didn\'t stand out among other anime that I have watched.So, for what it\'s worth, I give it a 6 out of 10. story takes place in a high school setting. A student Kazama Kenji was forced to join the Games Creation Club by its members. So what you are going to expect from this anime is how Kazama Kenji gets to bond with the members in the Games Creation Club who are all girls.Of course, there are some funny moments. Those moments to me are fun to watch but it didn\'t make me laugh out loud. The best moment is in episode 6 when Hachi Shio makes a love triangle with Roka & Kazama. I really watched it and never get bored.This anime builds up tension in the later episodes which I see in most anime I watched. Like when the later episodes, they show a rival group and the battle begins. If an anime is awesome, then the anime must surprise me from the start to the end. However, this anime failed to do that.ART (7):The animation is refreshing to look at especially when it comes to the character designs. For example, Roka Shibasaki\'s design is very cute but sometimes can be normal in some situations.SOUND (7):Both the opening and ending songs were very addictive.I don\'t have to mention the opening song because I have said it in the introduction.The ending song was addictive. The song starts with Batsu Game. Batsu game means punishment game. The ending song is ""Minna no Namae wo Irete Kudasai"".CHARACTER (6):Every character has their unique personalities. I am fine with all the characters. At least the characters never show me any annoying traits (ie. crybaby, arrogant, whiny). However, the characters didn\'t stand out well enough for me to love them.There was one character who looked a lot like Harima Tenma from School Rumble and that character I am referring to is Hiroshi Nagayama. He wears dark glasses like Harima Tenma but his hair style looks different from Harima.Ataru Kawahara wears glasses but he is interesting as a masochist who can tolerate pain. Next time, I would host a show with him (if he is real) to be an assistant in ""Rate the Pain"". Nah, just joking.Roka is very cunning and she always tricks Kazama into doing things for her. Like for example, she can manipulate people by showing her cuteness and her creepiness. This is very similar to Yuragi Hakoniwa from Noucome. She is cute but can sometimes be very intimidating.Chitose Karasuyama reminds me of Yozora from Haganai with her sadistic attitude.I seriously find that most of the characters resemble like some of the characters I knew from previous anime.CONCLUSION (6):Although this anime has its fun moments.

Having trouble keeping thoughts organized? Well perhaps you need to D-Frag, or so the title seems to suggest. This show is a Haganai/Seitokai no Ichizon type clone with overly vivid personalities and a rather unique combination of attempted coolness and comedic cuteness. Basically, a supposed wannabe delinquent, with Sonic the Hedgehog sharp hair, named Kenji is coerced into joining a game development club. Except that they don\'t really develop games. Rather, they just lounge around and occasionally play some games, and occasionally get into trouble with other groups.If you\'re looking for a very lighthearted slice of life with some...not-so-realistic personalities, this may be a good choice. I say maybe because you\'ll either love or hate the overall feeling of the show. Personally for me, the attempted coolness came across as immature and rather dull. Others have shown a very different opinion though so you might want to give the first episode a shot and see if you enjoy it.Animation:The animation is fair overall with a vivid color scheme and a lot of over-dramatization. Backgrounds are fairly average and likewise for shading. The characters are pretty unique in styling though I felt that facial animations were a bit lackluster as characters didn\'t seem to respond much to external stimuli.I guess there is a bit of action though most of it is extremely light and more of the comical nature. Fighting by splashing water or dirt on each other? Kind of cheesy if you ask me. There is a slight amount of ecchi though more like suggestive references, they probably tried to incorporate something like Seitokai Yakuindomo but didn\'t really succeed very well. Otherwise you just have bouncy from Buchou and a bit of cross-dressing.Sound:The Engrish OP is pretty representative of the show, taking a very shonen-based cool and combining it with cute-ish female voices. The song is pretty discordant with little melodic value. The ED is a bit more melodic but still has the overly-playful vibe that just feels much more fitting for an elementary school. The BGM is pretty light but serves its purpose. There are a lot of effects, due to the comic nature of a lot of events.There are a lot of veteran VAs here but I feel like they over-cast for a lot of the roles. Shizuka Itou is the standout as Buchou but most of the other roles just didn\'t have enough characterization to merit the strong VAs. Especially painful were Kana Hanazawa and Kana Ueda\'s roles; what\'s the point if their character can\'t act cute and tsundere, respectively?Story:This is frankly a glorified slice of life show that is based heavily on character-interactions, so I wouldn\'t expect much in terms of a central plot. If there is anything holding the story together, it would be the repeating pattern of someone or some group trying to get the fake gaming club closed. The oddball group works together to somehow try and overcome impossible odds. I guess it helps that the student council chair, who you never see actually doing student council chair-like stuff, is in the club. Some episodes are episodic while others clump up to form mini-arcs. There is a bit of a climax near the end but nothing mind-blowing.The more important thing to note here is the over-the-top nature of the characters and antics in this show. If you\'re just watching for the comedic aspect, then this is all fine. However, if you apply an ounce of thought into it, be prepared for very little to make sense. Besides the numerous plot and character holes, the school apparently has multiple infamous gangs and groups running around and causing messes, with relatively little discipline being dished out. A lot of behaviors and events are just so out of the ordinary that the merest thought of plausibility is cast aside.Character:Granted that this show isn\'t going for realism, I still find it annoying that the characters were so two-dimensional. Yes, the characters have interesting traits, but these feel unshakable in an unnatural way. A good example is Roka, a seemingly quiet and chibi figure who apparently possesses the comic ability to ""conquer"" others by putting bags over people\'s heads. Yes, she\'s interesting in a curious way but you never get the sense that she\'s remotely relatable. The sadistic student council chair, Chitose, acts cool all the time but just once you\'d like to see her out of that annoying facade- don\'t bother waiting. The only characters that really have any merit in my mind are Buchou, who harbors some feelings for Kenji, and Kenji himself. Everyone else, and mind you this includes a huge amount of secondary characters, are just fluff. While it\'s true that the character interactions had a lot of character (no pun intended), it was painfully lacking in depth.Value:It\'s probably pretty clear by now that I didn\'t have a very pleasant experience with this show. Maybe I\'ve outgrown this genre, but I still feel there are much better works out there that provide much more entertainment value without having to resort to meaningless gimmicks and outlandish, unrealistic personality traits. While the show has some comedic value and a drop of relationship value, it is spread out too thinly to make much of a positive impact. If you agree in opinion with my other reviews in the genre, I\'d pass on this one. not-so-realistic personalities, this may be a good choice.

An anime that I was very skeptical about at first, even after watching the first two episodes I was trying to understand. I had no idea what was going on, but for some odd reason I still continued to watch, and I enjoyed every moment of this anime. It\'s not too often that I find and anime where I am laughing through every single episode.ScoreStory: 10Art:8Sound:8Character:10Enjoyment:10Overall:10Now first off we have the story, some people might not believe this has a solid storyline or any sort of plot so to speak, but after watching an Anime such as this you can just tell how much...thought and work was put into it. Even the boring things in life that were done in this anime are a must see. It made everything more enjoyable and easy to watch. It was fun to watch!The art itself wasn\'t anything to crazy but it was more of a comfortable and relaxed environment if that makes sense. From the start it was just a feeling of ""Yes, this is good"". Whether it was the chibi or the basic art, it all just felt right.The soundtrack for this anime wasn\'t the most amazing in all of anime history, but it was a perfect fit none the less. The voice actors for this anime were very good as well, you could feel every expression and feeling through their words, the reason I gave it only an 8 was one of the characters, they just sounded too much like a different anime character for me.What really makes this anime what it is, is this group of insane and outrageous characters. If anything, saying they are insane and outrageous is an understatement, right off the start of the anime you get a hit to the face with crazy. These characters being so overbearing at times or mentally unstable even, is the glue for this outstanding anime.I enjoyed this anime thoroughly and couldn\'t stop laughing the whole way through.

Hopefully this will be somewhat effective. I'll try to keep this spoiler-free, so apologies if I sound rather vague.Fast-paced and light-hearted, D-Frag! is a surprising comical piece that never failed to amuse. The main characters are lively, humorous, and full of fun retorts. Although it does not have a slice-of-life tag, it practically is one - after all, this anime follows the daily adventures of the members of the (Fake) Game Creation Club. And unlike other slice-of-life anime, most of the episodes are loosely stringed together (although I wouldn't go...as far out to say that there is a coherent plotline).However, this anime is still far from perfect. The execution is certainly not perfect - being a fast-paced anime, the viewer is constantly being thrown from scene to scene, almost in a daze. Furthermore, many of the characters' actions are overly exaggerated. Although this is clearly done for a comedic effect, these actions are constantly overused - up to the point where it's predictable and does not substantially add any meaning to the character or the plot as a whole. Finally, the characters' relationships to each other are not clearly established or ignored for the most part (minus a few exceptions).All I can say is that if you're looking to kill time, this is the anime for you.Checklist:Story: 5Art: 5Sound: 4Character: 5Enjoyment: 8Overall: 5tl;drPros:- Humorous characters- Loosely tied together plotlineCons:- Characters behave in an overly exaggerated manner up to the point where their behavior is predictable- Mediocre execution due to its fast paced nature- Relationships are not clearly established as far out to say that there is a coherent plotline).However, this anime is still far from perfect.

Today on MAL reviews, I will be talking about, probably one of the most interesting and random, but enjoyable animes out there.  Everyone, this is D-fragments!Story (7.76/10): The story of D-fragments, or D-frag in its shorter name, is about a second year by the name of Kazama Kenji, who aspires to be a delinquent at his school with his friends Nagayama and Yokoshima, as the Kazama Clan, or whatever they\'re called.  They\'re not really well known.  It is then that Kenji meets a little girl by the name of Roka, who offers him...to be part of her club, which after some insanity of the over 9000 kind and some running around the school, that Kenji agrees to be part of the club, and the story continues on from there.When you\'re looking at an anime that\'s based on a club, you normally get the same formula of the characters of the show going to the clubroom and doing whatever, (which is usually nothing), making a couple jokes that are ""funny"" to us, the audience, then ending the episode off in a sort of episodic form.  Now take that, and reverse it.  That is what D-frag is.The story of this series revolves around the antics of the game creation club (provisional), as they go through life at school basically breaking all of the school rules, breaking property, running around and attacking each other with RPG game style attacks, and overall just being as insane as possible.  And that\'s only the first episode.  Beyond that, the series doesn\'t really go beyond that sort of mindset.  The whole series is essentially the game creation club\'s antics, explained in a great multitude of hilarious and VERY entertaining ways in an arcic setup, that actually works.The series itself doesn\'t try very hard to be entertaining, and it doesn\'t need to, because its idea is just so damn absurd, that it is extremely entertaining and very fun to watch.  The series was made to be very funny, and it succeeded in doing so in the end.  Also, the end.  This series has one of the most bullshit and random endings ever, that I laughed out loud because of just how absurd and hilarious it was when I saw it.Overview+  Absurd and entertaining plot+  Many wonderful, memorable moments-   Somewhat arc heavyCharacters (8.78/10):  Now, the characters.  When you look at D-fragments\' picture, the first thing that comes to mind is, harem.  That is not actually the case.  (The manga does have that tag for some reason.)  This series does have a multitude of female characters, but it is in no way, a true harem.  Because, these girls are much more interesting than most harem females you will ever see.Kazama Kenji, as the main protagonist is the aforementioned delinquent of this series.  With his spiky hair and rough way of talking, he is undoubtably someone who aspires to be one, which ultimately fails in the end.  Kazama is an interesting male protagonist, in the sense that he really doesn\'t care much for what is going on, since he\'s just as lost as the audience is in any given situation, but when it comes down to it, he does care for the people and what he does, as he is shown to be helping out a lot in the game creation club\'s ""quarrels"".  However, in terms of personality and favor from the audience, he is tiny in comparison to the greater majority of characters in this series.  Mostly, he fills up the main role as the main guy, but other than that, I wouldn\'t say too much else.  He mostly takes a backseat when it comes to things.Next is the fire/dark aligned underground boss of the school, (I have literally no idea what all of that entails, Roka Shibasaki.  Roka is definitely the main focal point of the show.  From start to finish, she plays a pivotal role in the plot, and is seen to be around Kazama for the majority of the series.  Personally, I have never really seen a character quite like her, due to the fact that she has this fire aligned moe thing, and this scary dark aligned personality that I would like to avoid if all possible.  She likes bagging people, (putting bags over people\'s heads), and all sorts of weird things.  I can\'t really explain her because she\'s just that kind of character that you can\'t really explain due to how interestingly weird she is.Chitose Karasuyama is the earth aligned character in the series, as well as the school president.  Personally, I don\'t get how she\'s the school president due to tyrannical and sadistic she is.  Chitose is one of those characters that will do whatever it takes to complete a goal, while at the expense of someone else\'s pain and misery.  What I think makes her a good character and a good fit for this show, is the fact that she has this authority, and thus the means to make the absurd things in this series make sense in terms of how they came to be.Next, my personal favorite, Sakura Mizukami, or, the water type.  (I\'m not kidding.  These characters all have some sort of element alignment like freaking pokemon.)  Sakura is the youngest character out of the whole main cast, being only a first year, with an exceptional addiction, to water.  She is always seen carrying a bottle, and even drowns her opponents with bottled water.  She has this sort of child-like demeanor, being very respectful to her her elders, and even calling Kazama her Onii-san.  (She just does it cause she can.)And finally, Takao.  (There\'s no last name for this one.)  Takao being the only character not in the game creation club (provisional), is a rather interesting addition to the main cast.  For starters, she is the only character that has her measurements posted on this site, so that sort of gives you an idea of what we\'re dealing with here.  Takao is sort of that bystander person that sort of just stands there and watches everything happen.  She doesn\'t really add too much to the series as it goes on, but she still plays a good part nonetheless.The side characters of this series outnumber the main cast 1:10.  What adds to this series\'s absurdity, is the fact that the series will add a few characters every few episodes or so, followed by a nametag on one of the screen corners, giving you a sort of idea of who this new person is.  While most of the supporting cast get about 10 minutes of screen time each, the supporting cast that actually matter, such as the double masochist duo of Ataru and Hachi, the electric aligned game creation club\'s supervisor, the legendary pigtailed 3rd year Tama-chan, Kazama\'s sister Noe, and my personal favorite Funabori.Personally, I think that the supporting cast is too big.  (Even Angel Beats had a smaller cast than this series.)  The fact that they add in characters left and right is a bit too absurd even for me, and their use and imprint on the series is as valuable as a dot you draw on your friend\'s paper in the upper right hand corner of their paper.  Also, they didn\'t explore some of the more important and better known side characters as much as they could\'ve, which I think really would\'ve added more, since the supporting cast is just as interesting and weird as the main cast.All in all, the cast itself was very well done for the idea they were going for, and I commend the people who made it, to make a series with a mostly female cast, not a bunch of girls who needed a guy to help them with everything.  Cause these girls kick ass.Overview+  Very well thought out female cast+  Somewhat original and thought out character personalities+  Above average male lead-   WAY too big of a supporting cast-   Adding characters left and right that didn\'t even matter in the endArt and Sound (8.31/10 and 8.95/10):  The art is definitely a good highlight of this show, mainly because the art is so bright and vivid, that it looks like it was colored in a highlighter.  The show has two main ways of presenting the characters.  One in a normal format of presenting the characters, and the ever so common chibi format that we see today.For the normal artwork, the series has a very detailed look to it, as well as a very nice and light color palette, that works very well to represent how light-hearted and fun this show is.The chibi artwork on the other hand has this more comical sense to it.  The actual color palette is still the same, but the way the characters are drawn is different, representing the characters in a smaller, shorter, and more cute form.  (Mainly, they use this way of making the characters look chibi on Roka.)  At times, the series intertwines these two art styles, that as mentioned before, works very well for what the series is trying to do.The sound I feel is one of the more addicting things of this series.  While the background music for the actual series is mostly average tracks that are mood fillers, the soundtrack for the series really shines in its OST, and ED.  First, the OST.  I cannot explain it.  The OST has some of the most random lyrics, and an ever-changing tune that I can only explain as a song that is worthy of being this anime\'s OST track.  The thing is, it\'s so random, that it\'s so enjoyable.  Hands down, this OST is one of my favorite opening tracks for an anime period, because it\'s just so fun to watch and listen to.The ED on the other hand is a very happy song that involves singing about a penalty game.  It\'s a nice little finisher to the anime, as it still contains that vibrant energy that this series is overfilling with.Overview+  Aesthetically pleasing look+  Good integration of both styles of art work+  Addicting soundtrack-   There are none.  =w=Personal Enjoyment (9.56/10):  When I first discovered D-fragments, I only chose to start with the manga because the manga was already present and ongoing.  I had held off on the anime series because I wanted to get far in reading the series, just so I don\'t spoil anything for myself.  That plan didn\'t work, cause I finished the anime before finishing the manga.What I love about D-fragments is the sheer randomness that works just so well for this series.  The series itself goes over the top and does not care if you go along for the ride or not.  It goes, and continues, making you hope that you can keep up.  As I was watching this series, the most memorable parts about it for me was how much I enjoyed the slapstick comedy that worked extremely well for this series.  For a series that wanted to be random, it succeeded.  D-fragments is one of those series that anyone can enjoy without thinking too hard.Personally, I love this series because of how entertaining and enjoyable it was.  It provided me some great laughs and no facepalmy plot points that I hate with all my heart.  In the end, I would recommend this show to anyone who would like a good laugh, or even to just not think, because in the end, thinking while watching this, will get you nowhere.  It\'s not the best thing to watch in the world, but for a comedy/school series, it\'s definitely top notch.Overall Score: (9.15/10)  Remember.

Personally, I have never really seen a character quite like her, due to the fact that she has this fire aligned moe thing, and this scary dark aligned personality that I would like to avoid if all possible.  She likes bagging people, (putting bags over people\'s heads), and all sorts of weird things.  I can\'t really explain her because she\'s just that kind of character that you can\'t really explain due to how interestingly weird she is.Chitose Karasuyama is the earth aligned character in the series, as well as the school president.  Personally, I don\'t get how she\'s the school president due to tyrannical and sadistic she is.  Chitose is one of those characters that will do whatever it takes to complete a goal, while at the expense of someone else\'s pain and misery.  What I think makes her a good character and a good fit for this show, is the fact that she has this authority, and thus the means to make the absurd things in this series make sense in terms of how they came to be.Next, my personal favorite, Sakura Mizukami, or, the water type.  (I\'m not kidding.  These characters all have some sort of element alignment like freaking pokemon.)  Sakura is the youngest character out of the whole main cast, being only a first year, with an exceptional addiction, to water.  She is always seen carrying a bottle, and even drowns her opponents with bottled water.  She has this sort of child-like demeanor, being very respectful to her her elders, and even calling Kazama her Onii-san.  (She just does it cause she can.)And finally, Takao.  (There\'s no last name for this one.)  Takao being the only character not in the game creation club (provisional), is a rather interesting addition to the main cast.  For starters, she is the only character that has her measurements posted on this site, so that sort of gives you an idea of what we\'re dealing with here.  Takao is sort of that bystander person that sort of just stands there and watches everything happen.  She doesn\'t really add too much to the series as it goes on, but she still plays a good part nonetheless.The side characters of this series outnumber the main cast 1:10.  What adds to this series\'s absurdity, is the fact that the series will add a few characters every few episodes or so, followed by a nametag on one of the screen corners, giving you a sort of idea of who this new person is.  While most of the supporting cast get about 10 minutes of screen time each, the supporting cast that actually matter, such as the double masochist duo of Ataru and Hachi, the electric aligned game creation club\'s supervisor, the legendary pigtailed 3rd year Tama-chan, Kazama\'s sister Noe, and my personal favorite Funabori.Personally, I think that the supporting cast is too big.  (Even Angel Beats had a smaller cast than this series.)  The fact that they add in characters left and right is a bit too absurd even for me, and their use and imprint on the series is as valuable as a dot you draw on your friend\'s paper in the upper right hand corner of their paper.  Also, they didn\'t explore some of the more important and better known side characters as much as they could\'ve, which I think really would\'ve added more, since the supporting cast is just as interesting and weird as the main cast.All in all, the cast itself was very well done for the idea they were going for, and I commend the people who made it, to make a series with a mostly female cast, not a bunch of girls who needed a guy to help them with everything.  Cause these girls kick ass.Overview+  Very well thought out female cast+  Somewhat original and thought out character personalities+  Above average male lead-   WAY too big of a supporting cast-   Adding characters left and right that didn\'t even matter in the endArt and Sound (8.31/10 and 8.95/10):  The art is definitely a good highlight of this show, mainly because the art is so bright and vivid, that it looks like it was colored in a highlighter.  The show has two main ways of presenting the characters.  One in a normal format of presenting the characters, and the ever so common chibi format that we see today.For the normal artwork, the series has a very detailed look to it, as well as a very nice and light color palette, that works very well to represent how light-hearted and fun this show is.The chibi artwork on the other hand has this more comical sense to it.  The actual color palette is still the same, but the way the characters are drawn is different, representing the characters in a smaller, shorter, and more cute form.  (Mainly, they use this way of making the characters look chibi on Roka.)  At times, the series intertwines these two art styles, that as mentioned before, works very well for what the series is trying to do.The sound I feel is one of the more addicting things of this series.  While the background music for the actual series is mostly average tracks that are mood fillers, the soundtrack for the series really shines in its OST, and ED.  First, the OST.  I cannot explain it.  The OST has some of the most random lyrics, and an ever-changing tune that I can only explain as a song that is worthy of being this anime\'s OST track.  The thing is, it\'s so random, that it\'s so enjoyable.  Hands down, this OST is one of my favorite opening tracks for an anime period, because it\'s just so fun to watch and listen to.The ED on the other hand is a very happy song that involves singing about a penalty game.  It\'s a nice little finisher to the anime, as it still contains that vibrant energy that this series is overfilling with.Overview+  Aesthetically pleasing look+  Good integration of both styles of art work+  Addicting soundtrack-   There are none.  =w=Personal Enjoyment (9.56/10):  When I first discovered D-fragments, I only chose to start with the manga because the manga was already present and ongoing.  I had held off on the anime series because I wanted to get far in reading the series, just so I don\'t spoil anything for myself.  That plan didn\'t work, cause I finished the anime before finishing the manga.What I love about D-fragments is the sheer randomness that works just so well for this series.  The series itself goes over the top and does not care if you go along for the ride or not.  It goes, and continues, making you hope that you can keep up.  As I was watching this series, the most memorable parts about it for me was how much I enjoyed the slapstick comedy that worked extremely well for this series.  For a series that wanted to be random, it succeeded.  D-fragments is one of those series that anyone can enjoy without thinking too hard.Personally, I love this series because of how entertaining and enjoyable it was.  It provided me some great laughs and no facepalmy plot points that I hate with all my heart.  In the end, I would recommend this show to anyone who would like a good laugh, or even to just not think, because in the end, thinking while watching this, will get you nowhere.  It\'s not the best thing to watch in the world, but for a comedy/school series, it\'s definitely top notch.Overall Score: (9.15/10)  Remember.  I\'m a blue fire type!', 'Love to fight, love to fight, I love to fight..........Does anybody think that there are certain anime that would be better off as mangas, well, this is one of them, what it is basically something whose plot were pretty random and it only rides on one particular character, in fact this anime is depended on that particular character as he goes around being a typical victim of his club\'s antics, so no more fucking around and I\'m gonna be presenting my ratings for each of this anime\'s category:Poor 3:Story:.........Simply, there isn\'t any and it would be better to forget what this anime\'s genre is.Sound: Though,...I like the opening theme, the voices of the character\'s were seemly too mature for their roles, like Kazama, his seiyu  Konishi, Katsuyuki no longer has that youthful intonation, Chitose\'s seiyu Saito Chiwa, should have used the same tone that she did in Bakemonogatari that is if she would have did the voice of Tama, Roka\'s voice should have been done by Takahashi, Mikako instead of  Hanazawa, Kana, in fact Hanazawa, Kana\'s voice over would have been a better fit on Chitose. About, Sakura, her voice over should have been done by Toyosaki, Aki since she does have cutie girl tone that she once did with Soga Keena from  Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, only the voice of Minami was a match for her. The rest, well, there probably need for me to concern about it since they\'re more like support character and it doesn\'t matter who did who.Fair 6.Art: Nothing much for me to say about it, except that the way  those male support characters were illustrated makes them too matured to be in high school, as if they have been there for quite a long time.Character:Kazama Kenji- well, I did mentioned that this anime rides on one particular character and it so happens that it is him, at one point I may have find it funny to see him going through all the antics that his club get into, but in another point I get annoyed by his tantrums and his rants when it would have been much easier if he just quit the club. Also, his tough guy looks makes him look like a dog whose bark was worse than his bite, despite of the fact that he can handle his own when dealing with delinquents, which it doesn\'t always end in success and he has to be saved by his club members, you might say that the rating for this category was for him.Roka Shibasaki - I may have find her cute for being a small but terrible character, but overall I see her as nuts who should be seeing a shrink.Chitose  Karasuyama- she is basically the only character that I like to hate.Sakura Mizukami- I may also like her, but then again her character was simply an over hyped one.Minami  Oosawa - For me, she was the kind of character that one would describes her as a question than a statement, where one would ask ""Who the fuck is she?!""Takao- the only character that I like, she is another reason why I give this category a 6.Ataru and Shio- it it weren\'t for them as well, I would have given this part a 4, since they\'re the ones who serves as the comedy part of this anime.Good 7.Enjoyment: thought it lacks a plot, it was still enjoyable enough to be watch when it was Kazama who is in such predicament.Overall: Good as it is, funny as it is, so does this anime deserve another season????????I won\'t recommend it, like I\'ve said this anime should bet better off as a manga than an anime.

I can\'t stand that D-Frag! is finished but the fact is yes, it\'s finished. After making me laughed so hard that my mom come to my room to say ""Hey, son. Do you go insane now?"" once a week, now is the time it\'s finished. So before starting the review, let me tell you how I feel before deciding to watch D-Frag! as my winter\'s anime.I always look at the genre of an anime before watching it, I started to watch D-Frag! cause some of the genres are School and Comedy. Yeah, I\'m a lonely guy without girlfriend or else so at...least I have to taste some comedy so that I\'m not feel lonely anymore yay (?). Well, while looking for some info for D-Frag! on this site, I found out that the cover of D-Frag! is 5 girls and a guy that I think it would become a harem. But then, I was wrong, cause D-Frag! has a F-ing fabulous comedy so that harem stuffs were pulled out from my mind.Okay, let\'s head straight to the review.Story 8D-Frag!, a story(story?) that involves a leader of a famous delinquent gang named ""The Kazama Gang"", but somehow nobody even knows him. Though he is a delinquent douche, he still helping someone to extinguish fire. And at the end, he forced to join a weird club named ""Game Production Club"" and he found the four not-so-normal girls.From the manga (chap special 14,5) at the end of the chapter, Tomoya-sensei wrote ""This extra doesn\'t relmaate to the main story (Is there something called \'story\' in this manga?)"" and yet i agree with him.For the plot itself, I think it\'s not a strange plot for me, it\'s just mainstream. I mean, A punk forced to join a club? But yet i realized, my inner self was just like ""Hey dude, this is a comedy you know, why you should be concerned about the plot, huh?"". Yes, later on episodes 6++ I watched some arcs and I didn\'t expect that a comedy like this has it\'s own arcs. It\'s so amazing.Art 8Nowadays, the\'re many animes with great art, and D-Frag! isn\'t one of it. To be honest, the art of D-Frag! is just an average for me. But, for a comedy anime, it just really suit with the gag. In D-Frag!, there\'re so many characters that given their chibi style. I love it, very very love it. Especially when the chibi character is doing his/her gag while the others stay at the original body style. The sense of humour just spreaded out more.Sound 9The seiyuus do their role so good. For example Roka (HanaKana), she\'s good at voicing all types of expression such as cute, straight, and that ""yandere"" style. For Kenji (Konishi Katsuyuki), he\'s so good voicing his punchlines. For Sakura (Takahashi Mikako) her voice is suitable for her expression, the smiling-all-time-water-element-Sakura lel. And for the first time of my life, I just heard the tsundere version of Itou Shizuka wow (because Akeno, Wilhelmina, and Hildegard all have an adult voice :v), and she\'s really cute at it. And at the end, Ataru (Fukuyama Jun) the M type, he\'s so funny acting as an M while voicing like that. It\'s like I imagining that Dark Flame Master is tortured by Rikka :)).For the OST, the OP is good, energetic, and makes you feel to watch the episode ASAP (not because the OP is boring but it\'s because it gives you full energy so you\'ll ready to laugh all the time), and the ED that performed by Itou Shizuka, Toyosaki Aki, and HanaKana is great too.Character 9All of the characters has their unique personality theirselves. A tsundere, a masochist, an ""open hearted"" delinquent, even elemental lords! (water, earth, lightning, and ""darkness"" fire). It just....wow...And that evil head of student council character, it just rare to see the ""real"" leader of the school is the head of the student council. Recently, there\'re so many characters that joined to the story and they have their own unique personality that different with anyone.Enjoyment 10It\'s the second anime that can make me laugh soooo hard in every episodes (the first one is SKET Dance). So, there\'s no lack for the enjoyment. Perfect score for it.Overall 9Well what can I say? It\'s so good for the enjoyment, even the other aspects were not too perfect. But it\'s still good, right? eh, no, it\'s better than good is it?If you feel you want to watch series and looking for a grooveless anime so that you are not forcing your brain to think ""How will it end?"" ""What will happen to him/her after that?"" or else and you want to laugh because your life\'s suck, I recommend D-Frag! for you. least I have to taste some comedy so that I\'m not feel lonely anymore yay (?).

I laughed quite a few times during every episode!!! Kenji really keeps it real and I love how he shouts at almost everything XD Without kenji, this anime would suck ass. imagine putting like densuke from eiken or any weakling anime main character and it would be a total embarrassment. The supporting characters are hit or miss, and I really blame this for only being 12 episodes! It felt a little compressed, and thus some...characters got forgotten or didn't really have their stories/personalities explored that well.  The jokes are pretty original, even when it comes to the ecchi stuff with takao's oppai;however, I kinda hated takao after awhile, she's just an excuse to put big boobs in anime. she would be a horrible character if she didn't have boobs, that's how sadly the writers made her lol. they basically made her a running boob joke. that can tick people off, and even though im a boob lover, they went a little too much with that joke. Thankfully, Roka is there to save the day :P such a cutie pie! Such a stranger character, but rightfully done! I don't feel like discussing every character, becuz they're hit or miss, but almost all deliver laughs, and that was the goal.Plot: well there's minimal plot because that's the point lol! that what makes it funny, so don't go expecting a deep work of art.Sound: there's not much to say about this, just avg.Art: again, pretty typical animeI finished this anime in one day, man it gave me a great happiness and i wish they went for like 22-24 episodes total. Plus, it won't have a long-term effect on ya, you'll forget about this anime as it has really no plot and is just there to make you laugh. still happy that i watched it though.P.S.

Just Kidding"" D-frag OPAfter watching 12 episodes, this by far is one a hell roller-coaster ride.Even though this show doesn\'t have any plots or arcs, this show is towards more on Comedy, just like Nichijou and Daily Lives of High school boys. The gags, reactions really made me lol, Fanservice? There is one massive oppai, one flat oppai and the rest are normal. Sadly this series has no beach scene. Well, doesn\'t matter anyway, this series is enjoyable. Otherwise, directing and script is well prepared.8/10The art is not really interesting, but for a...studio that i never heard before, the animations are fluid and smooth, no loopholes or weird animations, They did a good job. Character designs is also nice, the chibi version also. 8/10The OPs and the EDs are enjoyable, listened repeatedly for the OPs full version. The seiyuus that were chosen to voice acting the characters are decent and noticably Hanazawa Kana (Kuroneko from Oreimo) voice acting Roka, which i recognized earlier after the story of the series begin.  Kazama\'s seiyuu voice acting is also great, never listen to his other voice acting, but for this i really like it especially on the reaction parts. 8/10I like Kazama\'s reactions, it\'s totally funny and i wouldn\'t say it\'s priceless. He seems to be oblivious to Takao\'s feelings. Takao on other hand, can be a tsundere sometimes and i love her reaction when she cries, (so cute). Overall, the characters in this series can be sometimes weird and sometimes fun. 8/10I really enjoyed watching this series, this made me laughed so hard that i almost woke everyone up (in my family) because it\'s a comedy series.

An anime which most people would just over look, it has that stereotypical plot set up. Guy lives his life - guy does something and ends up being forced to join a club full of women - guy hates club but continues to stay in it and get up to shenanigans in everyday life. This premises would put most of the anime community off it, ""Just another boring harem anime nothing new"". Well im gonna tell you differently.Story - 10Now most people wouldnt think theirs much of a story in a slice of life-ish anime but youd be horrible mistaken. The story, although coherent,...has a new story at the end of one or two episodes. But it all serves a purpose, its not just mindless filler but instead develops the characters and makes the interactions between them seen more real and emotional. Another thing this story does amazingly is comedy. This is one of the few anime ive ever laughed out loud - the others being gintama and angel beats!. The comedy takes ordinarily boring settings and turns them into intelligently crafted and thought provoking comedy, something other anime tend to fail at.Art - 8The art is well done and looks crisp, animation is good but it isnt the level of attack on titan, still very good and well done. The overall colour scheme is extremely bright and cheerful giving the feel of light-heartedness and fun making it enjoyable and easy on the eyesSound - 7The sound is over all very good - the background music can be emotional, fast paced or quirky and overall sets the feeling of the scene. The issue i have is the opening and ending songs. The are very well sung and really well animated but its not really something you can listen to on its own and enjoy - its on the style off Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou ending; quirky and sung by the voice actors. still the sound is very well done.Characters - 9Characters are one od D-frags biggest stand points. Theirs really not much to say other than the characters well built, unique and interesting - hilarious as well.Enjoyment - 10This anime is amazing if you couldnt already tell, its really disappointing it was over looked and deserves a higher score. I actually finished this anime in a night and it left me feeling empty. Really should have been a 24 episode series and im hoping for a new season has a new story at the end of one or two episodes. But it all serves a purpose, its not just mindless filler but instead develops the characters and makes the interactions between them seen more real and emotional.

Theirs really not much to say other than the characters well built, unique and interesting - hilarious as well.Enjoyment - 10This anime is amazing if you couldnt already tell, its really disappointing it was over looked and deserves a higher score. I actually finished this anime in a night and it left me feeling empty. Really should have been a 24 episode series and im hoping for a new season', ""Loud, funny, predictable at times, but still adorable and satisfying. Despite the close relationship that anime fans have to gaming, it's rare to see an anime dedicated purely to the subject. However, D-Frag is a show where games and the world of gaming is the basis for a funny and refreshing spin on the school club anime scene.The story starts with Kenji, a so-called delinquent, who has recently moved to the city with his friends. They aren’t really bad people; they merely want the mystique that is attached to those sorts of people. Kenji and companys' appearance breathes hope into their club, but however, their...recruitment drive is…less than orthodox. It borders on the manic and farcical. The first several minutes give you no preparation for this, and at first, the audience left in stunned silence, but the tension slowly dissipates and you realize that the club is a rag-tag team of eccentrics, obsessives and power-mad horrors. However, there’s a twist in the tale, entailing the prior existence of a Game Dev Club, led by a busty girl named Takao. This extra addition gives a sense of competition and dynamism to the story. It could’ve been completed in the first episode, but the element of peril would’ve been extinguished. Fortunately it lingers on and adds an extra dimension to proceedings.Yes, some of the characters can be included into a cookie-cutter-like feeling, incorporating  archetypes such as the dominatrix, the peppy go-getter, the lazy placater, yet each of them possess an extra dimension which saves them from being purely plot vehiclesAs for the rest of it, it sort of falls down. The art work can be good at times and when the comedy is heightened to insane levels, it comes into its stride and it works. Unfortunately, during the bits in between it feels a little flat and dull – like watching a rushed product, or a part where the animators were anxious to get to the more comedic, and interesting parts. It lacks consistency and originality in its artwork, but nevertheless, a good watch.I certainly like this show and find it to be very funny. Gaming is something that most anime fans can understand and relate to, so I’m surprised it has not been explored more often. It's a refreshing addition to the school club genre and I certainly recommend this show for people seeking a wacky comedy with a lot of slapstick and shouting. recruitment drive is…less than orthodox.

The punch lines that the main character spouts makes this anime kinda ""distinguished"". The characters are overall fine in terms of graphic and sound (Kenji\'s and Roka\'s voices kinda ring in my ears right now!) . Character development is kind of lacking, though, as not everyone\'s character is intricately shown. This anime also promotes friendship as life is gonna be fun when everybody is around you. Definitely gonna wait for the second season!! ', 'So, I just watched D-Frag!, it\'s a show I vaguely remember hearing about when it came out and then basically nothing. Every time it did come up, it sounded like another run of the mill high school comedy that runs on clichés and doesn\'t bring much new to the table, but I\'m going to try and explain why D-Frag! might be my favorite comedy anime of all time.It starts out simple enough, there\'s a club about to be shut down due to lack of members. It\'s full of cute girls, one of whom explicitly says she\'s gonna miss doing nothing. On the other side, you\'ve...got the main character, a juvenile delinquent who\'s the leader of his own gang but is actually a softy and will absolutely do the right thing in a pinch. Heard all this before? Yeah, the show knows, you\'re not supposed to take it seriously, because the characters don\'t, the club president forgets the name of her club and the gang bemoan stereotyping and side characters comment on how unremarkable the main character Kazuma is.The show is cliché, but it knows it\'s cliché and uses this to regularly make meta jokes, frequently in the form of Kazuma pointing out exactly what the audience is thinking when something ridiculous happens. An early example is when he gets in a fight with a girl who uses a cliché anime ""special move"" where she blinds her opponent by revealing a bunch of curtains that block out the lights and windows. This is really weird, actually, no, it\'s dumb. How did she set that up, did she know she\'d be having a duel in that exact part of the hallway or are these curtains set up across the entire school? How did she trigger them to fall with a snap? That makes no sense. And wait a minute, they\'re just curtains, Kazuma can\'t see, but he can just run forward and push through them, this won\'t stop him at all. All these thoughts went through my head, and they probably went through Kazuma\'s too because he does exactly that, runs forward and pushes through the curtains...right through an open window. That\'s...smart, no, it\'s dumb, but clever. Really clever. D-Frag isn\'t cliché because it\'s not creative enough to come up with something original, it\'s cliché because it knows the inherent value of these cliché moments and what mentality it\'ll put the audience in. From there, it can play to or subvert your expectations at its leisure because it\'s honestly not trying to manipulate you, it\'s just genuinely trying to be a fun, likable show.No scene demonstrates this better than the very next one after Kazuma falls out the window. Another cliché moment happens when Roka manages to catch him at the very last second and yells about never letting go no matter what. Kazuma then points out the absurdity of the moment, tells her to cut the moe act, and then suggests letting him go because he\'s not even that far off the ground so he\'d probably be fine if he fell to which she responds that it\'s not an act, sure she\'s a little eccentric, but that\'s just who she is and she\'s not apologizing for it. The show isn\'t apologizing either, it\'s a cliché high school comedy and it owns that. That self awareness and unapologetic attitude lead to an amazing ride.I barely scratched the surface of why this show is great, you can break down just about every scene just like this and see multiple layers of depth there, but basically, if you haven\'t watched this show, give it a try. Obviously it\'s not for everyone, no anime is, but it\'s criminally under appreciated and also has a great great GREAT dub if that\'s something you care about. On MAL it\'s got like a 7.6 which is insane, because I\'d genuinely give it a 10/10, I unironically loved every second. got the main character, a juvenile delinquent who\'s the leader of his own gang but is actually a softy and will absolutely do the right thing in a pinch.

A lot of the tropes are similar only they are used in different ways. Nothing too new or innovative yet it still feels fresh.The slice of life aspect of the show doesn't fall short of other SoL's. It's pretty everyday stuff (hanging out, having fun with friends) with the occasional overarching plot (all the times people try to shut them down, a few competitions).In terms...of characters D-Frag! Does something interesting. It shares the spotlight with a lot of side and minor characters and yet almost all of them either have some sort back story or some sort of depths yet all of them are insane in some way or the other. The main character is the only one sane so he pretty much shouts out punchlines and such at anything that won't make sense. My only beef in the character department is, I'd wish this show was one episode longer, so it could give me the back story of Sakura (Pink hair) who is by all accounts the most and only underdeveloped character.Nothing stood out in the soundtrack department, for good and bad.To sum it up; I enjoyed this show a lot and recommend it if you're a fan of delinquent tropes mixed with game (video and physical) tropes. of characters D-Frag!

Turns out it was a masterpiece.This has a very simple story, a comedy about a wannabe delinquent who joins a club of the craziest women ever. But, the comedy is just golden. Truth be told, I started watching it because I felt that Seitokai S2 was pretty lackluster, and this anime didn\'t let me down, not one week. Although it\'s weakest episodes are probably the first two, which may not be the best to promote the series.Each and every one of the character probably made you laugh AT LEAST once, they were all fantastic and so random,...yeah, that\'s the word I\'m looking for: Random.I mean, we have a teacher called Shaun Konekone with a crystal skull. We have a son and a father that appear for no reason at all and they are great too, we have the cutest character Funnabori, the best tsundere Takao, the mysteriously hilarious and cute Roka (voiced by HanaKana), the student council president  who looks like Hitagi and is voiced by the same person who voiced her in Monogatari. We have a masochist voiced by FukuJun (Lelouch and Yuuta).I SEROIUSLY recommend this to anyone, a masterpiece hands down. The reason why it\'s so good is probably because it has progress, both with the characters and the story. Something Seitokai lacks, unfortunately. Off course, if you don\'t find the ""random wtf"" jokes funny, this isn\'t for you.

I feel the dub was pretty good, notably Takao and Roka - while the rest felt a little wooden or dry. Shiou was a great dub too, but my god do you still want to punch him in the throat (which I guess is what they were going for lol).I\'ll be sitting here patiently waiting for season 2 I suppose, and will definitely rewatch it in the mean-time!

""IS IT GOING TO BE A BAD SHOW""? Short answer: No, it wasn\'t.The story... we don\'t talk about the story. Not because it was bad but because it just didn\'t exist. Typical SOL.However I still got really drawn into what was going on most episodes. This is mostly because everything that happens in this show is just so fricking absurd, it\'s not even funny.. But that\'s just the thing, IT IS HILARIOUS. Sort of. I noticed other people praising this show with it\'s uncanny comedy but...I still just can\'t fully agree with that statement. Not because it is unfunny but because I didn\'t find all of the 9000 jokes / second they were throwing at us ""that"" funny. Please don\'t confuse this with me saying it is unenjoyable because it is in fact very enjoyable. Why? Because, in my own words, all of these jokes set the mood of the show. You aren\'t supposed to take this show seriously which I like.Art:Wasn\'t bad, however I found it rather inconsistent (not talking about the chibi\'s, the chibis are great and you DON\'T joke the chibi\'s). I felt the way the characters were drawn poorly in some instances (not all) and some of the camera angles were poorly drawn. The artstyle on the whole is pretty acceptable by my standards and animation is good enough for just a SOL anime.Sound:Not a musicoholic but yeah, had a good OP, good voice work, and I didn\'t really notice the BGM (but honestly who really cares in a SOL anime where the mood is set not by music but by the number of jokes you can break in a second, right DF?). Also, hi.Characters:Pretty likeable characters, however a few of the sub-main characters are JUST there (like the pink haired bitch) and barely had any affect with the main character. I guess this is a small mole hill in an otherwise mildly enjoyable show.Also, Takao Best Girl. Also she is voiced by the girl who voices Chris(also best girl) from Magikoi and not the anime (Worst adaptation ever), the VN.Enjoyment:Probably the thing I enjoyed most about this show was the atmosphere it gave off. Silly does work sometimes (it usually doesn\'t for me) and for the record I did not laugh at every joke this show threw at me just because of the sheer number of jokes. It\'s physically impossible. If you claim to have laughed at absolutely every single joke then you most likely evaporated out of your human shell. Art wasn\'t too great (or too bad) for me but it didn\'t get in the way of enjoyment.Overall:As an anime made up of 80% jokes, it was really enjoyable, no doubts here. A very addictive and bipolar environment that you just can\'t resist... Go watch it.I ultimately gave it a 7/10 because it left me wanting for more so let\'s hope for that second season =)If you found my review helpful then leave a like or whatever you do on this site and also leave me feedback so I can know what not to do in reviews in the future (I am not a writer for god\'s sake!) :) I still just can\'t fully agree with that statement.

Don't worry, it's not a bad thing for this anime. I would like to mainly comment on the comedy and the one-sided romance in this anime. The comedy is mainly from random scenes or punchlines by Kazama. It can be pretty random, I bet you. The romance is very slight and one-sided. Some of the girls, you would have to check the wiki if they...have feelings for him and for the others, you could instantly notice. It's one-sided, though. But I doubt that this anime was aiming for a mostly rom/com type anime.Art: 8/10For me, the art fit the theme of the anime. The art is very simple, the animation was smooth and the colours were nice.Sound: 9/10The OST somehow fit each scene, whether it is a really stupid one or a serious scene. Though, I will be mostly talking about the random OP and ED. The OP would have sentences along the lines of '....do you understand? I love tungsten'. The ED is less random than the OP, but they're both pretty catch though.Character: 10/10To me, each character stood out whether they are a main or a side. They were all very unique in their own ways.Kazama Kenji, the protagonist and the so-called delinquent. Most of the screen-time he gets is throwing punchlines to each random scene/sentence from each character. For a delinquent, he's very kind. But, he's pretty oblivious to the girls that like him.Roka Shibasaki, a very random girl. My favourite things about her is when she's in her chibi form either staring at someone or doing something stupid. Would you also believe me if I said she's the 'underground boss'?Chitose Karasuyama, the weird student council. Even though she picks on Kazama, calling him Mr. Foot Fetish, she can be kind sometimes. She's quiet sometimes, and can be slightly perverted.Mizukami Sakura, a water obsessed character. Though she is cute, she can be super random sometimes like asking a person if he/she likes water. Very cheerful but probably gets the least screen-time as a main character.Takao (no last name listed) is a tsundere and a girl who has unusually massive boobs that could break a tracksuit's zipper. She likes Kazama a lot and tries to impress him and hearing on what he likes, so she can cook something that he likes. She's a nice person too. A pretty girl who likes to play video games, now that's rare.Enjoyment: 10/10I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. I waited for half a week to watch this because I had really bad internet for about a week. As soon as our internet came back, I was really excited to watch this. I was not disappointed at all.Overall: 9/10If you're looking for a funny anime to kill time or to make yourself happy, then this anime might do the trick. Would I re-watch this anime? Definitely, for the laughs. Also, did I mention random? have feelings for him and for the others, you could instantly notice. It's one-sided, though. But I doubt that this anime was aiming for a mostly rom/com type anime.Art: 8/10For me, the art fit the theme of the anime. The art is very simple, the animation was smooth and the colours were nice.Sound: 9/10The OST somehow fit each scene, whether it is a really stupid one or a serious scene. Though, I will be mostly talking about the random OP and ED. The OP would have sentences along the lines of '....do you understand? I love tungsten'. The ED is less random than the OP, but they're both pretty catch though.Character: 10/10To me, each character stood out whether they are a main or a side. They were all very unique in their own ways.Kazama Kenji, the protagonist and the so-called delinquent. Most of the screen-time he gets is throwing punchlines to each random scene/sentence from each character. For a delinquent, he's very kind. But, he's pretty oblivious to the girls that like him.Roka Shibasaki, a very random girl. My favourite things about her is when she's in her chibi form either staring at someone or doing something stupid. Would you also believe me if I said she's the 'underground boss'?Chitose Karasuyama, the weird student council. Even though she picks on Kazama, calling him Mr. Foot Fetish, she can be kind sometimes. She's quiet sometimes, and can be slightly perverted.Mizukami Sakura, a water obsessed character. Though she is cute, she can be super random sometimes like asking a person if he/she likes water. Very cheerful but probably gets the least screen-time as a main character.Takao (no last name listed) is a tsundere and a girl who has unusually massive boobs that could break a tracksuit's zipper. She likes Kazama a lot and tries to impress him and hearing on what he likes, so she can cook something that he likes. She's a nice person too. A pretty girl who likes to play video games, now that's rare.Enjoyment: 10/10I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. I waited for half a week to watch this because I had really bad internet for about a week. As soon as our internet came back, I was really excited to watch this. I was not disappointed at all.Overall: 9/10If you're looking for a funny anime to kill time or to make yourself happy, then this anime might do the trick. Would I re-watch this anime?

Looking at D-Frag\'s image alone and the for some reason the name just put a bad taste in my mouth. Surprisingly when I checked that this had a decent score of 7.70 I decided to give it a chance and it\'s good that I did.Story: 7D-Frag\'s story is very simple and that\'s surprisingly a good thing. Normally I get irritated at some harem anime for taking themselves way too seriously or some other animes that don\'t have any...story and are episodic. All you need to know about D-Frag\'s story is that a high school delinquent (although its kind of hard to tell most of the time) joins an after school game creation club. After that the next episodes are meant for introducing more characters and just having the main characters goof off and do stupid things. It has a sort of slice of life feeling to it, and in a good way. D-Frag doesn\'t really need a story. It has two ""arcs"" if you even want to call them that since they\'re only 2 episodes long each and don\'t do a whole lot with the story. The only sort of progression you\'ll be getting is that of character development which isn\'t great, but not bad. I would\'ve loved to see more of it, especially from Takao. The only downside I have would be that it just sorts of ends. I know this is only the first (and sadly only) season, but its finale is kind of weak.Art: 8D-Frag doesn\'t look amazing, but it is appealing to the eyes. I like the character designs and the colors really pop. It\'s a good looking anime overall, but the creative ways in which they use the animation is where it\'s strong point is. It may just be me, but t\'s just really funny seeing a chibi form of a character doing the same action in only a couple frames or just seeing them in chibi form in general. The animation really helps some of the jokes work and that\'s very important for a series like D-FragSound: 7I would say D-Frag\'s soundtrack is easily it\'s weakest point. It\'s definitely not bad, it\'s just that some of it\'s songs feel really generic and could easily fit in with any other high school anime. Some of it\'s other tracks, most notably the calmer/sadder ones like That does not change, and Warmth, are actually quite good. The soundtrack is kind of a mixed bag, the OP is kind of generic but the ED is fairly good. As for sound design, it does a good job at helping out some of the jokes work. Another very important detail is the voice acting. I am not a fan of subs in general and didn\'t like the voices that much when I watched the OVA since there isn\'t a dub of it. However I did really enjoy Funimation\'s English dub. I normally enjoy dubs since thats how I watch anime, but this is easily an above average dub so I highly recommend watching it or at least giving it a chance.Characters: 8D-Frag\'s characters are what makes the show so enjoyable. All the main characters are unique and have their own personalities. I don\'t think there\'s a single unlikable character in the series. Kenji is an enjoyable main character but is a bit on the average side. He isn\'t the star of the show, and is MILES better than your typical main male harem lead. Roka and Takao are great and are the show\'s strongest characters (although Takao is best girl). Normally I\'d hate someone like Chitose but she turns out to be a likable character, but still my least favorite among the mains. Sakura is a weird case. She seems great, but gets very little screen time compared to the others which makes it hard to love her as much. All the other side characters are good especially Tama, even if she\'s only in the last 2 episodes. Another point I\'d like to talk about is how D-Frag seems like your typical high school anime and the way they introduce some of it\'s characters. Takao is seen at the beginning of episode 2 and seems like an annoying character, yet she turns out be the best. Same goes for the Band of 14 Devils. At first glance they seem like your average tough group of bullies, but turn out to be funny and enjoyable.Enjoyment: 8D-Frag is hilarious at times, and all around very funny. I wouldn\'t say it\'s there with the likes of Chuunibyou or Baka to Test but there are moments that come close. It\'s comedy is it\'s strong point and always seems to be fresh and unique. I could easily watch half of the series if (but most likely when) I rewatch the series. It\'s just really enjoyable and entertaining.Overall: 8D-Frag is definitely an underrated anime that I haven\'t heard many people talk about. I don\'t want to say it\'s a hidden gem since it\'s only 12 episodes but maybe if it were twice as long and was just as good then maybe. D-Frag is a well above average anime that will keep you interested in its comedy and enjoyable cast of characters. Just a heads up 1. Don\'t expect an ending 2. Try out the dub first and 3. enjoy it while it lastsHopefully in the future we\'ll get a second season but it\'s been 4 years now so I highly doubt that\'ll happen.

ASAP!""Story (5/10): There is not a worthy framework to follow on, just the comedy. But if there a worthy plot planning of following of, it would be the the typical lives of these high schoolers, their clubs, and how they go on about it. When it comes to most comedy anime however, the plot tends to stray away and comedy is often the focal point when it comes to these kinds of series. Fortunately, the anime succeeds when it comes to it. As a result, it is ridiculously hilarious. Nevertheless, this anime...could have been better off with a decent plot as their were noticeable signs of plot elements worthy when coming into the anime. The story starts off as the the \'Temporary\' Game Club are in desperate attempts to find a fifth member in order for their club not to be shut down. The club president eventually finds the fifth member she was looking for. But however, she pleads for him to sign into the club despite rejecting many times signing into the club. But after many desperate attempts and through amusing tactics, she gets him to sign. With him signing into the club, one of the members of the \'Original\' Game Club takes hold of the news and is furious. Simply because, they are the \'Original\' Game Club and as the guy who signed it, joined into the \'Temporary\' Game Club. The club president from the \'Original\' Game Club tells the guy to drop off the club and get in hold of their club instead. In result, words spreads to the \'Temporary\' Game Club and tension rises between the two clubs. As the cultural festival arrives, whoever makes the \'best game\' will be recognized at the best game club at school. This could have been a great plot to follow for the anime in general, but however, the \'main\' plot and the outcome, ended as short-lived as a result. As the series progressed however, it went to a continuous episodic plot to an episodic plot to a continuous episodic plot once again. Not only it was frustrating for these sequences to follow, it was widely inconsistent from each other. And, only to end without closure by the end of the series. What was learned however, even though each episode was in disarray and straying away from the \'main plot\', all the episodes had a similarity from each other. Each episode shared the danger of the main characters losing their clubs which makes the anime worth watching for. The plot is not what should not be looked at but for the fun of it. But nevertheless without the plot, the comedy saves the anime from failing.Art (8/10): The art is fine as it is. Certainly, the opening theme to this anime was flashy and as a result cracked a smile every time in each and every episode. The same can be said to the ending of the anime as well. But, what is unique about the ending theme is that at  the end of each episode, the ending theme adds in a new \'female\' character every time they are introduced. To mention that the characters designs are one of the highlights of the anime. Because, there were some scenarios where Roka, one of the main heroine of the series, turns herself into a \'chibi\' version of herself which amusing to see. To also mention that the facial expressions that the characters make are so undeniably adorable in some scenarios, and hilarious in some. The character designs were creative and perfectly executed. Overall, Brain Base did a great art direction job nevertheless.Sound (8/10): Let\'s start off that Konishi Katsuyuki\'s \'eccentric\' voice is absolutely hilarious to hear voicing one of the main characters in the series which was Kazuma, Kenji. Every time an insult or a sarcastic comment is made by one of the characters to attack him, he counterattacks it by yelling a logical comment of his own. As a result, a well done performance by Konishi Katsuyuki. To mention that all the \'seiyuus\' did a brilliant job voicing each of their individual character as well! No character felt out of place as each matched their characters personality. Lastly, most importantly and worthy of mentioning, that on top of the amusing animation, both the opening and ending tracks captured the anime\'s atmosphere as a whole. As a result, filled the anime\'s expectation as whole! The soundtracks were uplifting and joyful to hear simply because the lyrics hilariously did not make sense whatsoever. Maybe, it was trying a crack of wordplay? Oh well, it was entertaining to hear nevertheless.Character (9/10): The characters has their own little quirks that can be remembered by. To mention one character looked like Kenji straight out of School Rumble. What was interesting about this character lineup is that this is one of the most eccentric lineups yet. Not only it was eccentric, it was vast! Unfortunately with a cast so huge, it was hard to remember the names of each individual character. Fortunately, the characters and their charismatic personalities were there to distinguish their amongst their names. Importantly, the character lineup essentially brought this anime to life. Without this unique set of characters, this could have been a boring slice-of-life anime without a doubt. The characters brighten up the atmosphere of the anime and as a result, a success and a joy to watch. The characters succeeded in hooking the entirety of the anime as a whole. To mention, many of these characters however did fit into different categories of cliché anime tropes. Fortunately, many of these characters did not abuse the \'stereotype\' which did not make it a nuisance. Lastly and the character worth of mentioning of is Shibaskaki Roka, the main heroine of the series. Throughout the entire series, the \'eccentricity\' of her character shined above the rest. She was definitely an oddball and and at the same time, adorably cute! Overall, loved the characters!Enjoyment (10/10): Cried tears of joy through in and each episode. Stomach hurt due to laughing to much. Have not enjoyed an anime this widely entertaining in a long time. Enjoyed from beginning to end!Overall (9/10): Overall, this anime is a perfect example of \'entertainment\'. The characters and how they deal with each scenario is ridiculously entertaining. The idea may sound bland of characters playing rock, paper, scissors may sound boring but the way the author wrote the interactions between the characters is simply brilliant! The concept of a plot may be a non-existent, but the entirety of the anime as a whole is worth the watch! The framework just follows simply of high-schoolers, their game creation club and their how they go on about their everyday lives is just what makes it entertaining. Definitely recommend this anime! Do not forget to watch the OVA as well!Personal Rant:To be honest, this anime could have ended up as a harem anime, as there was a convincible amount of girls in the anime. To mention, many of the girls shared many of the cliche anime tropes used in a harem anime. This is just an observation however. But the idea of this anime being a harem anime could have ruined this anime reputation\'s for the worse. But, fortunately this series didn\'t portray any elements of harem that can be classified of the genre. The same genre applies to ecchi as well.RAW SCORE: 8/10OVERALL SCORE: 9/10 (Generous Score) could have been better off with a decent plot as their were noticeable signs of plot elements worthy when coming into the anime.

However, I found a show different from expectation.Story:Substantially, a guy is forced to join in a club ready to be closed for insufficient elements. And you said: ""where i have hear this?"" Probably in almost every school club show. The list is really long. Other elements are girls who spend the time playing. Just the name of the club and the game they produce worth watching the whole series. Im not interested to spoiler the show, but the story follows the club\'s elements and a a few other through...school life.What makes the show worth watching? The story starts pretty common, but i found in the direction something really awesome. Because, some lines are maybe better for a parody instead than a romcom. Im not joking, when i watched it i thought: im laughing like with noucome and korezom (2 parodies). And i dont remember a comedy so funny. However, everyone has a different sense of humour and i understand that is pretty personal.Second, the characters. Im not saying that they are so unique, but the director use them in a great way. There isnt a char that eclipse all other, but everyone has his space to make the show funnier.Animation: DecentSound: Nothing to writeCharacters:Its hard write in this section. Because by one side, they are common. On the other, they works together in a wonderful way. And its nice when episode after episode, the bond within them grow.The only i will write two words about is kenji kazama. I usually expect something from the male MC. He isnt empty, he isnt a weak person,he has some character. I cutted other show\'s rating when the male MC was pretty useless.Overall:I could reccomend this show if you like school comedy show. And even if you like this genre of show, you could not like the humour and (unfortunately) watch a mediocre show. The only thing i can say is: give it a try. school life.What makes the show worth watching? The story starts pretty common, but i found in the direction something really awesome.

In 2014, Brain's Base (yes the studio behind Baccano, Ixion Saga DT & OreGairu) aired a twelve episode adaptation. I'll be covering both that and the one episode OVA that was bundled with a special edition for the manga.Story:Our protagonist, Kazama, is a delinquent. One day he and his fellow skivers find themselves running afoul of the Game Creation club. To their surprise, they're handily beaten by the girls in the club. This swiftly results in Kazama being recruited to join the club. This, naturally, leads to shenanigans.The humour in this is pretty hit and miss....It has some very funny moments. The types of weird games the club comes up with can be really funny. A lot of the gags referencing games are also quite well done. The series is also good at coming up with crazy scenarios that have a lot of comedic potential. The OVA is a great example. The characters get involved in a race for special limited edition water and there are a lot of comedic possibilities with that as your premise. It wouldn't work as a long, full length anime but for one episode it's a perfect concept.On the other side of things, you have the jokes about masochism which just get really repetitive and predictable very quickly, thereby losing most of their impact. The series manages a few scenes that work with it but for every time it works there are three where it doesn't. It doesn't help that the series gives us two characters who have masochism as their main spiel. The same major issue holds true for the bulk of the love triangle japes. Kazama finds himself of interest to two different girls in a way that's so obvious even I wouldn't be oblivious to it if I were in that situation. And I once thought a young woman wrote her phone number on something she handed me by accident. And this dude seems completely oblivious. But that's not the issue with these jokes. The problem is that they're basically the same thing every time. The buxom girl gets embarrassed and acts cringey, while Roka is just completely forthright and Kazama plays the oblivious straight man. They can be funny sometimes but they're usually just cringe-worthy.I will give the series credit, though. Its comedy does work well more often than it falls flat, by a pretty strong margin.Characters:All in all, the cast works fine in a comedic context. If this were a serious series, they wouldn't. But as is, the only real complaint I have is that Kazama is kind of dull. His one job is to react to all the crazy shit everyone else does, and get dragged into it. Some might argue that you need the more “serious” character to help emphasise the craziness and respond to it but Galaxy Angel has an entire cast of bizarre, quirky characters and it is a superior comedy to this. Same with Muteki Kanban Musume.I'm not saying that no comedies should ever have that type of reaction character, but they aren't exactly interesting &, honestly, they shouldn't be put in the lead role. The mostly uninspired and uninteresting love triangle interactions don't help make a case for him either.Art:The animation is decent enough. Kind of standard but the designs work, the movements are smooth and the series does use comedic stylistic shifts and expressions pretty effectively.Sound:Hanazawa Kana, Takahashi Mikako, Saito Chiwa & Ueda Kana make for a thoroughly solid cast. About the worst I can say is that the series may be excessive with its use of exaggerated reactions and it results in a lot of yelling that can get quite trite. I bet Konishi Katsuyuki really shredded his voice doing that since he gets the worst of it. Chamomile tea is good for that, Mate. The music... I wasn't fond of the theme tunes in this one. It goes for that super hyperactive, noticeably auto-tuned aesthetic you get with some comedies. The incidental music was perfectly fine. Not the best I've heard from Matsuda Akito, but decent enough.Ho-yay:There's a bit. One of the masochist characters seems to want some polyamory involving Kazama. The OVA gets some homo-erotic moments between Sakura and Noe.Final Thoughts:D-Frag has a good amount of funny moments and some characters with strong quirks to carry it. I would go so far as to say that it is a good comedy. But it also suffers from putting a rather standard, dull character in the lead role and from some comedic bits that just get played out way before they stop using them. So, I can't call it great. Final rating, a solid 7/10. Next week, The Choujo. It has some very funny moments. The types of weird games the club comes up with can be really funny.

Final rating, a solid 7/10. Next week, The Choujo."", 'I\'ll start off this review by simply stating that D-Frag is probably the funniest anime I\'ve seen in quite a while. In many ways, the sole enjoyment and charm of this series is derived from its comedic antics, hilarious character portrayals and situations. I\'d most liken it to Baka and Test\'s younger sibling because of it\'s smaller scope and greater focus on running jokes and mindless entertainment.So with some brief inklings as to what type of experience you\'re in for as a viewer to this series, what\'s it actually about?Kenji Kazama is a young delinquent at his high school and has a known...reputation for being tough, calloused and intimidating, whether in fights, or everyday conversations. Most people would sooner stay away from him than try to be his friend. The comedy and insanity insinuates when a group of girls with some VERY interesting and colorful personalities forcibly recruits him to the school\'s lackluster and widely disregarded ""Game Creation Club."" The namesake tenant of the club however is fairly disregarded, and more often than not, the group isn\'t making games! The various personalities and social differences within all these different characters make for a truly fantastic social experiment, but also some GOLDEN humor! Whether it be the shy, eccentric and slightly dis-associative club president Roka Shibasaki, or the dense, proud and borderline Tsundere personality of Takao (her nickname being ""boobs"" due to her large bust size! :P). There is a character for everyone in this series!While the characters all have their varying personalities, conflicts and insecurities within the context of their daily lives and in the Game Creation Club, they retain their likability. This is a HUGE praise I have for this series. While the show doesn\'t go into too much detail as far as character development is concerned, it is clear that real, genuine friendships develop between the characters, and they work together well despite of their conflicts and differences. The most humorous interactions, and ultimately the ones that account for much of the shows plot development, are those involving our main male protagonist Kenji. Always reluctant and subject to the will of the crazy girls all around him, he\'s that character who\'ll just yell about everything and make things tons of fun for us audience members! Being recognized for more than his typical delinquent identity however, he grows to truly love being in the club despite the nature of his antics throughout the show. ;)In a lot of ways, as far as plot and character development is concerned, this series is most nearly episodic in its presentation. Smaller plots can underlie certain small groups of episodes without bludgeoning us with overwhelming twists and tensions. D-Frag is a FUN watch with an ending that best suits it in terms of its simplicity and scope.In conclusion, D-Frag is without a doubt one of the funniest anime I\'ve ever seen, (top 5). And it\'s an essential watch for fans of great comedy!Overall-9 reputation for being tough, calloused and intimidating, whether in fights, or everyday conversations.

It is very fast paced and the story would switch no something nonsensical midway, or even before that. Sometimes the beginning of the episode has nothing to do with the ending at all, though coherence is maintained well.The best thing about this show is it is so so so ridiculously funny. It is pure nonsense.The worst thing is it ended.I had friends who do not enjoy this show though and I was intrigue why. Seems that they are pretty much logistical minded and appreciate comedy that doesn't need imagination. So meticulously technical...people may not see the point why this silly show is so funny. people may not see the point why this silly show is so funny."", ""D-Frag is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy anime relying on randomness and the subversion of typical anime tropes to deliver some serious laughs. These contrasting elements work really, really, really  with each other; although there often isn't much in the way of plot within a single episode, let alone across episodes, I don't find myself missing it.Normally I'd give a series like this a 9/10, but D-Frag falls a short on animation (it gets pretty lazy at times), and a couple characters (Sakura comes to mind) are introduced, scarcely used again, and kinda just seem like they're being obligatorily propped up for the rest...of the series.Still, it's absolutely worth the watch if you're interested in a comedy anime that doesn't take itself seriously at all. My sole regret in watching it is that there's only 12 episodes and no second season :( of the series.Still, it's absolutely worth the watch if you're interested in a comedy anime that doesn't take itself seriously at all. My sole regret in watching it is that there's only 12 episodes and no second season :("", ""So I started watching D-Frag! simply looking at my recommendations because the premise seemed interesting.  I was looking for something a bit slice of life and absurd, and having been disappointed by some other recent shows in the genre, wasn't really expecting all that much.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed D-Frag!  This was a series that I found myself sitting down to watch an episode and I would end up watching 3 or 4 at a time because I was just enjoying myself too much.What ends up making the show is the visuals and the characters.  The sheer absurdity...of the scenes and the protagonist's consistently over the top response to the lunacy going on around him just has a way of working.  The show does a good job of mixing art styles together in ways that make for hilarious tone shifts and reactions that a consistent presentation style wouldn't allow for.What you end up with is a show that's generally very high energy and a little crazy, but never completely out of control in ways that are confusing.  Each show becomes a fun ride with a few good laughs and amusement along the way.I think that this show is a pretty solid example of a slice of life comedy with a twist done well.  There are quite a bit of your modern tropes thrown in, sometimes hilariously lampooned, such as video game tropes, a bit of the high school slice of life cliche shows up as well.  It never takes itself all that seriously, tongue is fully in cheek here.There is some light fan service and a little bit of light romance undertones, although it never quite spills into harem which is a trap that too many of these shows find themselves in for no good reason.  None of these romance/fan service elements feels over the top, and much of it exists as part of the comedy so it actually serves a purpose in the plot.  There's room for argument here, but I'd say that this is a good example of how to do these elements in a way that doesn't pander too much.This show isn't going to appeal to everyone, but if you enjoy a bit of surreal comedy in a slice of life setting, and especially if you enjoy gaming, you would probably find some enjoyment here. of the scenes and the protagonist's consistently over the top response to the lunacy going on around him just has a way of working.

He is confronted by Roka Shibasaki, president of the Game Development Club, but refuses her offer, though coercion does make him change his mind. The story sets itself here, where Kazama plays games that the GDC has created, and partakes in banter between the club.One of D-Frag's greatest strengths is in the main character, Kazama. He isn't anything special, certainly, but he's definitely a cut above the standard brown/black-haired, brown-eyed anime protagonist who just meekly goes along with whatever the rest of the characters do....He isn't afraid to speak his mind, and he will act however he sees fit, and at the end of the day, it's an angry delinquent from Kansai shouting for 12 episodes, that's as good an advertisement as any.Ultimately, D-Frag makes for a good show, devoid of any filler, cost cutting, or anything else. It's not going to challenge your views on cinema or your view of life as a whole, but the 12 episodes are going to be a good ride, and you'll be glad you went on it.

Honestly I was not expecting too much from an anime about games, but the way they take them to completely unexpected levels is really funny.The first episode might be misleading as it seems to focus in the quarrelsomeness of the main character and looks like just another school anime, but from that point on, it shakes you from one extreme to the other until you are completely amazed.Not recommended to: People looking for deep and psicological dramasRecommended to: Anyone who wants to have at least 20 min...of surprising and funny moments of surprising and funny moments', 'Somehow it being in the comedy genre just fails to make me laugh. There are a few things that stops me from enjoying this anime. First off, sure there are some funny moments but if you notice, every student looks like their in their late 30s and above. Secondly, Kenji screaming at every supposedly ""funny"" is kind of pissing me off as it is too overused and kinda boring. Lastly, there is no character development at all in this series in my opinion.I only recommend you to watch this if you really have nothing else to watch at the moment for some laughs. ', ""Hello everyone, please keep in mind this is my first review. I will do my best to express my tought on the animes i will be completing from now on.-Story- 8/10The story is mostly irrelevant  in this kind of anime. The most important thing is ''Is it funny and how so?'' I can say without a doubt that this serie is absolutlely hilarious, it manage to take the most trivials and boring things and makes them funny. What i personally like is that there is little to no puns. (I'm not too fond of puns!)-Art- 8/10The art in this one is quite simple and...colorfull, perfect for this kind of anime. The backgrounds are also well made with some references to games and mangas here and there. I also liked the design of the various characters theyr expressions are funny and they look adorable when they turn into chibis!-Sound- 7/10The music is okay but nothing really catched my attention, exept the opening which i really like. The voices of the characters perfectly fit them, Roka's voice is just the best. Only thing i didn't really like is that the main character (Kazama) is constantly yelling everytime something happens, i don't mind it that much since its part of the humour but it can get irritating.-Character- 9/10This is the strongest point of this anime, the characters are all awesome. Every characters have some sort of strange fetish or obscessions (putting bags over people heads, throwing dirt at people, being a masochist, crossdressing etc etc..) You never know what to expect from them and it always lead to completely ridiculous and hilarious situations.-Enjoyment- 8/10I really enjoyed this anime, it's rare to see a well made School comedy anime that does not fall into the usuall cliché of puns and echhi nonsense. Every episodes managed to make me laught hard and that's a sucess in my books.-Overall- 8/10Before watching this i tought this was going to be just another basic School Comedy but i was proven wrong on the first episode, this one is quite a suprise.If you like animes like Nichijou, MM!, Haganai or Chuunibyou i would absolutlely recommend you watch this one, it's well made and worth watching.Thank you for reading, if you have any feedback let me know! colorfull, perfect for this kind of anime.

Every episodes managed to make me laught hard and that's a sucess in my books.-Overall- 8/10Before watching this i tought this was going to be just another basic School Comedy but i was proven wrong on the first episode, this one is quite a suprise.If you like animes like Nichijou, MM!, Haganai or Chuunibyou i would absolutlely recommend you watch this one, it's well made and worth watching.Thank you for reading, if you have any feedback let me know!"", 'My overall score is more based off my personal thoughts, but I choose to be objective with this one or else I may come off as hateful towards it.D-Frag follows the club room anime tropes you\'re used to; first and foremost of which is being a harem, as I\'ve yet to see more than one of these have a cast of all females. Second is that the male is abused for absurd reasons. Third is that he retorts everyone around him.Alright, that\'s the groundwork out of the way and now onto the humor itself. The characters are alright at most, but of course you pity...the male lead by the end of it. The most normal girl in the anime is Takao, who is actually a sincere and honest female (despite how she is introduced) who respects Kenji and listens to his thoughts. But aside from her, all the other girls\' shtick is that they provoke Kenji in ways where you will really get angry at them by the end of it rather than admire them, with the exception of Roka who falls somewhere between hate and love. She never calls Kenji any nicknames or picks fights with him, but can also be just as disrespectful to him at times. I consider her my favorite among the mean girls for this reason since she provokes Kenji in a respectable fashion without going overboard (most of the time) and I could find myself laughing at her humor because of it.And speaking of manipulative, this brings us to it being the kind of humor where it\'s torture porn, something I\'ve mentioned many times before as a trope that more anime (usually harems) tend to follow. It used to be funny to the majority, but recently, lots of people have been against it since it\'s not only starting to grow old, but you consider it sad that the innocent character is mistreated so poorly. With D-Frag, you\'re expecting more of the same, albeit with more original writing in the humor itself which can make it feel more fresh from your typical harem.There are characters introduced at the start that give off the impression D-Frag is going to be a completely different anime, but it really does jump the shark by transforming itself into a harem almost immediately and discarding the rest of Kenji\'s male friends, who usually begin appearing when the scene calls for them. One of them bares a striking resemblance to Harima from School Rumble, albeit more sleek. And the other is a short, pudgy midget. Very sad these guys were scrapped as main characters since they could have brought some more life into the anime.I suppose I should say more good things about it. I did enjoy some of the soundtrack, Takao brought some fresh life into the harem scene and Tama is unarguably my favorite female character among the whole cast and it only saddens me at how little she appears in the whole anime, coming in near the end of it. Her insane personality was a breath of fresh air and seeing her kick Chitose\'s ass was so gratifying. And her backstory was strangely hilarious. She made me laugh more than the entire anime did and I even had one instance where I had to catch my breath from how funny she was. I\'d say she alone makes up the entire half of my overall score, though Takao could contribute a bit to that as well.We need more characters like Tama in harems. Her vibes, personality and treatment of the male lead never felt too off to me and her design is such an eyecatch. She is the very first character I saw from D-Frag as well before seeing anyone else and I remember asking what anime she was from at one point, but it was surprising to see her here. I had assumed she hailed from another anime and didn\'t think she would be allocated to a minor character that serves to fill in the final arc, so I was admittedly a strange mix of happy and sad when I saw her in D-Frag. Perhaps, moreso happy due to her lifting my drooped spirits.My writing here was stale since I wrote the review late and have since forgotten most of what the anime is, but my suggestion is to only watch D-Frag if you\'re used to the ""innocent character gets mistreated"" trope in anime. Or, if you just watch harems a lot in general, since you\'re used to that by default then. I won\'t say it\'s a bad anime since it\'s appealing to those crowds, but for my tastes, I disliked it a lot. Only watched it because it was brought to my attention a lot and the characters came off as likable at first glance.Only pleasant surprise I got was finding out that Tama was from this anime and I genuinely believe I may have given it a lower score if she was not in it. She felt like a breakout character and only appeared in its final episodes. If D-Frag gets a second season and she\'s confirmed to be one of the main characters, I\'d stomach through its humor again just to watch more of her. the male lead by the end of it.

However, I ended up loving it. Simple reason is the characters are, for the most part, really likable. Throw that in with this style of comedy and ""storytelling,"" and you have a great show. I realize that when you look at my animelist, I\'m very lenient in scoring, so again, take it how you will.Story: 7The story is told in a basic, linear fashion. The main casts gets a problem and they resolve it. Nothing groundbreaking. However, the main...appeal of this show isn\'t how great the conflict is. It\'s how silly they fix they fix their problems. And the comedy/silliness is definitely up to par with the heavy hitters of the comedy genre.Art: 6Nothing special. Run of the mill artworks and visuals. The characters are pretty typical. But like I said earlier, the appeal is in the humor.Characters: 8I loved the characters. The cast of ridiculous support characters give the straight man all the material needed for the classic joke setup. That being said the characters are pretty static meaning they don\'t really go through huge changes in their thought or actions, but again, not that kind of show. Also they are pretty typical as far as comedy anime characters go.Sound: 10The soundtrack is just average even considering it\'s a comedy. The high rating comes almost entirely from the voice actors/actresses. They really did a good job showing the emotions and portraying their characters to their personalities.Enjoyment: 10This is where the high rating comes from. From start to finish, I was laughing my head off. That\'s exactly how this type of show is supposed to be. It\'s not something you try to find reason for the dumb things they do. If you try that, you\'ll ruin every anime ever.Overall: 9All in all, this was a 9/10. Yes 9. A solid 9 at that. Why? Because it\'s just so fun to watch. It says 9 means ""Great,"" one step down from ""Masterpiece."" Is it comparable to the true masterpieces? Not even close. It\'s at least up there? Nope. It\'s not even in my own top 10.

An overused template in which the same tired jokes are made with the same cut and paste character personalities with varying levels of executional success. Maybe i\'m late to the party and the show had more relevance 2 years ago in winter of 2014, but a lot of the shows I intend to use for context still predate D-Frag by a couple years.Some classics which actually involve some story include shows like Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru from Spring 2013 and then there\'s the less narrative driven Sket Dance from Autumn...2012 which focuses, much like this show does, on slapstick humour to pull its audience. Though there is some continuity to SD still as there are some minor character developments. These two shows focused on ""self-help"" related club groups whilst other popular gimmicks include paranormal and occult based research clubs which mix in a little ""magic"" to power the inevitable troubling situations. Or anime/manga clubs which often deal with career building and legitimising art as a valid career option.So from the very beginning the show is nothing unique, original or special. But that\'s not to say a show that isn\'t any of these things cannot be enjoyed. But without tension or pacing or any semblance of a narrative that one can follow it\'s literally just the bare bones slapstick you can find anywhere else.A barely average animation quality also doesn\'t help the show, unfortunately  aesthetics are just as important in pulling and hooking an audience, a decent animation is just generally a pleasure to watch for its own sake. This show\'s animation is OK. Neither bad nor note worthy.Just like the jokes, the characters are mostly cut and paste personality types. The over bearing god like female president type, the lazy enabling blase sensei, the moe, the sporty girl (who for some reason is always a red head), the female obsessed with gays or cross dressers (the female pervert), the massive guy who\'s passive, the walking contradiction of a MC who\'s simultaneously strong willed but also submissive, i could go on. Basically you\'ve seen it all before.The show itself is fine and if you\'re looking to waste an evening I would say you could do better. But if you genuinely can\'t think of anything else then i guess, sure, i wont tell you not to watch this. 2012 which focuses, much like this show does, on slapstick humour to pull its audience.

But I must confess that I\'m wearying of it.Normally I write a lot in my reviews, but there isn\'t anything to write about. The plot is so contrived, that the actions of a single character done differently would topple the whole show. That action is, if Kazama Kenji fails to be drawn into the lunacy of the four female protagonists; their fun ends, and the story comes to a screeching halt. All he has to...do is walk and keep going, and if they won\'t let him; he can actually prove to the World how much of a delinquent he says he is, and punch any one of the girls so hard her nose breaks.The only decently funny bit in the whole show is when the Student Body President, Karasuyama Chitose, drops a hall locker on one of the characters. The behavior, lead up, and execution is priceless.But it\'s not enough to save a fatally flawed show; full of sight-gags, false leads, innuendoes with illogical/irrational consequences, intentional dead-ends, timing mistakes, inopportune dialog, and senseless breaches of etiquette with nothing to show for it but hurt feelings for everybody the viewer does NOT care about.And then the writers have the effrontery to believe that the principles of ""write bad jokes, rinse, repeat"" is the proper way to do inane humor. As if inane humor was ever worthwhile.In other words, it\'s a training course for teenagers that wish to become so enraptured by irrational thinking that they find themselves in a mental ward as a consequence of believing the World is a purple marble with a pretty green sky. And let\'s not get me involved with that obvious tagging mistake with Jay Ward; who was another crazy genius, but his humor was actually funny.On the other hand, some people want to be institutionalized, as a means of finding three-squares and a warm-sack without working for it. I for one, wish the creators of D-Frag! would change the volume on their IV-drip, and change the channel of video running around in their head. We might get some improvement.And all this in D-Frag!, to sell a picture card game, something that is quite popular in Japan. We know that because the editorial content in the credits tell the viewer to keep an eye on the special scene to get points for the next round of his card game.The artwork is quite good, but not over the top. The sound is good, and the voice actors do a passible good job. I gave this a 6.I think my job here is overdone, dry and tasteless.

female characters and yet it isn't a Harem or a Romance well maybe a little, instead it concentrates on comedy and because of that it turned to be one hilarious anime.The story begins with kenji Kazama who is your usual delinquent student yet somehow his gang encounters a group of unusual girls who end up forcing Kenji to join their club and from then on Kenji's life would become absolute hell.The story is relatively simple really as it shows a male student struggling to get along...with a bunch of weird girls who all imagine they have elemental powers and it was really funny and entertaining seeing Kenji going through a lot of trouble over simple matters with the girls and for a group of likeable female characters the girls in the Game Creation Club (Provisional) are somehow people you don't want to stick up for which was funny because when other people who came along to try and destroy the club you actually wanted the enemy team to win because the girls in the GCC (P) are an evil bunch trust me don't let they're good looks fool you as they will use whatever's necessary to beat their opponents.What I also liked from the story is how it went about because usually these kind of shows have a beach, pool, spa or some kind of cliched fanservice episode and surprisingly enough there wasn't one here which I have to give credit for, so instead the story consists of multiple competitions, some fighting with gangs and other clubs and a whole lot of arguing, but the arguments were absolutely funny especially with the jokes that came out of the arguments.I also liked how it had these little sections at the end of most episodes that show what other characters are doing during the show and added more to the hilarious factor, but also added a little bit of backstory or exposition and the way the anime ended literally begs for a season 2 to happen I mean after everything that has happened I would definitely be down for a second season.Now the characters are a really entertaining bunch and are always having arguments over some petty subject.Kenji Kazama is the male MC and he is part of the Kazama gang, he is a very short-tempered person which makes sense since he has to put up with the girls antics almost everyday, but he is a thoughtful person at times often making sure that people don't get hurt however he is also very competitive and will make sure that nobody will stop him from achieving his goal.The girls of the GCC (P) consist of Roka Shibasaki, Chitose Karasuyama and Sakura Mizukami, each of these girls imagine they have an elemental power and do go a little far with actually using the elemental power like for real Chitose will throw dirt in people's face's, Sakura will splash you with her water and Roka will control you with her dark power which is basically putting a bag over you're head, but their personalities do differ as Roka does have a very cute persona, but if you disagree with her she'll go almost to the point of Yandere or major Tsundere, Chitose is pretty much a Tsundere often picking on Kenji and giving him nicknames that annoy him, but she does care for her other club members and is willing to fight till the end for them and Sakura is the most positive and energetic of the group, she can be pretty sly too often out manoeuvring or out thinking people when they say or do something to her, for a group of likeable characters though I never really supported them in their endeavours because they felt like people who would be your friends, but would never respect or treat you right.Takao is another MC and she is the club leader of the original Games Creation Club so she has a petty rivalry with Roka, but her reasons for trying to shut down Roka's club isn't out of hatred and more out of sadness that she lost a friend though after their competition against each other they do get along more, Takao is probably the most normal girl in the series considering the other characters and she may whine from time to time, but she has a good heart and has a strong passion for gaming.Minami Oosawa is the GCC (P) advisor and she really doesn't do a whole lot since when she gets there she immediately falls asleep hence why her tone of voice is very mellow, she also considers herself a lighting elemental in the club which consists of her carrying a stun gun for protection.Tama Sakai is the ex-student council president and another person who tries to destroy the GCC (P) which is also mainly due to her history with Roka and Chitose since they have been battling each other since they were little kids, despite probably being as evil as Roka and Chitose she is actually very laid back and likes to make jokes which is why I thought she was actually a more likeable character than those two which was pretty funny.The artstyle was nothing special, but I really liked a lot of the reactions the characters made and their expressions were just great too which worked really well for the comedic moments and it did use the chibi format a lot often switching from normal and Chibi especially for Roka who was probably in Chibi form more than her normal form well it definitely made the characters more adorable.The comedy was absolutely brilliant I was laughing my ass off almost every episode and a lot of the jokes were just gold especially since they were mainly aimed towards either Kenji or Takao, but the arguments that the characters had with each other were really funny to watch too usually these kind of things annoy me, but in this anime these moments were so good especially during one episode where half of an episode was just dedicated to Kenji and Takao trying to not play the girls game.Looking at the game aspect of the show it was actually fun seeing what kind of ridiculous games the club could come up with and the fact that they made a big tournament just so that they can win one of Roka's bag's was just stupid, but really funny along with the other competitions that involved the club fighting for survival on multiple occasions and because of these instances especially the final one you'd think where the hell the teachers are.There are also some romantic elements here and there especially between Kenji, Takao and Roka though Kenji and Roka's relationship is more of a friendly rivalry really whereas with Kenji and Takao there is some proper scenes that show the connection between and that they are more similar than they think which for me and anyone else who likes this ship does produce some nice moments between them.Overall this was a very fun and enjoyable anime even if it doesn't have a strong story because what really matters here is the characters and the chemistry between so I'd definitely recommend this if anyone is looking for a good anime to laugh at. with a bunch of weird girls who all imagine they have elemental powers and it was really funny and entertaining seeing Kenji going through a lot of trouble over simple

whole lot of arguing, but the arguments were absolutely funny especially with the jokes that came out of the arguments.I also liked how it had these little sections at the end of most episodes that show what other characters are doing during the show and added more to the hilarious factor, but also added a little bit of backstory or exposition and the way the anime ended literally begs for a season 2 to happen I mean after everything that has happened I would definitely be down for a second season.Now the characters are a really entertaining bunch and are always having arguments over some petty subject.Kenji Kazama is the male MC and he is part of the Kazama gang, he is a very short-tempered person which makes sense since he has to put up with the girls antics almost everyday, but he is a thoughtful person at times often making sure that people don't get hurt however he is also very competitive and will make sure that nobody will stop him from achieving his goal.The girls of the GCC (P) consist of Roka Shibasaki, Chitose Karasuyama and Sakura Mizukami, each of these girls imagine they have an elemental power and do go a little far with actually using the elemental power like for real Chitose will throw dirt in people's face's, Sakura will splash you with her water and Roka will control you with her dark power which is basically putting a bag over you're head, but their personalities do differ as Roka does have a very cute persona, but if you disagree with her she'll go almost to the point of Yandere or major Tsundere, Chitose is pretty much a Tsundere often picking on Kenji and giving him nicknames that annoy him, but she does care for her other club members and is willing to fight till the end for them and Sakura is the most positive and energetic of the group, she can be pretty sly too often out manoeuvring or out thinking people when they say or do something to her, for a group of likeable characters though I never really supported them in their endeavours because they felt like people who would be your friends, but would never respect or treat you right.Takao is another MC and she is the club leader of the original Games Creation Club so she has a petty rivalry with Roka, but her reasons for trying to shut down Roka's club isn't out of hatred and more out of sadness that she lost a friend though after their competition against each other they do get along more, Takao is probably the most normal girl in the series considering the other characters and she may whine from time to time, but she has a good heart and has a strong passion for gaming.Minami Oosawa is the GCC (P) advisor and she really doesn't do a whole lot since when she gets there she immediately falls asleep hence why her tone of voice is very mellow, she also considers herself a lighting elemental in the club which consists of her carrying a stun gun for protection.Tama Sakai is the ex-student council president and another person who tries to destroy the GCC (P) which is also mainly due to her history with Roka and Chitose since they have been battling each other since they were little kids, despite probably being as evil as Roka and Chitose she is actually very laid back and likes to make jokes which is why I thought she was actually a more likeable character than those two which was pretty funny.The artstyle was nothing special, but I really liked a lot of the reactions the characters made and their expressions were just great too which worked really well for the comedic moments and it did use the chibi format a lot often switching from normal and Chibi especially for Roka who was probably in Chibi form more than her normal form well it definitely made the characters more adorable.The comedy was absolutely brilliant I was laughing my ass off almost every episode and a lot of the jokes were just gold especially since they were mainly aimed towards either Kenji or Takao, but the arguments that the characters had with each other were really funny to watch too usually these kind of things annoy me, but in this anime these moments were so good especially during one episode where half of an episode was just dedicated to Kenji and Takao trying to not play the girls game.Looking at the game aspect of the show it was actually fun seeing what kind of ridiculous games the club could come up with and the fact that they made a big tournament just so that they can win one of Roka's bag's was just stupid, but really funny along with the other competitions that involved the club fighting for survival on multiple occasions and because of these instances especially the final one you'd think where the hell the teachers are.There are also some romantic elements here and there especially between Kenji, Takao and Roka though Kenji and Roka's relationship is more of a friendly rivalry really whereas with Kenji and Takao there is some proper scenes that show the connection between and that they are more similar than they think which for me and anyone else who likes this ship does produce some nice moments between them.Overall this was a very fun and enjoyable anime even if it doesn't have a strong story because what really matters here is the characters and the chemistry between so I'd definitely recommend this if anyone is looking for a good anime to laugh at."", ""D-Frag is the sort of show that comes to mind when I think of simple, dumb, fun humor. There really isn't a lot to this series... A 'delinquent' (whose gang is actually going around trying to keep the peace around the school) gets... blackmailed, basically into joining the Game Creation Club... where each member is their own brand of eccentric, very few games actually get created, and the least responsible member is actually the teacher advisor. Things are complicated ever so slightly when he learns there's a second game creation club in the school, in a rivalry of sorts with this one, trying to get...Kazama's new club shut down.Thus leads to day after day of one nonsensical competition after another, where nothing is ever really accomplished, but each little adventure allows Kazama to get a little closer to his clubmates. It was a lot of fun, made me laugh a lot, and could be a little sweet at times.D-Frag just makes no effort to try and go above and beyond... in any aspect. The characters were likable enough, but no one was terribly deep. I liked the little moments Roka got where she talked about feeling a responsibility to her club, wanting to do right by them. She's never really fit in anywhere before, so that was a little moving. I really liked Chitose's loyalty to her best friend. And some of the other characters made me laugh just about every time they were on screen. So make no mistake: D-Frag was a good time.But there are just so many places they COULD have taken this story, so it frustrates me that there was no attempt at a bigger plotline. There are so many things that could have been done with this club setting... The kids seem to care more about the fact that there are two game creation clubs than the teachers do. There was a little pressure in the beginning, as Kazama's group needed him as their last member or else they were going to be shut down... But once that requirement was fulfilled, nothing else was really asked of them. (And the love story doesn't really go anywhere.)  Some sort of club challenge aside, they could have gone the friendship route. It's clear that what Takao really misses is Roka's friendship, not real club dominance. But nothing is really resolved between Takao and Roka either.So yes, D-Frag was fun... but felt a little half-baked. It really wouldn't have been that hard to make it into something more.

Unfortunately I think there were some stumbles in this series that make it fall short of that.It’s still quite good, but I think there was overall too large a focus on the girls in the Game Development Club and more specifically only 1-2 at a time rather than using the whole cast and their low and different personalities to craft really good jokes and short stories.So many characters...I would hope to see every episode just kind of get largely ignored for a still serviceable main story for the episode or series, but it’s not what I wanted or expected for the show.Comedy is still pretty solid but I think it relies too heavily on this romance stuff for a main character that feels like he has less time than 2-3 of the girls of the show.Again not a bad series, did not regret checking it out, but I think it could have done a lot more with its cast and even its premise.

The animation, story and music are average for any generic anime of this style. However, my biggest problem is with COMEDY which is almost NON-EXISTING in my understanding.the reason is because there is a difference between an absurd comedy and ABSURD SCENES without any kind of grace and it is in this last category that ""D-frag"" falls. Therefore, I would only recommend this if you do not have any good comedy pending to see, such as Gintama,...asobi asobase, Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei, Joshikousei no Mudazukai, Nichijou, Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro, among others. asobi asobase, Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei, Joshikousei no Mudazukai, Nichijou, Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro, among others.', 'So... I got into D-Frag without reading the manga with basically no expectations. It started off slowly and after 3/12 episodes you wouldn\'t know what it was about.It\'s pretty much unpredictable at times and sort of predictable at others. Quite some jokes are actually funny. The bad ones don\'t stick around. I was actually surprised how they ""use"" characters. It feels like the characters are just a tool to make the jokes work. Atleast this goes for the supporting ones.This becomes apperent because the anime only has 12 episodes. Not all characters can develop in this amount of time. It feels like I\'m watching ""the...best of"" D-Frag manga (I could be wrong since I haven\'t actually read it).Although the start was messy and there was no real connections between the episodes at the start it got better after a couple of episodes, story and enjoymentwise (although it doesn\'t have a story so I guess connectivity/appealingwise). Due to this I changed the score from an initial 6 to a 7 while the series probably has a higher potential.In short, if you\'re looking for a story this isn\'t something you\'d watch.

Not that I expected D-Frag! to actually be about game development in any shape or form (which an anime about that sounds about as entertaining as watching an apple brown), but D-Frag! seemed so uninterested in its own premise, it barely does anything unique with its loosely established concept and settle on being a rather generic run-of-the-mill shonen comedy that\'s way too loud while also bringing anything remotely new or charming to the table to muster more than a small handful of laughs over 12 episodes....STORY: So stop me if you\'ve heard this before in a situational comedy; a self-proclaimed high school delinquent befriends weirdos and develops a begrudging bond with them, and together they must work to keep their school club from being shut down. I\'d say D-Frag\'s premise could be written on a Culver\'s napkin, but that would imply someone took the effort of writing it down. The ""writing"" ""staff"" (I\'m putting staff in quotes, because that would imply a team with moderately qualifying credentials sat around and brainstormed, of which I\'m skeptical) merely copy/pasted a formula that\'s been beaten to death since 2003. This was about as written as finding someone\'s crumpled up notes from your social studies class in the garbage. If school club related premises are the backbone of modern anime and manga comedies, then this genre\'s spine is riddled with an untreatable case of osteoporosis. And the ""game development"" aspect of D-Frag! is virtually unexplored. With the exception of some meager retro interactive electronic and table top game references littered about, it bypasses addressing it. Given the universal resurgence of table top gaming in the last 8 years (maybe it\'s different in Japan), this was a missed opportunity. The Game Development Provisional Club could\'ve implemented more emphasis on poking jokes at deck builders, or multiplayer co-op board games, using those as a metaphor or morality lesson at the end of episodes, or even a chance for slapstick. But it foregoes these in favor of placing emphasis on Takao\'s ridiculously gigantic breasts and misinterpreting characters yelling at each other as jokes. SCORE 4.7ART: D-Frag is colorful, but nothing that makes it stand out in any particular fashion. Even the animation does little to accentuate whatever physical or visual humor they\'re attempting to get over. I\'ve seen it all before. Blank white eyes, Beam of Enlightenment, Blank Face of Shame, Cross-popping veins, nose bleeds, cross-dressing trap characters...every single anime trope is in D-Frag. I can\'t laugh at things I\'ve seen for 17 years. It isn\'t that tropes are bad, but how and why you utilize them are more important than just simply doing it.The character designs are alright, you can guess their personalities upon just LOOKING at them. For a comedy show, that isn\'t a bad thing. Kenji Kazama looks like every other turf-headed, orange, gruff protagonist. If you threw a black cloak on him, he\'d be Ichigo Kurosaki. Goofy large breasts aside, Takao is my vote for the best design. She has a more unique hairstyle (accentuated by the red ribbon, which helps her stand out) and a cuter face than any other female in the cast. The rest of the characters are a marginal amalgamation of seemingly rejected School Rumble designs.The backgrounds, like most modern anime, use a pointless amount of distractingly average computer animation, like more than one occasion there\'s just an establishing shot of things like a CGI hallway or playing cards. Again, just because you CAN do it doesn\'t mean you should. SCORE 7.3SOUND & VOICE: I\'m reviewing Funimation\'s English dub. All things considered, it\'s not a BAD dub, but as mentioned before, all the characters are screaming at the top of their lungs seemingly all the time and it gets rather taxing and repetitive to listen to. The Japanese dub is actually slightly more grating, so I just switched it back over. Some of the funnier lines are actually the low key moments from Austin Tindle\'s Kazama rather than his yelling. If you like English dubs (all 38.5 people on the planet), you may get some laughs out of the delivery of some lines, and Patrick Seitz is fairly entertaining as jock Odawara. I thought the funniest line was the very last one before the credits when their supervisor/teacher Oosawa told them they were all suspended for their gambling phone contest stunt. That was brilliant. SCORE 5.8CHARACTERS: Maybe it\'s because I\'m a very cynical and nihilistic person regarding modern anime (I try to look at the glass as half full), but I feel like I\'m missing something here. In a show as rambunctious and off the wall it pretends to be, D-Frag! has a surprisingly forgettable cast of characters. With the exception of Takao and Tama, the latter who shows up for the final arc, the motley crew is a mish-mash of templates and archetypes that try in exaggerated methods to seem dynamic, only come off looking rather generic. Kazama has two childhood friends who are featured fairly regularly, but I forget their existence. Sometimes it\'s a meta callback when Odawara returns and he\'s not remembered, but the aforementioned teacher Oosawa, whose gimmick is she sleeps and carries a taser (lightning type) is virtually useless after the first episode. Takao and Roka have this Ryoko/Ayeka-like rivalry for Kazama\'s attention, which is the only takeaway from D-Frag! I\'d say is genuinely amusing. Other than that, the setup for this series\' ONE joke is the same; someone speaks nonsense, Kazama gets annoyed and yells at someone. SCORE 6.2OVERALL: D-Frag! wouldn\'t suddenly become better or worse if it dropped its gaming premise. Like Dagashi Kashi (another ""why bother"" comedy) I think you need a little more defined reason for existing, other than weirdness for weirdness\' sake. I reviewed Tonari no Seki-kun and those 4 minute shorts manage to properly convey its humor in greater success than all of the rambling these girls do in D-Frag! throughout its 22 minutes. I\'ve said it many times, these hack anime and manga writers need to watch/read older titles like Tenchi Universe, Here Is Greenwood, Slayers, and Dragon Half and take some inspiration on how to effectively set up gags. Even if they are repetitious, change the delivery. Because offerings like D-Frag! is just the mediocre sludge that\'s a big part of the problem.FINAL SCORE: 6.1/10PROS: Decent art. Serviceable English dub.CONS: Way too generic, despite potential in premise. Obnoxiously loud, one-dimensional humor. Bland characters.

The Game Development Provisional Club could\'ve implemented more emphasis on poking jokes at deck builders, or multiplayer co-op board games, using those as a metaphor or morality lesson at the end of episodes, or even a chance for slapstick. But it foregoes these in favor of placing emphasis on Takao\'s ridiculously gigantic breasts and misinterpreting characters yelling at each other as jokes. SCORE 4.7ART: D-Frag is colorful, but nothing that makes it stand out in any particular fashion. Even the animation does little to accentuate whatever physical or visual humor they\'re attempting to get over. I\'ve seen it all before. Blank white eyes, Beam of Enlightenment, Blank Face of Shame, Cross-popping veins, nose bleeds, cross-dressing trap characters...every single anime trope is in D-Frag. I can\'t laugh at things I\'ve seen for 17 years. It isn\'t that tropes are bad, but how and why you utilize them are more important than just simply doing it.The character designs are alright, you can guess their personalities upon just LOOKING at them. For a comedy show, that isn\'t a bad thing. Kenji Kazama looks like every other turf-headed, orange, gruff protagonist. If you threw a black cloak on him, he\'d be Ichigo Kurosaki. Goofy large breasts aside, Takao is my vote for the best design. She has a more unique hairstyle (accentuated by the red ribbon, which helps her stand out) and a cuter face than any other female in the cast. The rest of the characters are a marginal amalgamation of seemingly rejected School Rumble designs.The backgrounds, like most modern anime, use a pointless amount of distractingly average computer animation, like more than one occasion there\'s just an establishing shot of things like a CGI hallway or playing cards. Again, just because you CAN do it doesn\'t mean you should. SCORE 7.3SOUND & VOICE: I\'m reviewing Funimation\'s English dub. All things considered, it\'s not a BAD dub, but as mentioned before, all the characters are screaming at the top of their lungs seemingly all the time and it gets rather taxing and repetitive to listen to. The Japanese dub is actually slightly more grating, so I just switched it back over. Some of the funnier lines are actually the low key moments from Austin Tindle\'s Kazama rather than his yelling. If you like English dubs (all 38.5 people on the planet), you may get some laughs out of the delivery of some lines, and Patrick Seitz is fairly entertaining as jock Odawara. I thought the funniest line was the very last one before the credits when their supervisor/teacher Oosawa told them they were all suspended for their gambling phone contest stunt. That was brilliant. SCORE 5.8CHARACTERS: Maybe it\'s because I\'m a very cynical and nihilistic person regarding modern anime (I try to look at the glass as half full), but I feel like I\'m missing something here. In a show as rambunctious and off the wall it pretends to be, D-Frag! has a surprisingly forgettable cast of characters. With the exception of Takao and Tama, the latter who shows up for the final arc, the motley crew is a mish-mash of templates and archetypes that try in exaggerated methods to seem dynamic, only come off looking rather generic. Kazama has two childhood friends who are featured fairly regularly, but I forget their existence. Sometimes it\'s a meta callback when Odawara returns and he\'s not remembered, but the aforementioned teacher Oosawa, whose gimmick is she sleeps and carries a taser (lightning type) is virtually useless after the first episode. Takao and Roka have this Ryoko/Ayeka-like rivalry for Kazama\'s attention, which is the only takeaway from D-Frag! I\'d say is genuinely amusing. Other than that, the setup for this series\' ONE joke is the same; someone speaks nonsense, Kazama gets annoyed and yells at someone. SCORE 6.2OVERALL: D-Frag! wouldn\'t suddenly become better or worse if it dropped its gaming premise. Like Dagashi Kashi (another ""why bother"" comedy) I think you need a little more defined reason for existing, other than weirdness for weirdness\' sake. I reviewed Tonari no Seki-kun and those 4 minute shorts manage to properly convey its humor in greater success than all of the rambling these girls do in D-Frag! throughout its 22 minutes. I\'ve said it many times, these hack anime and manga writers need to watch/read older titles like Tenchi Universe, Here Is Greenwood, Slayers, and Dragon Half and take some inspiration on how to effectively set up gags. Even if they are repetitious, change the delivery. Because offerings like D-Frag! is just the mediocre sludge that\'s a big part of the problem.FINAL SCORE: 6.1/10PROS: Decent art. Serviceable English dub.CONS: Way too generic, despite potential in premise. Obnoxiously loud, one-dimensional humor. Bland characters.', 'spoilers:My reviews almost never has spoilers but I always get in trouble for it.  So I am just going to say what this anime feels to me, how I enjoy it, how the characters are and how it could haven been improve without spoilers Ill try not to.This  anime feels like your typical harem anime there is no tag but this is a harem.  The girls fall in love with the male MC which seem to be on sight.  To give credit to the anime it does say the MC is good looking(i don\'t know if he is...it\'s a drawing), so the girls might like him for that shallow reason which makes more sense than other harem.  If you seen Gamers!, Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo, Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta and Ben-To you seen this before they do nothing new they reused old jokes you heard in other anime, the same boob grab, boob joke, girl getting nose bleed over a guy in a dress it been done some have done it better.My enjoyment of this anime was up then down. The first 1-4 episodes, felt like a tired old harem but they had new jokes made me laugh.  Then they started building up the romance/harem in the latter episodes if you can tell this anime has no romance or harem tag because they can\'t do that right, then it turns to a lame fighting anime that is why i compare it Ben-To.  So I stop enjoy it and started hating it.The characters did not make it any better, the tired old oblivious male MC made me mad not because he is oblivious because he is the character that SHOUT OUT the peculiarity of the situation they get in.  Nothing is more queer than him being oblivious to all the girls liking him and all the other guys getting punch, kick, spit on and be emasculated.  He does a lot of shouting I guess the author ran out of jokes thought that would be funny, it wasn\'t but if he was more like Bakugou that make would him better and funnier. The girls character are generic, they like the mc, there is a short girl, tall girl, girl with big boobs and people want to grab her boobs.  In the first episode he has two male delinquent friends which I wish the stay around because then it would add a new element to the story(speaking of Kono Oto Tomare! better anime the delinquent friends also join the koto club).How could it be better in my opinion, have the other delinquents join the club too.  It\'s rarely been done ""Kono Oto Tomare!"" did it and they have a higher rating, can\'t name another anime that did it too, people want to see something new.  Have the MC not be oblivious or be like Bokugo and wants to fight everyone even the girls and girls would still like him would be alarming but funny(someone will steal my idea).  Or at least have a clear direction to where you wanted to go and what this show was going to be.  If it was going to be a love story be one or was it going to be a harem go full out and be one.  This anime has a game and school tag but no way this is a game anime the games are in the background and they do more fist fight than play a games(reason i compare this to Ben-to), there is a school in the anime but no way it is a anime about school life.

My scores for D-frag are kind of all over the place, but I think by the end of this review you\'ll come to realize why I gave it an 8 overall.Story: 5, Look at the genre tags , Game, Comedy, School, and Seinen. Seinen is practically just a target audience tag, whereas Game and School are mainly setting based tags, which leads you with one conclusion, and an accurate conclusion at that: D-frag is a pure comedy anime. Let\'s face it, pure comedy anime aren\'t known for having deep, intricate stories that...captivate your heart and make you rethink life, no, they\'re meant to be enjoyed and have to give you your own fair share of laughing fits. Thus, while there isn\'t really a story going on here, my score of a 5 in story doesn\'t really matter, because that\'s not why you watch D-frag, and if you go into any anime expecting it to be something its not, you would obviously be disappointed. The comedy on the other hand I would rate an 8, and since pure comedies are more than capable of surviving without a strong story, if you would consider this grading criteria to be Comedy instead of Story, then I\'m sure an 8 overall score makes a bit more sense.Art: 7, My biggest thing when grading art is always, ""Does the quality stay consistent?"" and I can promptly say, ""No"" to this question, however, the majority of the inconsistency is done for comedic effect which actually gains points in my book. Although, the key word in that previous sentence was ""majority"" there were multiple instances when I noticed less than elegant animation for no purpose other than attempts to save money, I can only presume. Regardless, the quality is pretty standard and decently consistent, thus a 7.Sound: 9, I had a really hard time not giving a 10. The VAs (of the English dub) all did amazing work, and really helped to capture the charm of every character. Both the OP and ED, definitely aren\'t going on any Top Ten OP/ED lists, but they both fit the show excellently, so I can\'t really dock any points there. Honestly, most of the OSTs helped to enhance the scenes, but they just felt kind of generic, and are what held me back from handing out a 10.Character: 7, Theres not a lot of character development, so this score might seem kind of generous, but hear me out. This is a pure comedy, which needs strong characters to survive, but at the same time, pure comedies don\'t leave a lot of room for character development, and thus, I can\'t give it a high score in character, simply because the lack of actual character development. On the other hand, every character, and when I say every, I mean every, feels incredibly well defined, and for the most part, they end up making an incredible likable cast. They don\'t all have the most depth to them, but for a pure comedy, they really work well together to make you laugh.Enjoyment: 9, It\'s ridiculous, it\'s goofy, but most of all, D-frag is a good time. Its not anything that left me rolling on the floor in tears from laughter, but it was definitely worth the couple of hours it took me to binge this. If I\'m disappointed about anything, then I\'d have to say, I\'m most disappointed that it\'s over. The characters really made it worth it, and I can\'t say I\'d mind rewatching this in a year or so.Overall: 8, So hopefully by this point you\'ve come to understand why I gave D-frag an 8. I wouldn\'t go off and say that it\'s the best thing since sliced bread, but I can say this much, if you\'re a fan of anime in general and you\'re looking for a good comedy to enjoy, then D-frag is definitely right for you.

I believe D-Frag has a mantra that reads ‘If we put one-hundred small jokes in a 24-minute period, then logic dictates that some of...them have to stick.’ Most of the jokes involve lead character Kazuma shouting at the girls, which gets annoying after a while, but there's not really a single episode that isn't funny.While appearing like 'just another comedy', D-Frag manages to play on stereotypes while also establishing its own brand of wacky high-schoolers.

Fantastic Children,https://myanimelist.net/anime/455/Fantastic_Children,"[""Story:The beginning of the story is part mystery and part adventure, focusing on a group of half a dozen white haired kids making an appearance through out centuries seemingly without aging and the other time focusing on a kid called Thoma who meets some anti-social girl called Helga and a energetic boy called Chitto. I admit the story was a bit underwhelming at first but once the story unfolds in later episode, you'll be hooked straight away, it turns into something quite epic and unique, there's so many twist and turns and you'd just watch episode after episode and without even noticing it's already over.Animation:The...art style can be a bit of a turn off for some people, they might even think this is a kids show but fear not this is quite mature even if the first few episodes are light-hearted they're nothing compared to what happens next.Anyway, as you get used to the art, it becomes more apparent that it's done quite well, lots of attractive looking backgrounds and pretty solid animations.Sound:The background music can really manipulate the emotions of certain scenes, they really help make pivotal moments in the story have more impact. The OP fit the series perfectly too bad I had to skip on occasion since I just really wanted to get on with the story, While the ED is sang by ORIGA the same singer who lent her voice for the majority of the GITS soundtrack.Character:How they made the connections with each character was great, most of the characters had a certain connection to the main plot, the importance of characters become unpredictable that you'd be shocked when the story finally reveals what their purpose are.

But don't be fooled by the simple character design or the title. This series is actually quite intense, with a memorable and complex plot and good storytelling that will draw older viewers waiting with bated breath for what happens next. It is definitely not a series just for children.The story revolves around a group of mysterious children who appear every once in a while throughout Europe. Who are they, where are they from, and why do they keep on reappearing? These are some of the questions that are being answered bit...by bit throughout the series. At the same time, the story also follows another group of children who have run away from the local orphanage, and are searching for a place they want to go. At first, it seems that these two main plots have nothing to do with each other, but at the middle of the series, the two plots converge, and the viewer discovers that they are closely connected after all.There are also a couple of sidestories with a few adults involving something almost supernatural. Although these sidestories seem off-track, they are related to the main plot in one way or another, and are tied together in the last few episodes.The plot is fairly complex and quite involved, but not to a point where it's confusing. The story is told in a way that it's pretty understandable if you pay attention to it. The story is full of surprises, twists, and secrets that will keep the viewer guessing and wondering what happens next.The tone of the series is mostly serious. But there is room for some bits of humour and lighthearted fun. There are also a few philosophical questions subtlely being looked at, such as what makes us who we are as humans, is it our souls or our current selves? In terms of love, there are many types being explored: romantic, family, friendships, unrequited, and broken.CHARACTERSEven though it doesn't look like it at first, each character is connected to one another in one way or another, and that connection is revealed piece by piece throughout the series.The Children of Belfort: This is the name given to seven mysterious white-haired, blue-eyed children who have appeared for 21 times in the last couple of centuries. They'd gather and run away from their homes when they turn 5, and never live past the age of 11. They search desperately for something before their time is up. The way they talk and act make them more like adults than children. At first, they seem cold and distant, and even perhaps malevonant. But as their stories and pasts are revealed, the viewer comes to feel compassion for them, and their mission. Each person has their own stories and own unique personalities that will touch the viewers' hearts.Dumas: The mysterious white-haired boy who appears a few times at the beginning of the series. Appearance-wise, he seems to be one of the Children of Belfort, but he doesn't seem to be working with them. Who he is and his background story will be revealed later in the series.Helga: She is an orphan who is kind, but seems to be always lonely. She keeps on drawing pictures of a mysterious place that she wants to go, and she would run away from the orphanage to search for the place in her memory. Her friend Chitto is determined to help her get there. At first she seems meek and timid and always in a daze, but as the series progresses, her inner strength is slowly unveiled.Thoma: He grew up around the Islands, and knows them well. He meets Chitto and Helga by chance, and is drawn to help Helga get to the place she wants to go. He is a determined young boy who is open and shows emotions easily. Little does he know, he's more closely connected to the Children of Belfort and Helga than he realises.Dr. Gherta: She is the director and doctor of the mysterious and suspicious organization Ged Group. A brilliant scientist, she's somewhat single-minded and almost obsessive with her project, which, for most of the series, is unclear and even almost malicious. But the viewer gradually sympathizes with her plight, especially towards the end when she has a few secrets of her own to unravel.Detective Cooks: A detective who has been investigating the disappearance of these children, he got interested in them because his grandfather was involved with the children during his lifetime, and Cooks became curious of his grandfather's findings. As more of a spectator, his sidestory gives the viewer some background information and history to the Children of Belfort.All of the characters are pretty human, and although they main characters are only children, the circumstances that they're involved in and how they react make them seem older, and thus even an older audience can relate to them. By the end of the series, the viewer is able to sympathize with all of the characters, even if at first they may seem unlikable or malicious.ARTThe character design and art style is certainly unique, though not the prettiest; in fact, the designs could be said to be boring and quite simple. The children are designed more or less short and a bit stubby, and not a lot of details is given in the eye or hair area. The clothing design is also a bit boring, though it has a country-style flavour to it. However, the expressions for the characters are mostly well-done.The background art is very beautiful, with lots of lush forests and unexplored islands. The setting has a sort of semi-tropical or Central/South American feel to it (the ruins of temples and statues remind me of the Aztec or Mayan ruins, but also has a sort of exotic island feel), or maybe with a dash of exotic Asian feeling too (with some of the statues looking a bit like Buddhist statues, and the colourful and busy marketplace of Middle East). The cities though, take on a more 19th century European flavour (even though the story is set in 2012), with cobble-stone streets and stocky buildings.In general, the art is just different, and may take some getting used to. Instead of following the latest trend of shiny backgrounds, brightly coloured and detailed character designs, this series is going against the grain by looking back to the style of the older animes. The general colour palette of the series is kind of dark, with mostly grays and greens and blues, with a lot of scenes taking place during storms or at night; it's not neccessarily drab, but it's certainly not brightly coloured. There are a few exceptions with the scenes taking place in the forest on the islands, where the colours are contrasted sharply with the darker scences, using lots of bright greens and yellows. But I think this lack of shiny backgrounds and special effects, and simple character design does add to the sadness and longing feeling of the story. And rather focusing on the character designs (and fanservice), the simple art makes the viewer able to pay more attention to the story and character development.VOICESThe voices for this series is okay. It doesn't really stand out anywhere, but it is mostly ear-pleasing and suitable for the characters. And most of the actors do a good enough job bringing out the emotions, especially towards the end, the viewers can almost feel the characters sorrow or joy.MUSICThe music is one of the strengths of this series. The opening song &quot;Voyage&quot; by Inori, is dramatic and uplifting, but also gentle and calming, a perfect opening for the series. It is also used as an insert song for one of the episodes, but with a slightly different arrangement, it's slower, with piano and cello in the background, and adds a sense of sadness to the scene. The ending song, &quot;Mizu no Madoromi&quot; by ORIGA (who sang both of GiTS openings) is sad and nostalgic, as if longing for something, and very fitting to the theme of the series. I would definately recommend getting the opening and ending singles (it's one of the best I've heard).The background music uses a combination of piano, cello, and a bit of flute. The theme for the Belfort Children is very memorable (with piano and cello), and a bit sad, like the fate of these children. The only downside is that this theme is a bit overused, being played in almost every episode. Helga's theme (which is mostly flute and cello) is also gentle and pretty, and suits her character well. The background music is mostly soft and sad, with a few upbeat songs for the tenser scenes. It uses raw traditional instrumental sounds rather then edited sound effects, which works well. And I'd recommend getting the OST &quot;Memory of Greecia&quot; as well.PRESENTATIONThe first half of the series takes place in the current world at the current time, mostly following the adventures of Helga, Thoma, and Chitto, as well as that of the Children of Belfort and the people around them. Then the next couple of episodes focus on the background story and history of the series. Then that last ten or so episodes brings the characters and sidestories from the beginning of the series and tie everything together.The pace may seem a bit slow for those who are used to action right away and in every episode. Many of the episodes are used to tell the story and advance the plot, or explain the history and background rather than pure action. And because of the complex plot and how everything is weaved together, some parts of the plot may take some time to develop. But I found it interesting enough that it's not a boring explaination, and it does help to understand the plot much better. And worry not, there are plenty of action interspersed throughout. Personally, I find the pace okay, it's just that there's so much to take in and explain that it takes time. I find the plot to be interesting, and not too confusing to understand, and it did leave me wanting to know more after every episode. And in the end, all of the questions that I wanted to ask have been answered, so I find the ending to be satisfying.Overall, it is an enjoyable series, and I'd recommend it. In fact, I think this series needs more love and attention. by bit throughout the series. At the same time, the story also follows another group of children who have run away from the local orphanage, and are searching for a place they want to go. At first, it seems that these two main plots have nothing to do with each other, but at the middle of the series, the two plots converge, and the viewer discovers that they are closely connected after all.There are also a couple of sidestories with a few adults involving something almost supernatural. Although these sidestories seem off-track, they are related to the main plot in one way or another, and are tied together in the last few episodes.The plot is fairly complex and quite involved, but not to a point where it's confusing. The story is told in a way that it's pretty understandable if you pay attention to it. The story is full of surprises, twists, and secrets that will keep the viewer guessing and wondering what happens next.The tone of the series is mostly serious. But there is room for some bits of humour and lighthearted fun. There are also a few philosophical questions subtlely being looked at, such as what makes us who we are as humans, is it our souls or our current selves? In terms of love, there are many types being explored: romantic, family, friendships, unrequited, and broken.CHARACTERSEven though it doesn't look like it at first, each character is connected to one another in one way or another, and that connection is revealed piece by piece throughout the series.The Children of Belfort: This is the name given to seven mysterious white-haired, blue-eyed children who have appeared for 21 times in the last couple of centuries. They'd gather and run away from their homes when they turn 5, and never live past the age of 11. They search desperately for something before their time is up. The way they talk and act make them more like adults than children. At first, they seem cold and distant, and even perhaps malevonant. But as their stories and pasts are revealed, the viewer comes to feel compassion for them, and their mission. Each person has their own stories and own unique personalities that will touch the viewers' hearts.Dumas: The mysterious white-haired boy who appears a few times at the beginning of the series.

In fact, I think this series needs more love and attention."", ""Things go pretty slowly for a while, but if you're watching and wondering if things eventually pick up, well, yes, they do, around ep. 11, and most of what happens is explained, although it's not really anything as complex and sophisticated as Stand Alone Complex and there are certainly a few loose ends and deus ex machinii. (Not as complex as Stand Alone Complex? Just call me Unrealistic Expectations Man.) Normally I drop a show 2 eps in if it doesn't catch my interest, but this is a favorite of one of my friends here, so I kept watching.What do I think? I think it...could have used a bigger animation budget and could have been cut down from 26 to 22 or even 20 episodes.Animation is kind of low budget. Fantastic Children looks and feels like it was made in the '80s. The color palette should have at least been more vibrant. I mean, sure, you have only so much money for your budget. But if you look at, say, Noir, or Requiem from the Darkness, they managed to have some interesting animation without spending a ton of money on it. What if everything looked like the paintings in the ED? OK, maybe that's impractical, but it's still possible to look interesting on a budget.There is way too much time spent on shots of people just standing around, or extended close-ups of people looking surprised. There are a few things where a situation is first explained, then shown. It would have been better if it had just been shown. And, in general, the pacing is just a bit too slow for me. It's not that I don't appreciate Mushishi or Kino's, but that's not the style of this series. You can almost but not quite just skip a couple of the early episodes. Just don't watch eps 1-10 when you feel like watching something where lots of stuff is happening.There are a few pretty silly things. The guys with hats, for example. It's also a bit disappointing how not all of the characters that a lot of time is spent with get to actually do much.Voice acting is good. (The characters get intense towards the end, which is tough to do.) Some of the music, like in the last parts of ep 18, is alright too. (Yes I like the ep 18 Russian version of the ED better. So sue me.) The ED is mizu no madoromi, sung by Origa, by the way. But why oh why did they have to have some of the characters try to sing?So is it worth watching? Does the ending deliver? Overall I'd give it a 7, which means worth watching but not worth buying, and I'd say it's better than  or  but worse than  or . The drama and action pick up continuously towards the end, so the second half is better than the first. If you haven't seen, say, Gankutsuou, I'd suggest watching that before this, but Fantastic Children isn't *bad* and I don't regret watching it. The characters aren't cardboard cutouts, and there's not anything else like that to make me *dislike* it. There are just better series out there. I guess I'd suggest watching it if you like puzzle series and Final Fantasy. Especially Final Fantasy. I'd say it reminds me most of El Hazard the Magnificent World, minus comedy and with somewhat better characters and somewhat slower paced and a bit less coherent and most importantly minus the awesomeness of cat-based armor technology.Well, I hope this review can help someone decide whether to watch Fantastic Children, but I somewhat doubt it. could have used a bigger animation budget and could have been cut down from 26 to 22 or even 20 episodes.Animation is kind of low budget.

I just finished it and I'm blown away. I haven't cried this hard at an anime since I was on the last episodes of Clannad After - FC hit strings I didn't even know I have. From the moment Gretha remembered she was Mel, to Helga and Duma's little bonding session - and Thoma, oh god, Thoma. Just - I was sobbing and still feel like crying when I think about it.Sakamoto Maaya as Mel was fantastic. This is the second time I've ever cried for a side character - the first time was Shiroe from Terra e, and even Shiroe was set...up as a main character for two episodes. Her voice brought so many feelings to life in her. I've never held her as the voice acting goddess her reputation holds her, but now suddenly I'm not sure anymore.But the biggest star in this anime was Junko Minagawa as Thoma. When Thoma started bawling, it was impossible not to be pulled in along with him. Crying is often annoying, agonized tearful screams mostly unremarkable after a few hundred anime, but that - that-...The theme songs, those beautiful, heatwrenching theme-songs, they couldn't have chosen better ones. Having Aghi sing the ending in some of the episodes was also a stroke of genius - especially because he had no singing voice to speak of.Of course, this anime had bad sides too. Heaps of them. The directing was almost amateur and the script was somewhat cheesy. Unsurprisingly, the director wrote the script too, along with one other guy, and also unsurprisingly neither of them had anything remarkable on their resume - except for this.I was never sure what the series composition guys were for what exactly animation directors are for, but after watching this, I think I understand. This anime is their work alone. Checking their resumes on ANN, it becomes even more evident - only one of the three series composition guys doesn't have several good series listed; the other two, Hiroshi Fukutomi - storyboard on LoGH and Law of Ueki, and Katsumi Terahigashi, who worked on seven episodes of Durarara and several of Cardcaptor Sakura and Umineko (which again had script trouble). I want to say more here, but I don't know how to explain it - something about the series, something they must have done, because you can feel it strongly, saved it from the bad directing, and so well that you just stop caring about it and just enjoy.The script is salvaged by the excellent use of music. I'm planning to hunt down the OST after I write this, but it wasn't the music itself that did the trick (some parts of Kara no Kyoukai still bored me out despite Kajiura Yuki's score) - it was the use of the music; it underlined every single line spoken and made it jump out and grab you, pulling you in. In some places it was overpowering, reminiscent of .hack//SIGN, in others it was rather subtle, but it always felt perfect.Also, on the art: it's not perfect, but it's wonderfully haunting after it grows on you. Greecia is just plain beautiful. Still, it's not the best ever seen and the series could have benefited possibly from more budget here - to compensate, it has a definite character.I'm not sure whether I can even give the director points for the original story, since it's eerily reminiscent of Please Save My Earth. It lacked some of the dilemmas that made PSME worth reading, but, on the other hand, at least it handled the ones it had very well. I'm glad Soran wasn't an abusive ass, I'm glad Love Rival #1 for once wasn't a dick towards everyone and that his bottled up emotions erupted realistically, and furthermore I'm glad that they didn't spend much screentime angsting over the local Yamato Nadeshiko and made her have a personality beyond that. And it was sher genius to have Thoma not be [X], but [Y]. (Spoiler?)And nobody had tragic pasts beyond what the plot required them to! Ok, Soran did, for, like, half a minute.Fantastic Children is what I wanted Please Save My Earth to be, but I wasn't expecting that when I started watching (I was seriously expecting a vampire series), and it went above and beyond that.I gave this one of my rare (maybe not so much these days that I have an idea of what to seek out) 10 ratings.

In spite of its misgivings, it deserves it, in heaps."", 'A group of white-haired children in early 20th century Europe.  The discoverer of radioactivity.  A girl on a tropical island who draws pictures of alien landscapes.It\'s honestly very difficult to write a review for ""Fantastic Children.""  Firstly because it\'s a mystery, and if I go into too much detail, I might ruin the experience.  Secondly, because it really is one of the strangest series I\'ve seen.Humans are attracted to that something we can\'t quite reach.  That thing we don\'t know.  Somewhere, out there, is something.  We can almost taste it, and if we reach a little...further, or go around one more corner, we just might find it.  That\'s the best way I can describe the overall feeling this show gave me.  And if you like to be intrigued, strung along, and then have your heart wrung out, read on.This series is not so much about the story, or characters.  It\'s about moods and feelings.And it did an excellent job at that.  Even though the series has fairly mild themes, it did an unparalleled job at conveying strong moods and emotions.  For instance, it had some of the most successful horror I\'ve seen in an anime.  After all, which is scarier: some monster you see on TV, or a dark corner in your room, where you can\'t quite tell if something is hiding there?  It\'s those kinds of simple fears that this show plays on.  For the dark corner scene, and others like it, the tension would build for several minutes, until I was throughly convinced that something WAS hiding there, and wanted to scream, and wriggle away and hide my head.  And the ""monsters"" here are quivering shadows.  These simple black outlines really scared the heck out of me.But it\'s not a horror series.  It covers all sorts of things from hope, despair, love, longing, jealousy, resignation….so be ready to go with the emotional flow.I\'ll give an introductory synopsis, to show why it\'s difficult to explain the storyline:- A man calls the children of Befort ""Monsters.""- A boy in a city has a nightmare, and the next day he meets a group of white-haired, black-cloaked children.  They want him to go with them, but he says he\'s ""tired....""- These children go to a sanitorium, to meet with an old woman.  They are dismayed to find her dead.  One of their number is kidnapped by a white-haired boy with glasses.- An orphanage director punishes a girl by ripping up her drawings in front of her face.And that\'s just the first episode.  As the series progresses, the clues and befuddling facts build up higher and higher.Probably the thing that makes most people drop the series is: it takes a long time before any questions are answered.  We aren\'t told what the heck is going on until exactly halfway through the series.  Up till then, we are fed seemingly disconnected clues, and we fry our brains trying to figure out how they are related.  Past and present, science and myth, runaway children and journalists, detectives and orphans, stone cities and lush forests, a dying woman and a painting.  And why were all the children of Befort cast with obviously adult voices?If you like the series after the first few episodes, I encourage you to at least keep watching until the middle of the series.  Even if it feels like the story isn\'t progressing, and is going nowhere, just wait until then.  And if you aren\'t intrigued by the ""big reveal,"" you can go ahead and drop it.After I reached the midpoint, and everything was explained, the stakes were raised.  And things got into gear as the series careened onward to the conclusion.  Several times, things happened that emotionally tore me up.  But in a way that made me love the series even more.  The characters\' anguish was mine, and I wanted to scream with them.  I wanted to cry with them (and I sometimes did).   The ending was perfect for this story (be sure to watch the ""extra"" at the end, which helps resolve ""what happens after the ending"").What demographic is this series aimed at?  The simple character design and overall mild themes seem to imply it\'s targeted to young viewers.  (People are drawn very simply; faces are simple ovals, and the colors are very plain.)  However, the complex mystery and occasional strong tension and bloody violence imply it\'s meant for older viewers.  I guess you could call it a seinen, but only for lack of a better classification.I can\'t really remember the music.  I don\'t think it was bad, but it evidently wasn\'t very memorable.  (However, I LOVED the ending theme, ""Mizu no Madoromi,"" by Origa.)This rather unconventional series doesn\'t have the shiny things that a lot of people want in an anime: there\'s little violence, no comedy, very mild romance, simplistic art, slow-paced plot setup, and brain-rattling mystery.  But the emotional and mood factor were really incredible.  So if that sounds appealing, give it a try. further, or go around one more corner, we just might find it.  That\'s the best way I can describe the overall feeling this show gave me.  And if you like to be intrigued, strung along, and then have your heart wrung out, read on.This series is not so much about the story, or characters.  It\'s about moods and feelings.And it did an excellent job at that.  Even though the series has fairly mild themes, it did an unparalleled job at conveying strong moods and emotions.  For instance, it had some of the most successful horror I\'ve seen in an anime.  After all, which is scarier: some monster you see on TV, or a dark corner in your room, where you can\'t quite tell if something is hiding there?  It\'s those kinds of simple fears that this show plays on.  For the dark corner scene, and others like it, the tension would build for several minutes, until I was throughly convinced that something WAS hiding there, and wanted to scream, and wriggle away and hide my head.  And the ""monsters"" here are quivering shadows.  These simple black outlines really scared the heck out of me.But it\'s not a horror series.  It covers all sorts of things from hope, despair, love, longing, jealousy, resignation….so be ready to go with the emotional flow.I\'ll give an introductory synopsis, to show why it\'s difficult to explain the storyline:- A man calls the children of Befort ""Monsters.""- A boy in a city has a nightmare, and the next day he meets a group of white-haired, black-cloaked children.  They want him to go with them, but he says he\'s ""tired....""- These children go to a sanitorium, to meet with an old woman.  They are dismayed to find her dead.  One of their number is kidnapped by a white-haired boy with glasses.- An orphanage director punishes a girl by ripping up her drawings in front of her face.And that\'s just the first episode.  As the series progresses, the clues and befuddling facts build up higher and higher.Probably the thing that makes most people drop the series is: it takes a long time before any questions are answered.  We aren\'t told what the heck is going on until exactly halfway through the series.  Up till then, we are fed seemingly disconnected clues, and we fry our brains trying to figure out how they are related.  Past and present, science and myth, runaway children and journalists, detectives and orphans, stone cities and lush forests, a dying woman and a painting.  And why were all the children of Befort cast with obviously adult voices?If you like the series after the first few episodes, I encourage you to at least keep watching until the middle of the series.  Even if it feels like the story isn\'t progressing, and is going nowhere, just wait until then.  And if you aren\'t intrigued by the ""big reveal,"" you can go ahead and drop it.After I reached the midpoint, and everything was explained, the stakes were raised.  And things got into gear as the series careened onward to the conclusion.  Several times, things happened that emotionally tore me up.  But in a way that made me love the series even more.  The characters\' anguish was mine, and I wanted to scream with them.  I wanted to cry with them (and I sometimes did).

This is purely my thinking. Please do tell what do you think about it and do read this till the end because this is one of the greatest Anime I have ever seen.At first I neglected this Anime, as I saw in the middle and I quite didn&#039;t understand it. But when it was aired on Animax in January 2009, I was drawn towards it.As the story continues, it makes a connection with your heart. Although everything is explained in the series through scientific manner, but it still lacks a...few thing according to pure science. Although it is obvious but there are still many minor details that the writer seemed to have forgot. Atlthough it is showed as happy ending they forgot about the main part. The concequence. If you dare to violate such a law of nature, the nature won&#039;t forgive you.If you are wondering why a have dragged this so much, its mainly because of author&#039;s involvement. It isn&#039;t just for enjoyment. The ending in this was something I had never seen before. Althought it was a happy ending, it had tragedy far more than happiness. That I can&#039;t describe.&quot;If no one has written your favourite book, write it yourself&quot;, I heard this proverb somewhere. I am thinking about the future to this anime. I simply can&#039;t seem to accept the ending. Although the anime I come with, what would it be like, I have a small hunch but I will try to match the author&#039;s level of involvement in this.  It may take some time, but I will reveal it, because such masterpieces can never be allowed to die.Thanks for reading. few thing according to pure science.

Read the synopsis, look at the cover image, your first impression and amount of interest in both is probably pretty close to what you\'ll get.But if you\'re uncertain onwards we go--!I have a silly rule when it comes to finding new shows to watch. If there is at least one person passionate enough to write a glowing ""10"" review my likelihood to watch it is like, 50x more than it would be otherwise. That was the case for this show.And I\'m giving it a ""10"" myself for that reason, because I ended up passionately falling...in love with this anime. On a technical level, it probably falls more at a 7-8-ish. Mainly because of the presentation. The character designs are great, the writing is great, and the soundtrack is great. However, it is not animated in any impressive manner, the directing is pretty basic on a technical level, I have no idea what demographic this is aimed at, and the sound effects can be lacking. Which, given this is 2004, much of that makes sense; the early 2000s were a pretty tumultuous time for anime production- still transitioning to an all-digital format, tools for working as such being pretty limited, and people working with it likely being inexperienced. I\'d imagine especially so for a long-standing institution like Nippon Animation. But really, there are some ugly moments.I said at the start that this show is the sort that you\'ll probably be able to gauge whether you\'ll enjoy from the synopsis. A mystery with a long and historical past, classic-style design choices, your mature and likely very charming (indeed so) adolescent characters, with just that hint of sci-fi. And of course, everyone will want their taste of these traits in different amounts. For me, this show perfectly balances these traits.I\'m a history nerd- the historical aspect, while not super accurate, added a wonderful air of mystery and depth to the characters\' pasts. The characters were fun and had immediate chemistry, it has that wonderful episode 1 moment where you just go ""damn that was a charming-ass interaction I gotta see more of that shit"" and you get to see some really cute and childish interactions even from the mature characters. It\'s refreshing. It\'s absolutely lovely. But I\'m also a Tezuka cocksucker so sillyXmature is my bread and butter. Adding on: I don\'t like sci-fi much, this keeps it simple and blends some whimsical fantasy into the mix- it was never overbearing.And the mystery itself is so well-woven! Admittedly, I\'m easy to please but there was not a single moment where I was bored or didn\'t desperately want to find out what was next and what was behind it all. Well paced, giving you just the right amount of info to make your own inferences and throwing you some well done misleading hints. All wrapping up in an unvindictive, and satisfying ending. I mean there are some silly things throughout; like at one point a character says their ""body was made smaller and smaller"" and I guess we\'re just gonna ignore that this fella was shrunk somehow?? But most everything else was so well done that I was just like, ""Okay show, you\'ve answered my other questions I\'ll give you a pass this time."" And I will also admit writing-wise that there are some hokey or pretentious moments, especially early on. I remember in like episode 2 or so Aghi, one of the children, narrates this one quote and it just sounds incredibly silly at that point.The music is also really great, perfectly fits the emotions of the characters, and adding suspense when it needed to. The sad music is not just sad, there are many feelings in it just like our real emotions. Ueno Kouji, I hope you can be satisfied in knowing that you made a truly phenomenal soundtrack. The ending is also drop-dead gorgeous, the singer\'s voice is beautiful and the opening- although it took a while to grow on me- became something that I looked forward to understanding more of and listening to as the story went on.Just a fun additional thing, since this is Nippon animation I assumed it would probably be similar to their World Masterpiece Theater shows. Aimed at a family or younger audience with some intense stuff for the sensitive people but nothing too heavy. Yeah, I wouldn\'t say that now... If I would have watched this as a kid there are a lot of moments I am confident would have traumatized me. Just- some really unexpectedly violent imagery and very terrifying unforgettable situations for some characters. That may be one of later NA\'s banes, confused target demographics. I think this was probably a passion project of Nakamura Takashi more than anything, and as that I think he should be proud to call this his masterpiece.This was my first review, it was probably a bit pretentious but I sincerely loved this anime and it has become one of my all-time favorites despite its flaws. I hope other people will watch and love this anime too. If it sounds interesting to you don\'t hesitate to watch it! in love with this anime.

It is impossible to do a meaningful review of this show without spoilers, so I will keep this bare bones.Story 3/10:The story is incredibly convoluted. I don't mean that it was hard to understand, because they did give relatively clear explanations for the events. The problem is just the sheer complexity of the plot, while managing to lack in substance. The story attempted to tell a lot, but many of the plot points were unnecessary, anti-climatic, and gimmicky.Characters 3/10:I had a huge complaint about multiple characters (in-fact, my biggest complaint about the show), but I cannot even brush on the reason...why without huge spoilers.Tone 7/10:I did like the tone throughout much of the show. They didn't try to force comedy, romance, etc. in places that didn't call for it. They let the serious scenes be serious and the lighthearted scenes lighthearted. It wasn't fantastic, but it refrained from significant faults.Setting:At times I liked it, at others I didn't. That's as much as I am willing to say in fear of spoilers.Art 6/10:The art style itself is nothing to behold. The animation is fine but in no way superb. There are a select few scenes that stood out particularly well though. Not in the details or fantastic action scenes, but instead in capturing significant meaning in a single shot with well placed and scaled objects and 'camera' (so to speak).Sound 6/10:Not much to say one way or the other. Fairly repetitive soundtrack, but usually fitting. The voice acting was fine, but was hurt by annoying dialogue (specifically, the large amount of times they screamed each other's names during higher action scenes. It's nitpicky, but got to me in a couple of episodes).Enjoyment 5/10:As I said with the art section, there where a few particular scenes that were done wonderfully. So much so, that despite being bored for a majority of the show, I'm still glad I watched it.Overall 5/10:I think my reasoning is clear. There isn't a single aspect this show excels in, and it undoubtedly has it's flaws. To be entertained by this show, you need to enjoy lots of plot turns. I don't mean plot twists (where they take what you thought you knew and change it), but pure turns. The plot likes to stop at certain points, and just move on to something utterly new with no relation to previous events. These plots do not get intertwined, instead they simply get mashed together. Sometimes, they altogether annihilate the importance of previous plot-lines.It's a pass for anyone who does not care for a fantasy/sci-fi for complexity of plot alone. why without huge spoilers.Tone 7/10:I did like the tone throughout much of the show.

Despite how old it is as it came out in 2004, it has all the good stuff, I mean adventure, mystery, romance, fantasy and sci-fi? Yeah, sign me up. But have you know, you are signing up for a shipwreck of feelings. Seriously, I guarantee you. Don't believe how kiddy it looks, its actually quite heavy and personally suitable for older generations.Story: I'm a sucker for mystery, such that I have to know what's the big deal is. The plot is intriguing and as the story...unfolds, everything becomes clear. I will separate the entire series into two; the first part introduced the main characters alongside the supporting characters. The first part of the story tells you what the characters are searching for, and you don't really know what's going on. But I promise you, the latter part of the story is intense that you would definitely wouldn't want to miss. Basically, I love the plot, the story, it is entirely brilliant. It plays with reincarnation, and past life elements, and at the latter part of the story, most of the questions in my head had been answered.Art: The art, well seeing as it came out in 2004, not much to be swoon upon, but the animation is quite fluid actually. The action parts are nicely done, and the expression of the characters are very unique, subtle almost and animation flows very neatly. The colors are nice, and the atmosphere of the overall story especially in the flashback scene is wonderful.Sound: I love all the soundtracks used in the anime especially the opening and ending. The ending, Mizu no Madoromi is so rich, and it completely portrays the feelings of story which is melancholic and endearing.Character: The main characters, especially Helga and Thoma had perfectly developed their character at the end of the anime. The Befort's Children, I had a hard time to understand as they seem to be expressionless. However, as the story progresses, they showed an immense character development and feelings. Every actions they did had a reason and not just there for show. I feel very strongly for Thoma, who is actually (yeah not going to spoil anything but if you think he's the other guy like what I originally think, then he's actually the other guy). Another character that I didn't expect to love was Dumas, or Damian. If you stick until the end, you'll know why. The feelings the characters had (especially Seth), are all portrayed powerfully and will definitely deal a blow to your heart.Enjoyment: I hugely enjoyed the anime, as I think the story is a gem and I am very attached to some of the characters. It was a joy to watch their adventure and rooting for them to find what they are looking for despite all the hardships along the way. There isn't any other word to describe, because it is so different from all the other cliche animes. The only thing I regret is that I wish it had ended with my favorite ship. It is still amazing and 100% worth watching, nonetheless. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a ride in the ship of feelings. unfolds, everything becomes clear.

There isn't any other word to describe, because it is so different from all the other cliche animes. The only thing I regret is that I wish it had ended with my favorite ship. It is still amazing and 100% worth watching, nonetheless. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a ride in the ship of feelings."", 'This. Anime. Is. Underrated.TLDR this anime is like Ghibli vibes, Akira level sci-fi, and Monster plot twists in one show. One of the best mystery themed anime I\'ve seen my whole life. Its hard to explain once I\'ve started writing this review now that I think of it, but like I said, it draws similarities from Akira where the world is set up so absurdly it manages to make the illogical become logical. It is absolutely genius.Let\'s start with the story. This show is an epic opera. The story starts off with several parallel story lines of Thoma and the gang, the Children of Befort,...and Detective Cooks. Like all mystery stories, elements in each story line interact with other one by one. But in Fantastic Children, each discovery just ends up in another twists revealing more secrets and mysteries. The story keeps you second guessing about what is truly going on behind the scenes. The only downside is during the later episodes the pace starts to go a bit too slow almost as if its a soap opera. But the mysteries uncovered in each episode is just too good to miss out you wouldn\'t notice how many episodes have gone by.I think a big point of why this anime is underrated comes from its simplistic style of animation and character design. Fun fact, the creator of this anime was Akira\'s character designer. So if there was a reason why all the characters looked flat and simple then that is why. It does seem that this show was on a budget and its clear by how the animation production became but I think the animators did a good job on correctly animating character expressions even with its flat face like characters. I was always immersed in each frame and never felt that the animation hindered that.The soundtrack is also super underrated. The opening ""Voyage"" is one of the best orchestra soundtracks in anime I\'ve ever heard. The ending ""Mizu no Madoromi"" was equally beautiful and had a Russian version that played in a few episodes which I thought was unique. The overall OST was very beautiful yet melancholic and fit the narrative really well.The characters are written well and each had differing personalities which played off each other nicely. A lot of people disliked Helga\'s dead quiet personality but I think it served her aura as this mysterious ""chosen one"" girl well. The supporting cast were all memorable including all seven of Befort\'s Children.I absolutely enjoyed this anime and will definitely recommend this to anyone of my anime friends. If they think the childlike characters and simple animations made this anime suck then screw that. Because everything else in this anime is absolutely genius. 10/10 and Detective Cooks.

Fantastic Children has so many different plot threads that at the beginning it's hard to imagine that they’re all related – but they are and its so satisfying to watch all the threads come together. This anime goes through so many changes over its 26 episode run as every plot development adds new threads to the rich tapestry that makes up the plot. So many different elements are on display – mystery, sci-fi, historical, action, drama, adventure, but above all Fantastic Children at its heart is a...romance story spanning space and time. It checked all the boxes for me and its conclusion almost reduced me to tears!A minor criticism is that not all the characters were fully developed, including some of the Befort Children themselves – not all of them were adequately fleshed out and their motives and lives are still a mystery by the end. But its natural that some character development would be sacrificed for the greater good of the epic plotline and the central characters where quite well developed. I really liked Tohma’s character as he probably goes through the most changes and just when I thought I had him figured out a well placed plot twist pulled the carpet out from under me, Helga on the other hand was a bit dull for the majority of the show as she was the picture child for ‘emotionless girl’ most the timeANIMATION: One of the things that was putting me off starting this series for so long was the character designs as they are extremely plain and quite childishly drawn. However once you get into the series I found that these simplistic designs were the best choice for this show as they do not distract the viewer from the plot and display all the emotion you really need from the characters realistically. The backgrounds were beautiful and the attention to detail in the period scenes of old Europe was quite impressive. All the action scenes were well choreographed and exciting to watch and I was also impressed by the large number of locations covered over the course of the series.MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: The music was absolutely wonderful. I adored the ED theme in particular and have it downloaded – the style of the song puts me in mind of Clannad (the Irish group not the anime ) and its really lovely on the ear. Midway through the series its also sung in Russian which is also lovely. The OP was nice too and very fitting for the series. The score is excellent in its own right – grand orchestral pieces and melancholic piano really enhance the viewing experience. The voice acting is of a very high standard. Again Tohma stands out for me due to the sheer range of emotions displayed – Junko Minagawa (Cornelia – Code Geass, Joshua – Chrno Crusade) really did a fantastic job voicing him.All in all Fantastic Children is a wonderfully crafted anime, I’d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good solid plot driven series. romance story spanning space and time.

I am not going to go into all of the details and all of the reasons because I could make full essays just single episode based let alone for the whole anime. I am just going to point out the worst things and the biggest flaws.StoryThey try to make it seem like this story is very mysterious, very dark, very complicated and edgy but all they do is spit in their own mouth when...it is actually revealed what is going on.It's a very simple story that could have been said and shown in 12 episodes at best and even then it probably wouldn't have been good. With their stretching things and prolonging each reaction of a character to take at least 30 seconds when you already start praying for it to just move along and start pulling your hair out they stretch out the runtime in all the worst ways possible.I am not going to give you any spoilers but just from the summary alone you know that there exists a group of children who are spotted throughout history and when they are there are supposed to be some calamities this world goes through and seeing them is a bad thing. No, no it isn't. All of that means almost nothing in this story yet it takes half an anime for something to actually start happening. Almost nothing of importance happens in this anime until the final few episodes and even then it is laughably bad.Also, the amount of giant plot holes as big and vacuum filled like the black hole are innumerable in this anime. Almost every single thing you have mentioned in the summary reeks of plot holes. Why are those kids not ageing? Why do they lose their memories when they turn 12? Why some of them decide to live their lives here because they cannot take it anymore instead of just not returning back here? How the hell is Wanda here on Earth? How did that thing end up here and why wasn't it established in the story? Why did the princess' father decide to put that weapon in? Why is Dumas so obsessed with a sister he never even met? How does Dumas know all about the scientists when he was on a space ship practically since birth? Why does his father not care about his only son? What was the point of Crooks apart from the filler parts that had absolutely no impact on the story? Why would a princess choose to stay as Helga when Helga is as empty as it gets because all of Helga's life was spent on wishing to be the princess (getting to that place I know, but meaning of it is the same)? And so many more questions that I just cannot put all of them here because there isn't enough space. None of those questions get answered. It's like they are saying: ˝Just don't think about it!˝ArtArt is the 'best' part of this whole mess and since it is quite bad, that says a lot. And do not tell me I just don't like the look of the older anime. Quite the contrary, that is what I prefer. Like His and Her Circumstances, old Fruits Basket, old Sailor Moon, old Dragon Ball, Bleach, Ghost in the Shell... all of them I love. But when something is bad it needs to be pointed out. And this is... cringe. The colour palette is dark and broody but for no bloody reason. They insist on telling this story in a broody kind of way but it makes no sense. Cringe factor is through the roof. They are cutting corners on animation everywhere. You have the universe, 'Enma', guys who are just big black blocks of darkness, you have facial features that do not move, but kind of just twitch as if frozen in space and time and set on repetition and it can make you claw your eyes out. Here and there you will have a nice scenery shot and that is why it is a level higher than the rest.SoundThe opening song is there for all of the 26 episodes and it is soooo bloody annoying that I had nightmares about it. I truly hate that opening song. Sound throughout the series is really on a bad level especially when you start to notice how when they are holding a shot on a character for a reaction to something (and they do each character with the same expression each time something happens) then you hear the exact same sound for each of them, like 'ah', and you can hear them inserting that reaction and the way they paste it in is extremely unnatural. Also, the Helga character has one of the most annoying voice acting I have ever come across. They repeat the same music over and over and over again that you already feel like you are losing your mind.CharacterWhat to say that I didn't already mention in the story. Characters are cliches, they do not have a personality, they have no interests apart from what is needed to get the story going. They are one-thing-oriented characters. There are no layers and no subtlety and no depth. How you see Helga the first time that is how she is going to be the last time. Character growth is almost non-existent.EnjoymentLaughable. There was none. Apart from one single thing and that is unintentional hilarity. Which happens throughout almost one whole episode and here and there sporadically. In one episode where the weapon is activated somewhere and there are people trying to get to it to stop it there are so many moments of unintentional hilarity that I simply wish the whole anime was that stupid so I could at least laugh at how ridiculous it all is.OverallOverall I urge you to avoid this one. Do not even watch it for those brief moments of unintentional hilarity. It is bad, it is terribly bad. If you try to watch it on Fast Forward option you will notice that only then it will seem like it is happening in the actual time. This anime is a convoluted boring and uninspiring mess. I do not know why it is rated so high nor why there aren't other more negative opinions written about it but you can see a couple of the first episodes for yourself and judge the anime based on that because it only gets worse from there.I am sorry for all the time I wasted on this. I could have watched something at least mildly entertaining instead. it is actually revealed what is going on.It's a very simple story that could have been said and shown in 12 episodes at best and even then it probably wouldn't have been good.

I could have watched something at least mildly entertaining instead."", 'Fantastic ChildrenWow, this was quite a ride. 26 amazing episodes and damn were they good.A story that\'s not just complex, but if talked about in the slightest of ways, could be considered a spoiler, it\'s incredible. From 26 episodes, only one was a filler or rather, retelling of the events thus far, every other single episode had fantastic direction and purpose. We follow Thoma, Chitto and Helga for a large portion of the story. With the three kids, we also have a pack of children looking for someone very important; white haired, blue eyed kids. The story revolves around these two groups of...people and the way the story opens up; it\'s always done deliberately. The lore behind what\'s going on is just as interesting as everything else about Fantastic Children; it\'s weird, it\'s very sci-fi and odds are, you won\'t really know what\'s going on until halfway through the show where things really pick up pace, though believe me, the show starts off quite quickly and almost never slows down.The animation and artstyle used in Fantastic Children, almost reminds me of Akira Toriyama\'s art style. The faces and especially the eyes of most children and cast, shouted Akira Toriyama inspired to me; not that anything is wrong with that either, since it works pretty well in Fantastic Children. The colors used too, are pretty diluted and muddy, compared to what I\'ve been watching lately. Animation though, is pretty good, most things come off as fluid and smooth with enough detail where it needs to be, so nice job. The way it\'s all drawn though, is what makes Fantastic Children look so..well... fantastic! I never thought it was boring or dull at all.The only problem I had was, Fantastic Children loved to have the eyes shake or rather vibrate at intense speeds.... A lot of shock and awe happens in the show, so every time someone is shocked, their eyes start shaking, honestly, after seeing it happen 5+ times, I was a little annoyed of the effect and it almost made me mad.One of the best things about Fantastic Children however, is the use of music. My goodness, I don\'t believe there was a single episode that didn\'t use an arrangement of music at all. The orchestrated sounds that came into effect when a story element was being exposed was flawless. The piano arrangements were superb and a delight to listen to as well. In-fact, all the music that I heard whilst watching Fantastic Children was remarkable, well timed and just perfect for the emotions and feelings they (creators and what-not) tried to get across. Absolutely adore the music used.The cast of characters and the seiyu that went along with them was pretty good too. I didn\'t really like Chitto much and I hated having to listen to all the short ""ah\'s"" and ""oh\'s"" and breaths. There would be like 5 minute long expositions for story elements where characters would watch in terror at what was happening ""ah\'ing"" and taking breaths in fear. Honestly was a little annoying. The worst thing about it all though, was having to listen to Thoma scream. I absolutely hated that; even if it didn\'t happen often or much at all, the screams he did was just so... obnoxious almost. Aside from those few things, everyone did a great job and just listening to the cast/seiyu was really nice.I think one of the absolute best things about Fantastic Children is that it takes itself very seriously. It\'s a serious story about serious interactions that take place on a series of islands. In-fact, the combination of how the story is presented and the way the music is played during episodes, I swear I must have had goosebumps on me for atleast 18 of the episodes; not because they\'re scary, but because the overall effect given was enough to give me the heebie-jeebies!If you\'re looking for something different, with a nice sci-fi element to the show, with a story that is very wild, take a look at Fantastic Children. Try and watch an episode or two, I feel like most would get sucked in for sure. people and the way the story opens up; it\'s always done deliberately.

It looks like the producers watched some better anime, then took what they found good as ingredients for this one. They chose to make a “centuries-long mystery” as a mystery apparently means the viewer doesn’t need to know much details. Also limit the dialogue and add repetition to the recipe to cut the costs even more, and you get their business plan to get wealthy with minimal effort.This is probably the reason that fear emotions have to be shown on every face of every character and in sequence because a total group reaction would make the...episode shorter. In the beginning it does make you wonder what terrible event is happening, but it gets boring quick.And as the anime continues you find out that there is actually no reason for fear or it gives even more questions. Repetitions of fearful events is the strategy, and it is stalling the viewer with as little information as possible.Also the characters are on the move a lot, again slowing down the flow of the story. Especially if you see another long chase ending by someone teleporting away, why didn’t that happen immediately…  Ah yes it is as logical as having soldiers fight with swords, while having also laser weapons, some ingredients don’t mix well.There are so many repetitive events, combined with characters that are totally not necessary to the story (like the detective and the woman that is following him).  A waste of time that could have been used better to give details for certain decisions. No wonder the story is full of plot holes.The only way they make the story flow is to have someone appear at the right spot or at the right time listening in when someone else is telling some secret or information. It gives you a world with so much unused space and open doors everywhere as people need to be able to hide in it.All the characters are so very very empty, they just do something because the plot demands it. You could be positive and say that the story is about love that survives through space and time. But in the anime this apparently applies only for the 2 main characters, others experiencing similar events abandon their loved ones quite easily.But even those 2 main characters offer nothing else. Being their friend doesn’t keep them from flying away, leaving you heavily wounded behind. All that while knowing those wounds came from trying to save them. It all just happens to get some form of a story, but with scripted characters.The only fun I had was jokingly predict the worst choice that the royal mother could make, and then seeing it actually happen.Conclusion: It is not worth watching. episode shorter.

Kappa no Coo to Natsuyasumi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2848/Kappa_no_Coo_to_Natsuyasumi,"['When I borrowed the DVD from my sister I was sceptical at first because she said she didn\'t really like it and the graphics weren\'t really outstanding either. How wrong I was. Kappa no Coo to Natsuyasumi is one if the most amazing animes I have ever seen. I must admit I expected it to be rather boring and not special at all but I was so wrong. I enjoyed every minute of it, it was fun to watch, I laughed a lot, and I cried a lot too. The story really touched me, the characters really grew on me (even the supporting ones!) and...when I was done watching, I was sad because I didn\'t want it to end.The Story: The young boy Koichi happens to find a Kappa, which surprisingly survived over 200 years. He takes the Kappa, now named ""Coo"", home, and starting from then on, he secretly lives with family Uehara. When Coo starts feeling lonely, Koichi and the Kappa go on a trip, to find other Kappas. But a legendary being like Coo will not stay undiscovered for long...When I thought about rating this anime, I thought I\'d give it a 9 because the graphics weren\'t what I am used to from other animes. But after finishing the anime, I realized the way the characters are drawn fit the story perfectly. It was part of the charm in my opinion. The setting isn\'t some kind of parallel world so any other graphics, the ""normal"", often used kind, wouldn\'t have gone well with the story.I recommend this anime for EVERY one out there, but I must say there is some violence in it, so it\'s not just a happy go lucky anime.This movie is outstanding, unique and very, very touching. After watching it, you will agree with me. You WILL. There\'s no chance you\'ll disagree. That\'s impossible. when I was done watching, I was sad because I didn\'t want it to end.The Story: The young boy Koichi happens to find a Kappa, which surprisingly survived over 200 years.

But after finishing the anime, I realized the way the characters are drawn fit the story perfectly. It was part of the charm in my opinion. The setting isn\'t some kind of parallel world so any other graphics, the ""normal"", often used kind, wouldn\'t have gone well with the story.I recommend this anime for EVERY one out there, but I must say there is some violence in it, so it\'s not just a happy go lucky anime.This movie is outstanding, unique and very, very touching. After watching it, you will agree with me. You WILL. There\'s no chance you\'ll disagree. That\'s impossible.', 'What makes a great anime movie? Is it visuals, great storytelling, great and relatable characters, mind-bending themes and ideas or just the name of a famous director and studio. Whatever it is, we all love movies and anime. When I think about anime movies one of the first which comes to my mind is Summer Days with Coo and it is not because of complex storytelling, visuals or name of the director but it is because it is the only anime movie that genuinely made me cry and word “genuinely” is very important. Coo is not a movie of fakeness or pretending, it is a...movie about reality and humans, It does not pretend anything but show directly what is true and that is the greatest asset of Summer Days With Coo. To understand this we have to understand the story structure and characters of this movie.Characters in Coo are quite different than rest of the rabble. By that, I mean that they don’t have a specific trait like brave, loving or anything near it and they don’t follow normal convention of movie characters when they take action and when they do take action which will be almost always be motivated by the situation. There is no villain in this movie nor there are any heroes and what we might think is a hero do not follow general rules of a hero, ie. they are not purely selfless, well expect Ossan. In short characters in Summer Days with Coo are humans and nothing more and that is the greatest beauty of this movie. A hero is a hero because of the situation made him and villains are villains because situation made them, there no good and bad just people with different situations and needs. That is why I said there no fakeness or pretending, these people who are in the movie act genuinely like people in that situation, just like you and me. There is no trait defining them, no horrid past poking them, no high goal driving them, they are just normal people nothing more and nothing less.Story structure is defined by a single action and multiple reactions to that action. Like when you drop a rock in a claim pond and watch ripples react with each other to form different patterns. The movie can neither be called story driven or character driven. it is the initial action that forms the story and characters react with that story making their mark on it and story also making its mark on them. Its beauty cannot be explained by mere words. Summer Days with Coo is a movie that can put nearly every movie I have watched in shame, in the storytelling department.Again this simplicity and realism also reflect in its vision. It is rough, ugly, detailed, clunky and realistic in an odd way. Everyone looks normal, there are no extraordinary beautiful characters and yet there are detailed and beautiful backgrounds, this gives the movie a unique feel. Some may find visual to be repulsive but what hidden behind them is gold.Summer Days with Coo is a truly unique and beautiful experience and everyone should give it a try. It is a movie filled with Simplicity and Beauty to the brim and there could be no doubt that it is one of the best movies I have ever watched. So go and give it a try and let me know. movie about reality and humans, It does not pretend anything but show directly what is true and that is the greatest asset of Summer Days With Coo.

The family gets attached to Coo and struggles to keep him secret from the public. Coo soon starts to feel lonely and separated and wonders about his own kind.Even though there\'s a lot happening in between and afterwards, the movie has a very, VERY calm and smooth way of storytelling but doesn\'t create a feeling boredom. If you\'re looking for action and a propulsive plot, then this is nothing for you.Most characters have depth...and happen to be very open with their feelings - this, the sorrows of Coo and what they entail make ""Kappa no Coo to Natsuyasumi"" an exceptionally empathetic and touching anime.There are moments of fun, happiness and sadness, even some of shock. Everyone who usually cries a little (or more) in movies will definitely cry while watching this one.On the side panel you can see that someone set the genre to ""Adventure"" .... I don\'t think that fits too much. Slice of Life, Drama and (a little) Comedy are way more fitting.The visual art in ""Kappa no Coo..."" won\'t impress you all too much - pretty solid and modest are the words coming to my mind. All in all more than enough to catch the atmosphere and the viewer.If you\'re liking emotional motion pictures with strong characters and strong plot then you shouldn\'t miss this one. and happen to be very open with their feelings - this, the sorrows of Coo and what they entail make ""Kappa no Coo to Natsuyasumi"" an exceptionally empathetic and touching anime.There are moments of fun, happiness and sadness, even some of shock.

While it was a fairly cute movie it did have a very dark side to it.It really exposed the nasty side of human beings in this film, to the point where it almost made me uncomfortable. I am very sensitive about the fair treatment of animals, so just as a warning to anyone like me, you may be bothered by a few scenes in this film. Apart from that it definitely had some funny & cute moments...that made me laugh. I think I was just blown away at how emotional and deep that the creators made this film. It was definitely a mixture of things I hadn\'t seen before. It also showed a very interesting evolution of characters in terms of maturity, etc.It was also one of the longer anime films i\'ve seen (over 2 hours), but I\'m not sure if the extra length was really necessary. It did have some really beautiful scenery, but like the other reviewers said the animation wasn\'t all that great.Overall I thought it was a fairly good movie, but I probably wouldn\'t watch it again. I just wish I looked more into the plot so I would have been prepared for the not so cute side of it (since i was under the impression it was some sweet ol\' kids movie). It definitely was not up to the level of aesthetic & plot as some of the ""classic"" anime films out there, but still something refreshingly new. that made me laugh.

I cried so many times, and all of the times it was the human’s fault.Two characters died because of humans. Other characters suffered mentally, because of humans.When Coo discovered an ability, I honestly wished him to kill all humans. Sadly he did not so, but well. Would’ve been too easy anyway, I guess.Fuck humans. I hate them. I hate to be one of them. If I could choose, I’d be a different species. Anything, really.But humans are a piece of junk and this movie just proves it once more.I love the director for exposing humans like...that; perhaps that’s why the movie is unpopular.Anyway, go watch it and suffer. that; perhaps that’s why the movie is unpopular.Anyway, go watch it and suffer.', '""My father used to say that people rob water and land, and one day they will take away the wind, the sky and all that is sacred to us, but as a punishment for them, they will lose their soul.""It\'s really emotional anime in Miyazaki\'s style! One of the things I had to look, I found a wonderful, simple, almost childish cartoon about a Japanese mythical character – a kappa! In the center of the story - a small kappa named Coo (it is eastern Slavic relative of the nix) - green, large-eyed, like a frog and a turtle at a time. Kind, naive and...totally unacquainted with the modern world.Somehow, that full-scale project, that Japanese director Keiichi Hara spent five years, is overlooked. Apparently more people like to look at boobs flashing before his eyes, and rivers of blood than a fairy daily and an elaborate storyline. This anime makes us think about the problems which lives the modern world. It starts with fear, fear breeds violence..Many years ago, drunk, nervous samurai killed his father, and the small kappa during the earthquake fell into a crevice and slowly dried up, turning into a kind of stone. After 200 years the boy called Kouichi Uehara found the ""bizarre fossil"" and, of course, brought home.Kappa is a legendary nix from the Japanese stories. In the anime, he looks charmingly sweet. If I was a kid, I fervently wished for to get to know this creature. Coo is a miracle, surviving to our time due to successful circumstances.There is a comparison of the human world and the world kappas; the main character repeatedly that kappas never lie! We are like ants to swarm in the cities, like bees in a hive are working every day, fussing, fumbling, strive to be ""like everyone else"", ""best"", we want fame and money, to vent our anger on weaker. But of course not all like that!From the first seconds of viewing great drawing sets on a special way. I seemed to be plunged in my own childhood. An excellent story plus a great animated style: it looks like a mixture of traditional hand-drawn cartoon art and photo processing. The river, for example, looks unreal real! There is feeling that it is drawing over a digital image of water. Same thing with the sky: clouds – it can not be distinguished from the real thing. All of nature depicted on the high level. But, however, the faces of characters is  simple as possible (Ku - as opposed to people drawn very carefully). So all look very harmonious and well. Also I really liked the sound!It was interesting to see the evil of samurais. For some reason, I perceived their solely as a people of boundless honor.In the anime addressed topics: child cruelty, molestation of the media, the friendship, the relationship between a boy and a girl, sister and brother.Anime demonstrates what cruel and avid to sensations there are people sometimes.

Directed reproduced contemporary reality - all at once seized their mobile phones, but not to help, but to capture on camera in order.Within two hours of screen time never flashed the thought that I was looking it for a long time. Anime looks on the one breath. I would like that to be more such good, fairy tales, like the story about the friendship Coo and Kouichi.Duration of movie is near two hours and there is no innuendo here, the director realized fully all his ideas, and we\'ll just sit and absorb, digest, enjoy.

While it may not be on the scale of raiding and pillaging villages to gain land, you are indeed living on the natural habitat or animals, both big and small, and that is sort of what Summer Days with Coo illustrates. It gives human-like qualities to turtle-like creatures, called kappas, allowing us to see the consequences of our actions without discarding it as ""they\'re only animals."" It gives us a sense of sympathy. At the beginning of the film, a samurai kills a kappa as he...pleads to keep some of his land. The kappa\'s son runs out, but the ground cracks, as a curse has happened due to the elder kappa\'s death and the younger falls through, becoming fossilized. Fast forward to modern times and a young boy find the fossilized kappa, assuming his name is Coo, as the kappa becomes reanimated after being drenched in water and says ""coo."" The kappa, by this time have become a legend and nobody has seen one, so when the boy calls his father and tell him of his finding, his father rushes home. The kappa is something special and the father advises the boy to ""keep the kappa a secret."" So far, as far as aesthetics go, as those are important, especially in anime, the film is fairly pretty color-wise. There are poppy umbrellas and jackets against a matte, dull environment in soft rain. The characters, I hate to say, are kind of shoddy. They look bad, aside from Coo and the other non-human creatures, and these are very limited. We only see a dog, Coo, his father, and another, at the end of the film, legendary creature.The kappa is sure to experience a culture shock, and he does, sort of like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, but not entirely. Yes, in that he is brought into an environment that he is unaccustomed to and everything is foreign to him. What he thinks he understands, initially, he really doesn\'t. For example, when his sister brings home a snail as a pet, Coo eats it, thinking it to be food, or escargot. Edward didn\'t understand that at the beauty salon, he was being seduced, as he reveals it to his caretakers without any hesitation or drama. No, in that the kappa is much more animated, hyper and excited, rather than dull, calm, and docile. When the boy\'s sister lunges at Coo, he assumes that she is challenging him to a sumo wrestling match, and plays along. He becomes incredibly hyper when he has some caffeine from a soft drink and he even ventures out by himself, which is very unlike Edward. Coo quickly realizes that he must find another place to live, as he cannot assimilate. It would more or less be impossible for him. This is also like Edward.The movie displays how humans will often forget about natural life if it will progress their own interests, as the press harasses the boy to snap a picture of Coo, the rare kappa. Around this time, we begin to take a liking to the mother. She is unfazed by the press and ignores them. She sees them for what they are and doesn\'t acknowledge them or feed them, as they never seem to be satisfied. They surround the home of the boy and the family finally submits, allowing Coo to appear on a talk show. On the talk show, a man that has studied kappa via books for a long time is featured. He reveals that he has always believed in kappa because a kappa arm has been passed down through his family for a long time. He shows the kappa arm and it is Coo\'s father\'s arm! Coo grabs the arm and escapes on the family that houses him\'s dog, as the two have made friends.. He is hunted down by cameras as weapons. The dog dies by a car in the chase. Coo is about to kill himself, but his father places into him a sense that he should continue to live. He listens and refrains from suicide. The family ultimately decides that Coo should pursue a letter that asked Coo to visit the address the letter was shipped from, as Coo trusts it. He says that the handwriting is not human. He goes and to his father, in the sky lets him know that some humans are ok and he has made friends with them. The creature is one that is the same as the creatures in A LETTER TO MOMO, which are in Japanese folklore and tale the form of humans.

It's such a shame that this doesn't have an English dub, but don't let that stop you from giving this a watch. Summer Days with Coo combines supernatural mythology elements into a beautiful slice of life, following a family on its journey of growth via their special magical pet. Coo himself has his own epic journey, that begins tragically but ends happily. Coo, though not human himself, is treated as a true sibling and goes through an array of human emotions. While deeply moving at times, the movie also possesses fantastic & intelligent comedic relief (no exaggerated manga effects for comedy)...and plot-twisting drama. This is a true masterpiece - one of the greatest stories told, and really deserves an English dub. and plot-twisting drama.

Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8086/Densetsu_no_Yuusha_no_Densetsu,"['These days we often misuse words in ways that sometimes don\'t make sense. Take ""epic"" for example, and think about all of the occasions where the term has been applied as a colloquialism that simply means ""I enjoyed it"" , ""it was very good"", or some other sentiment along those lines. It\'s actually surprising how many people don\'t know the meaning or usage of the word, but rather than comment on the failure of education systems, let\'s have a look at how ""epic"" applies to an anime like Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (or The Legend of the Legendary Heroes, whatever floats your boat).The original...eleven volume light novel series by Kagami Takaya was published in Dragon Magazine from February 2002 until October 2006 and has spawned a sequel (The Legend of the Great Heroes of Legend), and two spin offs (The Legend of the Legendary Heroes Anyway, and The Legend of the Black Fallen Hero), as well as being adapted as a drama CD, a PSP game, a manga, and the recent anime rendition.Now aside from mild curiosity at the obvious addiction to using the words ""legend"" and ""hero"" in some manner, one has to wonder if the anime adaptation can really live up to the popularity of the franchise.The story begins with an attack by the Nelphan army on the person of Ryner Lute, a layabout who is on a mission for his trusted friend, boss, and cause of all of his problems, King Sion Astal of Roland. Accompanying him on his journey is the warrior and perpetual dango addict Ferris Eris, a woman who may be a genius with a sword, but is pretty clueless with almost everything else (except dango). The pair have been tasked with finding and acquiring the legendary artifacts known as the Relics of Heroes, which lie hidden in various places across the continent of Menoris.As with any fantasy tale there\'s an element of derivation inherent in the plot which results in several very familiar scenarios being played out over the course of the series. This in itself isn\'t a bad thing though, as these staples are often used to drive home a particular point, or as support for the main storyline.And this anime really does need the support.The main issues with Denstsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (DenYuuDen), are the lack of coherency with the story and the constantly changing pace of the plot. Viewers may often find themselves wondering how a particular situation came about, and while there are efforts to tie up certain loose ends, these are nothing more than papering over the cracks. The narrative suffers from a distinct lack of timely explanations, and events can lead the audience on a merry dance as they struggle to keep up with the storyline. This is exacerbated by the constant mood swings that occur from one episode to the next, and the addition of seemingly random comedy scenes give the viewer the sense that even the show itself has no idea what\'s going to happen next.The heart of the problem is simply that ZEXCS, like many other studios, have made a screenplay that is nothing more than a ""cut and paste"" rendition of the original source material. While there are some anime that get away with summarily stringing together disparate events, it would have been better for everyone if they at least made the effort to stick to the story. Better yet, ZEXCS could have followed the example set by Satelight when they made Guin Saga, and only adapted a portion of the story to ensure there would be a continuous flow to the plot.One has to wonder what moment of ""genius"" would persuade director Kawasaki Itsuro and series composer Yoshimura Kiyoko to make such a disjointed narrative.On the plus side the lack of care with the storyline isn\'t really reflected in the look of the show, and DenYuuDen has some nice, imaginative scenes that really show what ZEXCS are capable of if they put their backs into it. The series features some decent animation, but the design principle impinges on this to a degree, partly because of the bishounen aspect of the show, but mainly because of the costumes. While the various outfits and garments are creative in their own way, there are several scenes where things like cloaks would clearly be a hindrance to any actual combat. In addition to this the characters tend to be on the impassive side when it comes to facial expressions, although this becomes less of an issue as the series progresses.DenYuuDen also features some very nice lighting and visual effects that add an extra layer of atmosphere to particular events, giving them an elegant, decadent, or dramatic feel that requires little in the way of added audio. Unfortunately this is offset by a lack of attention with small, specific details which seem like they were pencilled in as afterthoughts (Ryner\'s two year old beard is one example of this). While it\'s sometimes easy to overlook these relatively minor flaws, every now and then they become impossible to ignore, and viewers may be left wondering why the studio didn\'t notice these discrepancies before releasing certain episodes.The series features two opening themes, LAMENT Yagate Yorokobi Wo by Yuuki Aira (episodes 1 to 12), and Last Inferno by Ceui (episodes 13 to 24). The first OP is a rather bland affair that is generally well timed and edited, but ultimately fails to inspire. The second track is an altogether different beast that has far better choreography, and possesses a more serious and dramatic air than before. As for the ending themes, Truth Of My Destiny by Ceui and Hikari no Filament by Takagaki Ayahi, neither is anything other than a reasonable pop ballad coupled with pointless visuals that have no bearing on the story proper.What is interesting is the manner in which the background music is utilised. The tracks are often subtle additions that never really come to the fore unless the situation warrants more drama or tension, and because of this there are very few clashes with the dialogue. In addition to this the effects are given precedence over the music during a number of action sequences, and given that this series is a relatively disjointed affair, the quality of the audio choreography is more than a little surprising.One of the problem areas for DenYuuDen is the dialogue, in particular the tendency towards oratory and the sudden changes between banter and seriousness that are extensions of the inherent issues with the storyline, so it\'s to the credit of the actors and actresses that they deliver some decent performances. Fukuyama Jun (Ryner Lute), Ono Daisuke (Sion Astal), Takagaki Ayahi (Ferris Eris), and the rest of the cast are able to inject a degree of personality into their characters, but this is limited by some truly cumbersome scripting.Unfortunately this, together with the compression of the story, has a knock on effect where the characters are concerned.Like so many other fantasy anime out there, DenYuuDen follows the tried and tested method of event driven development, but like many other shows it also falls into the trap of poor characterisation. From the beginning of the first episode the viewer is expected to not only identify with Ryner, Ferris and Sion without knowing anything about them, they are also supposed to wait for any explanations because of the disjointed nature of the story. Add to that the fact that much of the growth is dependent on specific events that are scattered throughout the narrative, and the lack of personality comes to the fore.That said, while there is little to maintain the viewer\'s interest in the characters at the start of the show, things do take a turn for the better at the midway stage so that by the end of the series they are no longer cardboard cutouts. The events that drive the development also become a little more complex as the story develops, which is nice to see as the tendency in fantasy anime is to add more detail to the story while keeping these ""signposts"" simple.Now it may seem like I\'m being unfair to DenYuuDen by picking up on so many of its flaws, but there is a reason for this. While there is a lot that could have been done to improve the series as a whole, it\'s actually a rather enjoyable romp too. The byplay between Ryner, Eris and Sion can be odd because of the poor scripting, but there is humour in there, enough to make the viewer smile at least. In addition to that, there is a concerted effort to improve the story in the second half of the show, with darker themes emerging and more focus on consequences. The action sequences are decent enough, but every so often there is a flash of brilliance, and the characters can sometimes show a surprising depth that really should have been there for most of the series.And that\'s the rub. It really, really could have been so much better than it is. There is so much that ZEXCS could have easily done to improve DenYuuDen, and even something as relatively simple as deciding to adapt only a portion of the light novel series would have made a profound difference.One thing that should be touched on is the mistaken assumption that Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu is somehow an homage to Legend Of The Galactic Heroes due to the similarity in the naming conventions. The problem is that far too many people who have heard of, or watched, the latter anime have automatically decided that DenYuuDen should be just as good when, aside from the name and the fact that heroes, politics and war are involved, the two bear very few similarities. It\'s a bit like saying apples and apricots should taste the same just because they\'re both fruits that grow on trees and their names start with ""ap"".Anyway, leaving that aside, the one thing that really stands out about this anime is that it\'s effectively an unfinished product, especially as the light novels are still publishing. The disjointed storyline and initially lacklustre characters make this a much more difficult show to invest in, and this is a shame as there are several key plot elements that are interesting enough to warrant much more attention.That said, ZEXCS\' attempt at adapting the novels has some good points, and while there is enjoyment to be had, it\'s a far cry from being an epic. eleven volume light novel series by Kagami Takaya was published in Dragon Magazine from February 2002 until October 2006 and has spawned a sequel (The Legend of the Great Heroes of Legend), and two spin offs (The Legend of the Legendary Heroes Anyway, and The Legend of the Black Fallen Hero), as well as being adapted as a drama CD, a PSP game, a manga, and the recent anime rendition.Now aside from mild curiosity at the obvious addiction to using the words ""legend"" and ""hero"" in some manner, one has to wonder if the anime adaptation can really live up to the popularity of the franchise.The story begins with an attack by the Nelphan army on the person of Ryner Lute, a layabout who is on a mission for his trusted friend, boss, and cause of all of his problems, King Sion Astal of Roland. Accompanying him on his journey is the warrior and perpetual dango addict Ferris Eris, a woman who may be a genius with a sword, but is pretty clueless with almost everything else (except dango). The pair have been tasked with finding and acquiring the legendary artifacts known as the Relics of Heroes, which lie hidden in various places across the continent of Menoris.As with any fantasy tale there\'s an element of derivation inherent in the plot which results in several very familiar scenarios being played out over the course of the series. This in itself isn\'t a bad thing though, as these staples are often used to drive home a particular point, or as support for the main storyline.And this anime really does need the support.The main issues with Denstsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (DenYuuDen), are the lack of coherency with the story and the constantly changing pace of the plot. Viewers may often find themselves wondering how a particular situation came about, and while there are efforts to tie up certain loose ends, these are nothing more than papering over the cracks. The narrative suffers from a distinct lack of timely explanations, and events can lead the audience on a merry dance as they struggle to keep up with the storyline. This is exacerbated by the constant mood swings that occur from one episode to the next, and the addition of seemingly random comedy scenes give the viewer the sense that even the show itself has no idea what\'s going to happen next.The heart of the problem is simply that ZEXCS, like many other studios, have made a screenplay that is nothing more than a ""cut and paste"" rendition of the original source material. While there are some anime that get away with summarily stringing together disparate events, it would have been better for everyone if they at least made the effort to stick to the story. Better yet, ZEXCS could have followed the example set by Satelight when they made Guin Saga, and only adapted a portion of the story to ensure there would be a continuous flow to the plot.One has to wonder what moment of ""genius"" would persuade director Kawasaki Itsuro and series composer Yoshimura Kiyoko to make such a disjointed narrative.On the plus side the lack of care with the storyline isn\'t really reflected in the look of the show, and DenYuuDen has some nice, imaginative scenes that really show what ZEXCS are capable of if they put their backs into it. The series features some decent animation, but the design principle impinges on this to a degree, partly because of the bishounen aspect of the show, but mainly because of the costumes. While the various outfits and garments are creative in their own way, there are several scenes where things like cloaks would clearly be a hindrance to any actual combat. In addition to this the characters tend to be on the impassive side when it comes to facial expressions, although this becomes less of an issue as the series progresses.DenYuuDen also features some very nice lighting and visual effects that add an extra layer of atmosphere to particular events, giving them an elegant, decadent, or dramatic feel that requires little in the way of added audio. Unfortunately this is offset by a lack of attention with small, specific details which seem like they were pencilled in as afterthoughts (Ryner\'s two year old beard is one example of this). While it\'s sometimes easy to overlook these relatively minor flaws, every now and then they become impossible to ignore, and viewers may be left wondering why the studio didn\'t notice these discrepancies before releasing certain episodes.The series features two opening themes, LAMENT Yagate Yorokobi Wo by Yuuki Aira (episodes 1 to 12), and Last Inferno by Ceui (episodes 13 to 24). The first OP is a rather bland affair that is generally well timed and edited, but ultimately fails to inspire. The second track is an altogether different beast that has far better choreography, and possesses a more serious and dramatic air than before. As for the ending themes, Truth Of My Destiny by Ceui and Hikari no Filament by Takagaki Ayahi, neither is anything other than a reasonable pop ballad coupled with pointless visuals that have no bearing on the story proper.What is interesting is the manner in which the background music is utilised. The tracks are often subtle additions that never really come to the fore unless the situation warrants more drama or tension, and because of this there are very few clashes with the dialogue. In addition to this the effects are given precedence over the music during a number of action sequences, and given that this series is a relatively disjointed affair, the quality of the audio choreography is more than a little surprising.One of the problem areas for DenYuuDen is the dialogue, in particular the tendency towards oratory and the sudden changes between banter and seriousness that are extensions of the inherent issues with the storyline, so it\'s to the credit of the actors and actresses that they deliver some decent performances. Fukuyama Jun (Ryner Lute), Ono Daisuke (Sion Astal), Takagaki Ayahi (Ferris Eris), and the rest of the cast are able to inject a degree of personality into their characters, but this is limited by some truly cumbersome scripting.Unfortunately this, together with the compression of the story, has a knock on effect where the characters are concerned.Like so many other fantasy anime out there, DenYuuDen follows the tried and tested method of event driven development, but like many other shows it also falls into the trap of poor characterisation. From the beginning of the first episode the viewer is expected to not only identify with Ryner, Ferris and Sion without knowing anything about them, they are also supposed to wait for any explanations because of the disjointed nature of the story. Add to that the fact that much of the growth is dependent on specific events that are scattered throughout the narrative, and the lack of personality comes to the fore.That said, while there is little to maintain the viewer\'s interest in the characters at the start of the show, things do take a turn for the better at the midway stage so that by the end of the series they are no longer cardboard cutouts. The events that drive the development also become a little more complex as the story develops, which is nice to see as the tendency in fantasy anime is to add more detail to the story while keeping these ""signposts"" simple.Now it may seem like I\'m being unfair to DenYuuDen by picking up on so many of its flaws, but there is a reason for this. While there is a lot that could have been done to improve the series as a whole, it\'s actually a rather enjoyable romp too. The byplay between Ryner, Eris and Sion can be odd because of the poor scripting, but there is humour in there, enough to make the viewer smile at least. In addition to that, there is a concerted effort to improve the story in the second half of the show, with darker themes emerging and more focus on consequences. The action sequences are decent enough, but every so often there is a flash of brilliance, and the characters can sometimes show a surprising depth that really should have been there for most of the series.And that\'s the rub.

First impressions from the title alone gave a sense it was trying too hard to be epic, but that didn’t matter since I expected “Legend of the Legendary Heroes” to be a fun, clichéd romp. But instead of creating a brainless fantasy flick for dumb people like myself, the show adopts a taste for complexities with writing that leaves a bad taste.The story opens with two of the three main characters, the wizard Ryner and the knight Ferris, as they journey across the continent of Menoris...in search of powerful Hero Relics to aid our third main character, the High King of Roland, Sion. The lazy Ryner and steadfast Ferris aren’t anything beyond that in the first episode, with the only noticeable interplay between them being a scene where Ferris calls Ryner a pervert. Unfortunately, this scene is a running gag throughout the show that turns the Ryner and Ferris duo from simple to cringeworthy.Much of the show follows Ryner and Ferris’ adventures, meaning much of that time focuses on their relationship, which is Ferris calling Ryner a pervert for no reason; Ryner doesn’t so much as see a pantyshot from Ferris, so it’s not even clichéd in the way it should be, but outright unbelievable. Their relationship is 70% one running joke and 30% serious moments with no real progress between them, because they’re only sentimental when the show calls for it. Their relationship goes in a circle, or maybe it’s a see-saw; I don’t care, but neither do the writers.In one of the show’s scenes, Ryner is going out of control for plot reasons while Ferris is trying to snap him out of it. After she manages to get through to him, Ryner breaks down and starts crying in her arms as the rain suddenly pours. This scene of clichés doesn’t work since there’s a lack of tells on their progress. Ferris blushes maybe once before this while Ryner shows no interest in her at all. And even if this scene did work, they go back into being a weightless comedy duo until the story demands their sentiments again. And this happens more than once.But Ryner and Ferris’ relationship is harmless compared to the threads in the rest of the show. Ryner’s lack of personality outside his laziness can be made up for with his background, but the show’s storytelling often jumps back and forth from present day to flashback without any tell it’s done so, making it hard to follow. Even then, most of what little backstory he has is in the later parts of the show. It’s hard to take his tragic past seriously when the show often glosses over it for attempted comedy.Ferris is an even bigger joke than Ryner. When she’s not wrongly calling him a pervert for whatever reason, she’s going on about dango flavors without much else to her character. Somehow, she has even less background than Ryner, and it doesn’t help that this background is little more than skin service that isn’t even charming, but a forced attempt at being dark and edgy. But, it wouldn’t be a forced attempt at being dark and edgy if Ferris was a character worth caring for, if she had real progress and most of her time didn’t focus on failed comedy.The final main character, Sion, is also a big joke. His character arc is about learning to make tough choices that come with being High King, but his personality doesn’t show it at all. He’s equally serious and easygoing until the end of the show, which makes it easy to wonder whether story events are affecting him at all. Most of his background involves characters that have one or two lines of dialog, which isn’t enough for it to be taken seriously like it’s supposed to. He’s also incomprehensible, saying he doesn’t want to rule like a tyrant one moment, then leaves his assassin servant to take extreme measures so he can reach his goals the next moment.Sorry, I tried jumping over one cliché and fell onto another. When the story isn’t being lazy with its characters’ progress or background, it tries TOO hard and ends up being a war and politics philosophy discussion without compelling characters to distract from the fact. These heavy themes require a delicate touch, but unfortunately most of the villains—villains, not antagonists—are wealthy, evil people that take away from any social depth the show tries to have.Not that what depth the show does have is worth much anyway. There’s a lot more going on in the story, but most of it amounts to nothing or is rushed. One of the characters shows a thirst for vengeance without any build-up leading to that moment. The character he wants revenge on wants revenge on another character. And that final character is dealt with so quickly it disrespects the passion and empathy the first two characters (try to) invoke. If that sounds like a short plot description, then don’t worry, because the show doesn’t give these multiple story threads more than a few episodes.But even with a lot of episodes, one of the characters still proves ineffectual.When this character is introduced, she wants to reunite with Ryner because he was her friend during her rough childhood. It makes sense. What doesn’t make sense is how bubbly she is for most of the show, badly clashing with her background. What’s worse is that this isn’t the set-up to a gag character, because she’s supposed to be taken seriously. But her serious moments don’t work, because she lacks the roundedness needed to make her bubbly and serious side believable as the same character.The only decent characters are more like two pairings that are unfortunately not around for long. One of the characters in the first pairing appears at the early and later parts of the show. She meets someone she doesn’t like at first, but in their next scene they’re enjoying a cup of tea, and in the scene following she’s a blushing maiden. The other pairing is a classic warrior and princess story that believably flows from adoration to sweetness; in the first scene they’re smitten at first rescue, in the next scene they’re trying to hide their feelings from their friends to no effect, and then they’re enjoying a moonlight walk.Ignoring the small amount of screentime these four characters have, they’re believable because there’s real progress to their relationships. Sure, it’s cheesy, but it’s at least an attempt at a pairing compared to Ryner and Ferris’ see-saw relationship. It’s not as layered as the other parts of the story, but being more layered doesn’t mean better, but a greater chance to be worse. When there’s more plot to juggle, it only falls down much worse when the juggle isn’t kept up, and the juggle falls the moment it starts.This is part of why Legend of the Legendary Heroes’ writing leaves a bad taste, and what I mean when I say the story adopts a taste for complexities. It tries to execute too many threads at the same time and doesn’t give enough time for each thread to be properly weaved. At the same time, the three main characters take up most of the story’s screentime but have almost nothing to show for it. It’s this odd combination of incoherent density and weightless quantity that makes this show such a failure from a storytelling standpoint.This leaves only the presentation to save the show, but the visual part of that falls short. Save for Sion, his assassin servant, and the four pairing characters—the last four lack screentime—most of the character designs are multi-colored to the point where it’s hard to tell them apart. For a world with swords and magic, many of the fight scenes are underwhelming for being nothing but beam spam or poor choreography that makes one question if the combatants are only as strong as the plot demands.The best part of the presentation is the music, but music isn’t the aesthetic focus of an action fantasy show. Still, it’s loud when it needs to be, and has a surprising amount of grace during quieter scenes when it uses the art of silence to put focus on the dialog. Unfortunately, the music is held back by its odd habit of using random rock music during some scenes. This modern flare clashes with the medieval, fantasy feel of the show. I suppose it’s trying to be cool, and in a better show it’d be shameless fun, but here it comes across as trying too hard.Which is odd, because looking at how the show’s main characters are handled, it’s like they weren’t trying at all. No respect is given to most of the characters and their stories, it tries to tell too many stories, the stories often lack chronological coherence, the social themes lack any depth with its stereotypical villains, and the presentation is best where it doesn’t matter anyway. This show does a few things right and everything else very egregiously wrong.But the best thing I can say about this show is what Ryner goes on about from episode 1; take a nap. Sage advice, because taking a tap is preferable to watching Legend of the Legendary Heroes. Sure, you won’t be doing anything, but at least it’s better than getting Alpha Stigma-level angry at the people who made this. in search of powerful Hero Relics to aid our third main character, the High King of Roland, Sion.

I would recommend not to read Edit Part B at the end of the original review, unless you want to.]Okay I admit, the title is a bit... I mean it\'s really something that can put you off. Add to that, a very very ordinary first...episode definitely led many to have a thought such as ""Oh! Okay. Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (Legend of the Legendary Heroes). I will watch it later."" or most likely, \'Meh, it\'s definitely not my type.""  And yes, I can tell that with the number of people actually dropping it after first couple of episodes, let alone placed it in their \'on hold/plan to watch\' list which is staggering.Regardless, before you even read this review, I would suggest to watch the first three episodes (you can seriously do without the FUNistreams, since it is actually nicely animated) and drop the show if you like, well its more like I dare you would drop it once you\'ve seen episode three.So much for an introduction, here goes the real deal:Legend of the Legendary Heroes is based on a novel of the same title which goes back some 8 years from now (first published in 2002). The anime is almost an exact adaptation of the novel. The novel and its anime adaptation are based on a feudal European setting, just that, blended with Magic and Monsters.As for a brief introduction to where the story picks up, Ryner Lute (Fukuyama Jun), a magician of the Empire of Roland goes on a journey to find what they call the \'Hero Relics\' scattered all over the continent. He is partnered with Ferris Eris (Takagaki Ayahi), a beautiful, arrogant and insanely skilled swords-woman. Both of them have been dispatched by Sion Astal (Ono Daisuke), the young Hero-King of the Roland Empire. If it wasn\'t for Sion\'s slave-running, as what both Ryner and Ferris see him to be, Ryner would have been enjoying countless number of days taking his afternoon naps while Ferris enjoying her share of dango, and only dango in all of her meals. Everyday!To give an insight, Hero Relics are assumed to be sources of immense power that can overthrow an entire empire, something Sion desires to have available at his disposal so that he can make his empire a force to be recognized. You can easily understand Ryner and Ferris wouldn\'t be the only ones on the hunt. As Ryner and Ferris keep searching for the relics, putting his absolute faith on both of them, Sion follows his dream to make an empire where everyone would have a wonderful life. Something that comes with a price indeed; Coup d\'état followed by numerous assassination attempts from time to time from power hungry nobles and their followers. I won\'t say anymore than this. Rest are for you to find out, because it goes far beyond anything as simple as it might seem as you\'ve just read.The story is surprisingly good. I always tend to enjoy anime with lots of flashbacks, past happenings which often help a story to grow. Denyuuden, as what it is called in short, really is impressive on that regard. While the first episode is more like an introductory episode that goes to show the main characters involved in the anime, the following couple of episodes show flashbacks from where it all began, why Ryner set for the journey to find the relics, why Ferris has been appointed as his companion, and how, young Sion came to throne. These two episodes (2 and 3) are basically the foundation of the story that will take so many turns here and there as more characters are blended in while making the anime all too enjoyable, that when you will look back, you will be thrilled to realize how simply it all started. The story has unimaginable twists and when you think a character was included just for the sake of it, they will surprise you with the role they are going to play in the development of the whole story. Story wise, this couldn\'t be any better. And I dare say, I have seen lots of anime already to make such a rather bold statement.The anime can be seen as from both the characters\' point of views, as well as from the political aspects involved, which makes it a very intelligent anime. For example, the decisions Sion makes as a King often conflict with his philosophy, but he shoulders everything as a King should, refusing to give in to his ideals. At the same time, the conflicting nature of the characters within themselves makes it a very heartfelt anime. Like Ryner, who has been through enough, shows lack of emotion, although he cares for every living thing around him, ironically though, he puts threat on those around him just through his very existence. Ferris, who is always mocking Ryner doesn\'t falter to hold him dearly when he really needs it the most. And the anime translates a society that is ruled by the so called nobles and their hunger for power, and a society where everyone brands certain people as \'monsters\' for the inhuman power they possess, ironically again, something they wish they never have possessed, something they were born with in the first place.The characters are nicely depicted. From the absolute loyalty of the subordinates of Sion, for instance General Claugh Klom, to the emotional involvements of the members of the Roland Taboo Hunter team, (yeah, you have to know Milk Callaud (Fujita Saki) and her reverse-harem :P) everything makes sense. Characters making their entrance halfway through the series, for instance, the Hero-King of Gastark, Riphal Edea (Nakai Kazuya), or even the late, very late introduction of Tiia Rumiblue (Sakurai Takahiro) has been intensifying. And there are mysterious characters like Ferris\' older brother Lucile (Sugita Tomokazu), Sion\'s right hand Miran Froaude (Suwabe Junichi) and Milk Callaud\'s second in command Luke Stokkart (Hino Satoshi) will make you ponder to understand their every move and their motives. You must have been really annoyed by now to see all those seiyuus in the bracket. But the reason behind putting them there is to show the number of popular voice-casts have been working on this anime, justifying the weight of the characters being portrayed overall.The animation quality is really of top notch. The backgrounds are nicely animated and gives you the feel of a feudal European setting coupled with magical terrains and mysterious plains. The actions are simply put, stunning. From the magical circles that Ryner draws before unleashing the commands, to Ferris\' sword fights are animated smoothly without any glitch. Like I warned before, watching online streams, or stream-rips will kill half the real enjoyment. The fierce battles, magic circles, blood gores; you really cant enjoy them over low quality streams. This is not an anti-FUNi claim, just a fact which you can clearly confirm if you google the anime\'s screenshots/screencaptures. I would rather you buy the DVD/Blu-rays when they are out.The sound, particularly the BGM of the anime is really good. They change and merge so nicely with the mood that it makes the anime vibrant. One of the major contributions of BGMs is to propagate the emotional state of mind of the characters involved and Denyuuden scores a perfect 10/10 in that aspect.

According to forum reads, twitter feeds and blogs, I have reached to a conclusion that unless there is a significant improvement of the market of DVD/Bluray Disc, which is really poor at the moment, a sequel is highly unlikely. So if you don\'t intend to read the sequel novel, which is still ongoing, this anime is definitely not for you. Other than that, I would just say that there were bits in the original anime trailer which were never shown in the 24 episodes run of the entire show, leaving a bigger question, why those bits were there in the trailer when they were never in the anime series at all. Of course, I am referring to the bits that directly showed parts that collaborates with where the anime ended and giving a glimmer of hope to a sequel of the anime. You just never know.] episode definitely led many to have a thought such as ""Oh! Okay. Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (Legend of the Legendary Heroes). I will watch it later."" or most likely, \'Meh, it\'s definitely not my type.""  And yes, I can tell that with the number of people actually dropping it after first couple of episodes, let alone placed it in their \'on hold/plan to watch\' list which is staggering.Regardless, before you even read this review, I would suggest to watch the first three episodes (you can seriously do without the FUNistreams, since it is actually nicely animated) and drop the show if you like, well its more like I dare you would drop it once you\'ve seen episode three.So much for an introduction, here goes the real deal:Legend of the Legendary Heroes is based on a novel of the same title which goes back some 8 years from now (first published in 2002). The anime is almost an exact adaptation of the novel. The novel and its anime adaptation are based on a feudal European setting, just that, blended with Magic and Monsters.As for a brief introduction to where the story picks up, Ryner Lute (Fukuyama Jun), a magician of the Empire of Roland goes on a journey to find what they call the \'Hero Relics\' scattered all over the continent. He is partnered with Ferris Eris (Takagaki Ayahi), a beautiful, arrogant and insanely skilled swords-woman. Both of them have been dispatched by Sion Astal (Ono Daisuke), the young Hero-King of the Roland Empire. If it wasn\'t for Sion\'s slave-running, as what both Ryner and Ferris see him to be, Ryner would have been enjoying countless number of days taking his afternoon naps while Ferris enjoying her share of dango, and only dango in all of her meals. Everyday!To give an insight, Hero Relics are assumed to be sources of immense power that can overthrow an entire empire, something Sion desires to have available at his disposal so that he can make his empire a force to be recognized. You can easily understand Ryner and Ferris wouldn\'t be the only ones on the hunt. As Ryner and Ferris keep searching for the relics, putting his absolute faith on both of them, Sion follows his dream to make an empire where everyone would have a wonderful life. Something that comes with a price indeed; Coup d\'état followed by numerous assassination attempts from time to time from power hungry nobles and their followers. I won\'t say anymore than this. Rest are for you to find out, because it goes far beyond anything as simple as it might seem as you\'ve just read.The story is surprisingly good. I always tend to enjoy anime with lots of flashbacks, past happenings which often help a story to grow. Denyuuden, as what it is called in short, really is impressive on that regard. While the first episode is more like an introductory episode that goes to show the main characters involved in the anime, the following couple of episodes show flashbacks from where it all began, why Ryner set for the journey to find the relics, why Ferris has been appointed as his companion, and how, young Sion came to throne. These two episodes (2 and 3) are basically the foundation of the story that will take so many turns here and there as more characters are blended in while making the anime all too enjoyable, that when you will look back, you will be thrilled to realize how simply it all started. The story has unimaginable twists and when you think a character was included just for the sake of it, they will surprise you with the role they are going to play in the development of the whole story. Story wise, this couldn\'t be any better. And I dare say, I have seen lots of anime already to make such a rather bold statement.The anime can be seen as from both the characters\' point of views, as well as from the political aspects involved, which makes it a very intelligent anime. For example, the decisions Sion makes as a King often conflict with his philosophy, but he shoulders everything as a King should, refusing to give in to his ideals. At the same time, the conflicting nature of the characters within themselves makes it a very heartfelt anime. Like Ryner, who has been through enough, shows lack of emotion, although he cares for every living thing around him, ironically though, he puts threat on those around him just through his very existence. Ferris, who is always mocking Ryner doesn\'t falter to hold him dearly when he really needs it the most. And the anime translates a society that is ruled by the so called nobles and their hunger for power, and a society where everyone brands certain people as \'monsters\' for the inhuman power they possess, ironically again, something they wish they never have possessed, something they were born with in the first place.The characters are nicely depicted. From the absolute loyalty of the subordinates of Sion, for instance General Claugh Klom, to the emotional involvements of the members of the Roland Taboo Hunter team, (yeah, you have to know Milk Callaud (Fujita Saki) and her reverse-harem :P) everything makes sense. Characters making their entrance halfway through the series, for instance, the Hero-King of Gastark, Riphal Edea (Nakai Kazuya), or even the late, very late introduction of Tiia Rumiblue (Sakurai Takahiro) has been intensifying. And there are mysterious characters like Ferris\' older brother Lucile (Sugita Tomokazu), Sion\'s right hand Miran Froaude (Suwabe Junichi) and Milk Callaud\'s second in command Luke Stokkart (Hino Satoshi) will make you ponder to understand their every move and their motives. You must have been really annoyed by now to see all those seiyuus in the bracket. But the reason behind putting them there is to show the number of popular voice-casts have been working on this anime, justifying the weight of the characters being portrayed overall.The animation quality is really of top notch. The backgrounds are nicely animated and gives you the feel of a feudal European setting coupled with magical terrains and mysterious plains. The actions are simply put, stunning. From the magical circles that Ryner draws before unleashing the commands, to Ferris\' sword fights are animated smoothly without any glitch. Like I warned before, watching online streams, or stream-rips will kill half the real enjoyment. The fierce battles, magic circles, blood gores; you really cant enjoy them over low quality streams. This is not an anti-FUNi claim, just a fact which you can clearly confirm if you google the anime\'s screenshots/screencaptures. I would rather you buy the DVD/Blu-rays when they are out.The sound, particularly the BGM of the anime is really good. They change and merge so nicely with the mood that it makes the anime vibrant. One of the major contributions of BGMs is to propagate the emotional state of mind of the characters involved and Denyuuden scores a perfect 10/10 in that aspect. I would also like to say that the OP/EDs are really good, and grow into you as you continue the anime.The only downside of the anime is probably every time it wants to pull a comedy. I would say it failed miserably to make me laugh even once.[Edit X: the following bits under [Ignore][/Ignore] was a conclusion I came up at episode 18.

You just never know.]', 'Titles are essential in most forms of entertainment in order to draw attention. Titles, however, can also be misleading. Such was the case for me and the anime series entitled The Legend of the Legendary Heroes. It may be have been just me, but for some reason I did not find the title to be particularly appealing and it certainly did not paint an image that seemed interesting to me—it felt too simple, too exaggerated. Then again, titles can be misleading.The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is a fantasy piece—a tale of magic and war in land inspired by Europe during the Middle Ages. It...deals with Feudal Warfare, more or less. Its focus lies in a number of characters, each taking up a particular role in shaping the world that they reside in. The Roland Empire is the country brought into our attention. At its throne lies the striving Sion Astal, a king of quite a young age, but one that has decided to do everything within his power to change his kingdom for the good. Things are looking better than they have been for a while in Roland, but the greatest battle has yet to take place, for behind the shadows lie assassination attempts to overthrow the king and various conflicts between the neighboring countries.Sion Astal knows that in order to prevail and fulfill his dream of changing the world for good he must find alternative ways of going about the problem. Therefore, he sends his good friend Ryner Lute, whom he made a promise to make the world a better place, and Ferris Eris, a female swordsman stemming to a clan in charge of guarding the king, beyond the borders of Roland and upon a journey to search for ancient relics that are said to have once belonged to a great warrior. These relics may hold the power to single-handedly turn the tides of battle in the bearer’s favour.Apart from the three aforementioned characters, which could be called the most important ones in the series, there are still lots of other ones that receive a notable amount of screen time and are quite vital to the progress of the story, such as Sion Astal’s right-hand man Miran Froaude (a highly interesting character that remains as puzzling in the end as he ever was) or Milk Callaud, the captain of Roland’s taboo-breaker squad who has her own personal reverse harem.Too many anime series like to paint their characters in black or white, but The Legend of the Legendary Heroes always remains in the gray area with most of its characters. Sure, Ryner Lute is a typical protagonist, yet even he has some pretty dubious past experiences. What’s fascinating is the way we gain a different perspective on certain characters, since some tend to change their alignment (or so it appears, at least) or something about them is revealed that puts them in a completely different light. Flashbacks are no stranger in this anime and they are often used in clever ways, usually giving us more insight about the characters and their principles (or their lack of them), but they also tend to become dull or overused at times (so everyone had a bad childhood—how convenient).Magic plays an important part in The Legend of the Legendary Heroes. The person most in contact with it is Ryner Lute, who is actually one of Roland’s greatest magicians (not many know this since he prefers afternoon naps over battles) and an Alpha Stigma bearer, meaning his eyes can detect forms of magic, but he is cursed as much as he is blessed, for those possessing the Alpha Stigma tend to go out of control and destroy everything in their path if things get too intense. There’s certainly some sword fighting to be had throughout the series (especially from Ferris’ part), but most battles are fought using magic. Thankfully, the fight scenes are very well-done and they’re always highly entertaining and easy to decipher (no weird camera angles or hurried editing here, don’t worry).One of this anime’s most impressive aspects is the story. It may not be innovative or original, but it’s executed in a spectacular manner, often exploring different themes or following several plot paths all at once. The main storyline never feels neglected, but somehow the series always finds time to develop other things at the same time and offer each of its characters satisfactory screen time. The episodes work great because their filled with a lot of variety, often featuring fashbacks and focusing on several plot points. The Legend of the Legendary Heroes gets a lot done in twenty minutes’ time, always remaining entertaining yet never feeling rushed or overloaded.The art and animation is truly excellent, often eye-popping, but it does exhibit some problems. For one, some of the characters’ facial expressions could have been drawn better, especially when it came to scenes depicting comedy. My other gripe is with an episode about halfway through the series which uses a different art style from the rest of the episodes. The reason why the anime changed styles was because the episode was more action-packed than the usual ones, but that still doesn’t excuse the fact that that certain episode felt too unfamiliar to work in balance with the rest of the series.Perhaps the most important drawback of this anime is its conclusion, or rather the lack thereof. While the series does not end with a cliff-hanger, it does leave most things open for a supposed sequel. However, a sequel coming out or not completely depends on how well this anime does on a financial level (it hasn’t been doing very well up to this point from what I’ve heard). So before deciding whether to give The Legend of the Legendary Heroes a watch or not, you might want to take into consideration the fact that things may never be resolved if no sequel is produced (of course, we’ll always have the light novels to ease that pain).Despite such flaws, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes remains an excellent fantasy anime series. The story is very well done, the characters are thoroughly interesting and adopt shades of gray instead of black and white and every episode is as enjoyable as the previous one.

Don’t let its corny title be the deciding factor when it comes to considering whether The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is worth your time.', 'The unique (and corny) name is what got my interest in this anime. I read the description looking forward to a great plot that contained fantasy and adventure, but it ended up with trite comedy, disappointment and magic tricks.Story: 6/10General Scenario:The beginning (first two episodes) was dare I say, terrible? It\'s most likely to turn viewers off leaving them to think ""I\'ll pass"". It jumps around, confusing the viewer instead of being intriguing. The story contains Ryner Lute being a lazy student and Ryner as well as Ferris searching for relics. It\'s much more than that but unfortunately it doesn\'t evolve everything it introduces. For...example: What happened to the people of the land that was conquered by Roland? There was not a significant follow up. How about God\'s Eye group (the group of kids who were outcast because of Alpha Stigma)? You would think Ryner would be concerned about them. They should have used less of their time on Ferris love for Dango and more on the plot. It was like they were trying to cram a whole plot into 24 episodes, when in order to develop the plot into a masterpiece for what they were trying to present, it needed more time than that. A concept does not guarantee an excellent finished product.Form of Development/Pace:The pace was moderate for each individual episode, but overall I would say it\'s fast even though it doesn\'t seem that way. Since it tries to cram a lot of information in 24 episodes, a lot of development is left out of the loop.Sides stories/ Extra space:There are no fillers however there is one recap episode.Believable?It\'s believable it\'s just poorly done to where people connect with the story itself.The Conclusion:The Legend of the Legendary Hereos\' conclusion was a big disappointment, reminding me of the ending of the atrocity known as Pandora Hearts /パンドラハーツ,/ Pandora Hātsu (I haven\'t done a review on that but I should. I\'m already expecting hate mail for that review). It ended with a test of friendship (23rd episode) and bringing back people that the anime left behind but not to contribute to the plot it was more like ""hey, these people you forgot about they are still alive"" kind of feel (24th episode). It also left the viewer to ask what in the hell was the story about? Was it about finding relics, a legend of legendary heroes or was it attempting to be about the struggle of existing as an outcast (Ryner) and the burden of wearing a mask (Sion and Ferris, when it came to her issues and how she acted them out on Ryner)? Conclusion are supposed to bring the plot together and make the viewer at peace because of everything made sense it\'s not supposed to leave you hanging with a lot of questions unanswered.What kept my interest:What kept my interest as the viewer is wondering how will the characters overcome their struggles. Sion with the pressure of trying to produce a ""perfect world"", a more harmonious world. Ryner finding true happiness leaving the mental despair of the Alpha Stigma behind and Ferris with her mental trauma, how will she overcome her fear of abandonment by those who loves her and her truly learning how to display love. (Instead of putting up walls and beating Ryner up and jokingly at his character for comic relief would she ever come to a place where she is truly vulnerable.)Explanation of rating:At most I would rate this story 6 out of 10. 6, meaning fine. It had the potential to be great but failed but at the same time it\'ll keep your interest anyways. Critically I would rate it a 4 (4 meaning bad), instead of the comic relief it could have used that time for plot. Black Butler /黒執事/ Kuroshitsuji is an example of funny moments but the plot is more essential and the comedy does not attempt to make up for lack of plot. However I did wonder how it would all pan out so at most I would give it a 6 for fine because some might love the hell out of it despite it\'s flaws while others looking at it critically would recognize what a big disappointment it is.Art: 8/10The artwork is splendid. It would have been better if had a great plot to flow with. I love the color schemes and the details and colors of the character costumes. Ferris costume is a treat with her purple and pink costume. This anime contained nice reflections and magic effects esp. the glow of the Alpha Stigma eyes, beautiful sunsets and detailed and fitting backgrounds. There isn\'t much to complain about the artwork. I don\'t remember one episode where I felt that the art team was slacking off on their job so with that I would give the artwork 8 out of 10. 8 meaning very good.Sound: 7/10The beginning theme and (especially) end theme compliments the series. The end theme were the better out of the two but nothing outstanding that makes me wanna rate higher. I like themes that encourage me to learn the lyrics not fast forward or skip if I have a chance. The background music was good though, it complimented the artwork and theme of the story. There were no annoying voices so that was a plus. So I would give it an 7 out of 10, 7 meaning good.Character: 6/10I would rate the character 6 out of 10, 6 meaning fine. The main characters Ryner, Ferris and Sion have issues that one can relate or sympathize with. That what makes them appealing to the story. Ryner have been rejected by society and still consider those who reject him well being. He often struggles with the will to go on in a world that hates him. Ferris has her trauma from her parents and she acts that out on Ryner with joking about his behavior being lewd and perverted while physically hitting him. Sion abandoned by one parent while the other one died, rose to power . He carries the burden of the world on his shoulders by trying to do the right thing. If the story was right it would have been beautiful to see how Sion finds balance in ruling a kingdom and being happy, Ryner would have overcome his struggle and Ferris would have faced her trauma and how it has affected her behavior towards a person she obviously cared about... Ryner. None of that happened instead the potential for great characters who could overcome were left how they were found in the ending. No significant progression at all.With the side characters, they were introduced but some of them weren\'t effectively utilized to be a benefit to the story.Enjoyment: 7/10Episode by episode I enjoyed the anime after the beginning the first two episodes in particular. However on an all overall scheme I\'m disappointed esp. with the conclusion.Overall: 6/10It averages out to a 6.8, most of that would be due towards the non-plot reviews so that should be taken into consideration. I\'m putting down to 6 so it wouldn\'t give any false hope. This might be an anime where the viewer has to watch again to catch little details to be satisfied with the plot but that shouldn\'t be necessary and wouldn\'t be necessary if it was written well.Would I recommend to someone else? I don\'t think I would. If you are fond of the animation for cosplay reasons and can handle the first two episodes then buy all means go for it but don\'t say I didn\'t warn you.Final notes:Even though I heavily criticized this anime I liked it and enjoyed it despite it\'s flaws. :-) example: What happened to the people of the land that was conquered by Roland? There was not a significant follow up. How about God\'s Eye group (the group of kids who were outcast because of Alpha Stigma)? You would think Ryner would be concerned about them.

If you are fond of the animation for cosplay reasons and can handle the first two episodes then buy all means go for it but don\'t say I didn\'t warn you.Final notes:Even though I heavily criticized this anime I liked it and enjoyed it despite it\'s flaws. :-)', 'This is the very first review i made on this site, so please dont kill me.When i just saw this anime, and base only in his title, i really dont expect anything beyond decent.Fortunally i was wrong, and maybe my rate on this anime is strongly based on that, dont get me wrong, it is good, but the low expectative that i have at first help to rate it high.So ok, the history itself its nothing special, a prince that want to become king to help his people and his friend that hides his real power in a medieval world with magic and monster.The really...good part its the way this history is told, the development of the main plot its just excelent, full of misteries and complots, it just feels realistic in that way, and the journey of the main protagonist it equally awesome, in a way i felt it like the beginning of Slayers.The characters are just awesome, Ryner the ""hero"" and his partner Ferris together made like 70% of the comedy of the show, but at the same time keep you interested in the sad past of Ryner, and the love-hate relationship with Ferris its too much fun.Also the way that Sion changes since became king its just what you expect of someone in that position and the ""not too good things"" that he has to do in order to keep order and make a change.The art and sound are great, full of color on the battles and the silly moments, and dark and pale on the sad and intrige momments, also the music just keep you in the mood of what is happening.The characters desings, once again, remind me a little bit of Slayers but a loot more stylish.I truly enjoy it, and actually has a plot, it really feel refreshing watch this after so many silly animes, and if you like medieval-magic action with a bit of comedy, i really recommend give this anime a try.PD: i really cant believe a series with a soo cliche title is actually good. good part its the way this history is told, the development of the main plot its just excelent, full of misteries and complots, it just feels realistic in that way, and the journey of the main protagonist it equally awesome, in a way i felt it like the beginning of Slayers.The characters are just awesome, Ryner the ""hero"" and his partner Ferris together made like 70% of the comedy of the show, but at the same time keep you interested in the sad past of Ryner, and the love-hate relationship with Ferris its too much fun.Also the way that Sion changes since became king its just what you expect of someone in that position and the ""not too good things"" that he has to do in order to keep order and make a change.The art and sound are great, full of color on the battles and the silly moments, and dark and pale on the sad and intrige momments, also the music just keep you in the mood of what is happening.The characters desings, once again, remind me a little bit of Slayers but a loot more stylish.I truly enjoy it, and actually has a plot, it really feel refreshing watch this after so many silly animes, and if you like medieval-magic action with a bit of comedy, i really recommend give this anime a try.PD: i really cant believe a series with a soo cliche title is actually good.', '\'Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu (Legend of the Legendary Heroes)\' is a medieval fantasy adventure about Ryner Lute, a social outcast born with powerful magic eyes, and his friend the new king Sion Astral\'s quest to end all wars.Story/Character:It\'s impossible to watch this show without being reminded of similar themed series. For example, the magical medieval setting of \'Scrapped Princess\', art style of \'Koukaku no Regios\', magic eyes of \'Code Geass\', and knighthood and characters of \'Fate/stay night"". However, this show had the mother of all premises by blending all the best qualities from such series with an interesting mission of collecting ""Hero\'s Relics"".With such...a cool mix of setting, characters, and items, we could\'ve expected a captivating epic adventure. What we actually got was a rather dull, huge mess of a story.First of all, the show had an awful story flow. A classic case of poor anime adaptation of a novel where the story jumps from one place to another. One minute, you\'re watching Ryner and Ferris trying to find Hero\'s Relics. Next minute, you\'re back in kingdom where Sion is working. Then jump back 5 (?) years before returning to a new adversary we\'ve never seen before. Unlike novels, this effect on anime makes it nearly impossible to empathize with characters.The character motivation is always questionable. All the kings are fighting for the same dumb reason: ""Slaughter all my neighbors to stop war"". This is 2010... there are already so many anime and movies about such contradicting and cliché themes. There were also a lot of scenes where characters are obviously capable of accomplishing a better result, yet simply give up or their spells are nerfed just to achieve the desired plot development. For example, the destruction of bridge by Kiefer in the final episode when she could\'ve clearly crossed first before destroying it. Such inconsistencies are usually unnoticeable in novels, but with visual support in anime, it just doesn\'t make any sense.There also was a deliberate power balancing and DBZ-like increment of average strengths. For example, Ryner and Ferris have not been able to obtain a single Hero\'s Relic, while far weaker antagonists manage to obtain and use them as their primary means of attack. In addition, somehow the victors don\'t seem to be interested in collecting the loser\'s Relic after defeating them. The story is very much driven by sudden appearance of new adversaries. One minute, a character seems to be invincibly strong, then a new foe appears, and previous antagonist doesn\'t even stand a chance. The prime examples are Sui Orla, Miran Frouade, and Tiia Rumiblue. On the other hand, our hero and heroine seem to be able to put up a decent fight no matter how strong or weak the opponent is (they even struggle against minions).There were way too many characters for 24 episodes. Not only that, most of them had very limited role and weak presence. I just browsed through the character list, and didn\'t even remember half of them. That\'s how bad the side characters were. And then we have the hero and the heroine, who were just lazy Lelouch Lamperouge (\'Code Geass\') and outgoing Saber (\'Fate/stay night). Despite Ryner having Alpha Stigma, he only casted about 4 different spells, 80% of which being ""Lightning"".The comedy was funny at first, but it got tedious through uncreative repetition of dango and sleep. A lot of action scenes, but not very exciting unless Alpha Stigma is fully activated. The story tries to be dark in the second half, but it just seemed out of place due to light first half, and didn\'t make sense. Overall, very boring, corny story and character.Animation:Amazing, considering a large portion of animation work was subcontracted to Korean studios.Characters are usually very detailed, and every character is easily distinguishable. While the background is not as detailed as it could be, the change in mood through lighting worked well.SFX was wonderful in action scenes and with magic circle or spells.Unfortunately, the presentation (camera angles, cuts, art style, action choreography etc) were rather dull, and seemed lazy.Sound:Loads of established seiyuu even in minor roles. Some annoying, but on annoying characters to begin with, so it was somewhat tolerable. Everyone sound like they should, especially Ferris\' voice was great.While Ryner played by Fukuyama Jun was excellent, I can\'t help but notice how his voice was exactly same as Lelouch in \'Code Geass\' series. The two characters are already similar as it is (both having magic eyes), having the same seiyuu completely cemented Ryner as a cheap copy. The evil/mad laugh really was godly though, the best I\'ve ever heard.BGM in battle and emotional scenes were well done and dramatic. The rest are rather ordinary and forgettable, but didn\'t sound out of place.All four OP/ED in the series were pretty catchy and suit the series.Enjoyment:This series was by far the most disappointing series of the season (ending Fall). By episode 3, this series had such a strong introduction that it could\'ve easily been an fascinating fantasy series, but it seemed to deteriorate by the episode from there, eventually leading to an inconclusive ending where nothing is explained and half the deliberate plot devices unused.From boring story, character, to lazy animation and voice acting casting choice, what this series suffered through was a widespread absence of creativity. Zexcs once again proves their incompetence, and this show did not live up to its title as the \'Legend of the Legendary Heroes\'.

It was an epic failure.', ""The synopsis for this anime really does it no justice, there is much more going on then them just searching for relics. Honestly, the relic searching did not really last all that long. One thing that stood out to me in this anime is it was actually very funny, there should have been a comedy genre added, however, comedy was not the only thing that caught my attention.The premise of the story could seem a bit cliche, there are quite a few other anime where the main has an incredible power and has to overcome the effects of a past that held...many hardships due to this power, but nonetheless this anime was still pretty great. It was enjoyable to see the hardships that Ryner had endured throughout his life and how he was able to overcome them. Also, they put quite a bit of back story on the other characters, such as Sion and Ferris, which was nice to see. That backstory adds a better connection to the characters as they face the conflicts together. Now onto my specific review points.Story 8/10As I stated above, it does seem at first glance to be a cliche of sorts, but the synopsis is quite under-developed. There is more than just them searching for relics, much of it is based on the power that Ryner has and the hardships that came and are to come from it. Also, the comical parts in this story were quite enjoyable as well, whether it be the constant whining or witty remarks of Ryner about his naps, or Ferris' constant belittling of Ryner with her large imagination of perversion.Art 7/10The art was not anything spectacular, although it was well done and they did not use many shortcuts. They had a good amount of detail as well. The gore scenes usually had some sort of shade above them not making them easy to see, but it was still good drawn overall.Sound 7/10The sound was ok. Nothing really struck me as really bad, or really good, it matched fine, but it did lack in some respects. The English voice acting was pretty good, the main characters seemed to match well with the voice actors. I have no speculation on the Japanese voice actors, as I have not watched the subbed.Character 8/10I liked the fact they gave lots of back-ground information on the other main characters and didn't just focus of Ryner. The flash backs and the information on Ryner was very tragic and gave a lot of meaning to the story.Enjoyment 9/10The story was great. I loved the way the characters were portayed, being that Ryner is a lazy guy that has witty remarks, and Ferris having the very funny imagination. The comedy in this anime was very funny, even though there was not a comedy tag. Also, being that Ryner was so powerful, it was cool to see how he progressed with his power, and how he gave it meaning.Overall 8/10I really enjoyed this anime. There were many aspects I did not plan to see, such as the comedy, and the small amount of romance. Many people may see it as cliche and boring, but the synopsis really does it no justice. So give this anime a try, and maybe you too, will find it to be a great watch. many hardships due to this power, but nonetheless this anime was still pretty great.

I mean, just by looking at the name, generic character designs, boring looking synopsis and a badly done first episode, it is very easy to dismiss the series as an uninteresting fantasy based around the same old beaten-to-the-death ideas. But here's the thing, although the name suggests otherwise, deep down Denyuden is a charming series which knows how to take itself seriously.Based on a novel series which was published in 2002, Denyuden is a story of Ryner Lute, a lazy guy who wants nothing more...than to sleep for ten thousand years, and his relationship with his best friend, Sion Astal, an idealist king who finds himself facing the harsh reality of the world. The story follows Ryner as he tries to deal with the world who sees him just as a monster, and Sion, who finds himself getting further and further away from the dream of creating an ideal country without any sadness. I have to say, Denyuden walks a very dangerous line as it tries to mix humor with themes like drama and betrayal, but it manages very well and I just loved the way the mood suddenly changes from silly comedy to deadly politics in this show. Not only that, there are many other elements like saving the world, sad childhood, betrayal, young leaders etc which can easily go wrong and destroy the show, but they are used well and only contribute in making the show more enjoyable.The staff behind Denyuden is pretty unimpressive, but I have to admit, they did a very good job on this series. The series doesn’t try to be too ambitious, and slowly builds up its characters and fleshes out its setting. The first half of the series, pretty much does nothing more than introducing characters and giving them a clear role. Many of the subplots are just there for the character introduction. The second half of the series uses all that building up efficiently and things suddenly pick up pace and that’s where the show really starts shining. The characters starts developing in the way you want them to, the story starts becoming very interesting and series throws away most of its humor and finally gives you the awesomeness its first arc promised.Although the story of Denyuden is not the series’ best part, it is still impressive. There are many interesting elements in the plot(Alpha stigma, Hero relics) and as the plot moves further, the questions just keep on increasing. The series also does a very good job on answering the questions yet not answering them. Many answers are followed by even more questions. Also there are many hidden answers in the series itself. The downside to this is that it may leave a few confusing parts but that can be solved by re-watching the series after you have finished it.The setting of the series may not be too special itself, but the way it is used, getting fleshed out by its politics, makes it very interesting. I love the way the characters are influenced by the world they live in. There are many myths and legends in the world of Denyuden and the way they effect the main plot also proves very enjoyable.Now, the best part of the series, the characters. Yes, the characters of this series are just awesome. Whether it’s the main characters or the side characters, all of them have distinct personalities and are really fun to watch. I just love the main characters. They are just fleshed out really well. I especially liked how Ferris, who at one time was really annoying, turns enjoyable in the end. Same goes for the side characters. Even the annoying ones like Milk. They all turn charming later in the series. I also like how there are many flashbacks in the story. Normally too many flashbacks are boring for me, but here they tell that the characters don’t forget what happens and try to develop themselves. This is true for especially Ryner. He was good at the beginning of the series, but he really developed in the series and by the end, he turns into a really fantastic character.The opening and ending themes of this series are okay, but I really love the voice acting here. It really brings life to the characters. And the use of BGM is pretty good too. The art isn’t too bad but nothing awesome either. I really liked the animation of the last arc, but apart from that it’s nothing that stands out.Well, to sum up and add some stats to the review:Story (9/10): Impressive and keeps you interested till the endSound (9/10): Impressive voice acting and use of musicAnimation (8/10): Nothing special here although I liked the work they did on the last arcCharacters (10/10): Really awesome characters. Loved everyone of themOverall (10/10): I loved Denyuden and it’s certainly one of my favorites.I would also like to add that if you are wondering whether to watch the show or not, just give the show a chance and watch the first arc(first 4 episodes) and then decide whether to continue or not. than to sleep for ten thousand years, and his relationship with his best friend, Sion Astal, an idealist king who finds himself facing the harsh reality of the world.

After a twist of fate he ends up taking over the throne and is determined to change the Kingdom of Roland for the better.It sounds very cliche at this point and all (and there\'s no reason why one wouldn\'t think that) but don\'t let that turn you off.The anime keeps it happy and fun be following the journey of Ryner Lute and Ferris Eris whom -under Sion\'s orders- are on a ""secret mission"" to seek out the Legendary Hero relics...in the name of ""world peace""! Or something like that.Again, it might sound cliche but the fact that Ryner and Ferris were forced to work together and each have their personal quirks make all of their interactions so amusing to watch.(For example: Ryner -the real main character of the show- is the laziest guy ever and always prefers to take naps over doing anything. Ferris is a beautiful ""assassin"" who\'s quick to resorting to violence [[at least towards Ryner]] easily twists and misinterprets situations in weird ways and [arguably] is only devoted to dangos [A kind of dessert/snack made up of several sweet sticky mochi-like balls that are ""shish-kabobbed"" on long thin sticks]Throw in a few more characters with equally weird quirks/moments and magic & mystery behind the Legendary relics and you\'ve got potential for a amusing and fun series!However it\'s not all fun and games as something dark & mysterious is also hidden beneath the plot....I recommend checking out this anime to anyone who\'s interested at all in anime with this type of setting/backdrop and those who like a good mix of action and comedy but also don\'t mind dark twists/drama, etc.----------------------------My personal ratings and few other random comments:((This part down here has now been changed to reflect my impressions up to episode 18))Story: 9** The political side (aka Sion\'s side) of the plot can be rather confusing & unclear sometimes if you\'re not paying attention especially towards the beginning but if you get the general gist it\'s enough to understand everything else.The other parts of the story are somewhat slow-paced and the episodes are constantly littered with cliffhanger endings but when it\'s all pieced together it\'s an epic story filled with a good balance of comedy and twists and those touching moments that make you feel sad for the characters.Art: 6**Colors are generally ""soft and smooth"" and not ""stressful"" to the eye. It also tends to use ""bright colors"" more than other color tones....though that\'s not to say the show doesn\'t know how to use dramatic lighting ---It\'s done well enough for those key dramatic moments, etc. A pretty standard yet fitting art style.Sound: 8**It\'s never bothered me so it\'s not bad to say the least. I think it\'s more or less fit in nicely with the moods of various parts as well (otherwise It would have bothered me) By the way, OP and ED songs are pretty good/catchy unlike other series I\'ve seen.Character: 7**Character backgrounds are only expanded on when the episode/plot pacing finds it necessary. This can lead to a good mix of well-timed character introductions vs the not so well-timed ones. At least the main 3 (Sion, Ryner, and Ferris) do not suffer from a lack of enough character development. Overall I\'d say the major characters have been expanded well like they deserve while most minor characters (and sadly- a few major characters) have yet to have a purpose establishedEnjoyment: 9**Outside of the Sion moments (Yes I\'m sorry Sion...I find you mostly boring) The other parts are either action packed or full of amusing conversations/situations that even something as mundane as walking through a town or forest can turn into something amusing. I really enjoy watching every episode and always can\'t wait for the next to air.Overall:As of what I\'ve seen so far, I give an overall score of 8...but that may change later on... in the name of ""world peace""!

Overall I\'d say the major characters have been expanded well like they deserve while most minor characters (and sadly- a few major characters) have yet to have a purpose establishedEnjoyment: 9**Outside of the Sion moments (Yes I\'m sorry Sion...I find you mostly boring) The other parts are either action packed or full of amusing conversations/situations that even something as mundane as walking through a town or forest can turn into something amusing. I really enjoy watching every episode and always can\'t wait for the next to air.Overall:As of what I\'ve seen so far, I give an overall score of 8...but that may change later on...', ""Let's get this out of the way first. The name. Legend of the legendary heroes? It must be a translation mistake right? I'm sure no one would call out the translators if it was just shortened to Legendary Heroes.So a couple years ago I got the entire series for FREE on itunes. Thats right folks it didn't even cost me a dime. Like any anime fan I downloaded it without a second thought, I didn't even look at the summary. But after 15 minutes of the first episode I turned off my computer and walked away, never turning back to see the rest of...the series.  Lesson learned from this - there was a reason why this series was for free.But lo and behold! Years later I find it on Netflix. It's like this series haunts me!! This time I watched the whole thing.AnimationIt's plain! it's like a cardboard cutout of the definition of anime. It didn't stand out to me at all.Soundwhile the music wasn't bad it wasn't amazing either. It was just there.StoryNow imagine Berserk and attack on titan had a child. That unholy offspring would be this. Now if done correctly itd be an amazing anime, but the writing had no structure.The begining was bad. Didn't hold my attention at all.Although once the story started explaining itself and I became attatched to the characters and knew their background. Then that's when this anime truly got me interested.But the ending is where it all fell apart. That excitement it built shattered instantly. This anime expained nothing. When I thought it was going explain something it'd turn around and leave me with even more questions than before. How did Sion ever become king? What did Sion do the 2 or so years Ryner was in prison? What is going on the entire last episode?! Seriously someone explain that last episode to me!Charactershonestly 75% of the characters were useless and could have been cut from the show entirely and it wouldn't have effected this anime one bit.I dont understand how some people are giving this 10/10 rating. Was it a masterpiece? Absolutely not. But it did have some redeming qualities. For a while there I would have given this anime an honest 8/10. But after the last 4 episodes that 8 dropped so far it became a 5. By the end of it all I felt like I wasted my time and unfortunately there is no way I'll ever get back the hours I wasted on this show.If you want a better  fantasy/action anime I point you to Berserk.

The legend of Zelda, the legend of Excalibur, the legend of leisure suit Larry. Likewise it also isn’t usual for many Legends to carry hero in their titles; Legend of Condor heroes and the legend of Galactic heroes are two good examples of this particular trend. However, this series I’m about to review (in my now trademarked half-assed style) does what very few series before have dared to do. It gives itself a name so damn awesome you’ll cream yourself every time you think about it. Welcome to Legend of the Legendary Heroes (DenYuDen!).CharactersWith a name as...awesome as this, the story has to be good. I\'m guessing probably full of action, epic battles, great characters and manri men. Well, if you (like me) thought that was the case you couldn\'t be anymore wrong. Try dumplings, tsundere, more dumplings and assassination attempts that clearly aren\'t Ezio based(ubisoft, western?... ok ok tenchu based then) . The plot is exactly as written in the title; the primary (and often randomly exploited) story is about a search for legendary hero artifacts from a past age, called legendary hero relics(very original). You might want to bring a map for this one as you\'ll have almost no clue where this story is headed. One episode they\'ll be searching for the hero relics(and failing) and the next episode Ryner and Ferris will be wasting minutes discussing dumplings in a very bakemonogatari like banter. There\'s literally little to no consistency in this shows tone. Which really wouldn\'t be so bad if that was what they were aiming for. However, that is definitely not the case as you\'ll see that shortly after these episodes about dumplings, going on a date and various other things(that belong on a slice of life show and not a show with the name legend) we are given massacres, wars and tales of hidden corruption. As a result this show has no flow, no sense of direction. Now I\'m well aware that this was originally a light novel and perhaps this style of narration worked best for that format. But for an anime? Many times I found myself confused at to what was going on. This especially worsened towards the end. Where I assume the producers/studio found out that they had blown their budget and poorly managed the episodes and now suddenly had to fit 100 plot devices into the last 2-3 episodes. Seriously, I don\'t even know if what happened at the end could even be called a cliffhanger. It all just felt very anti-climatic and rushed. Cliffhangers are supposed to build the tension for a possible(or in this case improbable) continuation. All this ending did was build more confusion. There are so many questions left unanswered at the end. Who is Ferris\' brother? Why is Gastark so desperately after the relics? What is the point to all this Lonesome Devil Dark Hero business ? I fear at the rate they\'re going even if they did continue this series it would take at least another 2 seasons before any of these questions get answered. And we\'ll all be left no doubt with a feeling that it was 2 seasons 2 many(ahahah...no?). Be that as it may the story does captivate it\'s audience and if you get past the slow beginning you\'ll definitely find something moderately interesting. For that reason alone it gets a 7/10.StoryThe characters. Ah what would a show be without its characters(what would a daimyo review be without random questions and comments)? First and foremost we have Grif...Sion Astal as this shows black knight.  He starts off with good intentions(conquering the world), a coup and later down the road begins to ask himself where all of this went wrong. It isn\'t Sion\'s fault though, Sion\'s mom was a commoner and his father was a noble so it completely makes sense to us the viewers when we see things like Sion being split into two personalities. His first personality and the personality that defines his character as whole (as it sets the tone for yaoi fanfiction writers across the globe) is the typical shojo male.  Flamboyant and visually effeminate it is the face he usually shows when talking to Ryner(suspicious). It is also the one usually displayed during this show\'s ending credits. His 2nd personality however is what I would describe as the serious fucking business look. Anything can happen when he displays this look ranging from: wars, noble executions and various attempts to kill his best friend. The reason for all these things? I suppose you could explain the first two kingly business and all that but the last one is up for grabs. Is Sion a crazy sadistic mofo(awesome)? Or is he just jealous that Ryner loves Ferris and not him? Who knows, who cares he\'s the villain and that\'s as much as the series wants us to believe. Who needs a motive? Evil is evil guys. Next up we have Ryner what I guess you could call this shows primary protagonist. What you need to know about Ryner is that in Japan people that don\'t work and want to sleep all day are cool dudes(shikimaru, etc). Where just about everywhere else they\'re jackasses (or daimyos). The main difference however, between a Ryner and a Daimyo is a Ryner has no reason to be lazying about all day. Ryner has atleast 3 women who would come(pun) to his every whim and call. The fact that he has what could potentially become a harem makes Ryner anime 2.0 approved. His first bi... love interest is this chick by the name of Kiefer (ran out of good names). Not much needs to be said about her and so I won\'t say anything else. But please do feel free to imagine and ad lib whatever this loquacious Daimyo might say.  His 2nd and by far more tsundere love interest is Ferris (Ferris? Ferris? Ferris Bueller?). Just as you might imagine she loves hitting our main character and subsequently wasting our time pretending not to like him. Many an episode died as these two tried to conceive what would only be described as a bastard plot. Don\'t get me wrong though I\'d love to bone her, but would I marry her? No. My life is what could only be described as an action anime full of suspense, violence, explosions and tissues(don\'t ask). Having her involved would change my life into some sort of mediocre slice of life. And that is exactly what Ferris does to Legend of the Legendary heroes. Her interactions with Ryner while they may seem interesting to some just remove quality from the show. Finally for the last love interest, we must ask ourselves this question. What does a show need to be greenlight for production these days? Random dialogue check, tsundere check, moe check, bishounen males check. Seems like everything doesn\'t it. But in the words of the eternal captain Konata of the USS Fap-J ""Make it loli"". Now you\'ll have to excuse me for not knowing this last ones name off the top of my head so I will just call her Orange Juice. In fact it is my opinion she was just added to ensure that this show maintained anime 2.0 standards. Without Orange Juice, Ryner is just in a love triangle( easily solved when studying rumbling hearts). With her, Ryner has a certified harem. The fact that Orange Juice is also a loli guarantees sales. Now we have other characters and once again simply out of lazyness I won\'t comment on them. Don\'t worry you really aren\'t missing out on anything all we have left is shotas, hentai sized women(mmm), more bishounen and very poorly written blood knights. Once again proving that if you can\'t write a story with a few characters adding a bunch of them won\'t make it any better (though it does make my rants longer). 6/10OverallGoing by the trend in my scores a 7 in the story and a 6 in characters can only be the sign of worse things to come. Normally you would be right but believe it or not I rather enjoyed this series. Now some of you may think I\'ve gone AWOL but it really isn\'t that bad(it isn\'t that good either). The most entertaining stories I found usually had to with Sion\'s story of conquest. I found that the darker elements helped to combat the uneventful I love Lucy type plots. 8/10EntertainmentDespite all it\'s flaws though, unlike another show I rated and review similar to this, Legend of the Legendary Heroes almost never comes off as pretentious. It doesn\'t try to fool the viewers into believing its made a masterpiece of a show. Neither does liking this show require one to kiss the feet of Kagami Takaya, the shows creator. For those reasons alone I am truly grateful. At the end of the day it\'s up to you (or your favourite reviewer) to decide whether or not you will like this show more than let\'s a stardriver or an index. But with so many shows attempting to blend different genres into one mass produced food tablet you\'ll find that no matter what you decide to watch this or next season everything will seem oh so similar. DenyuDen just did it in a way that wasn\'t dreadfully painful to watch. 7/10 awesome as this, the story has to be good.

DenyuDen just did it in a way that wasn\'t dreadfully painful to watch. 7/10', ""Also known as Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, an anime with a silly name if ever there was one. Now where to begin with this one? Densetsu starts off pretty straightforward- a magical fantasy with sword fights, a quest for powerful items, blah dee blah blah, been there, done that. Nothing new. However, I have to admit that my expectations were soon blown out of the water when the show escalated into something much darker and much more ambitious than what it first seemed. To anybody who starts off the series all I can say...is watch until episode three before you decide whether to watch it or not.There's quite a bit of mood-swinging involved where one moment you'll be laughing at the lighthearted talk and the next you'll be watching a bloodbath. The series has its high and low points in its 26 episodes and can be best described as erratic, but not necessarily in a bad way. There's quite a bit of world building (which never really came to fruition). but there's also a lot of character focus (which was way better).The characters were one of the strong points and many of them are fleshed out very well, especially the three main characters who are all likable and have good chemistry. (Also I have to applaud Ryner Lute's English voice actor for an excellent performance- he really brought Ryner to life). However, there are three (or two, your mileage may vary) annoying female characters whose definition of comedy appears to be screaming nonsensical lines nonstop at maximum volume. Please do yourself a favor and cover your ears every time they're onscreen.Other than the three idiots pretty much everyone was interesting- especially Miran, the ruthless guy with seemingly ulterior motives and a thirst for blood. He always managed to spice things up with his psychopathic behavior (and he usually just laughs off the mass murder).So there you have it; watch the Legend of the Legendary Heroes with zero expectations, and you'll probably emerge happy the way I did. I should warn you that though the series did have a good conclusion it's a bit of a cliffhanger (and there probably won't be a second season). Still, I'd recommend Densetsu to anyone interested in a bit of lighthearted/bloody entertainment with nothing better to do. is watch until episode three before you decide whether to watch it or not.There's quite a bit of mood-swinging involved where one moment you'll be laughing at the lighthearted talk and the next you'll be watching a bloodbath.

Even though the 1st ep starts in the middle of action and battle , the following episodes explain in quite well how did Ryner and Sion meet in a military school , how they become friends , it shows Sion's past too thus why he wanted to become king in the first place.

The comedy moments in the middle of a serous battle , Ferris beating up Ryner and so on make this show  worth watching ,because it gives everything .

Perhaps I found it good because I came in with such low expectations after reading the name, but I can definitely say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Truly, one shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.I would say that as of the 18 episodes that I personally have watched, the story has been interesting and captivating.  Although some might argue that parts of it are similar to other shows, it seems pretty unique...and original to me (although I certainly have not watched as much anime as many others).  The main character, Ryner, is fun to relate to, as his extreme laziness and lack of motivation make him somewhat of an antihero.  Other characters each have distinctly interesting personalities, and overall, the voice acting and audio is very good.  The animation quality has been fine throughout the show (in the most recent episode that I have watched, episode 18, the quality slightly decreases, but this is because more attention and detail is given to the action scenes, which, to me, is desirable).  Overall, I would say that this show is a very enjoyable one, and would recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested. and original to me (although I certainly have not watched as much anime as many others).

It isn't necessarily the best anime I have watched nor is it my favorite, but despite this fact it was one of the more compelling and intriguing series that I have watched. This is very surprising to me, because I found many flaws in the way it was executed.Densetsu's first flaw, and arguably its largest is the pacing of the story. For the first half of the anime not much happens. The anime comes off as cliche, repetitive. Ryner, the male...lead of this anime is lazy, and whines about having to do work, Ferris is the emotionless female companion that is there to keep Ryner in line. Whenever Ryner is lazy she gives him a good hit over the head. Both characters seem bland, and uninspiring. This sums up most of the interactions between the two leads for one half of the show.Unfortunately you are not able to skip the first half of the show because there are a few very important events that take place. They often come in the form of flashbacks, and they happen at peculiar times.What the first half of this anime is trying to accomplish is fleshing out the characters, and setting up the story. This is the anime's biggest downfall, too much time is devoted to setting the story up. That being said the second half of this anime is very memorable, and is teetering right on the verge of greatness.This is where the anime shines, this is what makes the anime memorable. It asks the fundamental question: What shapes each person as a human being? What seemed like bland, cookie cutter character suddenly are given a lot of depth. Suddenly the menial day to day interactions that you see in the first half become clear. There is a reason behind the repetitiveness, Ryners laziness, Ferris's relatively emotionless, cold exterior. What seems like a cookie cutter fantasy turns into a multifaceted, deep story line.This anime is slow developing, but the slow development will be well worth your time. What looked to be a bland, cookie cutter anime turned out to be one of the most enjoyable anime that I have ever seen. There were a lot of themes tackled in this anime, and it was done well in my opinion. If not for a lackadaisical first half, and a open ended ending it would have been one of the most talked about anime's of 2010.In reality the story is only just getting started when the anime ended. I think a second season was intended for this anime, but unfortunately it will never happen. You will just have to make due with the visual novels if you enjoyed this anime. All in all this was an anime that was greater than the sum of its parts. lead of this anime is lazy, and whines about having to do work, Ferris is the emotionless female companion that is there to keep Ryner in line. Whenever Ryner is lazy she gives him a good hit over the head. Both characters seem bland, and uninspiring. This sums up most of the interactions between the two leads for one half of the show.Unfortunately you are not able to skip the first half of the show because there are a few very important events that take place. They often come in the form of flashbacks, and they happen at peculiar times.What the first half of this anime is trying to accomplish is fleshing out the characters, and setting up the story. This is the anime's biggest downfall, too much time is devoted to setting the story up.

I really like the kingdom setting where is conflict between the different nations as well as inside one empire. The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is just that.The idea for the series, while nothing original, is really intriguing. But the execution was in one word - BAD.I will divide this review into two parts, the good and the bad of the anime.BAD :Nothing is...explained : Most of the important details are never explained and some are at the end of the series which isn\'t of any use. This leads to confusion and plot holes which leads to a lot of people just dropping the anime, which is fair enough. Who would want to watch something which throws different things at you that you don\'t understand? We are never explained or even told how many hero relics exist and how they were actually formed.Unnecessary Comedy : The comedy is so out of place in this anime, its not even funny. Almost all the important scenes are destroyed by comedy.Inconsistent Power levels : I\'ll give you an example.A is as strong as B. C is almost as strong as B. But C is annihilated by D. Then, D is annihilated by B. No matter what, this shouldn\'t happen.Character Development : The characters don\'t develop, they take a jump from being one personality to another. The main character Reiner is a kind-hearted loving guy at one time while at the other, he is simply lazy and uncaring(I am not talking about his inner demon). His relationship with Ferris develops to one point at around the episode 10 mark and then suddenly, it reverts back to how they were. at the start.Romance : While there isn\'t a whole lot of romance, the amount there is, isn\'t done well at all.  Places where there should be romance doesnt have romance while there is romance between characters we dont know enough about or how they fell for each other.Irregular Pacing : You\'ll never get the feel of what\'s going on in the anime.Good :Concept : The idea was really interesting but it isn\'t executed well enough.Characters : Although the character development isn\'t good, the characters were really likeable. Well, most of them were. I didn\'t like Ferris constantly beating up Reiner. She is just a sadist and has nothing more to her personality.The art and sound is good yet nothing to make a fuss about. They\'re satisfactory I would say.Enjoyment : 6.5/10I am not sure how much I enjoyed the series. I liked the idea and this could have really turned into a great story had it not been for multiple stupid scenes and plot holes.There were some concepts which were opened but never explored. For instance, Reiner should\'ve spent much more time with the people of his kind. Also, this should have happened way earlier in the anime. That had so much potential but the idiotic mangaka couldn\'t see it.Overall - 7/10I know I shouldn\'t be giving this anime a 7 after all the complaints I had about it but there were some really interesting scenes and episodes which had a ton of potential. They were good to watch briefly but the stupidity and some of the nonsensical things that happened brought this anime down. I didn\'t feel the anime had to be in lower than my ""7"" score category, which is the score I give to most of my anime.As for if I recommend the anime or not, I would say watch the first few episodes and decide for yourself. If you can stick with the anime and follow the story without getting bamboozled about what\'s happening after the first 5-6 episodes, then you might come to like it... somewhat. explained : Most of the important details are never explained and some are at the end of the series which isn\'t of any use.

On the surface it is a typical shounen action anime involving magical attacks and a search for mystical objects, and to some extent that is true. However, once the story begins unraveling, and it happens pretty quickly, Legendary Heroes shows that it has much more to offer than fighting and quirky antics.The show starts off in the middle of the protagonist\'s, Ryner Lute, journey for the ""Relics of Heroes,"" a mysterious collection of artifacts that...he and his reluctant partner Ferris Eris have been tasked to find and collect. While these artifacts are supposedly powerful and destructive, Ryner wants to use them to create a world full of ""afternoon naps,"" and to achieve this goal he is supporting his old friend and the current king of Roland Sion Astal. Sion, the ""Hero King of Roland,"" has a similarly lofty and idealistic, though simple, objective - peace.These naive ambitions would probably go unhitched in most shows where they are present, but the Legend of the Legendary Heroes turns the reality of these dreams into the main theme of the whole story; the sacrifices that the characters have to make and the way those losses affect and eventually make impossible the causes they strive for is the driving force that keeps the plot interesting. Each faction has their own needs, and when these needs clash the plot thickens, keeping the anime interesting all throughout. These sort of moments allow for plenty of character and plot progression which always comes at just the right time.The characters themselves are a mixed bag. The ones that aren\'t expanded upon much in the show\'s run come off as shameless archetypes which, though appropriate for their individual role in the story, weakens the believability a bit and makes character interaction much less provocative. The most unfortunate part of this negative aspect is that each episode seemed to have some focus on the side characters that never end up fully developing, leaving the viewer wanting more but knowing they won\'t get much. On the other hand, the characters that do have significant progression are endlessly interesting and show where the plot really shines. Luckily Legendary Heroes seems to know that is where most of its strengths lie and the first arc of sorts is a long flashback explaining Ryner and company\'s current situation, and it is definitely intriguing enough to catch the attention of anyone who might otherwise have been bored with the seemingly typical plotline that is laid out in the first episode.One would expect a good amount of action, and Legendary Heroes certainly delivers. There are plenty of fights to satisfy those looking for flashy magic moves and even some large-scale battles involving plenty of throwaway soldiers and explosions. Unfortunately there isn\'t much variation in the attacks themselves; for example, Ryner doesn\'t even use more than one kind of spell for the whole show despite being heralded as ""the Greatest Mage in Roland"" and being a wielder of the powerful Alpha Stigma. Most of the interesting action surprisingly comes from the otherwise mostly uninteresting side characters, who obviously don\'t have as many fights but when they are the center of attention they show off as much as possible, making their fights the most entertaining.The animation and art are mot much to speak of, outside of one particularly stylistic episode. Normally this wouldn\'t be a huge problem but the grand feeling the show should have is brought down at times by the lackluster visuals when they should ideally be on an equally outstanding level. The music is on a similar level of alright but not noticeable or memorable, again unfortunate given the creative things they could have done with the medieval-inspired setting.Legendary Heroes is an interesting and engaging plot filled with a mixed bag of generic and genuinely entertaining characters, topped off with a fleshed out fantasy world of politics and bloodshed. The things it is brought down by are significant enough to warrant some hesitation, but its assets are truly strong and warrant a chance from anyone who enjoys a well thought out and engaging plot and are willing to look past some of its clear faults and enjoy the whole. he and his reluctant partner Ferris Eris have been tasked to find and collect.

Is it worth spending all that time only to have no finale? No. Absolutely not. There are some stories worth experiencing just for the ride itself, but there are others where every single passage builds to a grand showdown/big reveal/epic sacrifice/whatever only to completely abandon that idea in favor of sequel baiting; here, there is no sequel and won\'t ever be one, so the entire anime is a pointless endeavor from the outset.I\'m entirely serious when I say that all 24 episodes...(to the very last moment) work tirelessly to construct a foundation of mammoth proportions. There are so many side plots and interesting characters built up but 100% of them are unresolved in the end--and it also doesn\'t help that Densetsu\'s primary worldbuilding technique is an over-reliance on flashback sequences. In my estimation 15% of this show is flashbacks, and while I generally loathe that technique it wasn\'t so bad and I could have looked past it. Unfortunately none of it amounts to anything.There are early hints of brilliance with Ryner\'s colossal power level, but besides a titillating peek it never shows itself again. The entire last half I was anticipating it being unleashed but it never came--just like everything else. It\'s like a neverending game of ""no honey, it\'s YOUR turn to enjoy yourself"" where no one gets off and everyone just goes to sleep out of frustration.I\'ve come out of pointless series with good impressions before because, as I said earlier, some journeys are worth experiencing. What differs here is that absolutely everything contributes to setting the snowball rolling downhill. All the little plot developments, character quirks, funny asides, and long philosophical diatribes build and build and build only for the sun to come out and melt the snow before the bottom. So, what do you get for 24 episodes? A decent magic system, snappy animations with impressive backdrops, a large cast of likeable characters where everyone has good motives, a musical score that\'s largely serviceable with flashes of brilliance, and a surprising amount of lighthearted scenarios (episode 23 in particular was extremely good in this regard). What you don\'t get is even a hint of closure, every single narrative thread still open, and an overwhelming sense of ""what the fuck was the point?""What an overwhelming disappointment.

The ones who are born unique to others and have no say, or the ones who hunt them down and kill them due to fear of being overpowered?The title of this anime in English translates to “The Legend of the legendary heroes”, which is a very relevant and fitting name for this anime. It is quite simple and at the same time quite complex. After watching just a few episodes you will understand the meaning, but what I do recommend is that...as you are watching try to figure out the multiple meanings of this anime title, and try not to just categorize this anime title as a “simple one”. Now to begin the adventure of the legendary heroes!The story starts off where you meet two out of the three most important characters. Ryner Lute is with his partner Eris Ferris on a mission to try and collect these “Legendary Hero” relics. At first while watching this anime, like most animes you tend to start off confused and wondering where this show is going to go. You have Ryner Lute who is a magician and holds a secret power within himself. His partner Ferris… man on man what an interesting character to put in an anime that could have been very serious. She practically uses her “charm” as an excuse to bully Ryner. She also bullies Ryner by calling him a “monster” (in a jokingly way) that abducts and does terrible stuff to kids and women. Aside from that she forces Ryner to agree with her, and EVERY mission she has to have her dango, and she uses the excuse to go on missions with Ryner to “protect the dango”.Later on you will meet the last main character who is King Sion Astal. As you can probably tell he is a king, and throughout the anime you learn bits and pieces of why he became king, and what he wanted to achieve as king… the usual. What made this such an interesting story was how you would always learn about the pasts of different characters in like segments and at crucial times during the anime. You learn about why most of them are who they are as the story goes on. You realize though after a while, after learning about all the characters pasts, some main some supporting, that this show could be very powerful and you could learn important life changing lessons. The biggest problem I found with this anime, aside from all the unanswered questions was the character Ferris. I mean I felt like her character (being tsundere) just went overboard at some points. Like at one point it will be very serious and intense and the next she is making fun of Ryner and it completely killed the atmosphere that had been built up.Aside from that, the only minor thing that I was disappointed about was the lack of a presence of Kiefer Knolles. I felt as if she could be one of the most important characters but she kind of just disappeared and reappeared randomly and I personally think she is one of the most important characters, especially for the development of who Ryner Lute really is. Those were the two biggest issues (or really only the issues) that I had with this show.Some things that I really enjoyed about this show were the magic, the character development, the character interaction with each other, and also the character styles. I really liked the way they portrayed the characters. This also goes with the fighting scenes that happened. I really like the pace they went at and also enjoyed watching all the unique aspects that were brought to each fight, and at the same time some of the silliness that was added. This show did go into great detail during the fighting scenes, with lots of parts being cut in half and everything that you would expect for a show that is rated “R”. That was one thing I was not disappointed bout, the amount of blood that flew around and the inhumanity of how people were treated.This show also managed to show another lifestyle that isn’t as relevant in today’s society, which is hierarchy. You have a king at the top and then the lords who follow him and the commoners. At first, this sounds like an ideal way of living for the people because they believe that what the king is doing was helping the commoners out a lot, but in reality you notice that people are still treated as outcasts and excommunicated from society (shunned). This show was also able to show you that people might act nice on the outside, but deep down they have this hatred towards certain types of people just because they are different.On a different note though, the music in this anime was good, nothing outstanding but it went with the show nicely. Personally the part that I always look for is when they end a show what is the mood or atmosphere that they leave you in. For this anime I found this very fitting using a very mellow song that filled each episode almost with a suspense and sadness in our hearts. I did really enjoy them trying to bring emotion to this anime (which was quite successful), and to be able to in some cases feel the pain of some of the characters and what they had to go through.This leads to ‘did I actually enjoy this show’? As I say in most of my reviews I do enjoy almost all animes, but there is always something that leaves almost this hesitant feeling in me, and in this case was all the unanswered questions that were left. Normally animes leave maybe 2-3 questions for the viewer to think about but this anime had an amount that made the series feel incomplete. With the incompleteness of the anime also comes the hope of expecting more to come, if you look at it in an optimistic way, otherwise…. You know where I am going. At the end of the day though, once I completed this anime I was quite pleased with the outcome because at first glances I was not expecting that much from this anime.If you have any questions or comments please just send me a pm or write on my wall, I will try my best to answer to the best of my power!

What made this such an interesting story was how you would always learn about the pasts of different characters in like segments and at crucial times during the anime. You learn about why most of them are who they are as the story goes on. You realize though after a while, after learning about all the characters pasts, some main some supporting, that this show could be very powerful and you could learn important life changing lessons. The biggest problem I found with this anime, aside from all the unanswered questions was the character Ferris. I mean I felt like her character (being tsundere) just went overboard at some points. Like at one point it will be very serious and intense and the next she is making fun of Ryner and it completely killed the atmosphere that had been built up.Aside from that, the only minor thing that I was disappointed about was the lack of a presence of Kiefer Knolles. I felt as if she could be one of the most important characters but she kind of just disappeared and reappeared randomly and I personally think she is one of the most important characters, especially for the development of who Ryner Lute really is. Those were the two biggest issues (or really only the issues) that I had with this show.Some things that I really enjoyed about this show were the magic, the character development, the character interaction with each other, and also the character styles. I really liked the way they portrayed the characters. This also goes with the fighting scenes that happened. I really like the pace they went at and also enjoyed watching all the unique aspects that were brought to each fight, and at the same time some of the silliness that was added. This show did go into great detail during the fighting scenes, with lots of parts being cut in half and everything that you would expect for a show that is rated “R”. That was one thing I was not disappointed bout, the amount of blood that flew around and the inhumanity of how people were treated.This show also managed to show another lifestyle that isn’t as relevant in today’s society, which is hierarchy. You have a king at the top and then the lords who follow him and the commoners. At first, this sounds like an ideal way of living for the people because they believe that what the king is doing was helping the commoners out a lot, but in reality you notice that people are still treated as outcasts and excommunicated from society (shunned). This show was also able to show you that people might act nice on the outside, but deep down they have this hatred towards certain types of people just because they are different.On a different note though, the music in this anime was good, nothing outstanding but it went with the show nicely. Personally the part that I always look for is when they end a show what is the mood or atmosphere that they leave you in. For this anime I found this very fitting using a very mellow song that filled each episode almost with a suspense and sadness in our hearts. I did really enjoy them trying to bring emotion to this anime (which was quite successful), and to be able to in some cases feel the pain of some of the characters and what they had to go through.This leads to ‘did I actually enjoy this show’? As I say in most of my reviews I do enjoy almost all animes, but there is always something that leaves almost this hesitant feeling in me, and in this case was all the unanswered questions that were left. Normally animes leave maybe 2-3 questions for the viewer to think about but this anime had an amount that made the series feel incomplete. With the incompleteness of the anime also comes the hope of expecting more to come, if you look at it in an optimistic way, otherwise…. You know where I am going. At the end of the day though, once I completed this anime I was quite pleased with the outcome because at first glances I was not expecting that much from this anime.If you have any questions or comments please just send me a pm or write on my wall, I will try my best to answer to the best of my power!

Although the reception of this almost-cliché fantasy story was rather poor, the show does give off its unique flare here and there.The plot was not spectacular. For people familiar with Arthurian legends and LOTR, Denyuuden pales by comparison. It isn't the first time magic, warring states, corruption and the battle between GOOD & EVIL appeared in text, on stage, or on screen –– RIGHT? But it was not completely unoriginal, for I liked how the forces of GOOD and...EVIL were relativistic: not one character acted purely benevolent or malevolent; they had their individual reasons to be. I give the plot a 7/10.Here, studio ZEXCS proved its ability to animate with stunning artwork. The most notable highlight would be its usage of optical effects in the depictions of landscape and objects, mostly shadow and reflection, which the studio used rather effectively to amplify situation and mood. Although the background details were not the most exceptional anime has to offer, I really enjoyed the character designs. The people were good to look at –– sometimes too good to look at. I give artwork 9/10.Brilliant is the word to describe the music in Denyuuden. With its music score a plenty, the soundtrack composed for this show coupled well with the emotions and events that are either happening or going to happen. “Ketsui no Tatakai” is a perfect culmination of flowering heroism. “Kakusei” captures the imagery of chaos and darkness. And let us not forget the lull of “Tonari ni wa”; probably the bliss from Ryner’s afternoon naps. The composition ranges from Baroque counterpoint to more eclectic selections: it’s good stuff. I give music 10/10.Characters were a highlight in this story with the exception of Iris Eris (watch the show and you’ll know what I mean). One outstanding feature about this anime is how often the characters would change in the way they feel towards one another, which made it more relatable to the viewer. Sometimes light; other times dark, each person was part of a balance amidst the yearning for the restoration of peace. I will attempt to give each major character a three-word title.Ryner Lute – Absurdist Minimalist MagisterFerris Eris – Haughty Condescending BishoujoSion Astal – Bipolar Workaholic VigilanteMiran Froaude – Shrewd Rationalist ProdigyTiir Rumibul – Caring Misunderstood “Monster”Luke Stokkart – Inquisitive Perceptive WatcherLucile Eris – Amoral All-seeing ArbiterLir Orla – Lucky Pink-haired BastardAs for characters, I give it 10/10.Overall, I really enjoyed “Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu” so I give it 9/10.

Well, if I should describe this anime in only one sentence, then I\'d definitely use this quote. It\'s an action, adventure, fantasy and magic anime produced by Lantis and  Media Factory. With a score of 7.85 it is ranked 745 on My Anime List.Plot and Story LineWhen you look at the title of this anime, you\'d most probably think that it is all about some amazing legends of some strong heroes from the past and so did I, but it came different. It was all...fantasy, action and adventure but it was not nearly as good as expected. Thing is, what I thought would be a story about legends and stuff, was more a story about ""monsters"" that were created by humans them selves. Those monsters posses the ""Alpha Stigma""- eyes that can analyze any type of magic but to the world they are better known as cursed eyes that bring destruction and death.One of those Alpha Stigma bearers is our protagonist, Ryner Lute. In a corrupt world, controlled by the nobles in each kingdom, Ryner became a talented mage being once a student of the Roland Empires\'s Magician Academy. In time, his best friend Sion Astal becomes the king of the Roland Empire and together they decide to fight against the evil in the world.The part about the legends is set in Ryner\'s mission. He goes on a journey together with Ferris Eris, to collect relics of the legendary heroes. They do find a couple of relics, but you never hear the story or the legend behind it. That sure was a disappointment for me because I was really looking forward to all the legends. From the title you\'d think that the legends make up the main story line, but they are more some plot-filling adds. Only in the end, one episode centers the Legend that reveals the truth behind Ryner\'s Alpa Stigma, but that one comes kinda out of nowhere and just ends in a huge plot hole. It just confused all the things I thought I understood before.Even tough they kinda mixed up the title-story thing, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is still a good anime. The main story line follows the Alpha Stigma users and their destiny as monsters. As said in the intro, it gives a clear message about how monsters are created and later feared and accused by humans.  It is really interesting how the anime portrayed  the real world in such a fantasy anime setting. Thumbs up for that one.The story also doesn\'t lack in intrigue, drama, romance and amazing action scenes. A lot of side and background stories are woven into the anime\'s story. You get to know  lot of characters and even tough they are just supporting characters, you learn about their past, their feelings, hopes etc. It really did a great thing when it comes to that.Still the major problem I had with this anime is the, let\'s call it, ""plot structure"". The anime has a lot of plot holes, forced happenings and some unexplained happenings that come out of nowhere. A possible solution for that would be a second season because the anime hasn\'t finished with the end of the first season. But there is no sign of a second one and considering the fact that the anime aired in 2010, I wouldn\'t say that there is a second season planed. I guess 6 years would be enough of they wanted to.CharactersThe characters in this anime are amazing. So many different, and so many interesting personalities at one place. This is one of the rare anime whose characters deserve to be described in detail, but each and every. Moreover, there is not a single character that I didn\'t like. They were really amazing. Besides, all those personalities contributed to the anime\'s overall appearance. As I mentioned above, the story is formed in a way you get to know each character and I found that great.My favorite character was definitely Ferris Eris. I\'ve always liked strong and independent female characters. In addition to that she is so unique and funny, but also caring and nice. On the other hand, our protagonist Ryner Lute is a lazy, good-for-nothing, yet strong when needed. He is obsessed with afternoon naps and always tries to find a wayout of his obligations and problems.Animation and StyleAs expected from a 2010 anime, it\'s animation is not a big deal. It is okay and watchable. Nice colors, smooth movements and the way they illustrated the spells was also good. The style has nothing special. In one word-average.ConclusionThe Legend of the Legendary Heroes is a good and watchable anime. It does have a couple of flaws firstly in the story and in the plot in general but amazing characters made it enjoyable to watch, especially when it comes to the all the drama around them. Bad thing is that the magic actually wasn\'t in the front of the story since I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I liked it enough to give it a score 8/10, meaning you should check it out. fantasy, action and adventure but it was not nearly as good as expected.

It's based off a light novel. Because it tries to follow true to the novel, the anime series ends on a terrible cliffhanger where we've been fed many episodes of buildup but no conclusions. It'll leave a sour taste in your mouth if you try to watch this as a standalone.Secondly, Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu's title, poster image, and synopsis misrepresents the series. It makes you think that this series is going to be a happy, cheesy adventure with an OP MC and romcom shenanigans. That's completely off, and...for that reason, a LOT of people looking for the aforementioned are disappointed when they start watching.This is actually a story centered mostly around war and morality packaged into a fantasy setting.  It's not a story about Ferris and Ryner travelling the world to collect relics. That's a very, very small portion of it. It's moreso about personal backstories of the three main characters and the ruling of the Roland Kingdom. There are many tragic backstories. Despite the fruity colors, there's a lot of gore and dismembered bodies. There are a lot of characters in a moral gray zone. There's a lot of pain. The best part of the anime is the emotional punch it packs.The series consists of generic elements, and it's comparatively 'old' - meaning you should expect tropes from the early 2000s.  For example, Ferris is a slapstick tsundere. This show's comedy relief centers around her poking fun at Ryner. This won't resonate well with many of the audience. I personally didn't mind it. It also incorporates fantasy elements and plot devices that have been frequently used in a number of series. However, I think that the generic elements have been packaged well into a story, so it doesn't  feel bland or overdone.Overall, I think it's a good watch, though it needs to be supplemented with background material. I would recommend it to people who are looking for something with tragedy and moral conflict, especially the latter. It's very rare to find something with so many gray characters. It also sports a solid fantasy world to enjoy. My verdict on this anime is that it is polarizing. People who can't get into the characters or who want action will hate it. People who tend to empathize with characters will like it. for that reason, a LOT of people looking for the aforementioned are disappointed when they start watching.This is actually a story centered mostly around war and morality packaged into a fantasy setting.

Some said it was because the low audience, some say it's just bad script writing, maybe a mix of both. The fact is, Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetu is a good and enjoyable show, which unexplainably went the wrong way on the last 4 or 5 episodes. The only way to redeem itself would be by having a second season, but this seems highly unlikely from what I read.I was really surprised by the story on this series.

Just because I thought that something was better than you thought or worse than you thought, doesn\'t mean that I did a ""Bad review"". If I did a ""Bad Review"" than I wouldn\'t have cared to make a review in the firstplace. Also, I can understand if I might have said something that offended you, upset you, or whatever, but I literally can\'t quite help...that. I certainly can make a review that deserves ""Constructive Criticism"", but I certainly don\'t intend on EVER making a ""Bad Review"" of anything. Anyway, rant over. Onto another review.First off, let me clarify the fact that this anime is one of my favorites of all time, and for good reason, and some people don\'t quite understand this.Now, the story is about a man named Ryner Lute, who is a man with a special set of eyes that can make him mimic the use of magic almost instantaneously. He is joined by a lady warrior named Ferris Eris, along his adventures, in order to find the ancient relics within the lands of the continent, so that Roland can become one of the greatest kingdoms on earth. Also, the King of Roland, Sion Astal, was the bastard son of a nobleman, who seeks to provide justice to his land and even to the world. Now, there are many mishaps along the way, and there are some decisions that I think shouldn\'t have been made, but overall, the story was one of the best parts about this anime, despite the use of the flashback.The art was nothing less than amazing. I loved how it was used to show the different contrasts between characters, and their demeanor. Also, it gave us something to look at when we want something to stick out in our minds, which lets us to believe that it even sets up the ambiance in he scene. It simply was amazing.The Sound is probably the best part of this anime. The music was nothing less than captivating almost every single moment of the anime, along with the great opening and closing music, but that was the weakest music in it, but it was still amazing.The characters were probably the weakest part of the anime. Ryner Lute was the best character within the anime, and you see his struggles, his pain, his laughter, his development as a character. He is one of the best protagonists of all time, despite his obsession with naps. Ferris Erris is a somewhat strong female lead, but she sometimes is helpless with dealing with Ryner Lute\'s behavior, often calling him a Womanizer and a Pervert, when he is not. Also, she doesn\'t really have the most original of names, but she is definitely a badass, if one might say so. Sion is also a fairly strong character. He is constantly doing paperwork, visits, parties, etc. when he is king. You see his struggles as king, thinking about how to govern the kingdom, how to deal with Ryner and people like him, etc. There aren\'t very many other main characters, but there are a lot of major supporting characters, like Kiefer Knolls, but she only plays a major supporting role because she was part of the magic academy that Ryner and Sion were a part of. Other than the 3 major characters, you don\'t really see much development from them, but you do see enough for them to be entertaining to you, like the romantic relationship building between one of Sion\'s generals and a noble lady, which is very enjoyable to watch, trust me. Also, there is a group that watches out for Ryner and stuff, but they don\'t really play much into the anime, in terms of the plot, until the later half of the anime, and even then, they aren\'t really the greatest.Overall, this anime is one to behold for me. I know many people seem to disagree, but that is fine. Everyone has their own opinion on things, and I can definitely respect that. I wish that we could agree, but we are human beings. This anime is definitely a recommendation. Still want to play the visual novel, because I heard its far better, but I still haven\'t found anything about it yet. that.

This might not be so interesting to a person who doesnt care for a dark anime.The story is really interesting and something that is quite cliche\' with the main protagonist \'Ryner Lute\' who travels around with \'Ferris Eris\' in search of the \'legendary hero artifacts\' pretty basic, story line with an interesting twist.Ryner Lute has eyes called \'Alpha Stigma\' or \'Alpha Stigmata\' which ever you would prefer, that have the ability to steal any magic he sees used. Which you will notice throughout the series. Though...his eyes are special ill get into that more later on. Ryner is seen as a very lazy person who doesnt want to do anything except have \'afternoon naps\' and i personally agree with him there.He travels with Ferris Eris who is the sister of the current head of the Eris household. She is incredibly powerful for a warrior with no magic. She easily deals with large numbers of people though she isn\'t invincible they make a good team as she is running up front with a powerful melee and he supports with magic, and been able to copy any magic he sees he can use it against them they normally stop using magic after they notice this though and just stick to weapons. (with exceptions)Sion Astal who knows Ryner Lute from the Special Royal Academy *spoiler* and later becomes king *spoiler* is a bright and charismatic person who is considered a hero among the people of Roland. He is surrounded by loyal and powerful subordinates who support him in his ideal to have a peaceful nation. He is also very much so a work \'a\' holic who does alot of work thats required of him without much common sense such as eating. And with his loyal subordinates aid they keep him in good health to help run the nation of Roland.They are the three main characters with other important characters been Ferris Eris older brother who is also the head of the Eris household and her younger sister Lucile Eris and Iris Eris.Isnt much to say about Lucile other than that he is more or less the kingpin of the Roland Nation who is incredibly and insanely powerful who *spoiler* makes a persons head explode with no effort *spoiler*Iris on the other hand dearly holds her sister in high regards and works to keep her happy (easily seen from the series) oh and cant forget this piece of info but Ferris is obsessed with Dango especially \'Wynot\'s Dango\' and Iris will deliver the Dango to her on nearly all occassions i can remember off the top of my head but dont hold me to that.Now the art is pretty good though its not the best ive seen from my many animes ive watched over the years. Its never the less good but still sometimes i wish they worked on it a little more. Never the less its not the worst ive seen but it is one of those animes where you notice it on the odd occasion.Character speech is pretty good, only one i have to complain about is Iris even now im still not a fan of little girls who suck up to people\'s voices its like nails and a blackboard x 1000. The sound effects are pretty good especially when *spoiler* Ryner lute goes out of control rapes absolutely everyone around him *spoiler*  (please dont take that literally) I never really noticed any environmental sounds though. That could really use some work, but that could just of been from my \'tunnel vision\' and me getting absorbed into the story.I enjoyed the series very much and would definitively recommend this series to anyone. *Spoiler* My favourite scenes throughout the series are when Ryner Lute goes nuts and kills everyone in his \'berserk\' status. And the laugh damn i cant get enough of it. Guess that just me and been dark and evil inside haha *spoiler* If they had more involved and more dangerous things occur during those kind of scenes I would have to say it would be top notch in terms of my gruesome bloody side of animes. but alas there isn\'t well not from Ryner anyways.Now to get back to the eyes i said i would talk about more, the alpha stigma that Ryner has is well ill say ""Special"" i wont say anymore than that otherwise it will ruin it for others. They allow him to do more than the average Alpha stigma user. Now his eyes are not the only ones that exist there are 3 in total. Since you\'ll find out roughly around episode 17 (dont hold me to that) i dont think anyone will mind me saying and describing them but anyways*SPOILER* The first eyes are his, which can copy any and all magic he sees and are the most common eyes (his are unique though watch series to find out why), Then there are eyes that allow one to see inside peoples dreams and only appear once in the series, And lastly eyes which can absorb all forms of power and people. Now you only see a person with that once in the series. I hope will we see more in a 2nd season if that will ever happen. *spoiler*Overall this series is great and full of a great mix of comedy from the traveling of Ferris and Ryner, as well as awesome scenes of Destruction from Ryner.The series can be quite dark especially when Ryner is going berserk (even the sky shows that clearly and dont ask why).Other than it been dark (which can be a bonus to some and a detriment to others) its a extremely good series, other than the art been a little disappointing and Iris annoying voice it certainly is a top notch anime.Hope that reading this review didnt totally waste your time. Hope you watch the series if you haven\'t already. his eyes are special ill get into that more later on.

Hope you watch the series if you haven\'t already.', 'Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu is an anime that focuses more on character than it\'s actual plot. The characters\' struggles and backstories will be the only thing that will keep you going. It tries to focus on the current status of the world: the politics, the invasions - why these people do it. Why are some more fortunate than others? What makes a great ruler? It got to a point where the show tries to over-complicate situations just to prove a point, and the characters appear flatter than originally intended.The interesting thing about this show, however, is it\'s inability to establish a proper antagonist. It\'s...both a good and bad aspect: bad primarily because what\'s a good anime without an antagonist? There is(are) conflict(s), mind you, if you consider ten sideplots running at the same time conflicts. But the great thing about this is that it immerses the viewer into its weird modern-medieval universe and leaves you helpless. We are quick to points fingers like ""Ha! If the MC defeats this guy, then a good ending will come out!"" or ""It\'s his fault!"" but the show takes that ability away from them and will allow the viewer to see the whole picture and leave them to their own conclusions. both a good and bad aspect: bad primarily because what\'s a good anime without an antagonist?

The first episode did not represent this series at all, on the contrary it was the worst. However if you give up on the first episode you have misjudged the rest of the show.The pace of the show is fast, and things quickly start to pick up, connections are made, and confusions cleared. The reason I continued through was the unexpectedly amazing episode a few in, to be un-numbered for sake of spoiling. There is a mix of...the comical duo of Ryner and Ferris that offsets the heavy atmosphere of Sion’s attempt at improving the kingdom of Roland.Expectation: 6-7 Fine to Good.Actual: 7 GoodEpisode scores: -,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,9,9,9,10,6,7,7,7Analysis:StoryThe story is large, fast paced, intertwined with politics, magic, relationships, and wars.

I loved how I was able to immerse myself in the huge cast and plot, and how I could sympathize with every side.The action was great in terms of animation, however there was a lot of ‘convenient’ dark spots, or rather almost any fight that took place indoors was like trying to find your way in the pitch black. It was an important element, and you can expect at least one action scene an episode even though it might be short.CharactersThere are too many to be able to count. Thankfully you should be able to keep them all straight if I could. The story is face paced so there is plenty of development in their disposition over the course of the show. The villains are loveable, and the heroes are despicable; there is no clear cut good and bad which gives the relationships between everyone more complex. Every character has motive, personality, and significance in a sense.The only possible annoyance in this was Sion’s and Ryner’s unjustifiable friendship.

Stale Battle-System:In the first episode, you\'ll be seeing some fancy moves done by Eris, the blonde girl, and some flashy magic done by Ryner, the main character who is a mage, but this isn\'t really where the show shines. The show sort of keeps on misleading you, and I\'m not just talking about the title. In the beginning of the episode, your taken into a battle scene where Ryner shows of his calculating prowess. But really, He only showcased this ability on the first battle. Most of the following fight scenes is basically him activating the same old spells: ""speed"", ""lighting"" and some other...minor things. It\'s actually quite repetitive when you remove his final resort, the old ""destruction mode"", which your going to understand if you watch. But again, combat wise, it\'s not so good.II. In-depth Characters:The characters are possibly one of the best things about this anime. It\'s what makes a seinen a seinen. Well, to me, anyways.-RynerWhat is so ""deep"" about Ryner? The guy basically doesn\'t know what to do(at first). It\'s not because he\'s incompetent, he\'s plenty smart. He experiences thought struggles about what to do with oh so destructive world around him. What he really wants is to take a nap. What should a guy who likes to takes nap do? He also dwells into some interesting philosophical thoughts such as when he divides people into two: the standby people(which he identifies with) and the people who want to do things. It\'s interesting because he\'ll eventually go along with a latter type of guy. Then, there\'s his ""destructive mode"" problem. By actually engaging in combat, he runs the risk of killing people. And then, there\'s this ""Naruto-hated by everyone problem"". This guy has so many things wrapped in his head and he\'ll continue to get wrapped as the story progresses.-ErisEris is what some people refer to as a ""Kuudere"", if you\'re familiar with the word. If not, it\'s basically an almost emotionless female. Clever, Self-Confident, Pompous, and self-declared ""Beauty"".(lol) Don\'t get her wrong. Eris is quite a deep character as well. After she teams up with Ryner, she begins to start to initiate these sort of ""clever pretend games"" with Ryner. Of course, Ryner just goes along. When you think about it, it\'s actually quite interesting that she\'s doing this. I mean, although cold and straightforward, she also displays herself as random and playful. Another facet of her is that she seems to bond with Ryner almost too well. Her peculiarities(dango) does not prevent her from doing work of course. She understands situations quickly and initiate swiftly with her sword.-SionPretty in-depth as well. By that, I\'m mainly talking about his moral-ambiguity. He is ambitious, unlike Ryner, and being him is like standing on a pedestal. There are too many sides to fall on.III. Boring Setting:One can\'t really pay attention much to the setting as there\'s not much out of the ordinary. It\'s basically your old medieval-magical period. There are powerful artifacts, which can be used as deterrent against war or can also be used to promote war. There are many countries and the world is engulfed in suffering. Ryner and his friends are victims.IV. Plain Story:It\'s kind of lacking originality. Individuals rising within an empire, and from an empire, save the world.V. Thought-provoking General Themes:""Saving The World"" is usually an interesting idea since it involves so much complexity in terms of morality and society. It\'s also a very big idea.""A Benevolent War"". There are many sides in the conflict. Some are simply led by corrupt rulers while other rulers actually wants peace...but at what cost? through war?""From Destruction comes Creation"".

Potential, that is the best word to describe the anime Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu. Densetsu had the potential to be talked about in the same breath as legendary animes such as Berserk, Code Geass, Attack on Titan, so and so forth. Instead this anime has faded into obscurity, completely forgot by most anime fans. It could have been one of the most talked about anime of 2010 but instead it suffered a terrible, and unfortunate fate of awful directing.This...anime had a lot of brand equity. The series Densetsu was a well known, and very popular as a light novel in Japan. The light novel was an epic that took on some lofty themes that many anime try to pull off but few are able to. It had it's lighthearted moments, but slowly it descended into a very dark and foreboding story line. The anime failed to capture that descent into darkness that made the light novel so great.After watching this anime I get the distinct impression that the director did not know what direction he wanted to go with this anime. After reading the light novel some of the decisions the studio took perplexed me.The first, and most fatal mistake the director made was trying to tackle two light novels in one season without any clear direction. In fact some stories were spliced into the first half of the season that were nothing more than side stories from different light novels in the series than the main two that were covered in the anime. These stories were more of your typical shounen/slice of life type of stories that did not do anything to enhance the main story. This is a very large problem when you're trying to cover as much material as they did in just one season. It throws this anime's pacing off, and leads to some schizophrenic pacing.What the director needed to do is trim some fat. A lot of that content was unnecessary to move the story forward. As a consequence the first half of the anime drug on for a long time without making any significant process. This in turn leads to the main plot lines being hurried at a blistering pace in the second half. This led to a bipolar, schizophrenic anime that didn't know what it wanted to be. Cool shounen? Na I want to be a slice of life anime. No wait! I want to be a cliche shounen anime again! Not so fast, we're going to be a brooding, dark fantasy anime. This schizophrenia makes this anime very hard to categorize, I seriously don't think you can fit it into any one category neatly.For me it led to some intrigue. I have been watching anime since I was the tender age of 7 (now I'm in my mid 20s). I have seen thousands of shows, from almost every genre imaginable, and in the end this is the one anime that left me scratching my head. I didn't know WHAT to call it because this anime had no clear purpose. It was supposed to be a dark fantasy, but instead it the director and studio did not know what to do with this anime.If they had trimmed some fat, and paced the story correctly this anime would almost certainly have had a second season, and my guess is it would have been in the Pantheon of most recommended and popular anime. Instead the anime ended at an awkward place, nothing was really resolved, the story just introduced a plot-line from left field that only really gets explained after the events that happened in the anime.Now, you may be asking, WHY did you give this anime a 9 out of 10? Despite the anime being botched, it really was an enjoyable anime if you had the fortitude to stick through it. The anime did a great job on world building. You got a great feel for the happenings, lore, and character of the main country in the anime, Roland. The anime did a good job fleshing out it's history, and politics surrounding the country.The anime also did a great job of fleshing out the main characters, Shion, Ryner, and Ferris. Another aspect that I liked about this anime is that it was hard to tell which characters had ulterior motives and which did not. It added intrigue and depth to this anime. This anime asked the fundamental question where did we come from, how did we get this way, and where are we going.Despite the anime being botched in many ways, it came through thematically. It had depth that most fantasy anime do not have, and despite the schizophrenic nature of this anime it executed many things well. This is definitely not an anime for the masses, but despite this somewhat negative review I would be willing to bet that more people like this anime than not. The few things that this anime did execute well made this anime worth the watch for me. It's just sad to think that most of this anime's potential was squandered. It could've been much more than it is, but instead the director of this anime pissed away this anime's brand equity, and story. anime had a lot of brand equity.

And mostly it has turned into either ignores or disklikes.Which is cool, that\'s to be expected when you\'re criticizing something that people like.I\'ll try to be very succinct here.Story:  Ultimately this show felt like a slice of bread hoisted from the middle of the loaf.  After watching, I asked myself ""was there a point to this?""Enjoyment? Emotional reaction?  Attachment?  I\'m not too sure, but what i do know was that it really filled me with dread....Some of the most unbelievably cruel and heinous things occur in this show all in the backdrop of comedic relief.  It was incredibly jarring.  One minute there is laughter, the next their is something super brutal, then immediately there is more laughter.If I had to some this show up it would be tragedy and meager, meager hope.  Which brings me to the characters.I thought, clearly, it was the strongest aspect of the show.  Better character writing in an anime?  I\'m not sure i could name something better.  There were cliches ofc, but so offset by the grim realities of the world that it automatically took on depth.The Sound and Art were all pretty good, sound was forgettable, but went well with what was going on.At the end, I\'m not sure who to reccomend this to; it was charming and funny alot of the time, but also unforgiving.  The twists and turns are not gentle.  It really throws you around all over the place.  Let\'s say that if you really liked Elfen Lied, which i gave the same score to, then you\'ll probably find something interesting here.  If your looking to get your heart warmed or a touch of the feels, well then you should probably run away never to return. Some of the most unbelievably cruel and heinous things occur in this show all in the backdrop of comedic relief.  It was incredibly jarring.

Or at least I haven\'t watched a whole lot of them aside from the Dragon Ball Z craze when I was younger and a few here and there. I saw this on Netflix and thought I\'d give it a go after enjoying the first half of Sword Art Online.The pacing on this show was very inconsistent and the animation was pretty lackluster. What really killed the show for me was the dialogue. I can\'t think of something I\'ve watched with worse dialogue. It sounded like reading old X-Men comics out loud where characters would say what their powers...did each time they used them whenever characters used magic ""I offer this contract to the god of blah blah blah."" I don\'t know why I watched 13 episodes but I couldn\'t force myself to go on. did each time they used them whenever characters used magic ""I offer this contract to the god of blah blah blah."" I don\'t know why I watched 13 episodes but I couldn\'t force myself to go on.', '""Huh? What? I don\'t get it"" was my reaction to the ending of this confusing, yet enjoyable series. After much speculation, I was able to vaguely understand the ending. What does this mean? It most likely means that I\'m stupid, or The Legend of the Legendary Heroes made itself a lot more confusing than it needed to be. I\'m leaning towards the latter. However, if you want to be a dick about it, then it\'d be the first one.  Anyways, besides the uh... intriguing(?) story, I enjoyed this series quite a lot. It just goes to show that you don\'t really NEED to know...what\'s going on (although it would be helpful) in order to enjoy a series.One thing that caught my attention was the artwork. In almost every single episode, the visuals were like eye candy. In fact, this was a big reason why I decided to stick with it in the first place. No, there were no crazy 3D effects that popped out at the viewer and gave them a boner. However, the lighting, angles, and its ability to create its own tone and atmosphere were all aspects that are very hard to find in other anime you see today. Why is that? Well, unlike other studios, Zexcs decided that 3D effects were NOT the only way to make the visuals enjoyable. And boy, were they right. Overall, the art was outstanding.Sound? Hmm...I can\'t really remember. Oh, right! That\'s because I tried erasing it from my brain due to its repetitiveness. In some scenes, the music didn\'t even match the atmosphere. The visuals were on a completely different level while the sound was produced by an elementary school band (no offense to you young\'uns). During certain scenes with Ryner and Ferris happily cracking jokes at each other, ominous music would begin playing. Now normally, you\'d expect something BAD to happen sometime soon. But in The Legend of the Legendary Heroes, it happened about 50% of the time. This was extremely misleading to me and therefore it ruined the mood that it had so successfully established through its visuals. Boohoo.Well, I can\'t say that the characters looked ridiculous, because then I\'d be lying to you (except for Sion, he just looked like a woman). But what is it with these people and their wide range of hair colors? Do they dye their hair at a young age or are they from different countries? I have no idea. Apparently, in Roland, you can have blonde, red, white, or brown hair. Now, I don\'t know about you, but that sounds awesome to me! I\'ll take the zebra stripes. Hair color aside, the characters were all developed quite well. Each one had a decent backstory, and it was quite a joy to watch. Although, they COULD have had childhoods in which their families WEREN\'T completely murdered or in which they were orphans. But I guess I shouldn\'t complain...too much. One thing that was quite bothersome was the sudden transition to flashbacks. In the middle of a fight, Ryner would have flashbacks and at one point, took up an entire half of an episode. Now, really? In the middle of a fight? What was the opponent doing the ENTIRE time Ryner was spacing out? Drinking tea? Reading the paper? If I were going against a guy with an Alpha Stigma, which apparently allows him to BEAT the living shit out of you, I\'d definitely go for any opening. I don\'t know, that\'s just me. Anyways, characters were decent and I appreciated the time spent animating these flashbacks.Did I enjoy this? Hell yeah I did. In fact, It was one of the best anime (in my opinion) in the season. The humor was consistent, and although I have not read the light novel, the story seemed to be faithful to its original. Although I was utterly confused by the story, and completely annoyed by the sound, the breathtaking artwork and the dynamic characters were pluses. Seeing Ferris be able to feel emotions and express deeper feelings for Ryner was a good sight, and seeing Ryner be less of an emo was relieving. If this series were to have a sequel, you bet your pennies (is that even a phrase?) that I\'ll be watching it. what\'s going on (although it would be helpful) in order to enjoy a series.One thing that caught my attention was the artwork.

It is really good, ryner lute is very powerful but he hides his power therefore he is underestimated, so when he shows of his power everyone is shocked. the story is good aswell however relationships between characters can get kinda weird. Once you start  this anime your gonna love it. ', 'Let me start off with sharp criticism because that is the first thing I want to do after watching the whole series. I must mention that it took me really long time to deal with this show therefore it can\'t be called captivating by any means.Animation quality was flat and inconsistent throughout the episodes. Sound was average as well, we saw similar OP/ED many times before, nothing extra nor memorable happend in the audiovisual area. ZEXCS did very tacky job at this one. The dialogues are miserable and often empty or repetitive. Most of the characters lack charisma and needed depth. The way how they...are introduced and developed is not properly executed in the whole narrative of the story. Fights choreography could be more complex and dynamic even though i am not sure what the anime is supposed to be, but i will get to this point later. The atmosphere is systematically being compromised by cheesy jokes. Last but foremost King Astals motivation speeches were happening suspiciously often right during sunset. Wasting time on insignificant characters as Milk and Iris is another problem. The end was very disturbing to me even though there was some slight foreshadowing it seemed to me like something that might be called ""very bad deus ex machina.""The main fault in this show is over-combination of various elements, meaning : different plot collisions that are not working, wrong pacing of show, Is it serious show or not ? Is the show about intrigues on kings court or action packed adventure ? Are the motives of love, family, death, friendship etc. coherent in the whole package ? All of those things could work, yes i think they could, but in this show they did not. To sum it up : Show had great potential with what seemed to be promise of ""more and better"" at the start. Unfortunately as the show went on and slowly was coming to an end, left the consumer with just a sense of unfulfilled expectations. are introduced and developed is not properly executed in the whole narrative of the story.

Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu was this anime. If you have seen Steins;Gate, then you know what I\'m talking about when i say even the vocabulary is different. In both Steins;Gate and Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, a certain type of language is used to signify that these characters aren\'t just your run of mill brainless characters, but are well thought out and intelligent. At least, this is what I first thought when...i finished episode 1.The intelligence the characters portrayed during this anime was amazing, but at the same time, they all had these weaknesses that were not realistic to people living in such a divided world. These quirks of their characters made for a more lighter tone to an anime that really needed to show more of its darker side. For lying underneath this anime\'s lighthearted banter was a plot that was filled with sinister origins and prophecies.  In one example, Ryner Lute, (the main character), expresses a character trait that just seems like a bad attempt to lighten the mood. I like to sleep just as much as the next person, (maybe too much), But it is the last thing on my mind during stressful situations, let alone a war torn world where everyone hates you and what you represent. Ryner Lute would have benefited from a much better weakness, or downside to flesh out his character a bit more. He comes from a background where even his own parents gave him up for dead, or at least, were to afraid of him to show him the affection a child needs.Ryner isn\'t the only character who had issues, Ferris Eris herself had an issue that bothered me. In an anime with such potential to take those anime tropes i mentioned and throw them out the window, why make her obsessed with dongo? The humor here was cute, and i admit made me chuckle a bit sometimes, but then a dark tone comes back and it all feels out of place. In Steins;Gate this same type of humor is thrown in, but it is used at the correct times and is a part of the anime as a whole, whereas the humor in Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu seems rushed, and just ""thrown in"".Another aspect of this anime that should be addressed is the Romance. First, you think he is destined to be romanced by Kiefer Knolles, but then they throw Ferris in, and even Milk gets a shot, but unlike a harem anime where each girl has a point, (or is supposed to), for being there, Milk just seems thrown in, and Ferris sort of takes Kiefer\'s spot. Having Ryner and Ferris stay friends would make for a much better character development point. They humor between them would have a place if it wasn\'t sharing a space with a romance. Kiefer and Ryner reuniting would make for a much better love story. Ferris mistreats Ryner the entire time they are together, using the common ""You are such a pervert"" phrase that we have all come to know and love. And yet there isn\'t even an inkling that he might be that way at all. At least in most anime when this happens the guy has seen something he shouldn\'t have, but poor Ryner gets accused for existing.Ryner Lute is hated for simply being alive, because of his rare power. So for a character that is abused all his life, Kiefer is a needed, and wanted, distraction. She treats him with respect and finds something in him that she is attracted to, and he sees a girl who can see past his hated power, and loves him regardless of what society thinks of it. So why is she disregarded and then replaced by a girl who constantly berates Ryner, just as society has done to him all his life. Though she was also able to see past this horrible power of his, she didn\'t respect what the constant abuse could have done to him, and abused him in her own way.I could go on and on about the characters and what could have been changed, but I\'ll leave that for another day. For now, i want to discuss the plot.The story is all over the place. According to those who have read the manga, it was not like this at all. So for some reason this anime was changed a lot from it\'s source material. And the saddest part is that the confusing plot is probably the worst thing that could have happened to this anime. With the impressive writing, to the incredible music. And characters who could have been fleshed out and wonderful to try and relate to, this anime certainly had a lot of potential. So why was it all over the place?This type of storytelling, where the story jumps back and forth through time and plot points, is something that is becoming more and more popular among writers who try to be different. And if done write, it can incredible to delve into. It is extremely difficult to pull off successfully, however, and unfortunately this anime messed up big time. For an anime whose literature and dialogue are already intellectually complex, to throw in a convoluted sense of time just seems pointless to me. Someone who wants to sit back and enjoy an anime, only to find this particular one, will end up being one of the numerous viewers who added this anime to their dropped list. And I\'m not normally one who agrees with dropping an anime, (I see myself as sort of a completionist), but I see how dropping this anime might end up being the correct decision, and not just for casual viewers of anime. Finishing this anime only instills a feeling of incompleteness and emptiness, and doesn\'t leave you hungering for more at the same time. We go from happy moments, to sad moments, to funny moments, and then back to happy moments all within one part of and episode where Ryner started out with a monologue about his horrible life. But that\'s not all, add to that a bit of unneeded romance that doesn\'t fit at all, and you have Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu in a nut shell.Now i didn\'t hate this anime at all, nor did I dislike it. In fact, I enjoyed this anime quite well. The strong suits of this anime besides the impressive writing and music, are how amazing the world is, and how diverse the characters actually are. I want to know more about this land, and the different nations that make it up. I want to understand the motives behind some of the minor characters that are randomly thrown in here and there. And if there is one complaint that I would have to stress the most about this anime, It\'s that it doesn\'t even give an effort to try and give the viewer those things.If you are wondering whether or not you should watch this anime, I would say give it a try at least, watch an episode or two. If you think you can handle the complexity of the story and randomness of the characters, then i assure you it will be a fantastic anime for you. But if you are like me and can\'t seem to get through an anime like this. Then you will struggle all the way through it.Overall, I wouldn\'t watch this anime again, But I don\'t completely feel like my time watching it was wasted either. i finished episode 1.The intelligence the characters portrayed during this anime was amazing, but at the same time, they all had these weaknesses that were not realistic to people living in such a divided world.

The way it can be describe is like a combination of Gangaro, Gothic with a modern twist added in to it that doesn\'t suit the setting.-However, I admire Ryner\'s new look, it brings out the bad boy in him.-Side comment: I hate the way the artist drew Sion, he looks more feminine.SOUND: Rating, a fair number 6.-My only comment pertains to the opening theme, which I hate it.CHARACTERS: Rating #8- I like the way to were the character\'s look matches their role, however as this anime goes on a lot of things started to shift, example, Sion is strting to look like that he is the villain, question is whether  he is the main or the secondary antagonist. Also, I kinda wonder as to what role does Keifer Knolles will play in the last few episodes and whether Ryner should side with Gastark  empire instead  or stay in Roland with the possibility of being killed by Sion.-There is a side mystery as to what Sion has entered into, which may indicate that he may have gotten what he had bargain for with Lucile Eris.ENJOYMENT: #8- The conclusion is just a few more episode to watch out for.OVERALL: #8-If there will be a season 2 of this anime, it\'ll be sure be fun to watch.Trivia: The legend of King Arthur came way back before the middle ages, it is said that the legnd came around during the collapse of the Roman Empire.The wizard Merlin, King Arther\'s friend was said to have really existed in real life, but not as a  person with magical powers, but as a Celtic druid who led numerous rebellion against the roman occupation of Britannia, now the UK. - I like the plot about the king of Roland, Sion Astal, who wish to make his kingdom a better place for everyone, his associates; a bum , Ryner Lute, who posses magical power called ""Alpha Stigma"" but like nothing more that to take afternoon naps and a skilled swords-woman, Ferris Eris who is an avid dango eater, together they strive to find the mythical ""Hero Relic"" and fight those whose ambition is to selfishly weed out other kingdom ( kingdom of Roland included) and rule over the land .-I also like the mystery of who the main antagonist is what add to the climax.At first one might thinks that it is Miran Foaude, the next it may be the king of Gastrark Refa Edia or Lucile Eris, but as it goes on it seems to lean towards Sion Astal.You also can\'t determined as to who the secondary antagonist is, it could be Sui and Kuu Orla, Luke Stokkart or Mran.ART: Rating-8-I like the way the setting, the cahrcters and the background were drawn.-But, I do wonder as to what\'s going on with the artist\'s mind when he drew Ferris\'s outfit?

I feel like Densetsu had a lot of potential.Probably the biggest issue with this anime is it\'s way of story telling (and characters a little bit) some of the transitions between episodes leave you very confused,""How did this event, suddenly turn to that one?""and overall just the general plot sometimes can get confusing. (ESPECIALLY around the end)With this flaw, I just think the anime wasted it\'s time and could\'ve been a good anime, not to mention its huge cliff-hanger...at the end.The other issue is with its characters, I feel there a lot of unnecessary characters, and maybe some of them were necessary, but with the anime ending on a cliff-hanger, we don\'t get to see their ""necessary-ness"" again, it could\'ve done better. A lot of times comedy is thrown in a little to much for the characters\' situations, and it bugs me a little bit, although it isn\'t quite out of place as let\'s say Akame ga Kill!But let\'s get to some of the good points.I like the Art/Animation, I really do, it is very pretty and the effects are nice, I really like how the guys and girls look, their faces are well, attractive to be blunt. But when one of the characters (Ferris) when her bangs ""flip"" it has this weird animation for them where it looks like her hair merges together in a weird way, I don\'t know you\'d have to see for yourself.Another thing, even if this was an anime that probably wouldn\'t get most people thinking, it did for me at some points, a little morale questioning here and there. There were parts of the anime I really enjoyed, and others, well,This anime took me 3 months to complete, and not just because I was pressed for time because of school, it just wasn\'t interesting to me, at a lot of points it didn\'t have me coming back to it on my free time. Only by my sheer OCD completionist nature did it give me the power to binge-finish it.Overall, I liked the anime somewhat, I feel if it ever got a S2 (which will probably never happen) and if it was done better it would be a great anime. This however, I don\'t feel satisfied from watching it, some of the ups of it were nice, but it didn\'t captivate me. You can watch this if you want, just don\'t expect too much.(Also btw the music is good, but the second opening has WAY better cinematography)STORY: 7ART: 8SOUND: 8CHARACTERS: 7ENJOYMENT: 7OVERALL: 6 at the end.The other issue is with its characters, I feel there a lot of unnecessary characters, and maybe some of them were necessary, but with the anime ending on a cliff-hanger, we don\'t get to see their ""necessary-ness"" again, it could\'ve done better. A lot of times comedy is thrown in a little to much for the characters\' situations, and it bugs me a little bit, although it isn\'t quite out of place as let\'s say Akame ga Kill!But let\'s get to some of the good points.I like the Art/Animation, I really do, it is very pretty and the effects are nice, I really like how the guys and girls look, their faces are well, attractive to be blunt.

It feels like they just started a new script at the end and that kind of ruined it for me, i have no idea whats going on here...Still, it was entertaining and fun every now and then. The only bad part is all the loose threads they left behind. ', ""This was one of the most disappointing anime i have ever watched. So if you have read the synopsis you already know what its about but trust me it is not worth the time. An anime that is under the fantasy or adventure genre should have a great plot with likeable characters; unfortunately this anime did not. The best thing about it was the art because there was a lot of colour and the art style was ok i guess. The next best was sound because i dont know how bad sound can be to be honest. And now i come to the bad bit.The...anime started off pretty good, i quite liked Ryner Lute even if he had a very common, predictable personality. The idea about Alpha Stigmas wasn't bad but for me the story didn't stick with the simple concept that alpha stigmas are feared and disliked by everyone. Instead it followed a very boring approach and focused on politics of the country and Sion. The story didn't improve at all throughout and then towards the end it didn't even make sense to me. And I know that i wasn't too stupid to understand but for the last 3/4 episodes I didn't even know what was going on.I thought Ryner Lute was ok but the other two pissed me off so much. Ferris had nothing likeable about her she was rude and grumpy and in my opinion was a waste of space. If Ryner Lute was more powerful she wouldn't be needed at all. She always called him a pervert and I think it was a sorry attempt of humour that had been done 10 times better in other anime. She just annoyed me a lot. Then there is Sion who's personality was like an old man for most of it. There were at least 15 other side characters who i either didn't know the name of or though were just average.Because of all these faults that I have pointed out I hated this anime. anime started off pretty good, i quite liked Ryner Lute even if he had a very common, predictable personality.

The Legend of the Legendary Heroes? Are you kidding me? Sadly, it was the only anime that looked interesting on there, so I watched it. And I have to say, it was really amazing.Story (9): Just watching the first episode will get you interested in the anime, though the plot they give you is sort of misleading, but still good (watch and you'll understand what I mean). The way the story plays out is really gripping and by the end, it'll seriously have you griping for a season two.Art (9): The...art's great.

At first I thought it was something generic, filled with b-roll action scenes but something about it made me watch the next episode, and then there was a little something more that intrigued me, and so on and so on, until by the final episode I was fascinated. But let's rewind.The relationship between the two main characters, Ryner and Ferris, I thought was perfect. One of the reasons this anime might not have universal appeal is because people have different psychology on relationships. Even...still, Ryner and Ferris are like perfect forces of Yin and Yang, each has what the other is missing, each are equally important to one another, and each have quirky characteristics that make them so uniquely special. When you watch a show, and you fall in love with the main characters as they fall in love with each other, and you are happy to watch the show, just to watch them be together, plot or no plot, then that show is amazing. I thought this show did that for me, and I hope it does it for you.The third main character, adds a dynamic and powerful force to this story. King Sion is how great kings should be portrayed. He is inspiring at every turn, with perfect mental undersight of every current affair, his courage and intellect make you feel protected, and his beautiful and loving nature make you feel proud to have him as a king. Yet he also has a genuine character that makes him, him! He's not emotionless, he has bold and heroic dreams, and stays true to heart. I really got a sense of these things as the story unfolded, which was achieved in no small part due to great writing, awesome character illustration, and excellent voice acting. Also, his actions were not for the sake of adding excitement to keep the viewer hooked. That's a path where most anime's falter. But not this one. His actions were highly logical and in sync with his character throughout. The same goes for each of the characters in this series.I already mentioned that the relationship between Ryner and Ferris was enough to make me watch this anime regardless of plot. But what makes this series so excellent, in my opinion, is that it actually has an incredible plot. Even transcending into the realm of the metaphysical with divine creatures and demons, then tying it back in perfect conjunction to the central plot.I heard this series was influenced by Berserk, and after watching it, yes, there are definitely many of the same elements. Both are awesome, but Legend of the Legendary Heroes has some important assets that Berserk does not. To name a few, the character development has more meaning, the love between the two main characters has better dynamics, and the ending is better handled in LLH. (I have to question the ending in Berserk, which took things to an incredible pitch, however it wasn't the way I would have liked things to end). Berserk does have MUCH better action scenes and stronger maturity level, which adds an important layer of meaning. If LLH had Berserk's maturity and gripping action scenes it would be the best anime I've ever scene, hands down.In short, I would recommend Berserk for people who like the more serious, mature animes, and LLH for people who don't mind a few silly moments in exchange for so much greatness. still, Ryner and Ferris are like perfect forces of Yin and Yang, each has what the other is missing, each are equally important to one another, and each have quirky characteristics that make them so uniquely special.

While the story and characters do make it seem like there should be much potential in series, there is very little resolution or even major conflict, for that matter. Most of the time is spent on introducing the characters and political motives of the kingdoms involved. Perhaps the production was planning on a 52 episode long series in which the plot would quickly build up to something more meaningful. After even 24 episodes, I feel that the pacing is much slower than expected. There is a mix between episodes...that are filled with action and adventure and others that are more slice of life. This being said. The main plot of the story only picks up in the last couple of episodes of the show.The technical aspects such as animation and sound are more than acceptable. The main draw for me, personally, would be the voice actor, Jun Fukuyama, who plays the main character Ryner Lute. He is well known for other such roles including Lelouche Lamperouge from Code Geass. Watching a series solely for a voice actor/actress might be foolish to begin with.I feel that Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu should be much better than it is. It is also rated much higher than it should be as well. The premise should much promise, though the pacing and direction of the series could have been done in a more effective way in the 24 episodes it was allotted. Sources such as ratings or sales might be the main cause for the production being cut short. that are filled with action and adventure and others that are more slice of life. This being said.

Sources such as ratings or sales might be the main cause for the production being cut short.', 'Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu sells itself as a dark, serious, and mature anime. But really. It\'s just an anti-climactic, choppy, temperamental, indecisive, unfinished hodgepodge medieval political drama that mixes shock value with childish antics and pretentious soliloquys about friendship, salvation, and the darkness of the soul, so primitive you can turn off the subtitles and hear the same short phrases spiraling out of control. It can\'t make up it\'s mind whether it wants to be a political thriller, a slice-of-life, a comedy, or an existential sinkhole.There are three main characters. The first is a female ""Gourry"" (a Slayers reference) named Ferris that is inconsequential...to the story and feels like a filler character thrown in for the sole purpose of bad humor. The second is the cliche pretty boy half-noble Sion who wants to become king to save the world. The last is Ryner, an orphan turned soldier with supernatural abilities that people fear and despise. Tell me you haven\'t heard of that before. There are many subplots, elements, and themes running throughout, but none are done well or even half-realized and all serious moments are undermined by the cheap, out of place comedy. It\'s like a dog on a leash at the pet store darting his head in all directions at all the new smells, never catching more than a whiff.There are 24 episodes, but if you removed all the slapstick humor (with giant swords), office pranks, juvenile teasing, and sexual jokes, you can easily fit it within 10. There\'s even a squad of dimwits a la Team Rocket that hound the MCs as they travel around and are unceremoniously sent flying into the sunset each time, just like Team Rocket. What\'s leftover is two different plotlines that eventually converge, one being Sion trying to manage political threats as a newly appointed king, the other being a roadtrip with Ryner and Ferris to uncover hero relics to bolster the kingdom\'s military power.For how much they exalt Sion as being a just and wise ruler, his decisions are mostly arbitrary and contradictory, with each bonehead move set up to look like a genius strategy or a great revelation of his convictions. He enlists the services of a political assassin to do most of his dirty work, in contrast to all his preaching about wanting to build a better society free of such underhanded schemes, and gives the assassin free rein to start blood baths wherever and whenever, no questions asked. Worst still, these undisclosed schemes are frequently at odds with what Sion is openly trying to accomplish, and his subjects will frequently clash with the assassin, unbeknownst to both parties what the king\'s true intent is. It\'s like bidding on a pair of shoes and using an alt account to bid against yourself, driving the price up. It\'s beyond stupid. There is no collaboration and no grander motive. Sion is frequently confused himself. It\'s just fake political drama, a chance for another fight scene. The political decisions that he does directly make show no great insight or ingenuity, and beyond just being the king and eliminating any nobles defying him internally, he makes little progress with other countries and doesn\'t even conquer a single piece of territory for the duration of the series. There/s even a scene where he proclaims that he\'ll welcome any nobles willing to join him but crush any who oppose him. His fawning subjects are awestruck. It\'s AMAZING! I\'ve never heard such a grand decree! One of many pedestrian remarks and decisions given the kingly treatment.As for Ryner, he may be looking for hero relics, but it\'s mostly just an excuse for him to stumble upon political plots or encounter and do battle with all manner of friend or foe who are either intrigued or despise his Alpha Stigma powers, which can go berserk, killing everything in sight. These attackers are frequently armed with overpowered hero relics, which makes it all the more strange why Ryner and co aren\'t taking the search even half-assed seriously or even using them. The first two relics he discovers, in fact, turn into giant monsters he just runs away from, letting them ravage the countryside. For all the constant, cloying bluster about not wanting to hurt people, he takes no responsibility. Then we have the endless existential dread every time he is reminded what a scary monster with scary powers he is and how he doesn\'t deserve to live. I don\'t need to be reminded ten times an episode, and he needs to make up his mind whether to kill himself or not and stop jumping back and forth to pad the runtime.The last few episodes vaguely introduce you to the mythos surrounding the Alpha Stigma, much of the supernatural forces at play, and even has cameos by Ryner\'s mother and father, popping out of nowhere like Code Geass to throw a bunch of esoteric, nebulous spiel about doors and formulas, lonely demons and black heroes. It\'s your typical poorly explained, half-baked, open-ended, subject to interpretation, Japanese vomit shoehorned near the end of most shows in lieu of a fleshed out backstory or credible mythology. It\'s supposed to justify the endless struggle between Sion and Ryner (""I\'m gonna kill you to save you! No, I\'m gonna save you by killing you!"" - how original) with an EPIC moral struggle. Now repeat that about fifteen times in one episode and try not to shoot your TV. The second to last episode is actually a non-canon OVA, completely destroying any sort of continuity or buildup. Instead of a beach episode, we have to settle with a birthday party for Sion instead. Completely throwaway episode with the same bad humor. The show ends in a cliffhanger, where Sion\'s invasion of the neighboring kingdom of Nelpha is teased. But no one is waiting with bated breath for the sequel.

Please Bear With MeWhenever someone ask me to recommend an anime that has the genre of magic + adventure. The first thing that comes across my mind is most definitely The Legend of the Legendary Heroes AKA (LOLH).Story: 9/10Set in an alternate universe, the story of LOLH is about a young man named Ryner along with a hot girl names Ferris was sent to retrieve the ""ALMIGHTY HERO\'S RELICS"" by the command of the King of Roland Astal Sino. As they were searching for...the relics, they need to venture out the country and as the story progresses, we get to see the darker side of the world, the cruelty of the society. Of course, the anime isn\'t all about the protagonist searching for some random relics. We get to see the backgrounds of the characters, especially Ryner; for his childhood was miserable and through series we get to see him overcome trauma.However, the story ain\'t perfect. There are a lot of plot holes and things left unexplained. Well, thats what Zexcs gets when they try to squeeze a 30vol+ light novel series into a 24 episode anime. Besides, they could have not follow everything in the original material and using only a proportion of the material and add something on it.Art: 7/10The art of this anime isn\'t awe striking or ultra realistic like Kotonoha no Niwa. But it\'d done it\'s job probably, to get enough details in it.Sound: 8/10Awww, I love the openings of LOLH. It is one of my favourite openings. Anyway, the soundtrack matched with the animation, pretty well. It is good enough to bring out the atmosphere of the scenes. It\'s done a pretty good job.Characters: 8/10Background story of the characters were nicely written, with good amount of details in it. Ryner has the most complicated background of all. His mysterious background brought up the whole story.Enjoyment: 10/10It has a wonderful setting, great characters with enough comedy and little bit of romance in it. With some odd/funny side characters to bring up the atmosphere. This anime is very very enjoyable.Overall, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes is an underrated anime. Very few really know this anime well. It has a wonderful yet, somewhat complicated story. It is one my favourite animes of all time. If you have never heard of this anime, you really should check this out. You won\'t regret it.

Overall (9/10)', 'For someone that didn´t really had high exponentiation for this one, boy was I in for a surprise. First of all I can say the I thought this series was great! I happen to love good action and fantasy delivered with a good soundtrack and animation. I think ""Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu"" (""The legend of the legendary heroes"") lives up to all of that. I also think it has a lot of other qualities but I get in to them later. If you have a problem with jumpy stories this probably isn´t for you.  You should also know that this i build up...for a equally long sequel, so all the threads doesn´t connect in the end.  But let´s get to way I truly enjoyed the show.Story 9/10I really enjoyed the story. It´s not the most original story but it doesn´t have to be, it had the right components. It had many elements, it´s just one of those stories that have many aspects. Some lighter scenes with humor and some happiness but also many dark and deeper ones. As I mentioned before the stories jumps back and forth in the timeline, often to get to know the main and supporting characters and know why they are like they are. It also jumps between different characters and geographical locations to build a larger picture. The story brings up subjects like trust, friendship, betrayal, forgiveness, guilt and exclusion. And of course a little love, (i´m a sucker for that) but just to keep the story interesting, it´s not this anime base just a spice.Art 10/10Outstanding. Beautiful colors, well designed characters and class light setting. One of the better I ever seen and I seen a couple now.. Many scenes like a conversation, a sunrise or a battle really comes to life by the art work. I actually bought this one on blu ray just to see it again with great quality, the art work deserves that.Sound 9/10The music and voice actors was great. I liked both openings and i think they reflect the mood change as the series progresses. I think they matched the scenes with fitting music which also supported the story. Overall i really liked the soundtrack a lot.  I watched the dubbed version (I prefer dubbed) and I think the voice actors enjoyed their work because I think they are great.Character 9/10The only reason that it does not get a full 10 is that there were characters that I had wanted to see more of and more background stories on them. But overall a great character development, just what I would have expected from a show that is build on a light novel that was still ongoing at the time. I really liked the main characters Ryner Lute and Ferris Eris. The are forced to team up and work together. They don´t care much for each other in the beginning but to see the how dynamic between them change through out the series is really great.Ryner appears to be a very lazy and clumsy mage who only cares about his next nap and Ferris appears to be an abnormally skilled sociopathic swords woman that only care about dongos (a kind of sweets), but there is a lot more about them then the first appearance. King Sion is a very complex character, which will be clear as the story progresses. It´s a lot of interesting supporting characters as well, like the kings closets associates and their enemies. Thought is also put into the ""villains"", whom all have there own reasons to do what they do. The clear line between good and evil that easily slip into this kind of anime is enjoyably absent.Enjoyment 10/10I enjoy the hell out of my self watching this one. I really liked that I didn´t now where the show was going, with twist and turns. The combination of great art work,  nice setting music, good plot and interesting characters really pulled me in. I should mention that ""Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu"" fits all my favorite genres, so if this is not your favorites it´s a chance that you will not agree with me.Overall 9/10Overall I loved it! If it was possible to give it 9,5 i would. The only reason that ""Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu"" not reaches a full 10 is  is that the second sequel hasn´t come out get as anime and may not never come. But anyway a great show. I will definitely watching this again. I think this show highly under rated. for a equally long sequel, so all the threads doesn´t connect in the end.  But let´s get to way I truly enjoyed the show.Story 9/10I really enjoyed the story. It´s not the most original story but it doesn´t have to be, it had the right components. It had many elements, it´s just one of those stories that have many aspects. Some lighter scenes with humor and some happiness but also many dark and deeper ones. As I mentioned before the stories jumps back and forth in the timeline, often to get to know the main and supporting characters and know why they are like they are. It also jumps between different characters and geographical locations to build a larger picture. The story brings up subjects like trust, friendship, betrayal, forgiveness, guilt and exclusion. And of course a little love, (i´m a sucker for that) but just to keep the story interesting, it´s not this anime base just a spice.Art 10/10Outstanding. Beautiful colors, well designed characters and class light setting. One of the better I ever seen and I seen a couple now.. Many scenes like a conversation, a sunrise or a battle really comes to life by the art work. I actually bought this one on blu ray just to see it again with great quality, the art work deserves that.Sound 9/10The music and voice actors was great. I liked both openings and i think they reflect the mood change as the series progresses. I think they matched the scenes with fitting music which also supported the story. Overall i really liked the soundtrack a lot.  I watched the dubbed version (I prefer dubbed) and I think the voice actors enjoyed their work because I think they are great.Character 9/10The only reason that it does not get a full 10 is that there were characters that I had wanted to see more of and more background stories on them. But overall a great character development, just what I would have expected from a show that is build on a light novel that was still ongoing at the time. I really liked the main characters Ryner Lute and Ferris Eris. The are forced to team up and work together. They don´t care much for each other in the beginning but to see the how dynamic between them change through out the series is really great.Ryner appears to be a very lazy and clumsy mage who only cares about his next nap and Ferris appears to be an abnormally skilled sociopathic swords woman that only care about dongos (a kind of sweets), but there is a lot more about them then the first appearance. King Sion is a very complex character, which will be clear as the story progresses. It´s a lot of interesting supporting characters as well, like the kings closets associates and their enemies. Thought is also put into the ""villains"", whom all have there own reasons to do what they do. The clear line between good and evil that easily slip into this kind of anime is enjoyably absent.Enjoyment 10/10I enjoy the hell out of my self watching this one.

I think this show highly under rated.', 'Overalllegend of legendary heroes disappointed me right outside the gate, with its ill-timed humour, gratuitous violence and unoriginal character constructs. legend of legendary heroes may have taken place at a fictional country at a fictional time, but of course we all know it\'s based on some form of European culture...because that\'s what most of their animes are based on. this show disappointed me because it had the potential to be so much better given the fact that the source material is a freakin novel. but it relied on so many anime cliches that it did more harm than good. not to mention the storytelling...and art were both lazy and predictable.Audiothe first season OP theme song was a very generic anime song, nothing to remember nothing to celebrate. same could be said for the first season ending theme song, but I have a feeling I may have liked it if it weren\'t for those corny images of the suffering children. that was just too much of an anime stereotype plus I don\'t like having my emotions toyed with. so its a no for the first season\'s open and closing theme songs....actually I couldn\'t give a shit about any of the songs. I watched the series in english dub, I would say they did a mediocre job. all of the lolitas voices were high pitched and annoying, so I guess that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. the best voice definitely belonged to, Miran Froaude. aristocratic with a hint of villainy.Visualsthe art is nice, it\'s what drew me to the title in the first place. but I wouldn\'t say it\'s the best art I\'ve seen in anime. not by a long shot. plus the art doesn\'t quite do what it\'s supposed to do, which is to capture the scenes as they might have been depicted in the novels. example: the scenes that are supposed to suggest opulence such as the palace parties, look bland; the scenes that are supposed to suggest the gruesomeness of war also look equally as bland. I also think the series relied too heavily on dramatic lighting..excessive soft glows, special effects glows, glitters and streaky shadows abound. the animation was pitiful considering the day and age and all the technological resources we have at our fingertips now, so there\'s no reason for the animation to have been as jumpy or as jittery as it was in some scenes. gratuitous scenes of violence are also rife throughout this series and it\'s pretty obvious why: to serve more as a plot diversion, cuz the storytelling sucks, shock value and to boost ratings, because everyone respects bloody anime, but also it was used as an animation shortcut. one swipe with a blade and 5 people just a rip open like packets of ketchup, with blood splattering everywhere especially on the camera lens so you don\'t have to draw anything else...cheap trick.Storythe story and then the characters were the biggest let down. there was just something not very ""true"" about this story: not very genuine. I can appreciate it being an anime, I can appreciate it been a fantasy anime, but it just doesn\'t come off as a very genuine story. I can\'t help but wonder if the comedic elements in the light novel were just as disjointed....and tacky. in one scene we have people\'s heads being cut off with blood splattering everywhere, and then right next to that you have some b**** eating dango on a stick or some whiny high pitched Lolita (and there are several lolitas in this) in pigtails go on and on about why she loves her big sister. in what universe or reality does this seem possible, or even logical? I will say that it is the serious side of this anime that has kept me interested. I do like the general idea of a corrupted monarchy, greedy heirs at each others throats, kingdoms at war, political intrigue and all that other good stuff. but it\'s that f****** weird goofy comedy that absolutely doesn\'t fit! who finds repeatedly abusive behavior funny?the overall theme(s) of the story is annoying, it doesn\'t help that the perspective and the narration are constantly being switched around between 3 or 4 different people. is it a story about the survival of a nation or a story about self discovery? perhaps a story about the pursuit of dreams? is it a love story or is it just a simple story about a quest to collect ancient relics? the problem is, can\'t really use that ""all of the above"" option unless you also want to accept that it\'s an over-inflated, over-ambitious, piece of shit douchebag anime series. Plus we already have much better anime out there that\'s already doing the ""Multifaceted"" swiss army knife thing. And you can\'t just shrug your shoulders and say hey that\'s just anime. we have enough anime out there that\'s already doing the ""Senseless anime"" thing.  But it\'s pretty obvious that the first option is exactly what this anime is trying to achieve. however it fails at accomplishing this, mainly for two reasons that I can see: 1, the majority of characters are walking cliches, not enough back story is given to these 2d characters to bind them to these roles you actually need them to portray (how does the bastard son of a concubine become king? ) And then 2, the widely varying emotional tones swinging from deadly serious to goofy slapstick. just because it\'s in anime. there\'s a reason why anime has different genres; each genre has it\'s own type of humour style and message and what\'s being emotionally required of the audience cannot all come from one anime. just all lumped in together and have it make sense. that\'s like saying you\'re gonna eat: tuna salad, chocolate, tofu, mackerel and cheese with a red wine all because they are edible and therefore you can. but does it sound like a pleasurable experience? no.and do not get me started on what ever the fuck those last few episodes were supposed to be about? some sort of wanna be shakespeare macbeth, king lear shit, with all these internal dialogues.....no, just no.charactersthe characters annoy me. yes they\'re beautiful, yes they\'re bishounen but they\'re very two-dimensional. which is a surprise to me, given the very rich resource that these characters were drawn from, a fuckin novel! I\'m not gonna go through all of the characters of the series but I am gonna talk about the main ones and why they annoy me. the boy or the main character, has an overwhelmingly strong power, but of course he has a personality that undermines that, because no one likes a cocky protagonist! so of course he\'s incredibly meek or incredibly shy, or very clumsy and in this case he\'s very lazy. needless to say when the appropriate time comes, he snaps out of it, he uses his incredible magic and he saves the day.the blonde woman instantly made me want to gag. she has blonde hair and blue eyes....so of course this means she\'s beautiful (insert gagging noise here... ) and of course she carries the sword, because she\'s the one with the penis envy and needs to carry some phallic weapon. the second part of her penis envy is evident by her unnecessarily abusive behaviour towards the males. is this supposed to be comedy? because I don\'t find it funny. is it supposed to hide the fact that he is infinitely stronger than she is? I hope not, since we already know from the first episode this isn\'t the case. and why isn\'t she fat? all she ever does is sit there chowing down on some dango which was funny maybe 3 out of the 5000 times they attempted the same lame dango joke.the gay king is also equally as annoying, once again another two dimensional character who\'s been given a flimsy background story: bastard child, some sort of abuse or neglect, magically becomes king of the country. I say he\'s gay because he doesn\'t seem to have any interest in any other person except the lead male character and some never ending piles of paperwork. and I\'m sure he\'s written that way on purpose so that we can have all these innuendos throughout the series.... for the fangirls. yes I\'d say that I am probably the most disappointed in this character. because the more serious and deeper elements of the story seems to come from his perspective. but for whatever reason the anime did not want to focus only on the serious side, they wanted shit to be light and goofy...and that\'s why the story sucked. did we even get to find out who killed the vassel? because I have a feeling the king did it himself.verdictI\'d say 4 maybe a 5...because conceptually it was a good story, but then again would credit go to the anime or to the original novel? I guess the anime, because it did capture the original concept, it was just poorly executed. the comedy was repetitive and disastrous, the violence and gore were gimmicky. the serious elements were left unexplored and the pathos seemed both preachy and trite at the same time. and art were both lazy and predictable.Audiothe first season OP theme song was a very generic anime song, nothing to remember nothing to celebrate. same could be said for the first season ending theme song, but I have a feeling I may have liked it if it weren\'t for those corny images of the suffering children. that was just too much of an anime stereotype plus I don\'t like having my emotions toyed with. so its a no for the first season\'s open and closing theme songs....actually I couldn\'t give a shit about any of the songs.

Watching episodes 1-10 was like a challenge for me, it was so boring and all of the elements which the anime mixed up is not satisfying to watch.A little bit of gore and dark/edgy genre, then they will add this unnecessary comedy scenes which completely ruins the mood. This anime was a rollercoaster of genres which is not compatible with each other, dark/edgy and comedy. Too much of those and you will produce some cringy scenes.To be honest I really have hopes...that the story will be a little better from what I expected, but no its not. The legend of legendary heroes has so many potential but it is all wasted because of its unnecessary mix of genre and its minimal progress. I'm really disappointed. The story just gets better for me in ep 20 but after watching 23 which is a shitload of cringy and filler episode which makes the build up curiosity of mine just shattered into pieces.The ending? It really sucks, I'm hoping that the mc will finally grow feelings to the fmc as she harbors feelings to him but no. Still dumbass and just consider her as his partner. Like yeah I'm okay if there is no progress in the main conflict of the king but at least make a progress of love interest between ryner and ferris. But no, it was all left to a cliffhanger. To the fact that this anime has 24 episodes but still no concrete progress of the king's conflict and between ryner and ferris is such a waste to watch.Overall: I really wasted my time watching this anime, unlike all of the anime I've watched this is the only anime that I gained nothing after watching it. So if you have some spare time to waste and just looking for an interesting plot. Watch this, but if you are asking me please don't. I really gave this anime many chances to improve as I want to like it but in the end. I just really wanted to finish it to know on how it will end. that the story will be a little better from what I expected, but no its not.

Did anyone else get Naruto vibes whilst watching this crap? ""Hurr because you have the Sharingan - oops, I meant Alpha Stigma - or Lino Doue or [insert whatever special power here], I and everyone else hate and fear you even though having that power says nothing about you as a person"". Yeah, that\'s how much sense it makes - none at all.Has anyone else gotten tired of the eye hax bullshit already? LOOK AT ME, I HAVE SPECIAL EYE POWERS! Fucking dumb....Did anyone else notice how the Alpha Stigma is basically the same thing as the Sharingan? The ability to ""comprehend"" everything? Inherent magical powers? Activated by the death of a close one? Trait only present in rare few humans? The Alpha Stigma is basically the Sharingan with a different name.Did anyone else notice how Ryner Lute is basically Naruto personality wise and Guts story wise? Naruto is a slacker, so is Ryner Lute. Ryner has no ordinary Alpha Stigma! No, his Alpha Stigma is SPECIAL! Just like Naruto\'s tailed beast is SPECIAL! Also when Ryner activates his Alpha Stigma he throws a hissy fit! Just like how Naruto throws a tantrum when he goes into tailed beast mode! So original! Is there more to Ryner Lute\'s personality other than ""Ah wunna protect mah friens!!""? Same with Naruto! Wow, what a complex and multifaceted personality! Totally not a one-dimensional typical shonenshit protag like Bleach\'s Ichigo! Did I mention that HE MEETS HIS MOTHER WHO SACRIFICED HERSELF IN HIS INNER WORLD? Can you rip off Naruto any more? I don\'t think so! Oh, also at the end Ryner Lute swears he will bring Sasuke - woops, I meant Sion - out of ""the darkness"" (TM). Top kek. And Sion, oh my god, he is the exact replica of Griffith. How he invited Guts - sorry, Ryner - into his little group, how EVERYONE got killed except him, Ryner and the other main character who is a girl (*cough*Casca*cough*). How he sacrificed all his friends to gain power(ahem - become king). Then start wars. Dat inner dialogue resembling that of a megalomaniac.It\'s like the author just read Berserk and Naruto and then decided to combine them into one clusterfuck of shit that had an edgier story than Berserk and a shittier cast than Naruto, if that was even possible.Now onto the action. The action, to put it plainly, sucks. Half of the ""battles"" are not really battles, just people laughing like retards whilst *black screen* *blood splatter* x_x.The Alpha Stigma happens to be a way shittier power than the Sharingan to watch in action because it\'s just a bunch of pentagrams rotating on the screen and occasionally laser beams turn people into dust (but the screen goes black so you don\'t actually see it). It\'s shit. At least with the Sharingan (in the Forest of Death episodes at least) you got to see actual hand-to-hand combat, people throwing shurikens etc. In LOTLH all you see is people\'s magical rotating pentagrams firing magic lightning bolts at others magical rotating pentagram. It\'s boring as fuck. Sorry, the animation is just so BADLY DIRECTED it hurts. Whenever something cool happens, everything turns black and red so you can\'t see it. Also, characters don\'t engage in any real melee combat, they just blink from one place to another.All in all I wouldn\'t recommend this show to anyone.

Also, characters don\'t engage in any real melee combat, they just blink from one place to another.All in all I wouldn\'t recommend this show to anyone.', 'Well, I\'m making this review to give a couple of advices and say what I think of the show.First a warning, first episode it\'s not the actual first one and gives a bad first impresion. So you may want to start with the second one. This one would be 5.5 or 6.5, I don\'t remember exactly what episode it would be.STORY:First, the story is good, nice pace and with some unique elements. First of all half of the show have like 2 stories at the same time. Ryner that has a more classic adventure type of plot and Sion that has something close to GoT...type, until both stories converge at one point.The plot is simple BUT a lot of things are said in an implicit way and not in a ""IN YOUR FACE"" kind of telling. You need to pay atention to it or you are going to end up complaining about ""how random the plot is"". THEY EXPLAIN MOST THINGS and the show has a pretty linear plot with a couple of plot twist but following the logic it had, nothing is out of place.The world is one of the things that I liked the most, there are a lot of countries and every each of them have their own kind of magic. There a lot of legends like the name of the show implies, about relics, special powers and heroes, lot of them are important in the plot. Ryner adventure collect a lot of lore about the world while Sion side give information about the factions in the world.This has a lot of comedy, sometimes you have a fun moment and then a very serius moment. We have a couple of the changes from time to time. Also a lot of times something that seems very serius ends up being a joke. Some things that seem important and then left behind may apear again later. It has a bit of romance.ART AND ANIMATION:The animation is good with really fluid movements and well used CGI. The art is kinda hit or miss I guess, I like it tho.Nice amount of action involving swordplay, magic, the relics and special unique powers. Also we have various kinds of scales of battle, from duels, to tag team battle, a couple of massacres and army battles. So your are going to see action here.CHARACTERS:I liked the characters a lot, most of them are developed, including secondary cast. We get to see their backstories, their goals, their problems and how some of them change(for good and for worse).RYNER, one of my favorite characters and I feel a bit related too it. This character is on the OP side but not the strongest one. Lot of people complain about him not going on a killing spree every time that he can because he is strong... HE DOESN\'T LIKE TO KILL PEOPLE !! But don\'t be afraid, this show has plently of killing and it\'s on the gore side sometimes.FERRIS, the female MC, this characters has a lot of hate, a missunderstanding about her it\'s her behaviour. She ""abuse"" the MC... BUT a lot of times it means something, it isn\'t blind violence. Look the context of her actions, a lot of times she does it because the MC is doing something dumb or because she is worried about him. Also a lot of times they are just joking, playing or doing dumb stuff together. It\'s not that hard to see that they really get along and have a fun dinamic. She has DereDere moments.SOUND:The soundtrack is OK, nothing good nor bad to say.OVERALL:GOOD:-Nice and violent action scenes.-Well developed and interesting characters.-Good plot.-Rich lore and world.-Great animation.-Decent comedy.BAD:-For some people the plot isn\'t explained enough and might get lost, so pay atention because they explain!!!-Around the 2 last episodes the pace gets weird and some random interactions between some of the cast and the MC apear, nothing great tho. It has a cool fight near the end too.-First episode.-Incomplete story. The LN is still ongoing after 8 years since the show ended, sooo the ending is pretty open.-The timing of some jokes might be annoying for some people. type, until both stories converge at one point.The plot is simple BUT a lot of things are said in an implicit way and not in a ""IN YOUR FACE"" kind of telling. You need to pay atention to it or you are going to end up complaining about ""how random the plot is"". THEY EXPLAIN MOST THINGS and the show has a pretty linear plot with a couple of plot twist but following the logic it had, nothing is out of place.The world is one of the things that I liked the most, there are a lot of countries and every each of them have their own kind of magic. There a lot of legends like the name of the show implies, about relics, special powers and heroes, lot of them are important in the plot. Ryner adventure collect a lot of lore about the world while Sion side give information about the factions in the world.This has a lot of comedy, sometimes you have a fun moment and then a very serius moment. We have a couple of the changes from time to time. Also a lot of times something that seems very serius ends up being a joke. Some things that seem important and then left behind may apear again later. It has a bit of romance.ART AND ANIMATION:The animation is good with really fluid movements and well used CGI. The art is kinda hit or miss I guess, I like it tho.Nice amount of action involving swordplay, magic, the relics and special unique powers. Also we have various kinds of scales of battle, from duels, to tag team battle, a couple of massacres and army battles. So your are going to see action here.CHARACTERS:I liked the characters a lot, most of them are developed, including secondary cast. We get to see their backstories, their goals, their problems and how some of them change(for good and for worse).RYNER, one of my favorite characters and I feel a bit related too it. This character is on the OP side but not the strongest one. Lot of people complain about him not going on a killing spree every time that he can because he is strong... HE DOESN\'T LIKE TO KILL PEOPLE !! But don\'t be afraid, this show has plently of killing and it\'s on the gore side sometimes.FERRIS, the female MC, this characters has a lot of hate, a missunderstanding about her it\'s her behaviour. She ""abuse"" the MC... BUT a lot of times it means something, it isn\'t blind violence. Look the context of her actions, a lot of times she does it because the MC is doing something dumb or because she is worried about him. Also a lot of times they are just joking, playing or doing dumb stuff together. It\'s not that hard to see that they really get along and have a fun dinamic. She has DereDere moments.SOUND:The soundtrack is OK, nothing good nor bad to say.OVERALL:GOOD:-Nice and violent action scenes.-Well developed and interesting characters.-Good plot.-Rich lore and world.-Great animation.-Decent comedy.BAD:-For some people the plot isn\'t explained enough and might get lost, so pay atention because they explain!!!-Around the 2 last episodes the pace gets weird and some random interactions between some of the cast and the MC apear, nothing great tho. It has a cool fight near the end too.-First episode.-Incomplete story. The LN is still ongoing after 8 years since the show ended, sooo the ending is pretty open.-The timing of some jokes might be annoying for some people.', ""Quick note before I begin: All parts will be graded and then added up to make up a final score out of ten. I will grade out of sound, animation, story, characters, and personal enjoyment. I'm sorry if all this seems vague, but I have not watched this anime for about two years. Also there is no selection to rate the story here, but I will add it in here anyway.Better way to read the review: https://sloaneranime.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/review-the-legend-of-legendary-heroesSoundI'll start with sound. I am a fan of both of the openings, although I think the second one is my favorite of the two. Both endings are also...very elegant and calming, and the first is my favorite. The sound track is more or less typical of kingdom animes such as these, but at the same time that is not a bad thing. The various, sometimes very gory sound affects are just okay, not amazing. The voice acting is good. I think I watched the series in dub, and the voices fit well. I watched some clips of the sub and that also seems to be well done.Score: 1.5AnimationNext up is the animation. When considering how to grade this, you have to take into account both the art style and the age of the anime. Since TLLH is an older anime and was made in a era of transition (between digital background/effects and draw), the background is pretty bad most of the time. I’m not going to say it is better than it is… The art style is pretty typical, but fits the content and style of the anime quite well. The effects for Ryner’s special ability do not disappoint.The depiction of death is dealt will in a way that is pretty brutal, but certainly not as brutal as it could be. I find it to be somewhat artistic, although some may consider it a form of censorship. The normal fight scenes are decent. I like how a lot of it is drawn (including horses might I add!) The animation overall doesn’t take away from the anime, but actually makes the anime better. Despite it’s age, the animation is solid.Score: 1.4StoryThe storyline of TLLH is not the most clear, but still magnates to keep it together. The premise itself is not very unique, but the progression throughout the series is what helps to differentiate the anime from others. Also the synopsis given on MAL gives the series absolutely no justice. Despite this, the story itself is well developed, especially by the characters. The paths that the main characters follow make sense, and the flashbacks flow smoothly with the main story line. On the other hand, some of the side characters seem to be poorly worked into the anime (they would seemingly appear out of no where).  Overall, the story is not very memorable (obviously), but the series makes up this in other areas.Score: 1.2CharactersI think the characters are easily the strongest part of the anime. The main characters are incredibly well developed through a combination of flashbacks and influential events. First I will talk about Ryner, the holder of a legendary power called the Alpha Stigma. Ryner is a somewhat  atypical main protagonist. He is seemingly unmotivated, yet possesses a great deal of skill for the magical arts. Ryner is unique because he fears his power more than any other character in the series. I think Ryner is one of the stronger leads in anime, as he carries the series very nicely and maintains his unique character. Ryner's past with Sion and journey with Ferris are the main focus of the anime. Sion is a (more or less) childhood friend of Ryner's. The two of them make a pack, agreeing that Ryner would do all that he can to help Sion take the thrown and dominate the country. Sion is a very calm and collected character. He is also very loyal to Ryner's, and saves his life on a number of occasions. Sion also helps bring Ryner and Ferris together. Ferris is somewhat blunt, but also pretty sweet deep down. Ferris is a sword wielding badass with a passion for dango and a unique past. The low-key romance between Ryner and Ferris helps TLLH to have light and humorous moments amongst the action and death filled moments.The side characters are also pretty enjoyable, and don't steal the show by any means. I like the red haired right hand man to Sion, Claugh. I also like the pink haired guy with the big sword, Riphal. Raven (Miran) is also a very interesting character, as he is caught in between his loyalty to Sion and Ryner. The antagonists of the series are forgettable, but serve their role just fine overall.Score: 1.7EnjoymentMy personal enjoyment of the series is one that is greatly influenced by nostalgia, as TLLH was one of the first anime I have ever watched. I really liked the contrast between the military, magic, and adventure sides of the anime. I only wished that the ending was finished off a bit better.Score:   1.6OVERALL SCORE: 7.4Overall, I would recommend the series to fan of action, supernatural, fantasy, and military.I would consider this a must-watch for fans of Kingdom animes. Another great Kingdom anime is Arslan Senki. very elegant and calming, and the first is my favorite.

I thought ""With that name it probably isn\'t  a good anime"".Fortunately when i began watching the first few episodes i saw  the story develop. You have a main character who is really strong but acts lazy and doesn\'t use his powers much and you have a super strong female lead who acts cruel to him. As you know he was forced to search for the ""Hero relics"" the fact that he was forced too made the story sound more interesting to me.Now for the art.I don\'t...watch animes that have poor art or really old looking. When i look through list of animes i usually judge if i want to watch it based on how it looks (that might be a bad habit if the arts not good or ""crappy"" but everything else is good about it.) So when i saw this animes art it looks newer then most animes and looks decent to watch the art when fighting made the anime really nice to look at and watch . Even so the art could be better hence why i gave it a 9As for the sound i usually like to listen to music in animes  when something big is going to happen or at the beginning or end of the episode.When i listened to the music in this anime it was pretty good. The sound effects for fighting , using magic and everything was pretty good better then your average animes. That\'s why i gave it a 9.The character\'s were just unique. Usually when the main character gets discriminated against they act dull and become dark characters.In this anime they could have did that but they chose a differentpath. The main characters gets tormented as a child but chooses toact calmly and just act normal. Usually in most animes the female lead is ""gaga"" over the main character, but in this anime the female lead acts strong and shows no affection , but really likes the main character. That\'s why i gave it a 10.Honestly anyone would enjoy this anime even if they aren\'t into the theme it\'s just fun to watch as things happen to the main character. Basically if your just looking for an anime to watch to pass time then you could watch this too. So i would say the enjoyment would get a 10.Overall i would give this anime a 9. watch animes that have poor art or really old looking.

The art and sound were pretty good, nothing to really complain about, its an action anime after all.My favorite aspect of this anime though was absolutely the characters. Even though at first some of them seem like your typical anime save-the-world kind of characters, each one has...a complex personality and the ""good guys and bad guys"" arent just a black and white concept. In this aspect, the anime is almost realistic, showing that each person has some core reason to think and act the way they do and even the best intentions can lead to the worst conclusion.I have to say that even though the characters were the best part of this anime, they were also the worst. In basically every episode there was a new character introduced, and toward the end of the episode you would like that person. Then the character that you thought you really wanted to see in future episodes, one that had the potential to be of serious importance and in the end, they disappear. If this happened once or twice then it would be fine, but it seemed that every character had some side story that the anime was leading up to and in the end it didnt tell you any of them. It makes no sense!I guess to sum it all up, the story and characters were great, but they threw in way too many twists that you thought ""Wow i wonder what happened"" or ""Oh I cant wait until this all comes together"" and then by the end they give you this messy wrapping paper and this shitty bow and call it the end. I say this anime was more aimed towards people who dont read too much into things, because if you ignore all the what ifs, this anime was pretty darn good! a complex personality and the ""good guys and bad guys"" arent just a black and white concept.

If that's the sort of thing you're into, this anime definitely gets interesting.Starting early on in the series, we come to understand that the protagonist is someone very special. While people in this world get trained in the use of various types of magic, a specially-born person with something called an alpha stigma can immediately copy any spell they see. But on top of that, when pushed too far, this person can go berserk and unleash utter havoc on both friend and foe. That's the...burden Ryner Lute has to wrestle with throughout his soul-searching journey, and one that his friends struggle at times to contend with.At the same time, the kingdom that Ryner lives in is one of typical social injustice as per the caste system. His friend, Sion Astal, seeks to change all that by becoming king from the ground up, a goal he accomplishes but then decidedly comes to odds with in his unending, escalating efforts to make the world a better place. The story unfolds between these two focal points, with superb dialogue fit for the age.The art and sound are both decently well done. There are a lot of action scenes with plenty of violence and bloodshed. But scenery can fall flat and be generally uninteresting, and I would have liked seeing more of a variety of outfits on characters, especially considering that most of the ones we focus on are higher-up sort of people. The sound isn't terrible, but it does lack in faculty during battles. It gets pretty bad during the largest action scenes, where it feels like none of the explosions pack any sort of punch.Characters are all very well done though. Ryner comes with a lot of depth surrounding his monstrous circumstance that pits him in a precarious position. He wants to be with people, but at the same time fears that he may harm them or that they may consider him just a beast to be killed. His companion Ferris, however, seems mixed but really pulls through to help show him that she's a true friend. Most of the time, she just calls him a pervert, and dreams up wild imaginings of him impregnating anyone he touches or teaching any young kid he speaks to the wicked ways of perversion. She's also monstrously obsessed with dango. But she cares more for him than she cares to admit. Sion, the other main focus, goes through a lot on the throne, which gets him in the end. Many of the supporting cast get some back story interlaced through the story, but there are still characters left out which could've used more supporting history.This anime was pretty easy to watch! Everything was enjoyable till the end, which definitely felt rushed. It's also unfortunate that 4 years after this series aired, we still don't have a second season. Fair warning: a great story, with interesting characters and interesting building, but a bad cliffhanger ending that just begs for more. Things are just starting to really heat up by the time the end rolls around, and then it all stops. burden Ryner Lute has to wrestle with throughout his soul-searching journey, and one that his friends struggle at times to contend with.At the same time, the kingdom that Ryner lives in is one of typical social injustice as per the caste system.

I'm going to have a LEGENDARY breakdown. To quickly summarize, the anime does an excellent job of getting you excited and into the story. Tons of arcs are introduced and you can just tell the story is going to be great. Now the problems... I sure hope you're able to read Japanese because the light novel is the only way you're going to get any sort of conclusion.Story 6/10The story is complex, convoluted, confusing at times, but has all the markings to...be epic. They chose to introduce way too many story lines and leave a lot of them fairly undeveloped as of the end of the anime. I think they put all of their eggs into the season 2 basket, because there was so much left in the air or unexplained that you can't possibly be left with a good feeling as a viewer.Art 8/10The art was very good. I enjoyed the characters and fight sequences. There wer some funny gifable moments as well.Sound 6/10Sound was OK. Nothing too memorable but it does it's job.Character 7/10This one is tricky. Some characters are given quite a bit of development, while others have confusing back stories and you really have no idea what their deal is.

They chose to introduce way too many story lines and leave a lot of them fairly undeveloped as of the end of the anime.

I enjoyed the characters and fight sequences. There wer some funny gifable moments as well.Sound 6/10Sound was OK. Nothing too memorable but it does it's job.Character 7/10This one is tricky.

Yet, despite the retro setting, the characters have depth of having a surface and a darker and more serious level beneath that. The whole eye thing is similar to Code Geass, yet it is...nothing like that at the same time. Anyway, if you're looking for an epic anime, this is one though the story may be a little complicated it sorts itself out in the end. If you don't like the whole deep story there are some killer action scenes at least one per episode, I think, so something for everyone. Romance too, and plenty of comedy this anime has it all and in good balance too. I won't say why it isn't a ten cause that would be a spoiler. Enjoy this one. nothing like that at the same time.

I lowered my...score to an 8 because of my frustration with the end... which if you read on will be explained. Up until the last episode the show had wavered between a 10 and a 9 for me.Now for the things I noticed in the series.First of all the story is really interesting not due to the actual plot of the series but because of the whole premise of the show/world. (Although, I will say that the plot is pretty interesting) Its not so much the plot line following Ryner and Sion that I found so interesting, but what was happening in their world during the course of the show. It was the social conflict between countries, between the people and the ""monsters"", etc and how people/characters changed or didn\'t change in reaction to them that I found really intriguing.I also hadn\'t thought about it much until I watched the last episode, but I realized that the first half of the series is really just an introduction to the world. The plot really doesn\'t pick up until the second half of the show. At the same time, I never found this frustrating and the show was never anything but enjoyable to me. Perhaps it is this careful development of the world that makes my first comment about the series true. I also think that this is part of the reason that the characters within the series have the depth that they have.However, this leads into my last comment. When I watched the last episode I simply could not believe it was the last one, not because I didn\'t want the show to end, but because I felt like it wasn\'t the end. It felt like one of the all too familiar cliff hangers that the show uses unashamedly and continuously. Because the real story didn\'t begin to be developed until later on in the series, I feel the writers had to rush to ""get it all in.""  Sadly, the show suffered for it. Character side stories were abandoned and unfinished. The last episode leaves the series completely wide open with no real ending to it at all. Watchers are left scratching their heads and wondering what in the world the point was beyond a simply exquisite peak into another world\'s history.*spoilers*I also felt some of the characters suffered from the rushed ending. I found myself wondering what happened to Kiefer after she was suspected of being a spy by Edea. She makes an extremely brief appearance in the last episode in an attempt (I assume) to show watchers that she somehow made it out of her sticky situation in one piece... yet, this answers no questions at all. Does that mean Edea let her go, or did she escape? Is she now acting on his orders in trade for her life? How did she know where Ryner was, and how did she get there that quickly, and why wasn\'t Edea or any of his people with her?  I also had to wonder about Tiir and Milk, these characters dropped off with no real explanation toward the last few episodes as well.  Lastly, one has to wonder... Who was the man who showed his face in only one episode, but seemed to be an important character (he kills Ryner and tests Ferris)? Who was the woman in the very last episode that stops Lucile and Sion.  How can Lucile be the ""Weaver"" if Sion is the Hero who consumed him? What will Lucile do when he realizes Ferris ran off with Ryner?I honestly feel as if the show has another season left in it (I wouldn\'t be opposed to that at all, in fact I would watch it gladly). So many unanswered questions and so many possibilities. What were the writers thinking finishing in such an open ended and rushed manner?Having said all of this, I still really enjoyed the show and would def recommend it.

On one hand they were enjoyable, and some of them were somewhat nuanced (some) Many of them felt very one note for me. The female lead Ferris has this obsession with dango that boarders on crazy. I feel like the beat me over the head with it every episode. I feel like half her lines are talking about dango I legit was getting really sick of it by the end of the series. Ryner had similar...issues with the dialogue where he constantly talks about the same stuff over and over again. I liked some of the minor characters more then the main ones just because they felt more varied and I understood their motivations better. My favorite character was probably Sion partially because he's hot, but also I felt like his inner turmoil was expressed a lot better then many of the other characters. Although at the end I was extremely lost and had no idea what was going on.Charater design/animation: In terms of character design I wasn't very impressed. Most of the characters were really just gave me 'fantasy world resident' vibes. Like, they were colorful but not in a fun way just an obligatory way. I really only like Sion's design because I have a weakness for long hair on dudes. The animation felt really inconsistent as well. There was one episode where it looked like someone else did the animation. Don't get me wrong that episode had much better animation, it just kinda brought me out of the episode because it felt so different. Otherwise it really wasn't bad or great it was just fine. It didn't enhance or subtract from my experience at all.Music/VA: I now have a personal vendetta against Ryner's voice actor. It's not that I thought he was bad or particularly miscast, he just got on my nerves. Something about that voice makes me feel like he's looking down on me all the time. The other performances were just mediocre. I feel like Sion's voice actor could have put in a little more effort but it hardly matters. The music was just boring and forgettable. The intro and outro were just random songs that will probably fade from my memory in like two days.Pacing: This was realllllly bad for me. I could never tell if this show was going for fun romp in fantasy world or serious political war show. One episode would be somewhat lighthearted and then in the next some guy was murdering like thousands of people. I never felt like the big scenes were properly built up to at all. The show also suffered greatly from too many perspectives. There were a LOT of characters and wayyyy to many of them got wayyyy too much screentime. It also seemed like many of the conflicts were resolved either really quickly or really slowly. There was one episode where I was like 'Is this show finally going to be awesome?' and then in the next episode all the tension was gone and the characters just acted like nothing happened.Plot: This show couldn't figure out what it wanted to be at all. It seemed at the beginning that it would be like a quest where they find all the hero relics and gather them with some fun scenes and cool dungeons. But that part was just pushed aside very fast and when hero relics are used later in the series, nobody seems to be that intent on stealing them or anything. Also where did they come from? So many characters seem to pull these things from thin air but it's never really explained where they got them from. I thought they were like super rare and legendary??? At one point the protagonist just leaves one behind randomly and some guy picks it up and uses it against him, like why didn't you take it with you I thought that was your goal? Many of the episodes attempt to be dark and political but it was just confusing. I couldn't keep all the countries and alliances straight at all and I just kind of gave up after awhile. Also the couple of times when the protagonist goes 'berserk' were just kind of funny instead of foreboding or scary (no thanks to the VA) The way he starts laughing maniacally is just cringe. The protagonist is also described as Roland's best magician but we only see him using like four spells and he is constantly being beat up or knocked out by complete randos that we only see once and never again (i'm looking at you random man) His cool ability is supposed to be stealing magic by comprehending it immediately but he almost never does that past like the halfway part in the series. It's like they forgot he could do that because they were too focused on his constant suffering.It may seem like I hate the show from this review, but I do not think it is not worth watching. I think many people can and have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it. I just think that someone like me who has seen a ton of anime will find it somewhat mediocre. If it's one of your first anime however, I think I could see people enjoying it more then I did, issues with the dialogue where he constantly talks about the same stuff over and over again. I liked some of the minor characters more then the main ones just because they felt more varied and I understood their motivations better. My favorite character was probably Sion partially because he's hot, but also I felt like his inner turmoil was expressed a lot better then many of the other characters. Although at the end I was extremely lost and had no idea what was going on.Charater design/animation: In terms of character design I wasn't very impressed. Most of the characters were really just gave me 'fantasy world resident' vibes. Like, they were colorful but not in a fun way just an obligatory way. I really only like Sion's design because I have a weakness for long hair on dudes. The animation felt really inconsistent as well. There was one episode where it looked like someone else did the animation.

Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49361/Lord_El-Melloi_II_Sei_no_Jikenbo__Rail_Zeppelin_Grace_Note_Special,"['(MY REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Following its 2019 TV debut, Lord El-Melloi II Case Files is back to surprise us with a Christmas special episode / short movie. It\'s not about the festive day itself; it\'s more of a Christmas gift to Type-Moon fans. So if you\'re reading this and are not fond of the Type Moon universe / Nasuverse or do not really care about Waver and the Clock Tower, don\'t bother watching this amazing episode. On the other hand, fellow FZ and KnK fans... have fun!The story unfolds in the Clock Tower and has a strong nostalgic vibe. Not in the same fashion as...the TV series - this time, Waver literally wakes up finding himself in the body he had at the Holy Grail War. There are one or two more reasons (that I don\'t want to spoil) this episode has this vibe but besides that, the mini arc\'s structure is familiar to us; it has a villain who uses Magecraft to achieve a goal, backstories, character interactions at the Clock Tower (Waver, his students, Reines, Gray etc) and of course, Waver solving the case and explaining the ""whydunit"". There is also something that took me aback and made me enjoy the experience even more; but if I mention it, it won\'t be a surprise for you!The aura and atmosphere are sometimes melancholic and sometimes hopeful; the main idea and Waver\'s philosophical aspects radiate a feeling of hope and support that striving for the best is an honourable way of living, even when life gets hard. Like in most Type Moon works, in this episode there are many magicians who have taken the wrong road. Some of those are Kayneth\'s ex-students and Waver\'s former classmates we knew nothing about, so there is lore and information about new characters from the Clock Tower.I don\'t know what to say about the soundtrack - Yuki Kajiura is my favourite composer, and once again she is exceptional here. The ending song sung by ASCA once again is, this time, a different version of the original opening with added lyrics and trust me, it is the icing on the cake. But besides that, there was the perfect music inserted throughout the movie too. The music, combined with the direction, pacing, dialogues and aura I\'ve mentioned before, are enough to make the experience a blast.To conclude, I\'ve witten this review just to express my satisfaction over a short project like that, and ensure you that watching it will be a great experience. That\'s the reason I\'m writing this simple and informal review, because I\'m sure some of you will understand me or want to read a review like this one as well. I want to express my congratulations to Studio TROYCA\'s work, and I hope this was not the last Lord El-Melloi II Case Files anime to air. We want more!Thanks for reading. the TV series - this time, Waver literally wakes up finding himself in the body he had at the Holy Grail War.

Maybe it's because I can relate to Waver, or because a bunch of factors play into the show creating a nice balance of drama and fun. I'm not good at explaining myself when it starts getting emotional, so suffice to say that despite its flaws I liked Lord El-Melloi going into this and was satisfied by this special.If memory serves, the main issues with the main cour of Lord El-Melloi stem...from issues with mystery execution and a step down in animation compared to the rest of the Fate franchise. I've always considered the latter point unfair since it inevitably involves comparisons to Ufotable, but I'm fairly confident in saying that the animation took a step up for this special. The emphasis on close-up facial shots was a bit off-putting, but everything else seemed smooth barring some brief CGI of familiars and a few scenes that felt a tad too fast (e.g. watch Gray open the book at the start of the special; she cracked that thing open in a flash!) I bet TROYCA was thankful that they only had to animate one particularly extravagant scene, because it certainly gave them room for polish everywhere else.Now, regarding the aforementioned former: it's not just the execution of mysteries, but the idea that the series can be confusing to follow in general. Lord El-Melloi takes a deep dive into the mechanics of the Nasuverse, and I can think of at least a few times in the original cour where things just weren't explained well enough to keep the viewer in the loop. This is not the case here: the only thing the viewer really needs to understand is the general idea behind shell projection, and the parallels to virtual reality and 'bringing out one's imagination into the real world' did a good job of explaining the concept without spending too long on it. The mystery itself was also easy to follow, though I have a feeling critics would be frustrated at how telegraphed it was; what is a good mystery if it's too easy to solve? To that I'd respond as a writer that finding a balance for mysteries can be incredibly difficult, and that in this case the main point of the special wasn't the mystery's depth: it was the emotional arc for Camus and Waver. Torn down to its core, this special is a tragedy meant to demonstrate what Waver lost when he entered the Holy Grail War: a legitimate chance at romance. Not only is this just too fitting for Waver (forever a virgin, the poor lad can't catch a break), but it also reminds the viewer that even young Waver had his strong points: he wasn't just 'Waver the Failure' before Iskandar turned him into a man. He was hardworking, firm in his beliefs, and more than willing to stick up for others like him...including Camus. It's easy to see why Camus fell for him, and why her quest for revenge paled in comparison to her desires to revisit the happiest time of her life: the moments where she could see her Waver at his finest. She's understandable in that respect, though as with many things in anime you can clearly tell when liberties are taken to raise stakes. All of this could have been resolved in one meaningful conversation without Camus's whole scheme, but where's the fun in that? This lets us get more Touko, and I consider that an absolute win. There's nothing special about the conclusion of the emotional arc itself since it's exactly what you'd expect: bittersweet, yet optimistic that tomorrow will be one step closer to the ocean. If anything, it's just nice to see Waver continue to confront his past in a (mostly) mature manner, with the occassional goofball slip-up every now and then.As a side note, I don't really know whether to consider Camus a villain. Her motive is relatable, but to take things so far as to get everyone involved in an eternal memory? It's made clear that for some that's a blessing, but for others like Waver it's preventing them from chasing their dreams in the present. Her relationship with Amleth is a bit cruel as well, though that's a given when you leave someone to die only to have them as your prime investor years later; be careful who you call ugly in middle school. Really, Camus seems more sympathetic to me than anything else: never noticed despite trying to confess (albeit in her own weird way), forced to suffer from some really nasty wounds for years, getting everything she could have wanted EXCEPT the one thing she actually wished for...it's like a part of her never grew up, and in a way you see that in Waver too. That isn't an excuse for her actions, but her actions aren't truly based in evil either; moreso regret.Overall, this special appears to at least somewhat address the main issues with the original run of Lord El-Melloi while being entertaining in its own right (even if you haven't watched the main cour). It still doesn't pack the pure emotional punch that would burn it into one's mind, nor does it possess the 'perfect puzzle' that would satisfy any viewer with its approachability and entertaining complexity, but it nails the notes it aims to cover while hosting a majestic soundtrack to boot. All I can hope for now is for Lord El-Melloi to get greenlit for a second season, preferably with the improvements applied in this special. from issues with mystery execution and a step down in animation compared to the rest of the Fate franchise.

The mystery itself was based on why Waver suddenly became younger and aged back to his late teen years which was fairly amusing to watch.Most of the focus in the story after...this revolves around Waver meeting some of his old classmates and specifically one guy who he wasn't on good terms with and a girl who liked him but he never caught onto her feelings. The girl was involved in an incident that wrecked her ability to be a mage and due to that she never really got to be with Waver after the holy grail war, she decided that she wanted to relive those days with Waver and used an advanced spell that would stick all her old classmates and him back in time during their school days. Watching waver unravel the mystery was fairly fun and there was enough information given to the audience so they could solve it, a noticeable improvement over the main series, overall a solid 7 out of 10.The visuals and music were also as good as expected, with a decent enough fight scene even if it ended very quickly, and there is another popular Fate series character who appears that fans of the Fate franchise will appreciate. This short film is worth a watch if you enjoyed the original series and wanted some extra story and more background on Waver and his teen years. this revolves around Waver meeting some of his old classmates and specifically one guy who he wasn't on good terms with and a girl who liked him but he never caught onto her feelings.

Watching waver unravel the mystery was fairly fun and there was enough information given to the audience so they could solve it, a noticeable improvement over the main series, overall a solid 7 out of 10.The visuals and music were also as good as expected, with a decent enough fight scene even if it ended very quickly, and there is another popular Fate series character who appears that fans of the Fate franchise will appreciate. This short film is worth a watch if you enjoyed the original series and wanted some extra story and more background on Waver and his teen years."", ""If you liked the Lord El Melloi series, probably you will want to watch this special, and I think is very worth watching. The story shows what would happen if Waver Velvet were to be that 19 year old from the past again. He and his Servant Gray try to discover who it was that made him what he was before, and for what purpose. I really liked this special because, it showed more of Waver's life in the Clock Tower as a student and his beginnings as a mage. The art looks a little bit better than before but the animation is the same....And the soundtracks from Yuki Kajiura are goated as always.Overall, I think this was a pretty good special to wrap up the year 2021. If you are a Fate fan and want to see more of Lord El Melloi then I strongly recommend it.

The explaination of the primary magic used in this special was lackluster at best, making me confused on what was going on, especially with the way that it twists what kind of magic...projection magic is. And as someone who has fallen way to deep into the fate rabbit hole, many of the uses of magic seem completely unfeasable in the magnitude of their power. The story is also extremely rushed, as many of the characters are only fleshed out from small snipbits of their lives which stops one from truly getting to know the character other than the most basic info about them. Like there is only enough information given to have a prelimilary understanding of  the motives of many of the characters, but thats all that they have. The anime expects its veiwers to piece together what kind of person each character is, but not enough to make the characters actually seem human. Plus there is kind of a reliance of tropes in the story, as many of the main plot points in it are as generic as they can be. but hey tropes are tropes so i can let it slide a bit.overall, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note - Tokubetsu-hen could have been a much better story if it had a longer run time in order to fully flesh out many of the characters, but being limited to being a special stopped the story from ever expanding its roots and becoming something other than a pretty basic story. projection magic is.

I really enjoyed the main season but this was just not it.The story just felt rushed and roughly put together. I felt like the cases in the main show, even some of the ones lasting just one episode, flowed better than this one. Here, details were skipped explaining why certain aspects were happening or who some people were. And the “reasoning” of the “antagonist” was just overly exaggerated and not properly dealt with at the end.Apparently, one would better understand the end if you’ve watched some other Nasuverse shows.Overall, very disappointed. At least the art...was good. was good.']"

Whilst investigating, he gets into a fight with Ran because of her superstitions and they stop talking to each other for a week.Of course, Shinichi ends up solving the case. His parents are also featured which I enjoyed very much. I simply love the...Kudo family, they are so funny and do not appear enough in my opinion.

This anime fly under my radar completely at first, but then i saw its score and need to check it out, and it went over my expectation. Everything went well going for it, and masterfully done all the way.*RECOMMEND FOR*: Directing, Character, and World buildingHere's the review:First of all, don't mind the title/gimmick much. The title/gimmick while is at play at first, it dim down a lot through the series. However, it still recall back to it masterfully...done by still making her previous lifes matters. Not just that, but they made every important character from the lifes impactful in the current life as well. The story itself also isn't bad. While overall story is pretty normal for a villainess & fantasy medieval style anime, it's done with very good integrity, and the world building went very well supporting the story and character dynamics. The politics right now is not that intense, so that might not be what you want to look forward too in this show.[Story 9/10, World building 9.5/10]The Character here is one of the reason that make this anime very good. Every character (that have a name) feels alive and have a role in it. The way they interact is very natural and is not force at all. Everyone has their own deep personality. Especially with the 2 MC, both of them have very good and interesting dynamic going on, and is very likeable overall.[Character 10/10]The Directing is the HIGHLIGHT of this anime. The animation is very good even when compare to all anime standards. No scene is lacking in term of animation, and the way they animate and art style is very good and flow with the amotion in the show. The sound directing is also as good. The pacing also is very nominal. The scale where they pace is very good for the drama and romance. With around 2-3 main event per episode. Nothing I could review on much as it's perfect for a drama, romance, emotional, fantasy show.[Production, Directing, Pacing 10/10]Overall, everything about this show is perfect.

If you’re like me and a big otome fan, you’ll really enjoy this one as it excels at all the usual story beats, while managing to be a breath of fresh air for the genre too. Unequivocally one of the best shows of Winter 2024.So by now we’ve had the concept of an evil villainess getting another shot at life done multiple times to varying degrees of success. What makes 7th loop cool is that as the...name suggests, the MC has lived thru  7 iterations of her life, which have all ends in tragedy. She’s able to draw upon the knowledge and skills of each of her previous lives and use them in the current one to try and prevent war. I really enjoyed seeing the depth of knowledge that Rishe has. It doesn’t feel forced or contrived like most fantasy MCs, she’s able to work through situations because she’s literally lived 6 other lives which have equipped her with the necessary skills.Rishe as a character is so well written. She really is the archetype I think more authors need to follow when writing women. She refuses to be put in a box and comply with anyone’s wishes but her own, she is determined to live life on her terms and is such a fierce soul. So often in these stories, women are swooning over guys or so caught up in stupid stuff that their own character gets lost. Not here. Rishe may have a prince as a fiance, but she’s not subservient to him or a typical maiden in love. She maintains her own interests, ambitions and identity.Speaking of that fiancée, the romance between Rishe and Arnold is of course one of my favourite things about the story. The idea of this strong and independent woman healing a broken young man and teaching him the error of his ways is awesome to me and I love how it was pulled off. While their relationship starts as one of political convenience, it morphs into something more authentic over time. But Arnold and Rishe are very much their own people with their own personalities. They are powerful individuals who refuse to bend to anyone, including the people they love and I found that to be a lot more realistic than your usual Shoujosei romance tropes where a character falls in love, now their whole personality is dependent on someone. The best relationships are those with two people who are complete on their own, but better together. That’s how I felt about Rishe and Arnold.Plot wise, I think this first season is really good. It’s a mix of political drama, the budding relationship between Rishe and Arnold and Rishe’s interactions with characters from her previous lives. It’s really cool seeing how some of the characters have changed since in this loop she hasn’t met them, and how some are still the exact same. There’s also an interesting plot line with Arnold’s motivations and his future ambitions that I had a lot of fun with. It’s certainly more substantive than your run of the mill villainess story. There’s no demon lord or multiple love interests in this one. It feels a lot more authentic and down to earth, and the story is better for it.Art wise, gorgeous show. Rishe and the other characters are all beautiful. As someone who owns the LN, I think the studio captured the beauty of the art very well. The animation isn’t crazy, but there’s some really nice moments like the dance scene from earlier in the season.  Just a solid production.For me, I’d say it’s 7th Loop, Raeliana and Lastame as the best of this genre. All 3 have similarities with powerful women who refuse to be swayed by anyone, mature storylines that feel real, plots that don’t revolve purely around romance and nice supporting characters. I think that’s the secret to success with these stories and 7th loop certainly excels at it.7th loop gets 9 loops out of 10. name suggests, the MC has lived thru  7 iterations of her life, which have all ends in tragedy.

So, in this new life she decides to take it easy. However, she soon finds herself with the ability to stop a future war that was the reason for her death in the lives prior. She would be able to do this by marrying a prince and ""manipulating"" him in a way that would prevent the war. The romance develops and the political aspects...of the show give it a nice different flavor. But there are many problems with this show.- Rishe, the mc, is extremely perfect in every way imaginable, which makes her boring halfway through the show. The love interest is not bad, still could be more charismatic instead the usual ""i hate everyone but you"" kind of character but whatever;- The romance develops quickly but not deeply at all, it´s just not convincing and there isn´t any progression regarding it from maybe episode 6 and on. It actually regresses.- Rishe is the only woman in the anime that does something, all the other female characters exist for her to save, fix or to make her look even more perfect. Most male characters have an important job and/or are experts in a subject and, of course, they are all fascinated with Rishe. In fact, all characters are just in awe of her. The same happens with plot lines that are there to show more of her qualities. Ultimately these side plots get resolved by Rishe in no time and barely affect the main story.- When it comes to animation quality and such, it is a pretty show, there isn´t really anything new (but i also dont feel there was a need for that) it has pretty characters, scenery and animation. The music doesn´t stand out but it fits the show.In conclusion: the show isn´t bad, it just feels generic and becomes boring a litle after the halfway point of the show give it a nice different flavor.

What intrigues me the most is that she has accumulated experiences from six lives, even though each of the last five lives lasted only for 5 years. However, they were five lives with entirely different purposes and unique experiences.It seems that in none of her lives did she seek or have romantic interests, but in this one, it seems that romance will find her, even if it\'s at the hands of...her tormentor from past lives. Rishe is a spectacle, exuding charisma wherever she goes. I can\'t help but mention that the ""tension"" between her and Arnold is very well-built; it\'s as if there is truly a lot of chemistry emanating there. The animation so far has been incredible, worthy of the light novel. I love this combination of romance with a medieval touch and mystery.

She is incredibly smart, and therefore can outsmart literally anyone in the show, even those that are supposed to pose a challenge to her. On the one hand, she acts independently and  goes out there and does her own things, but on the other hand, the moment Arnold (the male MC) is involved, she melts into a blushing mess.I haven\'t found the romance to be particularly good. I don\'t really think there\'s much chemistry between the two leads. Rishe claims he wants...to learn more about Arnold but he feels like a hollow shell of a character being a typical love interest in this genre.Arnold\'s ""cruelty"" is never truly shown, and he doesn\'t really do much besides making Rishe blush.In addition to that, the story isn\'t very interesting either. Drama comes and goes very quickly, and each conflict is obviously solved with Rishe\'s ""big brain tactics"". No one else matters, only her showing off her intelect. The problem is that it isn\'t very endearing or creative.The plot of the show also focuses on Rishe\'s ""past lives"" as this is her 7th life, but none of the past lives has been too... interesting? She learnt a few things here and there which made her great at everything, but nothing really flashy. For example, of her past lives was her being a... maid. So she learnt how to pick locks.The anime also doesn\'t let any big conflict or drama linger, which leaves every single conflict to start->Rishe uses her knowledge to solve it->bad character becomes good->More Rishe blushing by Arnold->Another conflict starts...Just a side note, I also haven\'t found anything of note about the artistic side of the show: music, art, animation... Nothing really stood out.In conclusion, I don\'t think it\'s a very interesting anime.

Usually I would rate a show like this at a 6 or 7. Why give it a 4 then?The reason is simple- The MC is really unlikable. It would be perfectly fine if she were a side character, but she is the actual driving force behind the plot.Her personality traits are ""quirky"" ""smart"" ""relatable"" ""unique"" - that\'s it. To put this into perspective I will compare her to some other otome protagonists:-  Catarina Claes is dumb in a ""cute and oblivious"" way. Yumiella Dolkness is dumb in a ""cool and oblivious"" way....Rae Taylor is dumb in a ""lesbian"" way. Pink Bimbo is dumb.To a certain extent all main characters in this genre are responsible for carrying their respective stories on their backs. Making a likable MC, therefore, is crucial. What is likable changes entirely from person to person, so these characters always have to walk a fine line.princess Knight Doctor Apothecary Bimbo quirks all over that line.This show covers tropes like they are grandma\'s christmas grocery list.Also, I won\'t lie. Duke of the north\'s deadpan reactions to mc\'s ""quirkiness"" are absolutely hilarious at times, but I\'m not laughing with the show, I\'m laughing at it. Who will buy that this guy is actually in love?Merchant Scientist agricultural Bimbo would be bad enough on her own, but every other character is straight out of the otome printing press. Thinking ""Oh, I know this guy"" after seeing someone for the very first time is not good in any context.I feel the need to mention this as well - on any show that isn\'t jujutsu kaisen, there\'s someone always calling the animation ""powerpoint slides"".

I loved the similarity & the difference.having said all the good pointers, I do believe that S1 with 12 episodes wasn\'t enough to convey even half the story. it felt like pilot season. I don\'t know whether we\'ll get the full ending for this anime in multiple seasons or it\'ll get discarded. either way 7th loop is a high-potential anime that isn\'t the run-of-the-mill otome that had started this (no longer a sub) genre. heck, this isn\'t even isekai lol it\'s pure shojou fantasy :\') the OP took some getting used to but I grew to like it too- Rishe & Arnold reminds me a lot of Raeliana & Noah & that\'s probably because both have such similar MC characters with similar end goals however, the anime successfully sticks out to be different both in terms of characterization & personality.

Gone are the days of the Otome Game feature (though still prevalent in shows like this season\'s Akuyaku Reijou Level 99 a.k.a Villainess Level 99) of Spring 2020\'s HameFura, and in comes pure fantasy element shows like novelist Touko Amekawa\'s Loop 7-kaime no Akuyaku Reijou wa,...Moto Tekikoku de Jiyuu Kimama na Hanayome Seikatsu wo Mankitsu suru a.k.a 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!, exploring the pure fantasy side of things when characters do actually get stuck in a time loop (which has the Otome Game-ish shtick, but not branded as such). And I don\'t know about you, but stories like these are what the Isekai trend should\'ve bucked at its peak of 10 years ago with its many fictional stories, yet only experienced now because the safety net has been safely cut with opportunities for the creation of something new, which this show has managed to carve its own spot in the process by being yet another great entry into the villainess sub-genre.A marriage engagement annulled, and various jobs taken at multiple loops of the same time period, only to be wind down by an early death from the hands of the same person, this is the life of villainess Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. From annullment to death takes one try at life within the span of 5 years, and no one other girl has experienced such a harsh tragedy in the history of the villainess shtick. Not before you meet Rishe, with her lives toyed like credits popped into an arcade machine for instantaneous revival to correct the course of her mission. But each and every time, be it the jobs she took or the locations she\'s at, the karma of death will always somehow reach her, unable to avoid the loops of catastrophe against her willful enemy: Arnold Hein. The Crown Prince of the Galkhein Kingdom, who always is the source of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse - the personifications of Death (Thanatos), Famine (Limos), War (Ares), and Conquest or Glory (Zelus). Now into her 7th loop, Rishe erases (but remembers) all of her past mistakes, and decides to go forward with the marriage engagement as a way to ""offload"" all of her troubles on him as both a noble\'s daughter and a fiancée, to goof around and be relieved of all her duties. Little does she know that this 7th Time Loop has surprises awaiting upon her: the governance of the Galkhein Kingdom alongside Arnold, serving its people, and most important of all: figuring out the reason why Arnold has grown cold throughout the same periods of time.First of all, Rishe is such an enigma of a character. One who deems herself righteous by doing good and avoiding the ""death flags"" to her impending doom, she\'s a fierce fighter who knows what she wants to accomplish her objectives and goals to reach to the significant moment of her character strat. A never-give-up attitude is what honours her character the most, even as a master-and-servant relationship between herself and said Crown Prince ensures that she will be surveyed like a watchdog. Sure, there\'s the occasional trope of the romantic sparks between both villainess and said Crown Prince, but to find that Arnold is quite the gentleman who\'ll protect his beloved, not to mention his very own capable Galkhein Kingdom, even if at the cost of his misconduct. Arnold is a man of his word, held to the high standard and promise that he\'ll see things through, along with his stern but kind personality that maketh the man himself to fall in love with Rishe\'s beauty, knight prowess and other skills, which makes her an interesting person to toy with.In terms of the supporting characters, there really isn\'t a whole ton, just those relevant enough for Rishe to ensure that her 7th loop does not get disrupted like her previous ones. Take Arnold\'s younger brother for instance: Theodore Auguste Hein may look like a little brat of a kid prince, but the relationship between the two is so tumultuous and broken that Arnold would just not listen to his younger brother\'s requests, no matter what his views are that could give a second thought to the circumstances at hand. Of course, with Rishe being involved in the sibling rivalry and trying to understand their differing opinions and soothe over for their reconciliation, as much as jealousy will overpower emotions and actions that kill, not because of regret, but of a suffocated success into ascending the throne. Overall, probably not the best cast of characters I will remember the most, but just enough to make both the main characters of Rishe and Arnold stand out for their capabilities, and that alone makes the entire show worth its milk run.Speaking of the milk run, I\'m legitimately surprised to see that the show\'s studio collaboration of Studio Kai and Hornets have made the show look far artistic than what I was expected to believe of the PV before it started its broadcast. Director Kazuya Iwata and his staff team did a great job on the show\'s overall production, and by it looking very much artistically detailed to the T, I thought I was seeing an overcommitment in quality, but thankfully it wasn\'t the case.The music, however, I find it to be fairly decent and not a standout as much as the anime does. Shun\'ichi Toki\'s OP ""Another Birthday"" is a rather nice song, and The Binary\'s ED...well, it\'s just stereotypical girl-group songs for days. Regardless, a nice feature that adds up to the display of the series in general.The sub-Isekai villainess genre has been forthcoming like salt and pepper as condiments to the AniManga platter, and Loop 7-kaime a.k.a 7th Time Loop is a nice diversion from the rest of its contemporaries. With a rather strong and empathetic villainess to go along with her rather unkempt fiancée, this show is a beauty for the eyes, while not being shy about its drama that\'s a never-ending causal effect at achieving the best possible outcome.Maybe we should start loving the villainess even more right now, they\'re hot property.

Similar to other isekai’s such as ReZero the main character Rishe is forced to relive her life and the consequences of her actions after each death in a time loop of reincarnation.What I find so compelling about this show is that first of all, it’s played by a female protagonist who has all the right characteristics of a strong independent female with desires and goals of her own that also play to her personality and...feelings towards society. As the story progresses not only can you tell Rishe is smart and clever    with her words but the story continues to progress and create more mystery and analysis waiting to be solved in order to understand the characters emotion and premise. Instead of offering fan service and being like a regular shoujo anime, Rishe as the main character continues to offer delightful surprises with her strategy in the main story that makes her feel more human than a perfect princess.

After six lives, she is represented as having good judgement and competence in a variety of technical skills. Moreover, the show puts these skills into action and interweaves them within the narrative. Thankfully, in doing so, it avoids the pitfall of saying she’s smart or skilled without living up to those qualities.I find the romance compelling. It does revolve around a classic shoujo trope of a powerful, mysterious, and attractive man and the uncertainty of his character, but...it has been satisfying.The animation has been surprisingly great as well. A scene in Episode 3 is particularly noteworthy, both in animation and its narrative flair. There are a wide variety of backgrounds, so it doesn’t come across as only taking place in a few areas and there has been quite a bit of subtlety with facial expressions and body language.As of now, the demographic I can imagine not enjoying this show are those who are (1) averse to the setting, (2) political intrigue plot beats, and a (3) general slice of life vibe. It is set in a pseudo-Victorian Europe fantasy world filled with nobility, aristocratic houses, slums, big dresses, ballrooms, and a walled town. Regarding (2) The central plot does seem to revolve around the interpersonal dynamics between the main male character and his family and various influential players within this universe. Finally, in between those plot beats are slower paced segments with washing clothes, picking herbs, reading books, inner dialogue, and planning.I am new to the villainess genre, so I have no context for a comparable anime.

I usuallly hate the term 'flawed character' as its often used to describe irredeemable abominations (looking at you, akito), but there are several characters that become so much more human, interesting and relatable with a few flaws.  One moment she is whoopin ass, solving problems, clearly stating her boundaries, and fortifying her...resolve to live this life through, to finally overcome the fate the she succumbed to in all of her 6 previous lives; and the next moment, she is blushing over Arnold Hunk's cliche lines like a middle schooler.

Not much to say, a shallow, perfect, mysterious powerhouse of a character. It's nearly impossible to believe Mr. One bad day away from committing genocide actually loves Rishe, and doesn't view her as a source of entertainment.

If you aren\'t, perhaps you should read this review further and see what things you should keep in mind before deciding whether you should watch it or not.""Villainess"" in the title:Let\'s get this out of the way.The word ""villainess"" was so far only relevant...at the beginning of the story. Not an anime classic ""villainess"" definition, as in an antagonist of an original story, but just as in a ""vile woman"".Society of that period would paint you as a horrible person if your engagement is broken thinking you must have done something awful for that to happen. That\'s it.Rishe isn\'t a part of some ""novel"" or ""game"" or something else for her to actually be a villainess in that context. At least the current light novel story doesn\'t hint at anything like that happening or being the case.Pace:You might already know that light novel adaptations tend to be either detailed and slow-paced or way too fast-paced and that rarely you can find one that does everything right. I would say this adaptation is a weird mix of both. A lot of things were skipped but the source material in itself is very slow so:- it\'s fast paced when compared to the novel,- I believe it\'s slow paced when observed standalone.Source material covered:I should preface this by saying that this anime adapts only first 2 volumes of the story, which is still ongoing, and currently has 6 volumes. It is also a relatively new story with the first chapter of the web novel published in 2020. First 2 volumes are merely the setting for this story!I might sound a little bit negative in this review but I want to cover the flaws for people that are searching for more than a time-loop romance anime.The anime itself:If you are a fun of: otome isekai genre, a strong female lead, political drama and classical otome isekai stereotypes you don\'t even have to read further, this is a show for you. I guess I should mention that this isn\'t an \'isekai\' anime per se, but a shoujo anime with a time loop as its plot device. But! A small note regarding said stereotypes: this anime has an interesting tendency to use classic stereotypes from this genre and turn them upside down.It edges out other similar anime for a simple reason of having an above average budget for this type of show. If you are a fan of them, you already know how your usual adaptation for an otome isekai goes: faceless people in the background, half of the time you are watching a slide show, CGI for every single object that moves (horses are unfortunately objects in this case), disfigured bodies of characters and utterly lame dancing and fighting scenes if any. This anime is significantly above this.When it comes to the adaptation\'s visual quality, 7th time loop does absolute justice to its source material. Would you believe me when I say that this anime had the best dancing scene of this season and one of the better fighting scenes with actual choreography? You will definitely enjoy watching this anime if you are tired of mediocrity that is usually present in otome isekai.The animation quality is great, OP and ED are unique but nothing special, the soundtrack wasn\'t too memorable in my opinion but pleasant.Now, what if you don\'t like otome isekai and watching the same thing over and over again but with different characters? Is there anything new? The answer is yes and no (will be explained further).Characters:The main thing that you need to like to like this anime is the protagonist, Rishe. After all, the whole plot revolves around her experiencing a time loop 6 times, with the current one being her 7th. Rishe wasn\'t a part of any kind of conspiracy or murder plot, she just learned to live however she pleases and use her time learning new skills and meeting and helping new people. In this aspect she is a truly inspiring protagonist that is both capable, independent, curious, strong willed and good-hearted. My only regret is that this anime completely removed almost all of the funny scenes and her sense of humor from this adaptation, as well as some of her weaknesses, making her feel flat when compared to her novel counterpart.Another thing that doesn\'t go in this anime\'s favor is the lack of the more detailed presentation of this story\'s mystery plot in the show-don\'t-tell fashion from the novel. Due to the a noticeable amount of skipped content some conclusions that the characters come to feel forced. This naturally affects Rishe the most, since she is the main ""detective"" of this show with her husband-to-be being ""the mysterious case"".Arnold is the character that also suffered because of the (at moments) very fast pace in my opinion. This is also a little bit due to his voice actor giving an unemotional performance in scenes that call for opposite (in the novel it would be mentioned that his voice is uneven or hesitant in these scenes, we got none of that). Since Arnold is a bit of an emotionally constipated character anyways, this ruins the rare moments that should show his true personality.At it\'s core, this story is a slow burn romance that doesn\'t want to rush its characters in any way. At the beginning the story will revolve more around slice of life, small mysteries and politics more than romance. If you cut a sizable portion of the conversation from the few romantic and character defining scenes and on top of that make them fast paced, you can imagine what you are left with. This is why Arnold unfortunately isn\'t portrayed as well as his novel counterpart but not all is lost.(More about the plot and Arnold):I mentioned how this story has an interesting tendency to use classic stereotypes from this genre and turn them upside down. In the same way Arnold is your usual cruel crown prince that is cold, kills people and doesn\'t bat an eye, does everything perfectly and is feared for his skills on the battlefield. But is that actually the truth? This isn\'t your cringe and usual ""the girl melts a psychopath\'s heart story"". It\'s highly speculated he is spreading his own bad rumors and acting like a villain on purpose and with a grand plan in mind, but for what reason? This is the main mystery of the novel that this anime is gently trying to introduce to you. For this reason it feels slow and can completely be missed if you only watch the first few episodes and quit. This is also why Arnold may seem a super flat character when in reality is the deepest one.This is the reason why I said this anime is both fast and slow. For a novel reader like me, who knows how detailed the source material is, this anime is very fast paced and hasn\'t done too great of a job in shortening the original story in the right way.But for an anime-only watcher I can bet this anime feels slow. This is a comedy, slice of life anime with an occasional drama that usually isn\'t even taken that seriously (it\'s one of the points I really like though) but all of that perhaps makes the viewer confused and wondering is there any point in this anime. It takes time to get to where it wants to be and, unfortunately, that is the second season if it ever gets one. These 12 episodes only cover the first 2 volumes which are only the setting for the story.Adaptation from the novel:I already mentioned this everywhere through out the review but this adaptation is pretty solid in my opinion even though it has its own share of problems. Some very important plot details were omitted that were even referenced later in the anime. Just how did the characters come to that conclusion if you didn\'t show it on screen? Others were completely ignored, as if they don\'t plan to make a second season (this is an exaggeration on my part; while it wouldn\'t be chronological, these plot points can be added anywhere and it would still work). While all of this is infuriating for a novel reader, I believe it won\'t hinder your experience if you are an anime-only viewer.--------------------------TLDR:If you like otome isekai:Recommended! You will enjoy this and want more. This is a very interesting mix of the good old and new in a comedy, slice of life story that has an amazing potential to become very serious and emotional story in the long run. I can say that so far in the novel, while the plot still didn\'t get to its peak, the groundwork is being laid for exactly this. It\'s one of my favorite novels at the moment and I am looking forward to uncovering all the secrets and seeing how Rishe will handle her beloved husband and, at the same time, her greatest opponent. The story is set in such a way that Rishe needs to use the amazing skills she learned in her previous lives and still meets and helps people from her previous loops, making this seem like a ""true route"" type of experience from visual novels.If you aren\'t a fan of otome isekai:Proceed with caution but I still recommend it. This really is a promising story, but a very small amount of it was covered. If you are very analytical, some things will be simple and some will be illogical because of the omitted material. There will be asspulls since the anime didn\'t do a great job at show-don\'t-tell like the novel did. Still, if you like capable and talented characters and their clashes in: politics, mind games, romance and perhaps even war in the future, give this anime a shot and watch it until the end before delivering judgment. It is definitely better than the others that currently exist in this genre (not counting Bakarina since that is a total gag story).Now this is the part where I have to make you roll your eyes at the obligatory ""novel is better"" statements but please! If you liked this story, consider reading the novel. If you are someone who prefers novels, consider reading the novel first and then watching the anime. After all, there is currently more story covered in the novel so you will be able to get to the parts where Rishe and Arnold finally get to know each other better and start getting more honest with each other and those parts beat the whole story covered in this anime by a mile.This isn\'t a perfect anime, so naturally not a 10, but I would argue it could have been an easy 8 if it had more episodes. So, for me, it\'s a solid 7 and can\'t even be considered lower when you have in mind the quality it shows when compared to the other similar anime from this genre.At any case, consider this anime a possible long term investment in case there ends up being more seasons or if you end up picking up the source material. at the beginning of the story. Not an anime classic ""villainess"" definition, as in an antagonist of an original story, but just as in a ""vile woman"".Society of that period would paint you as a horrible person if your engagement is broken thinking you must have done something awful for that to happen. That\'s it.Rishe isn\'t a part of some ""novel"" or ""game"" or something else for her to actually be a villainess in that context. At least the current light novel story doesn\'t hint at anything like that happening or being the case.Pace:You might already know that light novel adaptations tend to be either detailed and slow-paced or way too fast-paced and that rarely you can find one that does everything right. I would say this adaptation is a weird mix of both. A lot of things were skipped but the source material in itself is very slow so:- it\'s fast paced when compared to the novel,- I believe it\'s slow paced when observed standalone.Source material covered:I should preface this by saying that this anime adapts only first 2 volumes of the story, which is still ongoing, and currently has 6 volumes. It is also a relatively new story with the first chapter of the web novel published in 2020. First 2 volumes are merely the setting for this story!I might sound a little bit negative in this review but I want to cover the flaws for people that are searching for more than a time-loop romance anime.The anime itself:If you are a fun of: otome isekai genre, a strong female lead, political drama and classical otome isekai stereotypes you don\'t even have to read further, this is a show for you. I guess I should mention that this isn\'t an \'isekai\' anime per se, but a shoujo anime with a time loop as its plot device. But! A small note regarding said stereotypes: this anime has an interesting tendency to use classic stereotypes from this genre and turn them upside down.It edges out other similar anime for a simple reason of having an above average budget for this type of show. If you are a fan of them, you already know how your usual adaptation for an otome isekai goes: faceless people in the background, half of the time you are watching a slide show, CGI for every single object that moves (horses are unfortunately objects in this case), disfigured bodies of characters and utterly lame dancing and fighting scenes if any. This anime is significantly above this.When it comes to the adaptation\'s visual quality, 7th time loop does absolute justice to its source material. Would you believe me when I say that this anime had the best dancing scene of this season and one of the better fighting scenes with actual choreography? You will definitely enjoy watching this anime if you are tired of mediocrity that is usually present in otome isekai.The animation quality is great, OP and ED are unique but nothing special, the soundtrack wasn\'t too memorable in my opinion but pleasant.Now, what if you don\'t like otome isekai and watching the same thing over and over again but with different characters? Is there anything new? The answer is yes and no (will be explained further).Characters:The main thing that you need to like to like this anime is the protagonist, Rishe. After all, the whole plot revolves around her experiencing a time loop 6 times, with the current one being her 7th. Rishe wasn\'t a part of any kind of conspiracy or murder plot, she just learned to live however she pleases and use her time learning new skills and meeting and helping new people. In this aspect she is a truly inspiring protagonist that is both capable, independent, curious, strong willed and good-hearted. My only regret is that this anime completely removed almost all of the funny scenes and her sense of humor from this adaptation, as well as some of her weaknesses, making her feel flat when compared to her novel counterpart.Another thing that doesn\'t go in this anime\'s favor is the lack of the more detailed presentation of this story\'s mystery plot in the show-don\'t-tell fashion from the novel. Due to the a noticeable amount of skipped content some conclusions that the characters come to feel forced. This naturally affects Rishe the most, since she is the main ""detective"" of this show with her husband-to-be being ""the mysterious case"".Arnold is the character that also suffered because of the (at moments) very fast pace in my opinion. This is also a little bit due to his voice actor giving an unemotional performance in scenes that call for opposite (in the novel it would be mentioned that his voice is uneven or hesitant in these scenes, we got none of that). Since Arnold is a bit of an emotionally constipated character anyways, this ruins the rare moments that should show his true personality.At it\'s core, this story is a slow burn romance that doesn\'t want to rush its characters in any way. At the beginning the story will revolve more around slice of life, small mysteries and politics more than romance. If you cut a sizable portion of the conversation from the few romantic and character defining scenes and on top of that make them fast paced, you can imagine what you are left with. This is why Arnold unfortunately isn\'t portrayed as well as his novel counterpart but not all is lost.(More about the plot and Arnold):I mentioned how this story has an interesting tendency to use classic stereotypes from this genre and turn them upside down. In the same way Arnold is your usual cruel crown prince that is cold, kills people and doesn\'t bat an eye, does everything perfectly and is feared for his skills on the battlefield. But is that actually the truth? This isn\'t your cringe and usual ""the girl melts a psychopath\'s heart story"". It\'s highly speculated he is spreading his own bad rumors and acting like a villain on purpose and with a grand plan in mind, but for what reason? This is the main mystery of the novel that this anime is gently trying to introduce to you. For this reason it feels slow and can completely be missed if you only watch the first few episodes and quit. This is also why Arnold may seem a super flat character when in reality is the deepest one.This is the reason why I said this anime is both fast and slow. For a novel reader like me, who knows how detailed the source material is, this anime is very fast paced and hasn\'t done too great of a job in shortening the original story in the right way.But for an anime-only watcher I can bet this anime feels slow. This is a comedy, slice of life anime with an occasional drama that usually isn\'t even taken that seriously (it\'s one of the points I really like though) but all of that perhaps makes the viewer confused and wondering is there any point in this anime. It takes time to get to where it wants to be and, unfortunately, that is the second season if it ever gets one. These 12 episodes only cover the first 2 volumes which are only the setting for the story.Adaptation from the novel:I already mentioned this everywhere through out the review but this adaptation is pretty solid in my opinion even though it has its own share of problems. Some very important plot details were omitted that were even referenced later in the anime. Just how did the characters come to that conclusion if you didn\'t show it on screen? Others were completely ignored, as if they don\'t plan to make a second season (this is an exaggeration on my part; while it wouldn\'t be chronological, these plot points can be added anywhere and it would still work). While all of this is infuriating for a novel reader, I believe it won\'t hinder your experience if you are an anime-only viewer.--------------------------TLDR:If you like otome isekai:Recommended! You will enjoy this and want more. This is a very interesting mix of the good old and new in a comedy, slice of life story that has an amazing potential to become very serious and emotional story in the long run. I can say that so far in the novel, while the plot still didn\'t get to its peak, the groundwork is being laid for exactly this. It\'s one of my favorite novels at the moment and I am looking forward to uncovering all the secrets and seeing how Rishe will handle her beloved husband and, at the same time, her greatest opponent. The story is set in such a way that Rishe needs to use the amazing skills she learned in her previous lives and still meets and helps people from her previous loops, making this seem like a ""true route"" type of experience from visual novels.If you aren\'t a fan of otome isekai:Proceed with caution but I still recommend it. This really is a promising story, but a very small amount of it was covered. If you are very analytical, some things will be simple and some will be illogical because of the omitted material. There will be asspulls since the anime didn\'t do a great job at show-don\'t-tell like the novel did. Still, if you like capable and talented characters and their clashes in: politics, mind games, romance and perhaps even war in the future, give this anime a shot and watch it until the end before delivering judgment. It is definitely better than the others that currently exist in this genre (not counting Bakarina since that is a total gag story).Now this is the part where I have to make you roll your eyes at the obligatory ""novel is better"" statements but please! If you liked this story, consider reading the novel. If you are someone who prefers novels, consider reading the novel first and then watching the anime. After all, there is currently more story covered in the novel so you will be able to get to the parts where Rishe and Arnold finally get to know each other better and start getting more honest with each other and those parts beat the whole story covered in this anime by a mile.This isn\'t a perfect anime, so naturally not a 10, but I would argue it could have been an easy 8 if it had more episodes. So, for me, it\'s a solid 7 and can\'t even be considered lower when you have in mind the quality it shows when compared to the other similar anime from this genre.At any case, consider this anime a possible long term investment in case there ends up being more seasons or if you end up picking up the source material.', 'This is closest to a masterpiece than any other fantasy-romance anime I’ve watched in a long time. As someone who is currently reading the LN (not much further yet but eager to learn everything about this story) it’s among the best adaptations I’ve seen in a while.Story 9.5/10There’s so much to unwrap about this story that I could probably write a novel about it (but nobody wants to read that, especially given the source material already is a well-written LN, so I’ll try my best to summarize it). Just the concept of having a protagonist who is stuck in a time loop and...keeps re-living her life but with all the knowledge she has gathered is so clever. Personally I’m not a fan of politics being involved too much in a story, then again this one actually needs it to progress and it’s also not overused unlike with other series where the focus shifts too much on the politics. Here it’s the perfect balance. The world-building is far from being perfect but in my opinion it works. There are still open ends but it’s also due to the fact there is a lot of source material. Considering this the pace of the anime is good and even with the LN I think they are written in a way to not open too many lose ends for a build-up but never really living up to it. It does make you curious for more so for everyone who wants to know more about the story I would also recommend reading the LN. The way they adapted it in the anime is very close to the original. There are some minor changes but nothing that sticks out as ruining or watering down the story (at least not in my opinion). However, praising it this high, it has to be said that I feel like this story is mostly for people who enjoy a story that’s woven together in a way it might only make sense at one point. I had the feeling right from the start when I started to read it. So I feel like if you come across someone saying it’s boring it probably is if you don’t have a full picture (or lack the patience to wait for it). Personally I love developing theories in my head. So this kind of story is perfect for me. Not to forget a very different yet beautiful love story which has some tragic in it too (just by the fact how it starts out). It’s kind of a fantasy fairy-tale mostly directed to women but I see nothing wrong with that. There are some minor issues I have but they are not really in the story itself (which yet has to fully unfold).Characters 8/10Nowadays there is this tendency of writing characters (it’s a little frustrating) that are “copy and paste” of each other. But somehow I feel like even though this story might appear to have that sort of formula as well it’s not exactly the same. I’m someone who absolutely dislikes it when writers put their own characters on a pedestal and force their audience to like and even praise them the same way. There is nothing relatable about that. However, this anime did a perfect job in removing the one thing (or at least covering it much better compared to the LN) that slightly bothers me in the source material: that Rishe appearing just a little too OP and superior, being close to a Mary-Sue. Honestly, she might not be far off from being one. But it’s the only work of fiction for me that kind of justifies a main character like her. How so? Because considering she has lived the same life 6 times prior to this and is now on her 7th run, that she simply makes use of all the knowledge she acquired along the way, makes a lot of sense. More than if she would lack in many areas ad would still be where she started out after the first time loop or even before that. Especially since she used every single one of her lives to learn something new and taking a different path, which now comes into play perfectly. Now that she becomes the finance of prince Arnold. This outcome is only logical and actually a clever way to handle it (although we could argue about the amount of stuff she does on her own which could be accomplished by others). Of course there were moments I had to roll my eyes because she randomly knew something or was one step ahead of someone who even had a profession in this field… But they never take it too far and there are also moments when she struggles in a way or doesn’t know what to do. And we have to remember she is the only one aware of what is going on or will in the future (because she is stuck in a time loop). So from her perspective she has to shoulder a lot. And while she possesses many skills it’s her determination that makes her stand out from all the other overpowered strong female characters who often don’t have a motivation or it’s just presented in a manner that makes it unbelievable or bland. Rishe’s goal is to continue living while preventing a lot of bad stuff from happening. She makes allies, uses her knowledge to the best way possible and uses common sense. I don’t think it’s far from reality… Yes, she is still among the MCs who are a little too OP but in her case I don’t mind as much (at least most of the time). Still that fact prevents her from being among my favorite characters of all time but she is definitely better than most of the other MCs in this category (because in her case it’s justified).The second main character Prince Arnold is a little more tricky. Because at first glance he also seems to be the copy-paste male protagonist, cold but handsome prince (until he falls for the girl). When I was younger there wouldn’t have been more to convince me of his character…. But what really stands out about him is the fact that in the back of my mind there’s always this lingering feeling that there is so so much more to his character than we see and know. That’s what makes him so interesting to me. Especially given his interactions with Rishe. Like there is a lot of potential what the writer could do with his character and it’s fully realized in the anime (and I hope it will continue to be in the LN as well).As for the supporting characters they are alright but fall a little flat compared to the main characters. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, characters like Prince Kyle, Michel or even Elise are interesting enough to see them on screen or even to want to learn a little more about them but not in a way that would distract from the main characters (and trust me, I watched animes in which the side characters were way more interesting than the main characters. This is not a good sign). That being said… There is a certain balance and I feel like it would just be nice to give someone else a little bit more spotlight at times. Which will at the same time add to the main characters. (But that might just be me being a nit-picky writer).Unfortunately I have a little bit of criticism to add on how they adapted prince Theodore’s character. In my opinion they completely botched him. He was supposed to be Rishe’s age but he looks and sounds much younger. And I get they did that in contrast with Arnold but in my opinion they didn’t have to do that. Because I just can’t take him as serious as in the LN (ok, I can’t fully take him serious there either but at least I don’t think of him as a child). Maybe I will earn some hate for saying this but he’s the aspect I disliked most about this adaptation.Animation 8/10To be perfectly honest… in the beginning I wasn’t very fond of the animation style. And I still wish they would have stuck to the more mature artstyle from the illustrations in the LN. It would have given the anime so much more maturity as well. But it grew a little more on me after watching some episodes. Especially the background, atmosphere and love for details in some scenes. I’d still prefer a different style but it’s not horrible. The only thing (aside from Theodore) I wish was different are some of the proportions and anatomy of certain characters. It was just a little too much (especially in some scenes). So yeah, that wasn’t entirely perfect. But I loved the music (most of the time it was fitting). Plus fitting and beautiful Opening and Ending <3.Overall 9/10It’s not enough to be a masterpiece for very minor reasons but it’s very close to perfection for me and that says a lot. I just loved most aspects of it. It’s not simply enough to like the concept of a story, the plot, characters… but a combination of all of there aspects. To me this is a good example of a well-written story. While there are things I wish they would have done differently, there were also aspects that positively surprised me. And when it comes to adapting well-written stories it’s even harder. But this anime did a wonderful job and it easily became one of my new favorites. Especially for “fixing” something that worried me in the beginning (namely making Rishe too perfect). She still is a little OP but at least justified. And if you can look behind this because everything else is beautiful (especially the romance, even if it’s slow and more subtle), I would definitely recommend it and say this anime is a must-watch. It’s definitely one of my favorites this season and I might re-visit it after continuing further into the LN. Thank you for reading my review <3 keeps re-living her life but with all the knowledge she has gathered is so clever.

Thank you for reading my review <3', 'This had me giggling and kicking my feet throughout all 12 episodes. Not only is Rishe such a refreshing FMC but I love the classic “cold dark brooding” MC trope so I ate this up.What I will say about the MC is he doesn’t really have a soft side. Most of these brooding characters are secretly sweet as candy but not this guy. Rather than sweet he is compassionate and attentive which allows him to still be his dark and brooding self in most situations.Also the WAY he opened that ring box so QUICKLY and with TWO fingers was INSANE. Everything this man did...was sooooo buttery smooth it had me blushing lmaoo was sooooo buttery smooth it had me blushing lmaoo', 'I believe that, in addition to Doctor Elise, 7th loop time brought a completely different and innovative Isekai.There are two animes where the protagonist is a woman, and both are completely independent of the opinions of others.None of her wants or needs approval from any man to take control of her own life.  Richie is a determined girl and, as she has lived 6 other lives before this one, she wants to make the most of what she has to offer, in addition to using ALL the knowledge obtained throughout her 6 past lives.. doing the math, it totals 30...years lived in these 6 lives, since in each one she ""survived"" for 5 years each.The intelligence she acquired and being able to remember EVERYTHING is incredible (if it were me I would have forgotten the first one a long time ago).  It was a story that really grabbed me, I think whoever gives it a chance won\'t regret it.I REALLY HOPE THERE IS A SECOND SEASON FOR THE LOVE OF GOD years lived in these 6 lives, since in each one she ""survived"" for 5 years each.The intelligence she acquired and being able to remember EVERYTHING is incredible (if it were me I would have forgotten the first one a long time ago).

This show somehow leaves me feeling like I just watched genuine love story while incorporating a huge number of tropes in its plot points and characters. I did not come to this show with high expectations. Overpowered protagonist with respawn capabilities? Check. Comically evil villains? Check. So far, it\'s one of those shows where the MC feels invincible, winning every episode. However, like One Punch Man with its supporting cast or Mashle with its comedy, this show does something really well that makes me want to keep watching. And that is its excellent execution of characterization. The reason I\'m giving this...show a 10 is because I\'m in love with the MC!Characters (9/10): The male and female leads are the most developed characters in this show, and their romance is what makes it shine. It has the best dance scene I\'ve ever seen and Rishe might be one of my favorite characters of all time. She has this internal strength that doesn\'t come from the fact that she\'s OP. She makes hard decisions in the name of love and compassion, something everyone should aspire to do. The show does a really good job of Rishe\'s genuine determination and self-confidence. She has the goal of living a ""carefree"" life, which really means she\'s seeking freedom from the fear of death. Yet the thing I love the most about her is her real willingness to give up a great opportunity in the name of principle. This happened with her initial rejection of Arnold and later in the story. Scenes where people offer sacrifices of themselves get me emotional, and this show does it really well. I\'ve teared up twice from these types of scenes so far. I\'m sure I\'ll see it again. Seeing her hesitancy for prince Arnold and then gradual falling in love through their exciting dynamics and interactions introduces the potential changes she has to go through in this current life. I love their dynamic. Despite knowing a lot of the supporting cast in a previous life, she is forced to go about things differently and is genuinely surprised by some of their actions. The whole show is like a game where all the characters are figuring each other out.I like Prince Arnold too. He\'s very puzzling. Why does he start a war? How does he really feel about the people around him? It\'s very mysterious and definitely adds to the romance. It\'s exciting to see himself and the way he loves to Rishe and the audience.Plot (8/10): The plot is quite generic. You\'ve seen these tropes time and again. Undercover boss, introducing a modern invention in a fantasy setting, etc. However, anime is almost always full of tropes. The anime executes them pretty well by introducing an interesting conflict or character development as the context for the trope. It doesn\'t make the trope itself more interesting, but it\'s well executed. It\'s also used to advance the romance, which is top-notch in my opinion.Production (looks good to me/really good songs for OP and ED): I don\'t really care that much about animation quality or music unless it\'s really good or terrible. The animation looks decent to me. The dance scene looked pretty good. If there\'s any CGI, it\'s not noticeable. Also, I noticed that Arnold\'s lips make him look a little feminine. Finally, I did start watching this show because of Rishe\'s massive boobs in the main poster, so I must thank the character design for baiting me into watching this.TLDR; Rishe is a really well-executed OP protag in a show where wits and emotional intelligence make you the winner. Her romance with Prince Arnold is the best I\'ve ever seen, particularly because they both act like mature adults who have slightly differing convictions trying to get to know each other. It\'s the perfect fairy tale! show a 10 is because I\'m in love with the MC!Characters (9/10): The male and female leads are the most developed characters in this show, and their romance is what makes it shine.

Undercover boss, introducing a modern invention in a fantasy setting, etc. However, anime is almost always full of tropes. The anime executes them pretty well by introducing an interesting conflict or character development as the context for the trope. It doesn\'t make the trope itself more interesting, but it\'s well executed. It\'s also used to advance the romance, which is top-notch in my opinion.Production (looks good to me/really good songs for OP and ED): I don\'t really care that much about animation quality or music unless it\'s really good or terrible. The animation looks decent to me. The dance scene looked pretty good. If there\'s any CGI, it\'s not noticeable. Also, I noticed that Arnold\'s lips make him look a little feminine. Finally, I did start watching this show because of Rishe\'s massive boobs in the main poster, so I must thank the character design for baiting me into watching this.TLDR; Rishe is a really well-executed OP protag in a show where wits and emotional intelligence make you the winner. Her romance with Prince Arnold is the best I\'ve ever seen, particularly because they both act like mature adults who have slightly differing convictions trying to get to know each other. It\'s the perfect fairy tale!', ""One of the best villianess anime's ever.The show revoles around Rishe, a strong-willed protagonist whose on her 7th life and is determined to break the cycle. She's independant, sassy and smart. Bloody-minded to a fault, and these characteristics make this show so compelling, she makes sure everyone knows where she stands and what she will and won't do. Simply put, she's kickass and wonderful and you absolutely want to see how she'll get herself in and out of trouble.The people around her are all also smart but she has literal lifetimes of experience she isn't afraid to draw upon. The rest of the...characters have a ton of depth, but they very quickly end up revolving around her, even the love story with the prince is largely told from her perspective, so don't expect all your questions answered. The world is interesting and I'm dying to see more from it all really.Frankly, this show completely captivated me in a way rarely achieved by any fantasy show. characters have a ton of depth, but they very quickly end up revolving around her, even the love story with the prince is largely told from her perspective, so don't expect all your questions answered.

Just a story about meeting an almighty prince who for some unknown reason falls in love with the main heroine just because she behaved 'quirky' one time which wasn't even so much quirky to begin with. And of course just because of that this supposedly very wise and reasonable guy without any prior checks will allow you to do anything you want in his kingdom just because you are so cool. And there we say male protagonist harems are unrealistic. And this scene where she so easily reconciled the two brothers... Like really? Of course...all along this was just because they loved each other too much and no one except for the Mary Sue could explain this to them. Who would have thought?Anyway, I understand this anime is obviously not made to provide any logic but only a satisfaction to lonely girls hearts which I suppose it does ok so I give it a 6. Animation and music is on expected level for this type of a show, no more, no less.

Probably one of the oldest trick in the book when it comes to plot devices. It makes its way into this show known as 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy. Now imagine yourself in the shoes of a character who has been stuck in a time loop 6 times trying to escape a certain fate. This is the story about Rishe Irmgard Weitzner who tries to find out the truth.The english version of the title is translated as: 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy. It\'s exactly how...it sounds as the ""villainess"" tries to live her carefree life married to her worst enemy in this 7th time loop. Previously, she died in those previous 6th loops under various circumstances all involving a prince named Arnold Hein. Known of his brutality and feats, let\'s just say that he is Rishe\'s worst enemy.With the plot elements planted into the first episode, one would assume Rishe tries to down Arnold from the inside. There\'s indeed mind games being played throughout the show although not in a malicious way from her side. Rishe is a clever woman who isn\'t afraid to take risks. These involve taking on disguises, making bets, and even escaping from being held hostage in later episodes. To put it simply, she\'s not your klutz or damsel in distress. She doesn\'t need others to save her. We should however ask ourselves if Rishe is someone to respect and trust throughout the show. Watching her role goes to show that she learns from her past mistakes while also trying to change her fate.The plot doesn\'t demand much but there are several elements to watch out for. Beyond the Groundhound Day theme of time loosp, Rishe herself gets involved into more complex political affairs with the higher-ups. Arnold\'s proposal to Rishe should also spark curiousity whether it\'s out of self interest or geninue care for her. While there\'s no true love story between Rishe and Arnold, there\'s no denying that he is attracted to her beyond personal reasons. Unfortunately, it appears Rishe isn\'t great at seeing between the lines and remains mostly oblivious to his advances. Nonetheless, I want to assure viewers that Arnold himself is an intelligent and clever individual. However, he is also misunderstood due to his reptuation as a brutal tyrant when in reality, he is a caring person. The show does show his ruthless side when under pressure though, most particularly with his on-screen rivalry with his younger brother Theodore.One of the show\'s strengths is its character cast boosted with their charisma, intelligence, and cleverness. Outside of the core cast, characters such as Kyle, Oliver, and Michel are made to feel like larger than life. They have diverse skills that commoners would not easily obtain and are unique to their roles in the series. Let\'s also not forget about Rishe and her daredevil persona. When she wants something done, she will take any risk to get it done. Demonstrated in an episode where she escapes as a hostage, Rishe fights for her life rather than wait to be saved. Similarly, she\'s also clever at esponiage in disguise although not always successful. Ultimately though, this show\'s character cast offers a collective colorful look at different personalities.Unfortunately, 7th Time Loop suffers from adaptation issues due to its limited 12 episode time span. The main plot is ambigioulsy unresolved while the relationship between Rishe and Arnold didn\'t reach its full potential. Don\'t get me wrong, there are definitely moments in the show where the two has a clear connection. However, the show didn\'t truly build an everlasting relationship between them. It\'s one of the drawbacks for these type of anime, where adaptations had to be limited even if it means getting the overall flow right.7th Time Loops does meet its standards and perhaps go beyond with its production qualities. The main catch lies with its character designs, that gives the main guys their bishounen looks. In particular, Arnold has the charismatic look of a prince that can easily capture the attention of an audience. Similarly, other main guys are designed with aristocratic themes. Rishe herself has the look that balances between a princess and warrior. She has delicated features but also can be fierce when intimidated. The overall look of the show does its job at selling the its themes.This is by no means an anime contender of the year, and it would be very bold to even say that. Instead, it\'s a show that uses the time loop plot device and make the most of its plot. After watching this series, it goes to show that Rishe has exceeded her expectations as a female protagonist even if her relationship development with others isn\'t particuarly fleshed out. It shouldn\'t hold you back from giving this a chance though as I\'ve seen a lot worse. it sounds as the ""villainess"" tries to live her carefree life married to her worst enemy in this 7th time loop.

In her 6th life, she was killed by Arnold Hein. So when her 7th life begins, she tries to avoid him but ends up failing and is even proposed by him. She accepts and decides to do her best to stop him as his fiance.The plot is pretty basic but with a twist. Usually in reincarnation animes the main love interest is cold, hates the girl but falls for the girl slowly....This anime had a nice twist to it, having the main guy be interested in her right from the start, yet keeping the aloof personality.It might not be anything new but for those who love the genre, it will be worth your time in my opinion.My opinion on characters:Rishe, the protagonist is your average reincarnation anime girl but instead of trying to stay away from Arnold, the main love interest, she decides to stay by his side to stop him. She is pretty common ""nice girl who makes everyone\'s life good again"" but is refreshing as she is not helpless at all. She can fight and is very smart.Arnold is your common aloof main love interest who acts like he is cold and heartless but is actually soft. It\'s common but i think they make it work in this anime.It\'s only the 6th episode but i still have high expectations on how the plot turns out. I have generally a good feeling about it. For now i would give it an 8.

As an anime with a reincarnation theme, the focus on the protagonist's seventh life is truly captivating because the diverse experiences from previous lives have shaped the main character into someone with extensive knowledge and wisdom, as well as possessing strong charisma.What's intriguing is that the anime doesn't dwell too long on recounting the protagonist's past lives. Instead, the stories from the previous lives are conveyed effectively and contribute significantly to the development of the character in...their seventh life.The romance aspect of this anime is also compelling, following the classic shoujo trope of a strong and mysterious male lead. Although the protagonist initially shows no interest in or actively seeks romantic relationships, as the story progresses, romance begins to blossom in a natural manner.I will continue to watch how Rishe overcomes various challenges to make her dreams come true. their seventh life.The romance aspect of this anime is also compelling, following the classic shoujo trope of a strong and mysterious male lead.

The first episode was really captivating and really got me excited for what’s to come in the show, but the rest of the season kind of fell off and ended up being a bit boring and confusing. I usually go into shows with low expectations, so it was a surprise that the episodes after the 1st one were different.1st episode shows a bit of how she’s led past lives and met death at each one, so this 7th time she’s trying again to find another way to live. We see this powerful strong female protagonist with many skills to protect herself....And then that’s it—those protective/defensive skills kind of go into hibernation (except 1-2 episodes) and instead the rest of the season progresses with everything going perfectly as planned, except now she’s just a wife/fiancee. I was initially kind of impressed at first of ‘wow she knows how to do this’ but then the show ended up being ‘let’s outdo everyone and save side characters’.The chemistry between her and Arnold is really just not there. I love romance, subtle ones too, and I don’t understand exactly when they fell for each other 😅 one episode he’s glaring at her (in a non-joking way) and the next episode he’s like “you are my treasure”. And honestly this happens even til the last episode so sometimes with the way he talks to her you still don’t know if he actually loves her or just sees her as a form of entertainment. So I don’t even know if I could say the relationship is healthy either, just because throughout the series he keeps referencing violent tendencies like ‘I could flatten the world if I wanted to’, or ‘I could easily have you k*lled’ and in its definitely not in a joking way. So I don’t understand how she can say ‘I know you wouldn’t do that’ when he’s literally done it every single time in the past 6 lives 🤣Overall, if you’re looking for a strong female protagonist, you could probably watch this show but it won’t be fulfilling, as you might feel disappointed by the role and lack of power that she actually has.For the reincarnation aspect, I would recommend Tearmoon Empire because the FL and show is hilarious and actually does a good job of trying to avoid death, while trying to save a country.If you want a strong female protagonist that isn’t tied to being someone’s fiancée or being squished to that role and has more aspects to them that they can show without being perfect, I would recommend Apothecary Diaries (anime) and Yona of the Dawn (manga).

Basically if you love shoujo anime which story revolves around fixing a man (winning a man\'s heart), then I don\'t see any reason why you wouldn\'t like this, especially on top of liking the reincarnation themed anime, then this anime would be quite sufficiently enjoyable to watch. so of course you shouldn\'t just take the ""villainess"" title seriously and just outright ignore it at this point, whenever you see a ""villainess"" anime, you know it\'s most likely going to be a story about a girl reincarnated then fixing problems.But anyway, I recommend this anime only because and only to those who love this ""I can fix him"" story type anime.

Frequently with shows involving time the MC\'s either simply travel back and forth or are stuck once they go back/forward. The concept of Rishe reliving her life from a specific point, and using that as an opportunity to experience so many things lead different lives while trying to avoid her reoccurring fate was a refreshing twist. That alone brought my rating up.However throughout the middle part of the show I find it just falls flat. They take the story in a direction that while still a good watch, just didn\'t seem like...it lived up to what it could be. Also I feel like there\'s some pretty large plot holes involving the relationship between the two mc\'sOverall I contemplated between giving 7th time loop a ""fine""(6) or if it was ""good""(7). I think it really balances right on the line between the two for me. I enjoyed a lot of what the story had to offer and yet felt like they just missed the mark slightly on too many points.

I thought there should be something good about this anime that it has such a high mark on mal (for mal standards), and guess what, there was something about it. A shoujo anime that I enjoyed, even tho I can say I am a bit biased when it comes to this genre, even tho I haven\'t watched many of them shoujo stories, this one was really well made. A strong female MC?? A strong male character??? A good story that makes sense in like 90% of cases (the rest of the 10% is just me not being very...okay with how they did it)?? A production team that seems to have loved to make this show, as I ve seen in comments people pointing out small things that if you weren\'t knowladgeble enough, you wouldn\'t have caught it (for example, there was a short moment in the anime where they used a part of some old instrumental song which was sending a certain message that was perfect for that moment). I\'ve seen people calling it generic... okay, and? Yea, it might not be the next masterpiece, but what\'s wrong with a generic anime done right? And as others have said and I kinda agree with them, the word generic is starting to lose its meaning... ofc a lot of the stuff the anime does has been done already in other stories, but so what? It\'s not the end that matters, it s the journey. If it\'s done well, why would someone mind seeing ideas that they already saw? Especially because they are never the same, there\'s almost always something changed which makes it unique in its own way. Anyway, done with my small rambling. The anime? Yes. A pleasant surprise. Enjoyable to watch from start to finish. And oh God, this anime might have awaken something in me... hearing those heartbeats in my hd600... they hit right in my soul....Story: 9The story is well made. Does it have sense most of the time? Yes, I would say so. Are there a lot of things made in such a way to give meaning to further moves/conclusions/strategies? Yes, there are. As the title says, it s the 7th loop, so the other loops the female MC was learning more and more about the world, which imo is a pretty cool thing. And now in the 7th loop, she is using all her past life\'s knowledge to do exactly what she wants. I wouldn\'t say it\'s that much of a complex story, but it does have its moments of ""Whoa, that s pretty interesting!"". I kinda wished that the author would tackle certain aspects of the female MC when it comes to past lifes and such and the male MC and his past, but ig that is for the next season or for the LNs. But that\'s more my curiosity and interest in certain psychological aspects of the context they happen to be in. It also has a few fighting scenes that are well animated. Was kinda surprised, especially in the first episode. Didn\'t expect it to show so much.Art: 9Well animated. Few fighting scenes that are well done as well. The animation style does seem like what I\'ve seen as categorized as ""shoujo"". There might have been some moments, towards the end, that I kinda have spotted certain slide show moments, but not enough to warrant a complain. You ain\'t gonna go into this anime to start disecting each frame and moment, or at least I hope so... that would be kinda sad.Music: 9The music is pretty damn good. Who did the OST knew what they were doing. Especially the OP and ED are very well done, and I would say the OP animation is quite top tier, at least the first half of it. Especially those heartbeats...Characters: 9You have 2 strong MCs, one female and one male, that are well made for each other and form quite the unique power couple. They are not overbearing with the strong moments... it feels more like they complement each other in ways you just fall in love...

So well done!!With a lot of recent romance animes, while the characters are cute, they often are missing the sexual chemistry element that makes the relationships turn-up a notch. And it tends to make them feel more platonic than anything else. This show did a great job of showing how truly infatuated...they were with one another.As for the plot, I was thoroughly impressed. This held my attention fully for all 12 episodes! There was not a single duration of time that felt unnecessary or insignificant. They had a story to tell and they told it well. As for the characters-  the same thing! All the characters in the story are very interesting and I really can’t wait to see what else happens within this world.

It definitely started off really great, however there were some parts that halfway through season 1 I felt weren't necessary. The developing romance between Arnold and Rishe did have me giggling since I'm a sucker for a good slow romance.I think one of the best parts about season 1 was the process of Rishe learning more about Arnold. Because it's her 7th time looping she has quite a lot...of experience with different occupations, however being proposed to by the prince of another country is definitely unexpected! I'd say give this one a watch, if you're not into it that's okay!

However, it's on the 7th loop where Rishe is caught off-guard when she meets her worst enemy and the reason why she keeps reverting back to the beginning, Galkhein Empire's Crown Prince Arnold Hein. How will this loop affect Rishe's relationship with her biggest enemy?Story & Character:...6/10Although I am not particularly fond of Villainess stories 7th Time Loop was an interesting one with its mystery and drama elements. The story does well to keep the male lead in a shroud of mystery by making his decisions as bashful and unpredictable as possible in the beginning. The world isn't as expansive in this series; However, the plot events feel unique in terms of fantasy romance with an arbitrary engagement between the main characters, binding them together at every turn of the narrative. The events felt repetitive with meetings, banquets and traveling micro-arcs taking place in a lot of the downtime between developmental arcs.Characters is 7th Time Loop's strength and weakness. The main characters of the Galkhein Royal family and lead attendants have a great depth within them especially the Galkhein Princes. However, Rishe's character is somewhat an oddball who will not bat an eye to daylight murder but will be visibly traumatized at a distant stare down by a character she's trying to avoid. She has some quirks that make her unlikeable yet likeable at the same time; For example I personally wasn't fond with her constant dabbling in Galkhein's affairs but her character did great in defeating enemies or helping allies with past life knowledge. In terms of character development though, 7th Time Loop does fairly well managing a set of almost predominantly male characters.Art & Sound: 4/10I won't lie the art sucks. The way characters move during dialogue is so sluggish and choppy and their character art style feel amateur. The hair especially on some of the male characters felt like it was done by quickly doodling with a mechanical pencil especially characters like Michel and Kyle who have messy fringes all over the place.Sound wasn't the strongest part of the series either with lack of thematic songs or memorable use of sound effects and voice acting. By modern standard they weren't too bad, just nothing noteworthy or ground-breaking.Overall & Enjoyment: 6/10It wasn't necessarily a bad series but there are definitely obvious questionable plot events, art style pitfalls and a fair share of unsatisfying characters (and character traits) However, overall it was a decent watch; I would've liked to see more different flashbacks with Rishe encountering characters she's met earlier in the loops. 6/10Although I am not particularly fond of Villainess stories 7th Time Loop was an interesting one with its mystery and drama elements.

So when she hops out of the window to collect a few things before her parents banish her, she meets Prince Arnold, who was responsible for all 6 of her deaths - either directly or indirectly.- this is how my commentary on the first 5 episodes began. In it, I also explained that the series has two major weaknesses:Firstly, I don\'t like the concept itself - ""I\'m reborn for the Xth time"". 7 lives, which allow 7 times as many recaps because they...weren\'t shown, is annoying to me because I\'m not a fan of recaps. Fortunately, the recaps here are less annoying, even if it\'s a real shame that we know so little about her previous lives.On the other hand, the series puts dozens of questions in your head that it doesn\'t answer afterwards. This continues throughout the series and is annoying right to the end. Of course, the aim of a story is to use questions to keep the viewer interested in the story, but unfortunately the satisfaction of having at least some of the questions answered is completely absent here. Because when ""7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!"" has a story, then it revolves around the question of why Prince Arnold became so brutal in their last lives and how Rishe can prevent it in this 7th life. Aside from Rishe getting closer to the prince, there\'s no real progress in that direction throughout the season, which is annoying.Otherwise, what we have here is a fairly entertaining, if not overly unusual, romance intrigue story. The protagonist Rishe in particular stands out positively as a kind of stubborn, easy-going whirlwind. So if there had been a bit more of a common thread here than ""stay with Prince Arnold"" and if a reasonably consistent story had been tailored with him that went beyond ""stay with Prince Arnold and do my thing"", I could well have imagined that the far too long name would have been one of the few serious criticisms of the series. Although the character design, especially the lip design, really bothered me, because the far too detailed lower lip looks out of place.Edit: Where does the ""Villainess"" in the title come from? weren\'t shown, is annoying to me because I\'m not a fan of recaps.

It has quite a few recommendations already. However, I don't feel like it lived up to my expectations. Also, I did not read the light novel nor manga adaptations of this story to compare it to. I'll be in the minority saying that this isn't worth it, but I have to stand by that.This is a reincarnation anime centered around a once noble protagonist, Rishe, who is about to dumped by the kingdom's prince . . . for the 7th time. The other 6 lives were met with a premature...death followed by a resurrection by a mysterious force. The heroine wasn't a villainess in her previous life so I don't think this is one of those Groundhog day scenarios where she is intended to learn a lesson through repeated death. I just have to assume this is all for gaining cheat abilities through effort rather than bestowal.Similarly to Gekai Elise, another anime released around the same time, we are never told what powers allowed Rishe to come back to life, or what purpose her resurrection is intended to serve. The anime at least, doesn't cover the other 6 lives she lived extensively. Only the end of the 6th where she meats Arnold, the prince of a foreign kingdom. He is charmed by her athletic abilities and decides to offer her the chance to marry him. He is also the one who killed her in her last 'loop'. Yet seeing him come to aid Rishe and smoothly taking a knee to propose was enough to win me over. Add that to the stellar quality animation and beautiful opening song and this had all the makings of a fantastic romance adventure akin to Beauty and the Beast. Sadly, it was a steady slope downward from here.With each loop, Rishe tried a new tactic of living in order to actually survive long enough to escape what leads to her untimely demise. Her various teachers, at least the ones we see, were all bishonen to the n-th degree to the point of all of them having glossy lips and exhaling their every word in a seductive tone. In fact, all the hot guys of significance in this story have those shiny lips. It's honestly a little funny how they all look and sound like otome game targets. But this isn't what bothers me. The problem is that these are supposed to be her former teachers as well as people of high rank and education from past lives. And yet they all seem to be made deliberately clueless at key points for the sake of promoting the heroine's assortment of skills. The kinds of things she suggests to appeal for their support in the 7th loop don't seem inconceivable for her teachers to have thought of themselves. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling the narrative. I'll just say that resolving the more dramatic parts of the story didn't reveal very compelling reasons for their execution in the first place. Since the purpose of this loop was supposed to be discovering the reason for an impending war but without knowing the cause, all Rishe can really do is try and make life better for those around her in the hope that something changes. A half cour just wasn't enough time for things to 'build'. Episodes went by in a flash with some spending over half the time without leaving a room. Mind you, this is partially due the amount of tender flirting scenes that unfold between Rishe and Arnold (And they WERE nice). However it also slowed the pace of the story and some conflicts felt more like interruptions. Perhaps things will pick up more in the next season and I can re-evaluate this. Until then, I'm mostly disappointed that intelligence needs to be lowered for the key characters just to promote the heroine's strengths. Having different occupations worth of skills may put you in a great position to mingle as the future queen, but it will take more than a jack of all trades to end this conflict. And If the reasons for it are as silly as the ones in this first cour, I'd be very sad. death followed by a resurrection by a mysterious force. The heroine wasn't a villainess in her previous life so I don't think this is one of those Groundhog day scenarios where she is intended to learn a lesson through repeated death. I just have to assume this is all for gaining cheat abilities through effort rather than bestowal.Similarly to Gekai Elise, another anime released around the same time, we are never told what powers allowed Rishe to come back to life, or what purpose her resurrection is intended to serve. The anime at least, doesn't cover the other 6 lives she lived extensively. Only the end of the 6th where she meats Arnold, the prince of a foreign kingdom. He is charmed by her athletic abilities and decides to offer her the chance to marry him. He is also the one who killed her in her last 'loop'. Yet seeing him come to aid Rishe and smoothly taking a knee to propose was enough to win me over.

It’s just in our nature. We love it when we know how powerful someone is and someone doubts them arrogantly. That’s why One-Punch Man becomes frustrating at times because you just want Saitama to prove them wrong already. This show (whose title really doesn’t need to be that long) survives only off of that catharsis. That thrill of outsmarting everyone and then seeing how impressed they are. The only reason I continued watching was because it was satisfying in a way; watching the heroine find a way to outsmart everyone. But that’s...really all this show has going for it. The protagonist has no flaws because if she did, then the catharsis wouldn’t be there. It’s a type of power fantasy in, ‘if I knew what I did now back then’. I’m glad, even though technically an isekai, she doesn't have knowledge of modern technology. It makes it so any accomplishment she does is completely hers. But even with that, the power fantasy is still all this show has. The characters are one-note, despite how complex the show tries to convince you they are. Although she does outsmart everyone, the problems are never too complex to begin with. The challenges just come one at a time and never pile on top of each other and so you never doubt she can come up with a way out of it. You’re just sort of waiting for the moment to happen and then collect the dopamine when it does. The romance is bland and seems more like admiration than love.

Flying Witch,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31376/Flying_Witch,"[""Flying Witch is possibly the best iyashikei (healing) anime ever made. If you love Aria, Non Non Biyori, and the Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou OVAs, then this is a must-see series. Flying Witch stands out because it makes even Aria look action-packed. Every moment of every episode unfolds naturally and organically; there's a very subtle but unmistakable message that humans (witch or otherwise) are truly inseparable from the earth, plants, wind, and sky. There's no overt conflict, no overly energetic comedy bits, and really no plot. I have no idea how an entire episode dedicated to the coming of spring, taking a few walks, and picking...fresh wildflower buds for tempura can be utterly captivating, but that's why Flying Witch is so magical.One thing that's particularly refreshing is that all the characters, even ones from the magical world, are portrayed in a very realistic manner. Instead of relying on eccentric behavior to drive the story, the show just lets people be themselves. This is particularly important for the character of Chinatsu, a grade-school girl who's the younger cousin of Makoto (the titular witch of the series). It's great to see her reactions because she doesn't act like any of the anime tropes you might expect to encounter, nor is she given any odd quirks to make her more of a stand-out (e.g. Renge from Non Non Biyori). Chinatsu's just a normal kid, and that alone makes her a rare and wonderful creation.Similarly, Chito, Makoto’s cat and familiar, actually acts and is animated like a real cat. Chito can be lazy, likes taunting the neighborhood dog, and goes on inscrutable adventures that only another cat could truly understand. I’ve followed a few cats on their adventures in my time and Chito is exactly like those real world felines. There’s a wonderful moment in Episode 5 when Chito decides to take a nap with Chinatsu, and the animators take the time to depict Chito circling around a few times before finally settling down. This is exactly what every cat ever actually does, and this show has the generosity to let Chito be true to Chito. All anime cats should be so lucky.Generosity is perhaps the best word to describe Flying Witch. One can’t help but notice the small kindnesses that every episode contains. Whether it’s helping out with simple household chores, ensuring that a caterpillar finds a safe spot to feed on fresh leaves, or keeping a new friend company while she runs errands, one is constantly reminded of how these tiny actions are often so much more meaningful than the occasional grand gesture.Flying Witch is a moment of utter serenity in the frenetic world of anime, and its real magic is in giving its viewers the chance to reflect on the smallest moments in daily life and realize that those can be the most enchanting of all.

Maybe you are tired of how action-packed and over-the-top most anime are? Perhaps you want to relieve yourself of all the worries in real life and just enjoy the ride?Regardless, I invite you to enter the world of Flying Witch. It is not heavy, exciting, or full of action. In fact, it meanders through quite uneventful situations. However, it is truly the pinnacle of slice of life as far as feeling good goes. It's a beautiful concoction of peaceful music, a laid-back setting, and genuinely sweet characters doing everyday things with no...worry or tension and magic thrown in. While more demanding audiences may find it dull, I can safely recommend it those who just want something sweet and soothing.There are other relaxing shows out there, like Non Non Biyori, K-On!, and the Suzumiya Haruhi Series to name a few, but not very many of them can create such a perfectly built universe that seems separate and devoid of anime clichés and stereotypes. It is merely a tale of a girl named Makoto visiting her family in the outskirts with her cat. However, their daily activities aren't very ordinary. In fact, they regularly involve magic. Think of it like Aria or Yokohama Shopping Log with fantasy flavor. Makoto herself is a witch and their everyday events include anything from planting a mandrake to helping a friend turn back into a human from a furry to visiting a Ghibli-esque café with regular customers that include ladybugs, foxes, and invisible people. The magical elements blend in so seamlessly, it's as if they're natural. It adds a level of extra beauty to an otherwise run of the mill story.The cast of characters are very memorable. They all have stunning chemistry together and their conversations flow with ease. Each of them also have many personality traits that adds a level of familiarity that most SoL anime don't have. While I was watching it, I didn't feel like I was just watching characters talking with each other. I felt like they were genuine people that I knew closely. Don't expect them to be well-developed or complex though.Now I come to the big issue - Unfortunately, not everyone will appreciate Flying Witch. Regardless of how cute and cuddly it is, a large portion of the audience will find it boring. There is no overall plot, no drama, no conflict, no character development, and no degree of complexity. Those who want something exciting, thrilling or deep won't get what they're looking for.

The designs are very typical but don't stick out as terrible or anything. I can say the visuals fit the calm style of the narrative but only that much.As for the music, it does a good job of being soothing and restful but like the visuals, it's not fantastic. Most of the soundtrack is composed of calm piano and flute pieces, as well as some stringed music. None of the tracks in particular are very memorable but as a whole, it does its job. The opening, on the other hand, can be described in one word - Cute. With the adorable dance routine, upbeat song, and colorful visuals, you can't help but feel warm inside after watching it. It does a very good job of preparing for what's to come. There is also something special about the voice acting. Quite simply, the VAs sound genuine. None of them deliver squeaky or overly obnoxious roles (unlike a good portion of slice of life), so it sounds very nice.So, sit back, relax, drink a cup of tea, sit on your couch, and enjoy the ride. Are you having a bad day? It will be a great remedy for that. In the end, what you have is definitely a basic slice of life type of show - but one of the best ones out there.

Yes, it’s literally a series about a flying witch named Makoto and her friends. Yes, it has magic in the series because what else would witches excel in? And yes, this is the type of magical story that will entice you in such a comfortable charm that you won’t ever forget.The series is adapted from the manga of the same name and essentially, it’s a hybrid of slice of life and fantasy. We follow the life of Kowata Makoto as she returns to living in a rural town with her friends...and relatives. In essence, it explores the daily life style of how Makoto gets around while also developing her magical skills as the flying witch. Her friends and family guides her while we also learn about their characters. There is no linear storytelling as each episode seems to be an episodic adventure of itself. However, that’s what actually makes Flying Witch so special because just how unique the show can be as we see its imaginativity.A good deal of the enjoyment about the series comes from the characters. It’s a small yet diverse and unique cast because every character has their own attributes and characteristics. Makoto is the polite type of girl with a down to earth type of personality yet also has a problem of getting lost. Throughout the series, this humorous gag is played as we see how clueless she can be with directions. Then, there’s Chinatsu Kuramoto (Makoto’s cousin). As a younger character, it comes to no surprise that she is curious about the world around her and the people she meets. Furthermore, she has a peculiar interest in magic after seeing it with her very own eyes. It’s also interesting to note that Chinatsu gets a decent amount of development as she experiences with magic as well. Akane Kowata is the witch of the series, literally. She is not just the older sister of Makoto but also acts as her mentor figure as well. However, unlike Makoto, Akane is more of an airhead and often speaks what’s on her mind no matter how brutally honest it is. Despite that, she deeply cares about her family and we can see that she has a gentle heart. From Chinatsu’s family side, we also have Kei Kuramoto who serves more of the older brother type. Although by personality, I find that he is more similar to Akane with his down to earth personality. It’s these characters that gets a good deal of emphasis and each episode explores their relationship in the story. And to be quite honest, it’s quite special.So yes, you’re probably asking yourself: what should I really expect from Flying Witch? Do we just get to see a typical slice of life/fantasy story that we may or may not like? While the pacing of the series may feel sluggish, it’s the atmospheric feel and ways to embrace the fantasy genre that really can win fans over. Throughout the show, there’s all type of supernatural gags that makes their appearances ranging from sonic screeching mandrakes, flying whales, mysterious ghosts, and even anthropomorphic characters that can transform into a dog. Familiars such as cats and hamsters are also no stranger in this series either. The point is that the series wants the viewers to experience what it has to offer by bringing all sorts of content to the table. It succeeds in this by bringing a sense of magical realism by combining elements of supernatural with daily life experiences.From a story perspective, the series can stray some viewers from pursuing further into the series as at times, the pacing can feel uninteresting. If you’re dying for some magical action, then you’re looking at wrong place. This isn’t some series about witches trying to take over the world. In fact, Flying Witch emphasizes a lot about its premise and themes rather than story development. I confess to myself that the series is perhaps one of the most charming shows I’ve watched in recent years. Just for the fact that each episode, there’s the graceful feeling the series brings in with its character and setting. Even the comedy, which I wasn’t sold on at first, convinced me that the series is a rare gem. It’s down to earth humor that is very consistent about what it tries to do. In the meantime, I’m also satisfied with the directing of the series despite that it follows more of a rearranged adaptation.J.C. Staff helms the series and it’s quite an elegant feeling you’ll see with its artwork. Characters look simple yet makes you wonder what to expect about them. There’s a refreshing feel whenever you see characters like Makoto on a broomstick or Chinatsu with witch aesthetics on. The familiars are also convincing that blurs the line between magical realism. Even the setting of a rural town is crafted quite well with a countryside feel that is nostalgic.Soundtrack and music plays an important part of the series as it brings the atmospheric feeling to life. The overall tone of the show has a gentle tone and is wonderfully put together with its soft instruments. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also lighthearted and reminds us how charming the series can be. Furthermore, I have to give praise for the overall voice mannerism of the series as they sound exactly as their personalities is reflected.Ah Flying Witch. Dubbed by some fans as “Comfy”, it’s definitely a show that is recommendable to just about anyone. From the unique cast of characters to magical realism, it’s a series that takes slice of life and fantasy to a creative level. What you expect is what you will get. And that is, a show about flying witches, familiars, and giving you a comfy time. and relatives. In essence, it explores the daily life style of how Makoto gets around while also developing her magical skills as the flying witch. Her friends and family guides her while we also learn about their characters. There is no linear storytelling as each episode seems to be an episodic adventure of itself. However, that’s what actually makes Flying Witch so special because just how unique the show can be as we see its imaginativity.A good deal of the enjoyment about the series comes from the characters. It’s a small yet diverse and unique cast because every character has their own attributes and characteristics. Makoto is the polite type of girl with a down to earth type of personality yet also has a problem of getting lost. Throughout the series, this humorous gag is played as we see how clueless she can be with directions. Then, there’s Chinatsu Kuramoto (Makoto’s cousin). As a younger character, it comes to no surprise that she is curious about the world around her and the people she meets. Furthermore, she has a peculiar interest in magic after seeing it with her very own eyes. It’s also interesting to note that Chinatsu gets a decent amount of development as she experiences with magic as well. Akane Kowata is the witch of the series, literally. She is not just the older sister of Makoto but also acts as her mentor figure as well. However, unlike Makoto, Akane is more of an airhead and often speaks what’s on her mind no matter how brutally honest it is. Despite that, she deeply cares about her family and we can see that she has a gentle heart. From Chinatsu’s family side, we also have Kei Kuramoto who serves more of the older brother type. Although by personality, I find that he is more similar to Akane with his down to earth personality. It’s these characters that gets a good deal of emphasis and each episode explores their relationship in the story. And to be quite honest, it’s quite special.So yes, you’re probably asking yourself: what should I really expect from Flying Witch? Do we just get to see a typical slice of life/fantasy story that we may or may not like? While the pacing of the series may feel sluggish, it’s the atmospheric feel and ways to embrace the fantasy genre that really can win fans over. Throughout the show, there’s all type of supernatural gags that makes their appearances ranging from sonic screeching mandrakes, flying whales, mysterious ghosts, and even anthropomorphic characters that can transform into a dog. Familiars such as cats and hamsters are also no stranger in this series either. The point is that the series wants the viewers to experience what it has to offer by bringing all sorts of content to the table. It succeeds in this by bringing a sense of magical realism by combining elements of supernatural with daily life experiences.From a story perspective, the series can stray some viewers from pursuing further into the series as at times, the pacing can feel uninteresting.

I think both happen maybe once in each episode and that\'s it. But it\'s not a bad thing, it\'s just regular \'slice of life\' anime.Story follows young witch Makoto living with her relatives in some nice countryside. The vibe really reminds me of ""Non non biyori"" - almost no people in the background, just main characters doing everyday things. Well, sometimes \'everyday things for a witch\', but it\'s not flashy fireworks show. I really liked that, the magic rituals shown are simple - no lights, no wind, mainly drawing magic circles, using small items...and awaiting effect. Flying on a broom is a way to travel around town, no racing or great speeds, just floating short distances.You\'ve seen these characters before - 7/10Unfortunately nothing great in terms of characters, but they work nicely in this enviroment.Some nice ideas - 9/10The witches are among us, and so are some interesting ideas about how they live, and what other magical things there are in the world.Sound - 7/10The opening is great, you will clap along in no time. Soundtrack not so much unfortunately, but it provides the relaxing atmosphere.Nichijou - 7/10Nothing special in terms of story, but I enjoyed short episodes from life of a witch. Familiar situations with just a little bit more magic.Non Non Witch - 10/10For me that was really more of a simple life in the countryside, relaxing atmosphere and no real problems.In conclusion, I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something peaceful to watch this season. and awaiting effect.

No spoilers. As if this show actually has anything to spoil, in the first place. Ok, then. Flying Witch is one of those shows that I see a screenshot or a short clip of and I think the artwork looks so stinkin good, that I just gotta go see the entire show. And unfortunately... that doesn\'t always lead me to the best of shows... If I were to describe Flying Witch in one word, it would be ""nothing"". That\'s the gist of it. NOTHING happens in this show. So you\'re thinking ""Oh, then it\'s a slice of life show?"" I...guess??? But it\'s the most eventless and dull lifestyle that you\'ll ever witness. Now, I said that there isn\'t anything to spoil in this show, and there really isn\'t. But I will be going over some events in the show, as well as the overall beginning set up, just so I can better describe things. Don\'t worry, though. I swear that you won\'t be getting spoiled on anything groundbreaking, no matter how much detail I give you.So as the name of the show implies, this show stars a witch, named Makoto. Now you may be thinking ""Ok, a witch. So there\'s probably some cool magic and otherworldly events in this show, right?"" Nope... Well... there is, but it\'s almost entirely non existent. What I mean is that a lot of the magic in Flying witch is either done through reciting words, writing a spell or drawing a symbol, or through jump cuts that have NO flashy transition that even acknowledges that something magic even happened. For example, there\'s this cafe in the show, run by a witch. But the cafe looks like an abandoned, destroyed building. What they gotta do is a series of gestures, to make the cafe\'s true appearance show itself. You see them looking at the destroyed building, cut to their faces and bodies, doing the gestures, and then cut to the building being completely different. No transition. No sound effects. Nothing. Another thing is the flying. Makoto doesn\'t entirely know how to fly, at the beginning of the show. That gets mentioned around episode 4 or 5, or something like that. So you\'d think we\'d watch her trying to learn how to fly. But no. On the second to last episode or so, there\'s a scene that has Makoto flying on her broom. One of the characters mentions how well she\'s flying. And she just says ""Oh, ya. I finally mastered it."" And that\'s it. It\'s never brought up, again. There\'s even a part where a non witch character starts training to become a witch. She asks for her parent\'s permission and they just say yes, with no hesitation. And then that\'s it. She never gets any magic powers throughout the show, but she\'s apparently now in training to become a witch. And that\'s the end of that.So if you\'re watching this show for its magic elements, don\'t. They\'re the most nonexistent non extravagant magic elements you ever see, or rather not see, in any anime ever. So how about the slice of life aspect of the show? Is that any good? Well... not really. It doesn\'t have any sort of plot, in any of the episodes. Not even any episodic ones, like Ouran Host Club or Fruits Basket. And it isn\'t funny in the slightest, like Azumanga Daioh. This show is all about existence. Just straight up existence, in the blandest way possible. There\'s about .0001% of magic, thrown into the mix of it, but that\'s all. Now a show about simple existence isn\'t always a bad thing, when the characters are at least interesting to watch. So... are these characters interesting to watch? Take a guess... Just like how the show can be described as ""nothing"", all of the characters can be described as ""nobody"". Not a single one of them has a personality. At all. I could not describe these characters, if my life depended on it. I even went and looked up the character descriptions for everyone on MyAnimeList, and even THEY can\'t describe these characters in more than 1 or 2 sentences. Probably my favorite description was for one of the main characters, Chinatsu. Her description is ""Younger sister of Kei. She dislikes bake because she thinks it\'s for adults."" That about sums it all up, right there.The characters are all nice people. That\'s about as much as I can say to describe them. Nice. They\'re always nice to each other. There isn\'t a single bit of conflict in the entire show. I could probably count on one hand, all of the sentences in all of the dialogue of the entire show that had even the slightest bit of conflict in them. There\'s literally nothing else to say about it. There\'s no conflict. No problem solving. No plot twists. No nothing. This is a show about nothing, starring a bunch of nobodies. As for the music, it\'s just as bland and nonexistent as the show, so at least it flows well with the show it\'s attached to. Still, you won\'t remember any of the songs in this show. Not even the opening or ending. The opening and ending are generic in both sound and visuals. Completely skippable. There\'s no english dub as of right now, so you\'re only option is sub. The voice acting is fine. No problems with it, at least. Though, if there ever is a dub, you may think this is a good show to have play in the background, while you do something else. Though, personally, I think it\'d be better to leave the visuals in the background, and don\'t even worry about listening to what\'s going on.The animation is probably the best thing in the entire show. That\'s the whole reason I decided to watch this show, in the first place. The animation was done by J.C. Staff, a company that has worked on MANY other shows, and many that are far better than this one. Such as the previously mentioned Azumanga Daioh, Toradora, and one of my favorite shows, Little Busters. The animation in Flying Witch is really stinkin good. Scenery is beautiful and the characters are nicely detailed, despite their boring designs. HOWEVER. There is ONE thing in the animation that REALLY bugs me. And that is the character\'s noses. I know that that\'s a weird thing to complain about, but the character\'s noses all have this little light ring bubble on them, and it\'s VERRRRRRRY annoying to look at. Right from episode 1, that stupid light ring thingy bugged me, to no end. And it stays there, throughout the entire show. But other than that, the animation is near perfect.The only thing left to talk about is that there are some OVA episodes, for Flying Witch. There are 9 episodes, each being no more than 2 minutes long, and being animated in a chibi CG art style. As for the plot of these OVA\'s... they have just as much of a plot as the regular show. In other words... nothing at all. So in conclusion, Flying Witch is nothing special in the absolute slightest. I don\'t think I\'ll ever be watching it, again. Though, I can\'t really say I HATED it, as weird as that sounds. It wasn\'t a bother to watch, being only 12 episodes. It was easy to follow, since there\'s literally nothing to follow, in the first place. It\'s nice to look at, and it may be fun to watch with your kids or younger siblings, since this is one of the few anime series that is actually appropriate for a very young audience. If you wanna watch this show to relax, I GUESS I can recommend it for that. Though, to save you some time, I would only recommend watching episodes 7, 8, 11, and 12. Those were my favorites out of the bunch, and you can honestly see what the entirety of the show is about, just by watching one of them. So ya. That\'s about it. If you\'re looking for a good slice of life show, with subtle magic that actually adds to the story, watch one of the Key anime. If you\'re looking for a slice of life with a plot, watch Ouran. If you\'re looking for a slice of life with actual comedy and actual characters, watch Azumanga. And if you want a show about literally nothing... watch Flying Witch...I\'m honestly not sure where to leave off this review. On one hand, I was ok with watching this and it certainly wasn\'t a bother to do so, but on the other hand, I got absolutely NOTHING from watching this. So I\'m gonna give this show a bit of a weird final score. If you\'re willing to watch this type of show and accept that you\'ll get absolutely nothing from watching it, I can give this show a 5. But if you don\'t want to watch this type of show, then I\'d give it a 0. I know that isn\'t really a fair rating, since the fact that a show was even able to be created deserves at least SOME respect. In that case, I\'ll give it a 1. But please know that my rating of 5 doesn\'t mean the show is decent, and my rating of 1 doesn\'t mean the show is terrible. I\'m giving it a 5, simply because it\'s the the most indifferent rating I can give. And with this show, I am 100% indifferent to its existence and to my experience watching it.Flying Witch gets either a 1/10 or a 5/10. guess???

Flying witch\'s is perhaps one of the best titles to get snuggle up and ""comfy"" with.Flying witch was indeed a ""comfy"" title. Without a doubt ""comfy"" is the best word to describe the series. Flying Witch is a fantasy title that follows the 15-year-old witch Makoto Kowata and other supporting characters in her daily life.  Because the show is considered ""Slice of Life"" the story and plot are slow. The  slow pacing of the story-telling is actually a good thing, it makes it easy to follow along, and in addition to that, you can...enjoy what the story has to offer, which is one of the many things I appreciated about this title. What\'s fascinating about Flying witch is that the show has a distinct Studio Ghibli feel to it. Ghibli films were always full of imaginative worlds, full of wonder and exploration. More than likely you will read this in many other reviews, with that out the way, let\'s continue. Flying witch is the ""ideal"" example  of a show with the following genres\' ""supernatural"" and  ""slice of life"" done right.  The original author Chihiro Ishizuka must have had extensive knowledge and a lengthy amount of experience working on supernatural and slice of life titles. Because none of her work is listed anywhere, I\'m going to assume that she has worked on various titles in the past and went unaccredited. If this is truly her first work then I must say that the way the anime was able to portray her work was very well done. The show offers quite a lot of lighthearted comedy which is backed up with little things like odd reaction faces (which I always found hilarious,) silly little jokes and gestures, that sort of thing. More than likely you won\'t be laughing your ass off to much. As for the lasting appeal the story has to offer, I feel like the show didn\'t really stand out that. This is perhaps due to the releases of bigger titles like Kabeneri of the Iron Fortess, Re:, and Boku no Hero Academia. When you read the Synopsis of Flying witch, in comparison to the mainstream titles listed above I\'d say more viewers would watch those of witch. Last few things I\'m going to add is that Flying witch\'s story, while not as deep as I expected, does in fact have moments that tug at the heart-strings at bit. It\'s so well part together that I may or may not have had tears in my eyes...Flying witch delivered visually spectacular animation! Settings, objects, all boated very high quality animation that was both frequently & heavily used during various scenes. The beauty of the background settings, water, trees, grass plains, the quality was beautiful! I could see that the animators added a few CGI objects & textures to add a sense of realism to certain things, again, like water, clouds, and ground objects etc. Seeing the reflection of objects in the water, the rough detail added in the stone,simply brilliant. Yasuhiro Okumura and Yoshio okouchi went all out, in details of the objects like wooden floors, tables etc.  Character designs were pretty amazing too. I loved the silly reaction faces the Characters would make. This coupled along with the moods shown on their faces . J.C.Staff really outdid themselves when it came to adding details and such to characters faces and body movement. Expressing the way a characters facial features, body movement, and emotions when they  would react to supernatural moments had a somewhat overly dramatic, yet was almost human-like. I do not doubt that J.C. Staff brought in real people (most likely workers there) and used Motion capture suits to add more realism in the already majestic & magical fantasy world that is Flying Witch. Perhaps the only thing that bothered me is the reflection spots on the characters noses, just that little odd spot. With very little doubt, I can say proudly that Flying Witch had ""the best"" animation I\'ve seen so far this Spring season. Outstanding job done by J.C. Staff!I love the intro song, it really gets me excited to watch the show and singing & start clapping along with the song like a mentally disturbed man-child.  Every episode I would deliberately forget to skip the intro to sing along, as if I was a child watching Barney, or sesame street, or whatever children\'s programming is on now-a-days, damn if I know. The way that the intro song is performed reminds me of a late 90\'s and early 2000\'s catchy anime opening. To be more specific it kind of reminds me of Azumanga Daioh\'s intro, remember? Lu La lu La piano wa sekai no yumesaku nohara ni melody... Ready to sing along and then get right into the show and have a blast watching. The background music played in Flying witch was fantastic too. It\'s sort of like music played to fit with whatever is going on at the moment. That music really enhanced the quality of scenes full of magic, and certain parts in the show where the girls were taking part in some sort of adventure. Ghibli comes to mind again because as I mentioned earlier just about every song in a majority of the films has a beautiful and relaxing musical score that helps intesfies viewers expiernce while watching their films. Flying Witch shares that simular trait. Voice actors were perhaps my favorite thing in the sound department. Second favorite, because you know, the opening song is #1. I think that the voice actors did a magnificent job delivering their lines along with perfectly executing the over the top reaction lines/responses. Each character had their own distinctive, unique, &  charming qualities to them. This makes the show both friendly and appealing to whomever decides to watch it. It\'s actually rather difficult for me to add anything of usefulness to the characters because I feel like my character section would turn out to be very opinionated. So with that, Let me add that the cast is memorable, their interactions with each other is always fun to watch.I cannot think of one thing I didn\'t enjoy about Flying witch. The comedy, jokes though light was often times funny and kept me going through the story. The plot  for different episodes always had something of interest and charm to deliver. Enough though I didn\'t feel like it had enough ""magic"" for a supernatural title, I was still impressed with everything that was presented in the end. I enjoyed getting time to discover new things with the main characters. Speaking of characters each of the main cast had  left me with good impressions of them. Expect for Kei.. he was boring as a character. Makoto, Akane Nao, MamaKuramoto and Chinatsu were the characters I enjoyed seeing the most in this series. Each of them had both fun and loving aspects to their own unique personalities which made the show all the more enjoyable for me. If I had to choose what was my favorite thing about flying witch was, I would probably say all of it. The show was so well written, displayed beautiful settings, and had the best music composed to complement that scenery. All of it, all of it put together made for a really amazing title!The only thing that stopped me from giving Flying Witch a 10/10 was that it lacks replay value. This is the type of title that I would probably own, but not open, nor watch. It would site in my Blu-Ray pile until I remembered that I bought it, despite loving it so much at the time. While most would consider this a polished diamond, I would consider it a hidden gem. It\'s only great if find it for yourselves that way you\'re not influenced by others (myself included) opinions about the show.  It makes the experiences of watching Flying Witch all the more valuable.  I had a really pleasant time watching this show  and I would highly recommend it to anyone who can handle slow-paced slice of life titles. enjoy what the story has to offer, which is one of the many things I appreciated about this title. What\'s fascinating about Flying witch is that the show has a distinct Studio Ghibli feel to it. Ghibli films were always full of imaginative worlds, full of wonder and exploration. More than likely you will read this in many other reviews, with that out the way, let\'s continue. Flying witch is the ""ideal"" example  of a show with the following genres\' ""supernatural"" and  ""slice of life"" done right.  The original author Chihiro Ishizuka must have had extensive knowledge and a lengthy amount of experience working on supernatural and slice of life titles. Because none of her work is listed anywhere, I\'m going to assume that she has worked on various titles in the past and went unaccredited. If this is truly her first work then I must say that the way the anime was able to portray her work was very well done. The show offers quite a lot of lighthearted comedy which is backed up with little things like odd reaction faces (which I always found hilarious,) silly little jokes and gestures, that sort of thing. More than likely you won\'t be laughing your ass off to much. As for the lasting appeal the story has to offer, I feel like the show didn\'t really stand out that. This is perhaps due to the releases of bigger titles like Kabeneri of the Iron Fortess, Re:, and Boku no Hero Academia. When you read the Synopsis of Flying witch, in comparison to the mainstream titles listed above I\'d say more viewers would watch those of witch. Last few things I\'m going to add is that Flying witch\'s story, while not as deep as I expected, does in fact have moments that tug at the heart-strings at bit. It\'s so well part together that I may or may not have had tears in my eyes...Flying witch delivered visually spectacular animation! Settings, objects, all boated very high quality animation that was both frequently & heavily used during various scenes. The beauty of the background settings, water, trees, grass plains, the quality was beautiful! I could see that the animators added a few CGI objects & textures to add a sense of realism to certain things, again, like water, clouds, and ground objects etc. Seeing the reflection of objects in the water, the rough detail added in the stone,simply brilliant. Yasuhiro Okumura and Yoshio okouchi went all out, in details of the objects like wooden floors, tables etc.  Character designs were pretty amazing too. I loved the silly reaction faces the Characters would make. This coupled along with the moods shown on their faces . J.C.Staff really outdid themselves when it came to adding details and such to characters faces and body movement. Expressing the way a characters facial features, body movement, and emotions when they  would react to supernatural moments had a somewhat overly dramatic, yet was almost human-like. I do not doubt that J.C. Staff brought in real people (most likely workers there) and used Motion capture suits to add more realism in the already majestic & magical fantasy world that is Flying Witch. Perhaps the only thing that bothered me is the reflection spots on the characters noses, just that little odd spot. With very little doubt, I can say proudly that Flying Witch had ""the best"" animation I\'ve seen so far this Spring season. Outstanding job done by J.C. Staff!I love the intro song, it really gets me excited to watch the show and singing & start clapping along with the song like a mentally disturbed man-child.  Every episode I would deliberately forget to skip the intro to sing along, as if I was a child watching Barney, or sesame street, or whatever children\'s programming is on now-a-days, damn if I know. The way that the intro song is performed reminds me of a late 90\'s and early 2000\'s catchy anime opening. To be more specific it kind of reminds me of Azumanga Daioh\'s intro, remember? Lu La lu La piano wa sekai no yumesaku nohara ni melody... Ready to sing along and then get right into the show and have a blast watching. The background music played in Flying witch was fantastic too. It\'s sort of like music played to fit with whatever is going on at the moment. That music really enhanced the quality of scenes full of magic, and certain parts in the show where the girls were taking part in some sort of adventure. Ghibli comes to mind again because as I mentioned earlier just about every song in a majority of the films has a beautiful and relaxing musical score that helps intesfies viewers expiernce while watching their films. Flying Witch shares that simular trait. Voice actors were perhaps my favorite thing in the sound department. Second favorite, because you know, the opening song is #1. I think that the voice actors did a magnificent job delivering their lines along with perfectly executing the over the top reaction lines/responses. Each character had their own distinctive, unique, &  charming qualities to them. This makes the show both friendly and appealing to whomever decides to watch it. It\'s actually rather difficult for me to add anything of usefulness to the characters because I feel like my character section would turn out to be very opinionated. So with that, Let me add that the cast is memorable, their interactions with each other is always fun to watch.I cannot think of one thing I didn\'t enjoy about Flying witch. The comedy, jokes though light was often times funny and kept me going through the story. The plot  for different episodes always had something of interest and charm to deliver. Enough though I didn\'t feel like it had enough ""magic"" for a supernatural title, I was still impressed with everything that was presented in the end. I enjoyed getting time to discover new things with the main characters. Speaking of characters each of the main cast had  left me with good impressions of them. Expect for Kei.. he was boring as a character. Makoto, Akane Nao, MamaKuramoto and Chinatsu were the characters I enjoyed seeing the most in this series. Each of them had both fun and loving aspects to their own unique personalities which made the show all the more enjoyable for me. If I had to choose what was my favorite thing about flying witch was, I would probably say all of it. The show was so well written, displayed beautiful settings, and had the best music composed to complement that scenery. All of it, all of it put together made for a really amazing title!The only thing that stopped me from giving Flying Witch a 10/10 was that it lacks replay value. This is the type of title that I would probably own, but not open, nor watch. It would site in my Blu-Ray pile until I remembered that I bought it, despite loving it so much at the time.

It makes the experiences of watching Flying Witch all the more valuable.  I had a really pleasant time watching this show  and I would highly recommend it to anyone who can handle slow-paced slice of life titles.', ""I'll start off by saying kudos, Flying Witch. It really took me by surprise how much I ended up enjoying this show.I pick up a number of shows per season, and Flying Witch was the one I knew least about. I got a very relaxed vibe from the first few episodes so I stuck with it. By the end of its run I was in awe how much this magical slice of life had won me over.The colorful cast of characters we meet over the course of Flying Witch is definitely the standout ingredient here. Your typical slice of life is bound to have 1...or 2 unbearable characters, but I honestly loved everyone we came across over this journey; from the various witches like accidental-furry Inukai and the adorable cafe assistant Anzu, to their familiars and the various creatures inhabiting the magical realm.The main cast is extremely strong as well. Our witch-in-training Makoto is a very endearing main character. The little quirks like her lack of directional awareness are the greatest combination of goofy and adorable. Makoto's host family is also top-notch (I never understood that, were they related? Or just like really close family-friends? eh, it doesn't really matter).Older brother Kei is Makoto's age and has to be praised for how chill he is. I've seriously never seen a dude in anime keep his cool so well around a house full of women. And there's no tacked on relationship between Kei and Makoto either. Their interactions throughout the show are extremely genuine and enjoyable. Everyone's interactions throughout this show are very well done, honestly. Even the parents, who lack the most screen time of the whole family have things to love about them. The mom is extremely mom-like, and the dad's heavy accent always gave me a good laugh, especially when his words flying right over Makoto's head.But I have to give the MVP to little sister Chinatsu. She was consistently the funniest and most adorable one of this show. Everything from the way she speaks, to her mannerisms and movements captured the essence of a young girl very well, and the magical atmosphere around her only heightened that great childlike sense of wonder.I could go on about these characters all day. I'd love to talk about Makoto's rambunctious older sister Akane, or their feline familiar's Chito and Kenny, but we'd be here all day.tl;dr: Characters - 10 outta 10.Next, we have to talk about the art. This is one of the most beautiful shows I've seen recently, and that's coming from someone who is constantly on the prowl for shows with amazing art. The backgrounds and still-shots are impeccable. From flowing rivers with cherry blossoms overhead, to detailed close-ups of plants and vegetables, Flying Witch has some astonishingly great visuals.Not only is the art and animation beautiful, but the designs of creatures and characters from the magic world are a sight to behold. There are some wondrously imaginative designs throughout this show. While I did sometimes get a Ghibli-esque feeling of astonishment as the various magical beings appeared on screen, my appreciation for these uniquely designed creatures was more comparable to something from Dark Souls or Bloodborne, games I highly value for their artistic direction and whimsical designs. The Harbinger of Spring's arrival in episode 2, and the Curtain of Night visiting the cafe in episode 8 both gave me that eerily creepy, yet beautiful feeling I get from Dark Souls enemies. Through and through, Flying Witch did not disappoint in the visual department.The OP and ED are also filled with vibrant colors and breathtaking landscapes. They're both surprisingly catchy too. The soundtrack is the sweet little cherry on top of this wonderful sundae. It's very subtle, but adds tremendously to the mood of each scene.There is no central plot or story to this show, but it really didn't need one. The lack of conflict made for a calm and relaxing ride the entire time. The small victories and natural progression is enough for the show to feel like its moving and that these characters are learning and experiencing new things.The show is called Flying Witch, but Makoto doesn't even do that much flying, on screen anyways. The show moves forward at such a great pace, yet goes nowhere at all. We go along with Makoto each day on a new adventure, and though it doesn't seem like much, we do get to see, bit by bit, how she is coming to understand the world of magic surrounding her.We see Makoto gently float into the air in the first episode, as the world of witches is revealed to Chinatsu for the first time. Makoto is still a novice with her broom, and we see her struggle with the way she uncomfortably rides it at first. But once episode 12 rolled by, and we drift with her over the peaceful city of Aomori, we see her riding her broom properly. There was no training montage, or countless escapades of Makoto clumsily falling off her broom. No, we see her naturally progress through the time she spent with the Kuramoto's, and as things come to a close, seeing Makoto ride her broom with such ease bears the fruits of her growth to us.I can't say it enough how much this show surprised me. I went in with zero expectations and left with something I'll hold as a magical experience of my own. Flying Witch came and went like that spring courier, filled with bewildering mystery, just to drift away after we've only scratched the surface. There's so much beauty and history left to explore in the world of Flying Witch, and I hope there will be more of it to come in the future. or 2 unbearable characters, but I honestly loved everyone we came across over this journey; from the various witches like accidental-furry Inukai and the adorable cafe assistant Anzu, to their familiars and the various creatures inhabiting the magical realm.The main cast is extremely strong as well.

Instead, the show is just a super-relaxing slice-of-life series with a touch of magic. If you\'ve watched titles such as Non Non Biyori then you can expect the same atmosphere from this show.[Story]Flying Witch is basically about a 15 year old witch named Makoto who moved into a rural town called Aomori to train as a professional witch. This is where the slice-of-life atmosphere begins.The atmosphere of the show is super-relaxing. It\'s like you want to move out of this god-forsaken noisy/polluted city and...just live the rest of your days in a (almost) pollution-free quiet rural environment. That\'s what I felt like when I was watching an episode of Flying Witch every week.I heard that the creators mentioned Flying Witch as an ""iyashikei"" show or in English, a ""healing"" anime show. It\'s purpose is to basically have a healing or soothing effect on the audience, such as myself. The creators were right! I\'m usually always busy on the weekends and having a show like Flying Witch calming down my stress level every week is a huge benefit for me. So not only does the show have a relaxing atmosphere but its ""iyashikei""effect completely works and is the only reason why some of you lots shouldn\'t kill yourself.Flying Witch is definitely not for everyone and I can tell based on a few reviews/opinions that I\'ve heard from other people. Nothing much happens throughout the show and the pacing is very slow. This might put off people who aren\'t a fan of slice-of-life genre and some might even find this show extremely boring. That\'s completely understandable because not everyone wants to watch a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode or drinking at a cafe for half of the episode. However to me, scenes such as the one I recently listed, weren\'t boring at all. They executed it in a way that made a scene like a character following a cat around the town for an entire episode not boring at all.One last aspect that I want to talk about is the comedy. They are well done. The comedy isn\'t forced and they just let the characters do their thing while at the same time, not overdoing it so the funny moments doesn\'t turn stale. For example, Makoto is somewhat of a klutz and has a bad sense of direction. The show used them to make hilarious moments but they didn\'t overdo it to the point where she would come off as a dumb character. The character dynamics are also great and they really know how to pair these characters up to create a bunch of cute, heart warming and/or hilarious moments. Also, I forgot to mention that Chinatsu\'s reactions in the first few episodes are hilarious. It\'s a kind of reaction that you\'d expect when seeing something so bizarre happening right in front of your eyes and just comes of as unbelievable at first.  What makes it even more hilarious is the fact that she\'s just a 9-year old kid and she\'s seeing something that she\'d never expect that she\'ll see.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9/10)Looking at Flying Witch\'s visuals and animation makes me somewhat excited at how future J.C Staff\'s anime will look like. This is actually their best visuals yet and it\'s way better than their previous works such as Index and Railgun. The visuals looks almost like real life at first look and the character designs are well done and it\'s not as bland as it used to be when comparing this show to their most recent work.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (10/10)The soundtrack definitely, and I mean DEFINITELY played a huge role on why the atmosphere is relaxing. The OSTs are phenomenal. Few examples are those slow piano bits or those slow guitar parts with a flute(?) playing at the same time. I really want to import those CD soundtracks. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""Sharanran"" by miwa feat. 96 Neko. The OP theme song is absolutely catchy and I have been listening to it for the past 12 weeks. Also, those claps though. The ED theme song is ""Nichijou no Mahou"" by Makoto and Chinatsu. Same case as the OP. I love the song and both voice actors have great singing voices. It\'s not something that I\'d expect from a slice-of-life show though but I guess it works.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (9/10)The characters are amazing. Each and every one of them has a set of unique personalities that makes them likable in their own ways. None of them came off as annoying. Especially, Chinatsu and Makoto who I thought was going to be very annoying at first but after watching the first episode, the way they acted was realistic and it blew my mind. I mean, it\'s rare to feature a cast of characters with realistic personalities instead of our usual ""Character has to be one of the ""dere"" traits"". For example, Chinatsu was acting like how a kid her age should act and it\'s hard to believe that Makoto is a 15 year old teenager considering the fact that she\'s super mature for her age and she likes to do adult stuff like farming, picking out plants and etc. Though, that doesn\'t mean Makoto acts exactly like an adult. Some of the things she does can come off as rather immature but that\'s normal since she\'s just a 15 year old teenager.Like I said above, the character dynamics are amazing. Pair one of these characters up with another character and you\'re going to get the same result regardless. A cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments. Chinatsu, Chito-san and Makoto does take the cake though whenever they\'re on screen.If you were to ask me like who\'s my favourite characters in the series then it would go something like this:Chinatsu > Chito-san > Akane > Makoto > Nao ..... and etc.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (9/10)I had low expectations from this series before it aired but after the first few episodes, I ended up enjoying this anime as much as I did watching Non Non Biyori and Non Non Biyori Repeat.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Out of 3 slice-of-life animes that I watched this season, Flying Witch is, no doubt, the best slice-of-life this season. The show\'s atmosphere is very relaxing and I\'m glad that magic isn\'t widely used in the series. It shows us magic is one of those mysterious elements in our world. The characters are amazing and the show just lets these characters do whatever it wants, which lead to a bunch of cute, heart-warming, smile-inducing, and funny moments.  Now, I\'m bummed out that I won\'t get my weekly doses of Flying Witch anymore to relieve my stress levels.[OVERALL]: (9/10)Pros:+The show\'s atmosphere is very relaxing+Relaxing pacing+Best animation J.C Staff has produced yet+Very relaxing soundtrack+Fun cast of charactersCons:- just live the rest of your days in a (almost) pollution-free quiet rural environment.

Also the plot is all over the place for an anime with a slice of life genre, it may have a comedy genre, but it wasn't even funny, so poor Flying witch has landed a 3 over 10 on my score card.Artwise, it was a plain as any anime without an ecchi genre, so it's a 5 over 10, don't expect any panchira, onsen fanservice nor a swimsuit fanservice.Sound, a  7 over 10 since the only consolation here was the opening theme, Sha, la,la, laaa.........it has that sweet feeling to it and it fits that main character as well.Character, it's a 5 over 10 for this category, since the character themselves were plain and boring as they can be.Enjoyment, since there isn't any scantly in this anime, it as decent as it can be, so 4 over 10..........But overall , I'm giving it a 3 since you're more likely to wonder as to why would they even make an anime this boring, than enjoy the show.

OUT"", 'Spring 2016 is a season full of highs and lows. I mostly dealt with the latter, making myself too submerged in the negativity. But here comes Flying Witch, a show that has become known by now as a healing experience. Watching the show never fails to improve my mood. Everything about it just screams positivity and sunshine from the calming atmosphere, joyful characters, and the laid-back story. The often atmospheric moments such as scenery shots accompanied with beautiful calming music is truly bliss. The story of a young witch training in unfamiliar yet welcoming territory reminds me a lot of Kiki’s Delivery Service, one of...my favourite Ghibli films. While it does not offer any actual plot, each episode offers an adventure that constantly introduces supernatural elements and fits them well into the lighthearted slice-of-life approach. It does bother me occasionally that no one really bats an eye that witches live on their daily lives without trying to conceal their identity. The show doesn’t really explain if witches are a norm in the society, or that the characters are just air-headed enough to not really care.One main gripe I have with the show is that it could have utilized its story better. The show presents Makoto as a witch in training but we don’t get any actual specifics regarding how the world of witches work aside from other witches that are introduced in the show such as her sister Akane. We get to see some witch stuff happening but it’s mostly shown as amusement though some fit in the “witch training” department. The show does try to blur the boundary between the two worlds but it would have been great if the show used more than one perspective.Overall, I recommend this show to slice-of-life fans who would like to see something atmospheric, calming, meditative, and positive. It doesn’t use its potential to the fullest but nevertheless a fleeting euphoric experience. my favourite Ghibli films.

Why? Well, read my review and you\'ll see why!Story: (8/10) Here\'s my take on the synopsis. Makoto, being the witch she is, the story practically revolves around her alongside her cousins, Kei and Chinatsu. With the start of each episode, as a witch in training, Makoto explores Aomori, Japan with her two cousins to expand her surroundings. By exploring together, the crew encounters many things. May it be companions, magical beings, creatures and places unperceivable from the human eye! With the help of her surroundings and as a...witch living with her two cousins in Aomori, Japan, her goal is to become a \'Flying Witch\' someday!Art: (8/10) The animation is fluid, and simply beautiful since this anime is made by the one and only and as expected J.C. Staff! The creators who made Toradora!, Kaichou wa-maid Sama! and many other notable anime! There\'s nothing more great you can get from them (well, there are a few exceptions), but can expect great art from this anime!Sound: (8/10): The music is one of it\'s strong points. Because, two words. It\'s. Relaxing. And. Soothing. That\'s five, nevermind. But anyways, for those who have watched Gin no Saji, the singer   \'miwa\' sings both the first opening of Gin no Saji and for the opening of this anime as well! I can appreciate that the opening, ending, and let\'s not forget the soundtrack matched the tone and quality of this anime!Character(s) (8/10): You may think the characters are dull, boring, and are lacking of variety through the first two episodes. But, the characters are as well one of its strong points. The reason why it\'s one of it\'s strong points because it strays away from all the other anime cliques we\'re all tired seeing of. Don\'t expect any dere(s), loli(s), shota(s) and etc. But do expect some quite interesting magical beings as well as adorable little creatures! As each and every character have a fun, original, unique personality to them!Enjoyment (10/10): By watching the first two episodes, my first impression of this anime was \'indifferent\'. I thought it would be some other anime slice-of-life cliche. As the third episode strolled along however, I found newfound respect for this anime. The fun adventures they have together, things they find that are unperceivable from the human eye, make me want to be part of their adventures! A fantasy you\'d want to indulged in. As that being the case, I can quite say that I\'d enjoyed this anime.Overall (9/10): Along with Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge, this anime stands as one of the best anime to watch of the Spring season. Each and every episode was filled with intriguing stories, I must say, to watch! I can say that the characters even though they were simple, were unique in a way! Art was presented greatly as expected from the J.C. Staff. Sound absolutely was relaxing and soothing at the most part! Most importantly I enjoyed this anime from beginning to end! If you want a relaxing and soothing anime to watch after watching a \'stressful\' anime, I definitely recommend this one! Expect yourself to smile and chuckle at each and ever episode!- I want a season two!RAW:8.79/10.00OVERALL:9.00/10.00 witch living with her two cousins in Aomori, Japan, her goal is to become a \'Flying Witch\' someday!Art: (8/10) The animation is fluid, and simply beautiful since this anime is made by the one and only and as expected J.C.

It\'s a quiet, laid-back experience that my wife and I enjoyed watching as a ""cool-down"" show after a day of work, or even simply after a more intense anime. It excels at creating a relaxing atmosphere in a way that feels more naturalistic than many other moe and/or healing shows. I find it somewhat hard to describe why this is without sounding silly. For example, men exist in this universe, and they just go about their normal lives. That sounds a little silly, but consider that some other shows in this genre feature no male characters of any importance,...which is fine, of course. But seeing big bro just kinda sitting around, shooting the shit with Makoto & pals, did a surprising amount for my immersion. Another thing that I found really elevated this show was its unwavering commitment to having no real plot. Again, maybe that sounds silly, but hear me out. Nothing happens in flying witch: there is no conflict, the characters have no real goals that they work towards, and while they do change and maybe even ""grow"" over the course of the series, any growth of character happens in subtle ways as a result of their interactions with the other characters. There are other shows that I have watched that try to create the same sort of relaxing atmosphere, but because the writer is afraid to commit 100%, they do have some sort of plot, albeit one with incredibly low stakes. An example that comes to mind is Koisuru Asteroid. You *could* also describe that show as having ""nothing happen""-- but it wouldn\'t be quite true. In that show, characters have clearly stated goals, there\'s a romantic subplot, and there\'s even some interpersonal drama. It\'s all incredibly low-stakes, to be sure, but the show still has the structure of a traditional story. This is where flying witch really shines, in my eyes. It fully rejects the trappings of traditional storytelling in favour of just showing us the lives of these characters in as natural a way as possible. The only other show that I can think of that does this with any degree of success is Non Non Biyori. Of course, I haven\'t watched every show, but of those that I have experienced, flying witch is truly deserving of praise. It might not seem like much at first glance, but the deep commitment to just nailing a particular, cozy vibe leads to a result that I think I can call a real work of art. which is fine, of course.

This show was a gem among stones this season, with nothing else keeping me particularly hyped for the next episode. Despite this show having a basic plot and absolutely no movement in the story (not physically anyway) this was absolutely one of my favourites this season.Story: 8Flying Witch is about, well, a flying witch. Her name is Kowata Makoto, she leaves the city of Yokohama to live with her relatives in the small town of Aomori to train as a witch. That\'s about it, each episode depicts the antics all...the characters get up to together, from simple activities like cooking at school or making a vegetable patch, to creating potions and discovering new spells accompanied by the other witch characters, Akane (Makoto\'s sister) and Inukai (Akane\'s friend). These activities were enjoyable to watch, there was no flashy spell-casting or explosions or intensity, just relaxing and calming to watch.Art: 8The setting of Aomori is absolutely beautiful, lush landscapes and aerial shots of the town and surrounding environment are frequently shown and used effectively to transition scenes and display the location of our characters next ""everyday"" event. The characters looked fairly stock-standard, you\'ve seen this style before, but it is nice to look at, they look like normal people. I think that\'s another reason this show feels so relaxing to watch, the characters don\'t look like they\'re out to fight evil or blow shit up, they lead normal lives and do normal stuff, simple and effective.Sound: 9While the OP of Flying Witch is questionable at times, personally I enjoyed it sometimes, didn\'t really at others. The ED was beautiful, really nice way to tie off each episode, especially as sometimes I didn\'t even feel it coming, and assumed it was part of the episode. On the topic of that, the soundtrack was incredible, so god damn tranquil. The quiet sounds of the mornings accompanied by soothing acoustic guitar sets each episode off with a fresh and warm feeling. The SFX used in comedic scenes also works perfectly, with a wonky, quirky tone to it that, in my opinion, emphasizes the scenes dialogue or topic effectively.Characters: 8You\'ve seen all these characters before, they are quite easy to predict and you can guess their next personality trait in an instant. But, this doesn\'t mean they don\'t keep the show going, Makoto is gorgeously bubbly and excited by such simple things you can\'t help but gush, Akane receives the label of crazy, adventurous, show-offy alcoholic big sister, but still adds important input to the dialogue and her storytelling adds an entire new level to the world that the show is set in. Kei and Chinatsu are both great characters, Kei being the understanding, kind and welcoming male lead, always willing to spark the events of the episode, and teach both the other characters and the viewer (well, me at the least) new things about the particular activity being done. Chinatsu is cute as fuck, and her excitement and open-mindedness makes every scene a happy one, her charm and bubbly personality surpass Makoto, and her clueless-ness at some points has a very distinct curiousity to it, pulling the viewer in and forming a surrogacy of inquisition.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed this show very much, I enjoyed watching these simple characters interact and grow deeper bonds with each other as they performed everyday tasks and just simply had innocent fun together. That\'s really all there is to it, this show has such a simple formula and executes it perfectly. Making such simple activities interesting to watch and difficult to stop.Overall: 8Basically if you\'ve got a cup of tea or something in your hands, lying in bed, or on the couch, relaxed in the early morning and you watch this, you\'ve pretty much got no excuse not to feel spectacularly tranquil and enlightened. If your looking for something light-hearted and easy to watch, I encourage you to watch Flying Witch.~Xeno156 the characters get up to together, from simple activities like cooking at school or making a vegetable patch, to creating potions and discovering new spells accompanied by the other witch characters, Akane (Makoto\'s sister) and Inukai (Akane\'s friend).

It\'s a far deviation away from a typical school SOL and (violent) adventure types,  I can\'t really put the right words together to describe it. I invite you to join the world of Flying witch because I do not think you will be disappointed. The character development is great and every second of every episode leaves you with a sense of fulfillment. Which is a very hard thing to have. The show is bright and airy and well...Just go watch it!Keep in mind with this though: Not a lot really happens...in this anime. There is no backbone story line guiding the plot in any one direction. It\'s just a hodgepodge of ""let\'s do this today!"" So if you\'re not really into that, this may not be your cup of tea. in this anime.

So if you\'re not really into that, this may not be your cup of tea.', ""Flying Witch has next to no conflict yet manages to remain engaging through its atmosphere, picturesque scenery, and soothing soundtrack. The show places utmost attention on the mundane to provide a sense of beauty for the ordinary that is easy to miss in real life.  By basing some of its locations on real life settings, it further adds to its realism. Tasks such as gardening and cooking are ones that Flying Witch tackles while (hopefully)  retaining the vewer's interest through its atmosphere and grounded character interactions. The characters in Flying Witch are  less exaggerated than in some other slice of life series,...even amidst its use of magic. Some of the show's comedy is effective precisely because it juxtaposes the mundane attitudes of its characters with the magical scenarios at play. The show effectively incorporates  magical realism by  treating magic and ordinary reality as essentially equivalent, leading to magic appearing to be ordinary and the ordinary appearing to be magical.Rather than bouts of spectacle, the show showcases tasks such as microwaving onions and thinning flowers from an apple tree for half an episode. However, the show nails the interactions enough to retain engagement. Akane's playfulness coupled with Makoto's carelessness enables entertaining antics when the former is teaching the latter magic. Chinatsu's childlike and organic reactions to every situation are the most potent in the entire series, and Kei's reserved nature helps ground every event into a state of peace rather than conflict.  The characters mostly behave in an ordinary and organic manner, which is appropriate for such a series. There is an element of realism to the blandness of the characters, as it reflects how uninteresting  real life individuals could appear to be in ordinary scenarios. One may argue that the lack of conflict  in the series is forced, but there can be many time-spans in real life where little to no conflict occurs.Final Verdict:Flying Witch is a soothing series that achieves its goals. The visuals, soundtrack, character interactions, and attention to a detailed setting all work to enhance the experience. For those generally interested in Iyashikei series may find Flying Witch to be worth watching. even amidst its use of magic.

Something about it enables me to relax and take in a show with little to no effort while still enjoying it. What\'s more is we get witches and the like added to the mix. Normally, when it comes to having this element in a series, it mostly involves shounen battle sequences, good versus evil and whatnot. Here, we just have witches (the rest mostly being spirits of nature) living amongst...humans with no conflict. Rarely do we see this ever happen, and I\'m glad a series like this exists.What also makes this entertaining is the characters. They\'re all likable and have some good interactions with each other. From the timing of their dialogue to their amusing expressions, it\'s hard not to smile when you see these characters appear.I think what makes this a good series set in the ""countryside"" is how the animation depicts the scenery. So much detail is put into the houses and the nature that it looks realistic. Also, the character designs are very appealing and cute.Don\'t think that I dislike anything action-oriented or shows that are strictly shounen, far from it. It\'s just, you do see a lot of them with each season, and it can get a little tiresome. Which is why shows like Flying Witch allow me to take a breather.

It follows the story of Kowata Makoto who's a witch in training. All of the episodes cover the everyday life of this girl and her family and friends.What i like about Flying Witch in general is how relaxing it is. Now it is just a typical slice of life anime at first glance but each episode you start to enjoy it more and more until you can't get enough.What makes this a masterpiece is the combination of charming characters, gorgeous art, and over the...top calming music. All of these just compliment each other so well.From this point on there's some really minor spoilers so keep in mind. REALLY minor.[Story] (This part have some minor spoilers, you can skip this.)Even though there's really not much into the story in Flying Witch, or slice of life anime in general. But Flying Witch just makes the simplest and boring stuff interesting. What i noticed while watching Flying Witch is how this anime has ZERO drama. There's absolutely no drama, everyone's so chill all the time. There were plots where i thought there would be some drama but no they just play it off and it turned into a funny scene and i laughed my ass off. By the way, yeah this anime is really funny. Found myself can't stop laughing at times.[Art]The art is well typical J.C Studio style, of course with it's own characteristics for Flying Witch. What makes this special is just how beautiful it is. Especially the green scenery and everything. Deserve a solid 9.[Music]Now the music in this anime is just extremely calming and just gives off that country side feel, kind of like harvest moon/stardew valley (game) vibe. They fit in the anime so well. This whole anime reminds me of stardew valley, how they pick up wild plants in the side of the street and cooks them, just like in the game. Anyway i'm sidetracking, the music gets a 10 from me.[Characters]The characters can be described as a few words: Charming, happy, cheerful, silly, funny, chill,cute and more. They are absolutely no antagonist in the anime. Don't forget about the familiars in the anime, they are characters too. My favorite is Chito the black cat. SO CUTE. The facial expression in this anime are hilarious af.[Enjoyment]Definitely was not bored while watching any of the episodes. They 20 mins episode felt like 5 mins, they went by so quick. Really enjoyed it.[Overall]This was one of the best slice of life anime's i've watched. Of course it's not for everyone, maybe someone find it boring or uninteresting but it's definitely good for me. If you find it boring the first few episodes, don't stop watching. You'll fall in love later. Might even get a S2 since there's still manga material to be covered.That's it from me, this is just my opinion, if yours is different well no problem. Have a good one. top calming music.

If you find it boring the first few episodes, don't stop watching. You'll fall in love later. Might even get a S2 since there's still manga material to be covered.That's it from me, this is just my opinion, if yours is different well no problem. Have a good one."", 'Shalalala~!!!...flying witch is one of the best healing anime this Spring 2016.flying witch\'s plot is looking at the daily lives of a witch living in the rural side with her relatives and this anime looks at both sides of both rural farming and magic.The characters aren\'t anything new as the setting of the rural town to the anime being a slice of life anime, the characters are just as laxxing as the genre flying witch is in, however there were two characters that breaks this, that being ever-enthusiastic Chinatsu Kuramoto voiced by Eri Suzuki, the younger sister of Kei, relatives to Makoto and Makoto\'s free...spirited older sister Akane Kowata voiced by Kana Aoi, Akane brings in some flair and the magical side to flying witch and just her nonchalantly coming in and feels like a firework just appears, Chinatsu on the other side feels like an audience surrogate to this anime as she looks at both sides of this anime\'s setting of the magical witchcraft side and the rural side and really Chinatsu just made this anime what it is.

It has magic, that\'s sure, but it\'s different, more classic and, in some ways, more deep.Story: 6Why only 6? Because that series doesn\'t have a story, and doesn\'t need it, in my humble opinion.The events of the various episodes are well managed, so the time will flow easily while watching.Art: 7What can i say...the ""visual"" part of the anime is not memorable, but it fits perfectly the pace...and the atmosphere of the series, and for me that\'s the most important thing.Sound: 8Nice voice acting and pretty op/ed. The main dish, though, is the OST; it harmonize with sceneries, moods and situations, giving a push on the emotions that the spectator feels.Character: 7I have to say it, as the story doesn\'t exist, even the characters aren\'t so original or deep, or have some sort of development trough the series...but they work, and the work pretty well.With so many anime out there i think that\'s nearly absurd to pretend originality everywhere, so i don\'t give much weight to that point in my evaluation.Enjoyment: 9This series was a fresh wind that have traveled trough seasons, bringing along the scent of everything that has encountered, and the results it\'s something great.It\'s a slice of life, the comedy part is not so funny, the ""witch magic"" appears maybe one time for episode, but the real magic is everywhere. If I have to analize every single element the rate will not be so high, but the show have a strange sort of alchemy that it was able to put all the parts in a pot, cook them at low fire and take out the best from all.Overall: 8 well deserved! and the atmosphere of the series, and for me that\'s the most important thing.Sound: 8Nice voice acting and pretty op/ed.

That said, this doesn’t mean that Flying Witch is a bad or uninteresting series. If there was one word I would use to sum up Flying Witch, it would be “easygoing”. This is one of the most relaxing anime in a long time, a simple show about simple pleasures.Each episode of the show is a small slice of the life of Makoto, a girl who moves to live with her extended family to finish school while also completing...her training to become a full-fledged witch. Her magic skills still need a great deal of work, but her charming (if slightly odd) personality endears her to those she meets and she lives a life of simple pleasures and adventures. This is an anime without any major conflicts, antagonists, or drama. The cast of characters-which includes her mortal cousins completely new to witchcraft, her supernatural neighbors and friends, and her easygoing but talented older sister- is enjoyable, and the experiences that Makoto and those around her go through are refreshingly uncomplicated and full of charm. Each week reveals a bit more about the rituals and lives of witches, but the main focus is not the witchcraft or magic itself, but rather how magic is all around us and the way witches and other beings use it in their everyday lives. It is definitely a slice-of-life show more than a show focusing on fantasy or magic, and the magical aspect is treated as part of Makoto’s normal daily life.+Charming cast of characters+Relaxing atmosphere+Simple plots made interesting-Not much character development-Not for those expecting deep storyOverall, the show is sweet and simple with a touch of comedy.

Flying Witch is the kind of show that I don't particularly want to watch at first glance, but I always find the urge to watch it whenever I noticed that the new episode comes out.The story is as what it sounds like. A witch comes to town, people get shocked, people get over it, then magical stuff happened. It's not as disastrous as monster comes in every now and then, but not as school life...as it can be. In fact, while they are still in school, many episodes were not school related. The pacing is quite suitable, they don't rush for progression (since slice-of-life usually are not about progressing the plot), but keep everything in a row so that you remember things.The art is beautiful. I enjoy watching the scenery whenever I find the need to look away, and it does not disappoint most of the time (if not all the time).The sound is quite memorable. I find myself sitting through the OP most of the time, because it's quite the earworm. The background music played whenever they are doing things and not talking, is also quite suitable. It's quite fresh since the shows I watched are mostly fast-paced fighting shonen anime, and I find it quite relaxing to just sit back and relax.The character design was...basic? I do enjoy they being quite naturally coloured (and not anime-coded colour). The non-human part also show quite a bit of work, which is all beautiful. The character introduced was not overwhelmingly a lot (as per slice-of-life), and their personality don't overlap but rather complement each other. So it showed a good chemistry between their relationship and I enjoyed them interacting with each other, rather than just the main lead interacting with one at a time. However, I find Kei's role being not very obvious, as he does not show as much screentime as the others, while being like the only male main character (not counting non human male characters). Ah well, it's called Flying Witch for a reason.I had to say, I enjoyed this show quite a bit. While I don't necessarily love the show, I would consider re-watching an episode or two when I'm down just to cheer me up enough to continue with my miserable life.

Seeing them integrate & understanding magic from Makoto is awesome. It is also funny to see more of the magical world that Makoto was brought up in by her parents. It's also a bonus to meet various characters in the magical world & seeing how they balance their lives in reality.CHARACTERS (7/10):Makoto is 15 year old witch who has moved to her cousins' place. She needs to work on flying skills. Her familiar is Chito. She is a kind, soft-spoken witch that is friendly with...everyone she meets. Makoto is constantly learning about magic and improving her sense of direction.Kei is a cousin of Makoto and older brother of Chinatsu. He is the same age as Makoto and is always helping her out. Kei is also afraid of ghost.Chinatsu is a young girl who was first skeptical about magic but is now amazed. Ever since Makoto's arrival, Chinatsu aspires to be like her and learn magic. She is also very helpful with her family and curious about various characters in the magical world.OVERALL ENJOYMENT (7/10):I usually love watching slice of life and this anime is no exception (obviously). It's great to see the journey of Makoto as a young witch while growing up as a regular teenager. This anime is very similar to Studio Ghibli's film -- Kiki's Delivery Service. & for those who have seen the film… you will see why. Plus, the only thing I would like this anime to improve on is to have more variety of the settings (other than the countryside). Since Makoto is able to fly on her broom.

In this anime we watch the daily life of Makoto, her relatives and their friends, which is a normal life in the countryside. Well, except that there are witches, ghosts and stuff like that. In the ""healing"" section, Flying Witch does an amazing job. There are no conflicts or characters acting mean (Akane plays some pranks, but they are never going overboard or anything) and we witness people enjoying their lives and having fun. The magical part is always present and keeps getting...more interesting as the show goes on, though I personally would have wished for a little more of it in the first half.9/10Art:Okay, yes, the bus in episode one looked bad. BUT! later we get to see a CGI whale that looks amazing, which makes me believe they were under time constraints for the first episode. Everything else is also very beautiful to look at. It is not overly colorful most of the time (compared to Anne Happy for example), but the countryside setting is used well to show of the wonderful nature. The character design was pretty good too, slightly moe but not too much.9/10Sound:The opening is fun and will be stuck in your head for a couple of hours (or more), which is always a good thing. The ending is nothing special, but well made. People have criticized Shinsuke Sugawara (voice of Kei) for the impression he left in episode one, but he got better and better as the show went on, becoming quite good. That\'s astounding for someone in his VERY FIRST seiyuu role. Everybody else did a good job as well, special mention goes out to the voices of Akane and Chinatsu.8/10Characters:I don\'t think I have ever seen an anime before where every single character was so incredibly likeable. They are all very fun people to be around and they are so nice! There is not a single bad thing I can point out.10/10Enjoyment:Watching Flying Witch was so much fun, that realizing that it\'s over now makes me sad for real. Provided you like Iyashikei (generally called relaxing or healing anime), I highly recommend this anime to you. It could very well be the epitome of its genre and I really, really hope there will be a second season one day.10/10Overall:9.2/10 more interesting as the show goes on, though I personally would have wished for a little more of it in the first half.9/10Art:Okay, yes, the bus in episode one looked bad.

Kiki's Delivery Service, Shuumatsu no Izetta & El Cazador de la Bruja were all great or better. This time around, we're looking at Flying Witch. This one is based off of a manga by Ishizuka Chihiro wth the anime being handled by JC Staff. Yes, the same studio as Final Fantasy: Unlimited, Azumanga Daioh, Honey and Clover, & Potemayo. We've looked at their works a lot and with widely varying degrees of quality. Let's see where this one falls.Story:We open with our heroine, Makoto, moving in with some relatives so that...she can finish High school and be semi-independent like a good witch. From there we basically follow her as she spends time with friends & relatives while meeting supernatural beings and doing witch things. Basically, it's a slice of life with the twist being that it's about a witch.I don't really have any issues with the series in terms of narrative. Yeah, the story is very minimal with the various episodes all focusing on different slice of life situations that may not be connected to one another, but that's not really a problem. There are plenty of slice of life series like that and this one uses that format very well.Flying Witch is very firmly an iyashikei series. If you aren't familiar with the term, it basically refers to an anime or manga that's designed around soothing the audience and making them feel good. The main tool it employs to gain this effect is making the supernatural elements highly comforting and whimsical. Whether it's a harbinger who just wants to say hello, an anthropomorphic witch who's really friendly and adorable, a shy ghost who just wants to serve tasty pastries or some other such thing, they're all designed around instilling a sense of delight. And because the supernatural elements are so integral to making the series enjoyable, they never seem gimmicky or pointless even though what they're being used for equates to faffing about. I also appreciate the way it takes the piss out of certain tropes like the “magical being who's supposed to be keeping their abilities a secret but everyone knows anyway.”Characters:When you have a light, fluffy series one of the things you absolutely need to go with it are endearing characters. Fortunately, that's another element that Flying Witch absolutely nails. The characters have eccentricities, but they aren't heavily exaggerated like they are in some comedies. Which makes them entertaining and fun while also preventing them getting overbearing. It also manages to have a child character who acts like a child, isn't annoying and is actually really charming. Which is not easy to do. And this is coming from someone who doesn't care for children in general. The characters also possess enough verisimilitude that they feel, largely, like real people. The only way they really stretch believability is that they're too good natured and you don't encounter many people with that level of goodness. Much less an entire world where it's everybody. But I can't complain about that since it's part of what makes it excel as an iyashikei series.Art:Flying Witch has, I must say, superb artwork. It's not just that the backgrounds and character designs are really well done, although that helps. It's the entire supernatural aesthetic. The creatures they encounter are creative and interesting looking. The whale in particular stands out but there are a lot of other examples. The magic isn't flashy, but the more subdued use of it does work better for the relaxing atmosphere. So, good decision there.Sound:The performances in this are really good. And, for most of the main actors, this is my first time hearing them give really strong performances. Shinoda Minami, Suzuki Eri, Sugawara Shinsuke & Aoi Kana included. I've heard Mikami Shiori and some of the minor characters in good anime before this one but most of the main cast don't have many credits which makes their performances all the more impressive. Dewa Yoshiaki's soundtrack complements the soothing atmosphere perfectly. I'll give him full credit on that one.Ho-yay:There's a bit. Inukai and Akane interact as though they're one confession away from ripping each other's clothes off and just going at it. Akane even describes Inukai as being too cute. There are also some interactions betwixt Makoto and Nao that make it seem like Makoto has more than a little crush.Final Thoughts:If you're looking for something whimsical and endearing that'll soothe you, Flying Witch fits the bill damn near perfectly. If, on the other hand, you want something with an involved narrative and a lot of conflict, it's not going to be that. Ultimately, I really enjoyed watching it and would go so far as to say it's among the best iyashikei works I've seen. My final rating is going to be a 9/10.

The plot is really simple, but because the characters are likable and the art is calming, it's still an very enjoyable show to watch. It has a few references inside, which is always nice, but there was one in particular that pretty much made me fall out of my chair of amusement. The humor is good and it overall is just a very gentle and kind show. It's a perfect summer anime. "", 'Ahhh! That’s the sound of wild mandrake root makes when pulled out of the ground. Flying Witch, is special a soothing anime one to calm the heart and not provoke to much though, just enjoy the show for what it is, a SoL with small hints of supernatural. Interactions between characters’ flow naturally, with cute moments between one another. Hints of fond moments between supernatural elements such as Ghosts, Spirits, Mythical creatures and so forth.Our journey begins with a cat Chito and high school girl Kowato Makoto moving to Aomori, Japan. Makoto is newly transferred witch, which is atrocious when it comes to directions perhaps...not even able to tell left from right. Anyhow she’s a witch that moves in with Kei Kuramoto, Makoto second cousin along with his younger sister Chinatsu Kuramoto.

I can't recall exactly the shows, But I've had some shows that kind of feel the same or are alike and they're just not that great.The Slice of Life and Magic is a nice pair up in this. It's honestly nice and calming with no threat about anything. It honestly baffles me that I never once found myself bored with this show. Normally, These shows can barely hold my attention for long.I do find it kind of disappointing that there is little in the ways of magic happening.  We see very little of anything happening. I do also...wish that Makoto ( MC ) Was smarter in the knowledge of magic.The characters are the best.-Chinatsu Is a surprisingly adorable girl that I don't find annoying. Normally I can't stand kids with most of them being boy characters. Girls tend to be less annoying but still are usually badly done.-Makoto's is a pretty awesome MC. She is an always adorable girl and can be very naive about things that just makes her all the more entertaining. I really like both Makoto and Nao. They are pretty good friends together and I love how Nao is always trying to keep up with Makato.  Even though there isn't romance. I did notice some slight Yuri cues, I don't know if it was intentional. But both Nao and Makoto would make a perfect ship.-Nao is fun to have on the screen whenever she's on tv. The only issue is that we barely see her. I like her design and is my 2nd or 3rd favorite of the show. Again, The friendship between both her and Makoto is pretty good. I would ship them if this was the type of show.-Akane is a pretty good tomboyish character that I like. I'd say her design is up there fighting for my favorite character design of the show. I'd say she is my 2nd or 1st favorite. I like both Nao's and Makoto's friendship a good amount. But I'd defiantly say I adore the friendship between Akane and Inukai. With Akane always causing trouble for Inukai and Inukai and Akane seems to be more natural friends. I of course ship the both of them and feel that in the actual show, That there is some actual Yuri tension between them.-Inukai I like. It's kind of interesting how due to her mistake, She is for the foreseeable stuck in a Beastkin type form of a Dog ( She looks more like a fox to me) It's kind of an adorable design. Just like I said to Akane description, The friendship is my favorite. I also obviously ship the two of them.I love this show and hope we get more in the future. I'm not putting my hopes on it.

At the time of writing, this is possibly the most underrated show I\'ve come across on MAL.I see people describe Flying Witch as a healing anime. Sure; semantics aside, it\'s a slice of life anime with a light-hearted feeling, and I would say I haven\'t enjoyed a show of this style this much since K-On. You know when you want to just sit down and put something on for an episode or two before bed? That\'s Flying Witch. It\'s the genuine characters and their interactions that make...you want to watch more.The pace is slow but not droll. It keeps you amused without really needing a ""raise-the-stakes"" mentality. From start to finish it feels very episodic (though due to characters introduced and few total episodes etc... you can\'t really watch it out of order). But not much is really accomplished, and that\'s fine. That\'s what you\'re watching for. Most episodes introduce a character that may pop up later, but for that episode you just get to enjoy the mystery of finding out who that person is and their story.What I do like is how natural the characters and their interactions feel. There\'s just a tale on display that you get whisked along for, and you can really stop at any time. All I\'m saying is... try it out.

I mean, actually just sitting through a 12 episode series about a person going through their mundane life is absolutely boring, and not exactly something that you should try to achieve in a slice of life. Sure, it can be about someone\'s mundane life, but it\'s got to be enjoyable in some way shape or form, whether it be characters, the story/setting, or the dialogue. Either way, a slice of life is not successful because...it\'s actually just some random person\'s day to day life.Flying witch is basically this. Non non biyori, Nichijou, Miname ke, even lucky star or something are good because they have ""normal,"" yet fun characters. Slice of life is obviously held up by their well made characters. Whether it be dialogue, relationships, or drama, characters play a pivotal role in whether or not a slice of life is well made. Those shows I mentioned above had great characters. I found them funny, interesting, or just relaxing to watch.Flying witch, on the other hand, is basically a bunch of side characters talking to each other, and you start wondering where the main character is. The fact that the traits of the main character can be summarized by ""eccentric,"" and ""bad sense of direction"" even by episode 5-6, you\'ve got a problem. The fact that the same dialogue or scenario about these two traits happening with the main character, only in slightly different setting is just boring and predictable. Everything about the dialogue in this show is dead. No liveliness at all. It just feels like it\'s a script that people are reading off of.Non non biyori also makes use of the setting much more than Flying witch ever did.  They both feature a typical countryside town, yet the characters in Non non biyori actually interact and mesh with the setting extremely well. They do things that can only be done in the countryside, and the animation also has a lot of extremely vibrant scenes, attention to detail, and backgrounds dedicated to the setting. It\'s a great example of how a simple cast of characters can be elevated due to the well made setting and dialogueAs for Flying Witch, the setting is tossed aside. In fact, the episode settings and dialogue can actually taking place in any suburban or urban area. Like I said before, dialogue is extremely boring and uninteresting, and the author takes liberties in the character\'s actions so that the show can seem less boring.That\'s basically what Flying Witch is trying to do: seem more interesting than it actually looks. ""Wow, my story is very bland, and my characters are also quite the boring lot, how about we make the main character a witch? Haha, that will make my story good."" That\'s basically what I think the author was trying to go for. Magic and witches are only talked about when there\'s another witch other than the main character in the scene. It\'s like there\'s a slice of life portion of the story, and then the witch/magic part of the story. They don\'t work in tandem, and mix like oil and water. There isn\'t any attempt to incorporate magic into everyday life, but rather, it\'s just a quirk of the main character. Instead, it\'s just boring slice of life scenarios. Then, when that becomes boring, as it surely does, then stuff about witches and magic come up again to keep your attention. Rinse and repeat. Unfortunate that instead of making a story about a main character using magic in their everyday life, it\'s about a witch that doesn\'t use magic unless the story permits, thus essentially making most of the episodes completely unrelated to her witch identity, which is pretty stupid when it\'s an integral part of the plot.All in all, this show is a dime in a dozen  put in with all the other failures of slice of life shows. it\'s actually just some random person\'s day to day life.Flying witch is basically this.

It does indeed have magic for it contained magical characters like witches and fortune tellers and such.

I like every single anime that is having realistic personalities. all of the reaction are pretty realistic that i somehow connected and relatable to their emotions and reactions if i ever encounter the scenario. Makoto is the best girl out of all Slice-of-life anime i ever watch.And, all of the clothes she used (well, all of the characters) is respectable and not sexy neither too shorts. i really love her school uniform with that big legging socks(?). i can\'t ever hardly think even just a little about sexiness in these anime because how well their clothes are.can we just, copy these style of fashion into every anime please? so i can watch it without awkward panty shot or awkward camera boobs/butt shots? because i watch for the plots. and those shots are unnecessary.Enjoyment is 11/10:Like come on. when i found out about this anime from a clip in youtube, i was a bit confuse at same time have a string that pulling me to ""watch this!"" anime. so i decide to take a shot and my god, it is very enjoyable. you can watch it with whole family without having any awkward conversation or awkward scenarios. and plus, no such a thing called emotional ride in this anime. it is literally flat out relaxing and happy anime.Note to all new watchers: forget everything you think about and just enjoy the episodes.

The magic element really sets this show apart though - there's no war going on, the protagonist isn't on some long-winded quest or anything. Instead, it's about a young girl and her training as a witch. Simple, but it works.The Art - Watching...the show has a sort of calming effect; there's no flashy colours or effects. You're instead given a beautifully gentle looking show that really matches the anime's atmosphere.The Sound - The OP and ED are both cute and match the tone of the show pretty well, much like the background music. Whilst the tracks aren't memorable, they add to the calming effect of the show, and help to immerse you into Makoto's world.The Characters - Every single character has their own unique charms and quirks. Makoto's kind yet eccentric personality, Chinatsu's random one liners, and even Kei's subdued personality really make the show what it is. Akane will always keep you coming back as well.Enjoyment - Flying Witch was one of those shows that I underestimated; I didn't really pay that much attention when I watched the first few episodes, but when I restarted it, I realised when a gem it was.

Wrap up in your blanket, grab something warm to drink, and enjoy this serene look at small city living in Japan.Don\'t expect crazy mahou shoujo super powers or power-up battles. The ""witch"" elements are quite tame and are mostly designed as a way to generate the plot or dialogue of each episode. Makoto and her sister are inspired by classic European witch mythology with an interesting fusion of Japanese culture. Surprisingly, this all blends seamlessly with the rural-ish setting of the series.The show is competently executed in all aspects. I have...no complaints other than perhaps it simply followed a tried and true path and didn\'t push any artistic boundaries or attempt anything particularly stunning. Given the point of the show, I really don\'t hold that against it.This is an episodic show, so if you have a requirement for your anime to have a overarching story arc you won\'t find it here. I generally prefer series that have a story, but I would encourage people like me to give this show a try if you\'re looking for something lighthearted and relaxing.Overall: 8/10. Solid execution in every way. This gets an extra point purely on how cozy it is. It was an excellent stress reliever.(Side note: I\'m a beginner closing on intermediate level Japanese learner. I found this show very useful for practicing my Japanese because it fills one of the more uncommon niches in anime--a slice of life focused on the interactions of a family unit.

I am usually the kind of viewer that comes into most anime (hyped or sidelined) with minimal expectations and I was not disappointed at all with this one.The story is nonexistent but it's mainly about a witch who moves in with her cousins and continues to live a normal...life while studying magic.  They go on small adventures (and get's lost in them sometimes) and approach the small things in life while laying in some comedic moments using the magical themes.  Flying Witch does a very good job at keeping its composure and the atmosphere is constantly slow yet calming.  Where the show excelled at was using the atmosphere it gave as some form of indentification like it knew what it wanted to be, what it wanted to achieve, and that the makers of the show will not be attempt to go further and will lose sight becoming something it's not.  It remains simple throughout but manages to present it's moments of beauty very quietly with a sense of wonder.  It also presented a proper balance between the average slice of life-life and the fantasy aspects of being a witch.The characters are nothing complex or nothing the most fascinating.  But that beats being annoying, loud, and having high-pitched voices forcing their cuteness on the viewers since they are unconfident on what the anime has to offer.  The cast keeps things very simple and interacts with each other staying true to themselves like they are real people.  The characters ranged from interesting, subtle, humorous, and just overall held up the happy mood.I found the artstyle beautiful and the animation was solid throughout.  The cinematography was also excellent making the most out of what it could display with its multiple scenes of nature and the countryside environment.  The opening is nothing much but I didn't feel like skipping over that at all.The show does not try to be flashy but it's just normal.  Sometimes that's all an anime needs to be for somebody to enjoy it without having to watch through the parts of anime they hate such as troupes and cliches.  If you like slow, nature-focused slice of life like Non Non Biyori, you should totally give this a checkout.  Flying Witch gets a thumbs up and a 7/10. life while studying magic.

This anime is funny, healing and really worth the time if you are a fan of slice of life.Watching this is very soothing, just helps you relax from time to time. The visuals are also very suitable for slice of life anime such as this.Characters are also quite funny and very heartwarming.This is not comparable with slice of life anime like non non biyori which is much better, this has more of ""harry potter"" element and has much knowledge regarding witch craft....The whale island is much amazing as well, reminded me of rune factory game from Nintendo Wii, and has many enjoyable fantasy elements. Recommended for those who enjoy both the slice of life and fantasy elements.I enjoyed the series very much and would give 8/10 overall.

Often in Japan, someone who is ""weird"" or ""different"" is quickly turned into a target for bullying and isolation. Flying Witch does neither with its witchcraft: it\'s not a massively powerful set of abilities like in countless magical girl shows or The Ancient Magus Bride, and the community in this little corner of Aomori is surprisingly accepting of these...quirky young women who can fly on brooms. Witches in this world try their best to do good with their abilities, which is cool because it would quickly become a very different anime otherwise.I\'m not 100% familiar with Wiccan customs and rituals, but it seems to me that the original artist and the anime production crew did their homework here (or at least, made it look convincing). The only category of ritual the show doesn\'t delve into is curses and hexes, which is good because, again, seeing one performed might transform the show into something else.The show does a great job of capturing the idyllic beauty of rural Japan. Well, not quite as rural as Non Non Biyori, but you get to see nature much more than in metropolitan Tokyo or Osaka (yes, I know, there\'s places like Ueno Park and the Imperial palace, but those are heavily managed).This cast is very well-written and directed. Makoto is a sweet yet slightly clumsy heroine, Chinatsu can light up anyone\'s day, Kei is a fantastic foil to both (with good deadpan lines), Akane is great comic relief fodder, Nao and Inukai are great tsukkomi girls, and the parents are cool with just about anything. Even the cats provide good comedy in the style of R2-D2 (and I just learned Ai Kayano voiced Chito, so that\'s cool).Finally, the music. For the most part it\'s either synth with a really good instrument set or studio musicians, and the one recurring theme is Makoto\'s. One track uses woodwinds to gently lead up to the introduction of Makoto floating on her new broom, another uses pizzicato strings to accompany a humorous vignette. The opening theme is cheerful and fun, though for some reason the characters are leading an odd syncopated clapping in the refrain.This series is great if you want to kick back and watch happy anime. quirky young women who can fly on brooms.

Nothing will ever come close to how chill and lovely this anime is. Not only is it subtle in it's context, the way the characters talk and interact is very smooth and quite and natural. The comedy is even before , nothing feels forced .. and Alot of times you can't really expect it , it doesn't give you much space to think but rather immerses you In the world.. the ost was lovely and perfectly used. You get to learn a few good things as it carries silently a few hidden messages about how to accept others no...matter how different they are.if you have the smallest bone for a slice of life, healing or comedy animes then this is definitely a must matter how different they are.if you have the smallest bone for a slice of life, healing or comedy animes then this is definitely a must"", 'In the enchanting land of Aomori, the vibrant world of ""The Flying Witch"" unfolds. The story follows Kowata Makoto, a studious 1st year girl with dark hair, green eyes, size 7 1/2 shoes, and her friends and family Akane, Shina Anzu, Ishiwatari Nao, Kuramoto Chinatsu, Kuramoto Kei, Chito, Kenny, and Inukai. They embark on adventures of their daily lives. The group of friends encounter normal stuff in each episode, to facing magical creatures, and learning life lessons. As the episode navigate, their bond grow more and more stronger. Introduces the viewers to the power of comfiness. Each episode also represents the element loyalty, laughter, generosity,...and kindness perfectly. In my honest opinion, this feels like an ASMR but in anime form. Makes you cozy, relaxing bgm, seiyuu soothing voice, you name everything to make a good ASMR.I would say the story is over all a 10 out of 10. The theme and message was great. The general plot was as nuanced as I would like it to be. And admittedly they were really funny and wholesome. Very very light story to watch. Like if you watch this with a 5 year old children, they would understand it. Like Shinchan for example. Every episode is filled to the brim with happy go around vibe. Nobody is bad, no villain, even if they have the power to be a good villain. Love this kind of story because it reminds me about all the good people in this world. Sure real life sucks, but hey there\'s also a lot of people that\'s nice too.The art was definitely beautiful. Now I may be a bit biased from the fact that they drew all the characters with such pretty face that I sometimes got so mesmerized, but from the transition scenes, I could tell that the backgrounds were drawn nice as well. The art style is in match with the comfy and relaxing feeling this anime bring to me. So yeah 10-10The sound design was nice. I loved Makoto\'s voice acting and also Chinatsu\'s. I thought they really clashed well when they were on screen together, like the sweetness of the pineapple, mixed with the sultry bitterness of the pizza, MMMGH that stuff is good. They both are the biggest support on why I say the ASMR anime thingy. The music was also an excellent choice, it all fit the vibe, especially the OP and ED. So I would say 10 out of 10 too.Makoto is amazing, her personality gave the vibe of one of my childhood friends that I really had a crush on. They have the same shoe size and everything with the second toe being longer than the first. I think I already made my stance clear on Kei, Chinatsu, and Inukaj, but I didn\'t touch much on Anzu sadly. Despite my praise for Makoto, Anzu was definitely my favorite by a long shot. Her personality is just so wifey material, she\'s cute, kind, independent, blonde, and wear serafuku most of the time. That\'s not all tho. I want more screentime for her but I guess that\'s too much to ask.Enjoyment here we go. I\'ll start off by saying everything was great. The animation was great, the plot was nuanced and demonstrated the character\'s values nicely, the girls were cute, the music is a banger, and the world building is unique too. They touch to a \'what if\' scenario of witch living alongside all of us and the fantasy creatures too. They act like normal people and not like all the movies depict. A breath of fresh air to this genre. Combining supranatural with slice of life. I will definitely rewatching this next year when I need to distract myself for a bit from the busyness real life throws at me. Thank you for reading my review. and kindness perfectly.

Thank you for reading my review.', 'For Indonesian review you can scroll down.English is not my first language so I apologize in advance for my bad english.It feels like finishing a warm cup of coffee during cold weatherThere is a need to make a good review for a great underrated anime like this. Because this is the first slice of life anime that I felt attached to, so it is a shame that the anime only consist of 12 episode. So, after I binged all the episodes, I binged the manga as well. I can say that both manga and anime are great, but I was amazed by how the stories...in the anime are ‘rearranged’ from the manga while not hurting the main strories. Also, the addition of trivial things apart from the manga makes the anime version livelier and the characters more connected to each other. In this case J.C Staff has done a great job of adapting the manga.I’ve watched another great slice of life anime such as K-ON!, Usagi Drop, Demi-Chan Wa Kataritai (Interview with the monster girls), and Sora no Wo To (Sound of The Sky). What makes Flying Witch really stand out from the others is the fact that this anime has succesfully build the calm, warm, and peaceful feeling after watching each episode. It may be a little exaggerating, but I would say that this is the holy grail of slice of life anime. Everything done in the right way in the right dose. The animation is not as great as other anime in the same season, but it fits the atmosphere of the anime. The background art takes you deep to the beauty of Hirosaki region in Aomori.  The characters really support how the stories goes and felt like a real person, not self-inserted characters, not artificially made characters, not a moe blob, not overly cute, not someone who is stubbornly determined to achieve something in his/her life, overly funny, or -deres type characters. The story is the one which held strongest point in this anime, despite the lack of main plot, every episode have certain connection of cause and effect to other episodes. What I really like is how the anime/manga makes the magic somehow believable. There are no flashy magic, the magic here is done like chemistry or making herbs that has to be done in the right amount or else the result won’t come as expected. The soundtrack of this anime besides the opening, is not really  memorable but it is not bad either. The opening itself is good enough so I decided to download it to my phone.Overall, I highly recommend this anime for all anime audience, young or old, newcomers or veterans.INDONESIAN REVIEW.Saya harus menulis sebuah review yang baik mengenai anime ini, agar dunia tahu bahwa anime ini terlalu bagus untuk dilewatkan. Inilah pertama kalinya saya merasakan keterikatan terhadap sebuah anime slice of life. Sayangnya, hanya terdapat 12 episode. Jadi, setelah saya habiskan ke-dua belas episodenya, saya langsung habiskan manganya juga. Bisa saya katakan bahwa keduanya bagus. Hanya saja saya merasa kagum dengan versi anime-nya. Sebab, cerita yang disajikan di anime ini diubah urutannya agar terasa lebih pas, tanpa merusak pesan utama yang ingin disampaikan. Selain itu penambahan beberapa hal kecil yang tidak diceritakan dalam versi manga-nya membuat keseluruhan anime ini terasa lebih utuh dan koheren. Dalam hal ini studio J.C Staff berhasil menjalankan tugasnya dengan baik.Sebelumnya saya juga sudah menonton anime slice of life yang menurut saya bagus, seperti K-On!, Usagi Drop, Demi-chan wa kataritai, dan Sora no Wo To. Namun, yang membuat Flying Witch menonjol adalah kenyataan bahwa anime ini berhasil membuat penonton merasa tenang dan damai setelah menonton tiap episode-nya. Meski agak berlebihan saya berani mengatakan bahwa anime ini adalah anime slice of life pamungkas. Semuanya dilakukan dan diselesaikan dengan cara yang tepat dan jumlah yang tepat. Animasinya tidak sehalus anime-anime lain di musim yang sama, tapi kualitas animasinya pas untuk anime ini. Selain itu background art-nya dilakukan dengan baik sehingga seakan-akan membawa penonton ke Hirosaki, Aomori, daerah yang menjadi latar anime ini. Tokoh-tokohnya terasa seperti orang asli, bukan tipe-tipe karakter moe, -dere, atau jenis-jenis karakter streotipikal anime yang laku dipasaran. Jika anda mengerti maksud saya. Dari segi cerita, anime ini memegang kekuatan utama.  Satu hal yang paling saya suka dari anime ini adalah bagaimana sihir yang dilakukan terkesan nyata, tidak bombastis seperti Harry Potter atau anime-anime sihir yang lain. Disini, sihir dilakukan seperti percobaan reaksi kimia atau membuat jamu, semua harus dilakukan dengan takaran yang pas, jika tidak hasil tidak akan seperti yang diharapkan. Untuk musik latar sendiri tidak ada yang istimewa, namun untuk musik pembukanya menurut saya cukup bagus untuk saya cari dan saya unduh di HP saya.Secara keseluruhan, saya sangat menyarankan para penikmat anime dari segala usia untuk menyaksikan anime yang satu ini.

It's fun and if you like slice of life, you'll probably like this anime a lot, i did.Story: 7/10[NO spoilers] The story of this anime is not very deep, it works...mostly as a background, the anime presents to you that, in this world, there are some witches and they do some witch stuff. They don't show much of that, in all the anime there's, probably, 6 spells, and most of thame they just... fly in brooms. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, the anime choose to focus on the life of Makoto, a (surprisingly) 15 years old [she looks like 20 lol] that lives a peaceful life on a town in a kinda rural (not really rural side, but it looks like it is sometimes) town. The story then progress showing the life of makoto and her friends there, not escaping much of this theme.Art: 8/10Cool, it's not surprisingly good, but it's good. There are some scenes where they fly that are really good, that's it.Sound: 7/10Eh, the op is cool, but the rest of it is just... generic.Character: 7/10You know them, they're in all animes you've watched. The characters are just... normal, makoto is fun and i like her a lot, but the best character is her cat. Overall, the cast is not complex, but they have memorable traits, althought they don't act mostly like a real person, it's just what you expect, but you can feel that they work fine in the context of the anime. There are some characters with cool concepts that appears just once, and some don't even say anything, but gives kinda of a veracity to the world.Enjoyment 9/10This anime is F U N, you cant just sit, relax, and be entertained by it, they always keeps the anime fresh with some others things to the characters to do and, when you noticed, the day is over and you watched all the episodes without leaving your room.Overall 8/10There's nothing left to say about it. It's a slice of life, a relaxing and fun anime. If you like relaxing anime like yuru camp, Non Non Biyori, Usagi drop, barakamon, gin no saji, etc. you will definitely like it, it has no real conflit (like, for example, barakamon) but nonetheless still a good time. mostly as a background, the anime presents to you that, in this world, there are some witches and they do some witch stuff. They don't show much of that, in all the anime there's, probably, 6 spells, and most of thame they just... fly in brooms. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, the anime choose to focus on the life of Makoto, a (surprisingly) 15 years old [she looks like 20 lol] that lives a peaceful life on a town in a kinda rural (not really rural side, but it looks like it is sometimes) town. The story then progress showing the life of makoto and her friends there, not escaping much of this theme.Art: 8/10Cool, it's not surprisingly good, but it's good. There are some scenes where they fly that are really good, that's it.Sound: 7/10Eh, the op is cool, but the rest of it is just... generic.Character: 7/10You know them, they're in all animes you've watched. The characters are just... normal, makoto is fun and i like her a lot, but the best character is her cat. Overall, the cast is not complex, but they have memorable traits, althought they don't act mostly like a real person, it's just what you expect, but you can feel that they work fine in the context of the anime.

There isn't much to cover so this will be brief. It a very relaxing and cute show.The story revolves around a witch named Makoto, who is a witch. She has come of age, but do to her parents wish to finish school has gone to live with her cousins. Nothing really interesting happens, no real action, or mini plot points. This is both a strength and a weakness for the show imo. It creates this relaxing and non intrusive mood to the show. However it also seems to be alot of missed potential. Characters...are introduced, situations are created, magic is discussed and used, and not only does nothing come from it but it also never seems to get brought back up.The art was very pretty and colorful. The soundtrack is very catchy, and even though not usually my taste is now on my playlist.The characters were interesting enough, but like I said above nothing comes from it. Makoto the young witch who is bad with directions has plenty of personality, but doesn't really shine. Other witches are introduced and shelved and only brought out for a quick glance here and there. The cousin and the rest of the family only seemed to exist for small comic relief.I enjoyed this show overall. However pure slice of life shows like this are not to my taste. This one in particular is particularly dry do to it having zero drive. No characters stand out, the story or even the theme of the show not even remotely discussed, no mini events take place...etc. Normally this would make me rate a show poorly but it did a great job in being an escape that I think it hit what it was trying aim for.TLDR: Nothing to the show really. Watch if you like dryer than normal slice of life shows. It is cute and relaxing, also has great art and soundtrack. are introduced, situations are created, magic is discussed and used, and not only does nothing come from it but it also never seems to get brought back up.The art was very pretty and colorful.

In this dog eat dog world that we live in rampant with all sorts of negative occurrences that pop up without warning, it\'s important to set aside such stressful moments and enjoy something that is quieter or less hectic, and enjoy the magic that is the casual, everyday life.Story: Kowata Makoto is a witch in-training who comes to Aomori, a rural area of Japan that is far away from the usual bustle of city life to live with her cousin and his relatives as she journeys to become...a full-fledged witch.While it doesn\'t look like it from the outside, the majority and beauty of Flying Witch is its simplicity and its rather basic nature.  Every episode has Makoto and various characters in the series experience different and sometimes magical events around town that offer a new adventure with just a touch of whimsy to each and every one.  None of these so-called adventures are extremely outlandish with most of them pertaining to simple, everyday tasks like going to the store, spending time with others at home, or even just going out for a walk with only a very small amount of them being somewhat extreme in terms of what the adventuring is.  But what really separates this show from other similar concepts is the execution and unique flair that the show adds to it.As the show is also about witches and the supernatural in order to add that one little touch of whimsy to the series, the show very often showcases magic and other magical attributes associated with witches.  However, the magic in the show is extremely subtle, similar to magic in the real world.  There\'re no dramatic spells or effects, with the biggest thing to come out of actual magic in this series being just a small little poof if anything.  This subtlety adds to the overall feel of the show to make it seem as though that even real life events can be magical regardless of how mundane they can be.The only real downside that I can see with this show is the fact that this show is extremely atmospheric.  While the story aspect and overall feel of the series is what drives it to become this whimsical everyday tale that it is, the calm and gentle atmosphere has very often been the problem for many people who want something to \'happen\' as some have stated.  The show doesn\'t really have any high points nor does it have any low points.  It\'s a slice of life series that pertains to the life of a young witch living in a rural town, so it\'s a kind of show that sadly, doesn\'t really appeal to everybody.Despite that, Flying Witch still holds its merit for being a wonderful show due to its calm and beautiful atmosphere to give it this individual feel to it.  The show kept its own pace and delivered what they wanted to do each episode.  In fact, I come out of the series feeling like I didn\'t even watch enough of the show because I was smiling throughout the whole episode and was so engrossed in this gentle world that the episode ended just right after I started it.  Even with me watching the OP and ED every episode, every episode just felt too short.  That\'s how you can tell that it\'s a good show.Overview:+ Simple and whimsical atmosphere+ Even pacing+ Subtlety in all aspects to pertain it to real life-  Gentle atmosphere has been known to make people despise this showCharacters: The characters in Flying Witch are what could be described as normal people in a sense.  While yes, there are a few outlandish/mythical characters and the main character is technically a witch, the majority of the cast aren\'t these exaggerated and overdone character tropes, but just simple rural people that enjoy the simpler things in life.First there\'s Kowata Makoto.  A directionally challenged witch in-training, Makoto is the main character of the series who spends the majority of time in the series like all of the other characters, living their quite lives out in the countryside.  However, beyond this, Makoto doesn\'t particularly have any other traits to her.  Beyond what is established, Makoto doesn\'t really change much in ways of character development in the series and are more or less introduced to new things rather than grow as a person.  She, like the rest of the cast are very simple characters that don\'t have too much to them.Then there\'s Kuramoto Chinatsu, Makoto\'s younger cousin who is introduced to the world of witches.  Chinatsu is a bright, energetic, and adventurous elementary schooler who finds fascination in the world of witches, often times being shown the magic and/or parts of the witch world.  She sort of plays the audience in the series as she, like the audience, are being shown these whimsical things that add a bit of spice to the series.The rest of the characters in the series more or less play the part of going along with the ride.  I chose to weed out Makoto and Chinatsu specifically because they both get the most screentime.  In actuality, all of the characters play similar parts to these two girls by just being characters that go along with the ebb and flow of the series and live out whatever event that is going on at the time whether it\'d be the unique task of the day or meeting someone new.  As such, these characters don\'t really feel like characters so much as they feel like the ones on stage who are showing us, the audience what new thing that they\'re going to do for us today.  They add to the atmosphere rather than being what the show is about, so the characters fall flat a bit in that sense.Overview:+ Characters aren\'t tropes but feel like people-  The story drives the characters rather than the other way aroundArt: Produced by J.C. Staff, a company that has had both its ups and its downs, Flying Witch is one of their projects that got a substantial budget and got a very good treatment in terms of the quality of its production.  The overall color scheme is bright and cheerful, with the show boasting high quality and production art that was breathtaking to look at.  And the water looked like REAL WATER.  (Do you know how hard it is to animate good water?)I think what really made the art for Flying Witch just exceed expectations is the fact that virtually every location that was drawn and animated for the series was based off of a real-life location.  Every background that was made for the series was an almost 1:1 comparison to the real world location and that to me is not only mind-boggling, but just shows the dedication and the lengths and the effort that was taken to make this series so pretty.As for character designs, the show boasts a moe style that leans towards realism rather than an 18 year old girl looking 10.  The characters still have relatively big eyes and cute appearance, especially since the majority of the cast is female, but the characters looked more like their actual age than opposed to what other shows have done.  However, if you\'re not a fan of the moe artstyle, than this might still be a bit of a tougher watch for you.Overview:+ Excellent, high-quality art+ Wonderfully made backgrounds+/- Moe artstyle for character designsSound:  Ah, yes, the OST.  The OST brings just so much joy to this series.  Adding into the calm and gentle atmosphere for the series, the soundtrack for Flying Witch utilizes several key instruments like piano, acoustic guitar, bell, flute, and clarinet to give it that airy and whimsical sound like a gentle breeze to add to the already pleasant atmosphere.For its OP, we have ""Sharararan"", an OP that I NEVER skipped.  The OP is this extremely happy and cheerful opening that I always had the urge to clap to every time I heard it.  It\'s the kind of feel good song that you can\'t help but smile to or dance along to just because of how catchy it is.Its ED, Nichijou no Mahou, is a gentle and quieter song sung by Makoto and Chinatsu\'s seiyuus that acts as the quieter night to Sharararan\'s sort of morning feel.  It\'s a good song, but compared to the other tracks in the show\'s OST, it doesn\'t compare or stack up to everything else that\'s there in the OST.Overview:+ Overall, wonderful OST+ Catchy clap-along to OP-  ED kind of lags behind a bit.Personal Enjoyment:  Flying Witch is a series that I never thought I would find myself addicted to.  At first glance, I knew that the show was going to be pretty good just because of the amount of time and effort that J.C. Staff put into it, and their track record when it came to devoting an entire seasonal or at least most of the budget into one show.  But I never expected myself to be so enveloped in such a calm and gentle feeling that only left me wanting more.  After finishing it, I\'m a bit at a loss for words cause I quite honestly want more of this series.Did I enjoy this series?Yes.  Despite the fact that there are some people who absolutely despise this series for being \'boring\', I for one is one of those people who enjoys those kinds of \'boring\' shows.  Every episode gave me something new to engross myself with, and hell, if you can make a show have a cat, just a normal cat, be as interesting or even more so than her human cast members, then you\'re doing something right.What didn\'t I like about this show?The only complaint I have is the lack of elaboration on the characters in the series.  The characters aren\'t really that deep and really only have 1-2 traits to them because the story is the one that carries the majority of the series.  But in all honesty, I both didn\'t notice nor cared about that throughout the run of the series simply because of how much I loved seeing Chinatsu or Makoto going through their daily lives or discovering something new.Would I recommend this series?If you want a nice, calm show to watch, then Flying Witch is definitely something that should be on your plan to watch list.  If you\'re a fan of more story-driven or action-based shows, I would say to stay away from this.  My problem with a lot of the hate with this series is the fact that the people who despise this series don\'t really appreciate the idea of atmospheric shows, so they don\'t innately understand the qualities of what makes this genre so enjoyable since all they see is a bunch of cute girls running around doing generic stuff. That\'s fine, since not everybody has to like the same things, but I would highly suggest that if you do not like shows that don\'t particularly have a plotline, or just don\'t like slice of life shows in general, don\'t watch this.  You will not have as fun of a time that I had watching this.  I guarantee it. a full-fledged witch.While it doesn\'t look like it from the outside, the majority and beauty of Flying Witch is its simplicity and its rather basic nature.

You will not have as fun of a time that I had watching this.  I guarantee it.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I used to practice magic tricks with cards a lot when I was a kid.I wasn’t very good at it, but I could do a few. Double-flipping, “stories,” rigged decks. It was fun trying to trick my family members, seeing their bewildered faces as I did something seemingly impossible. Something that only magic could account for.Flying Witch does not have card tricks, but it does have lots of magic – of a different kind.STORYOn one unassuming day in April, Makoto, a witch-in-training, arrives in a new town where her relatives live. Her purpose? To better...her witch knowledge and abilities. Thankfully for her, the day to day happenings lend themselves to magical opportunities. And thus Flying Witch proceeds.This proceeding is nothing like work or routine. The anime is, after all, an “iyashikei” (or “healing”) show. Meaning, its contents are heavily designed to be easy, soulful, and happy in nature.And that is what the audience gets. Makoto hangs out with Chinatsu and Kei, Akane and Inukai, Nao and Anzu. She takes part in simple yet soothing activities, like finding herbs in a forest or pruning apple trees.The setting also aides in Flying Witch’s healing capabilities. The small, quiet town is not boisterous with the clamoring of cars and bustling venues. Instead, it invites a feeling of nostalgia, a sense that this spot is tucked away from other parts of the world. Their home houses all the “action,” but its open doors, small farm, and simple décor create comfort with ease.Even the anime’s comedic moments are reserved. Nao says to Chito (Makoto’s black cat) that she seems to have gained weight, so she jumps on Nao’s back and lightly taps Nao’s forehead with her tail. The anime does not aim for huge laughs on purpose since that would defeat its healing agenda.Of course, one cannot forget about the magic, for it is implied in the title. And, unsurprisingly and surprisingly, magic ends up being the most important part of the show and the least important part of the show.First, magic being the most important. Throughout the season, the anime showcases many magical events. Summoning a murder of crows with Akane’s help. Turning Inukai from a dog-girl into a full-fledged dog. Revealing a ghostly waitress through Makoto’s drawn circle.It must be noted that these magics are not flashy whatsoever. While these are some of the more obvious moments, Makoto levitating or speaking with Chito are just as magical. No matter how normal the anime (rightly) depicts them.Since these non-flashy magics coincide with the iyashikei tone of the show, they also bring about some of the best moments that the anime offers. Hiding cafés, flying whales, and glowing fish are not possible, but, precisely because they are magic within a non-magic world, they stand out as a wonder to behold.Second, magic being the least important. In many of the scenes, magic plays no role at all. Makoto, Chinatsu, and Kei get their picture taken by a kind old lady passing by. Nao does her best to cook food during their cooking class. Chito walks the same route two different times.Just as it was with the flashiness of the magic, it must be noted how mundane these events are. Picking radishes and making hotcakes aren’t life-altering events. But they demonstrate that life really is just that: a series of simple yet personable moments.For instance, it’s not the otherworldly people that visit the café; it’s the good luck that a pair of romantic ladybugs bring. It’s not that there are fish that swim in the ground; it’s the serendipitous glow of those fish in the nighttime sky. It’s not the giant flying whale; it’s the peaceful ruins of a civilization long since gone on its back.In other words, when the magic and non-magic are combined, the show’s main message reveals itself: The truly magical moments are the ones that have been “nearby” all along.The show does have small faults when it does not take advantage of some of its elements. The father gets sidelined hard, the Harbinger of Spring only shows up once (despite having a dancing part in the OP sequence), and Chinatsu’s whole witch apprenticeship (let alone Makoto’s own training) does not see a conclusion. Again, these are not deal-breakers, but they do stick out as odd narrative choices.Regardless, Flying Witch’s tone and its message carry it as far as any broom could. That is to say, pretty far.ANIMATIONFlying Witch does not try to dazzle its audience, but what it provides is a lot of prettiness over the course of the season.Especially in its backgrounds. Dense forests, a quaint café, and a nighttime shot of some cherry trees are detailed in both lighting and depiction. Even more importantly, their soft colors and simplicity further evoke a feeling of calm. Perfect for this healing anime.In particular, the plants do the most work. Trees, flowers, bushes, herbs, and grass play a major part in making the show a peaceful, nature-filled hub. And since green is often associated with health and healing, the focus on greenery only furthers the anime’s goals.Even the town itself, with its roads, parks, and buildings, show off how pretty the anime can look. It’s a location revisited multiple times – much like Kei’s family’s house – but it never ceases to feel inviting to walk within.The character designs go for simplicity as well. And rightly so, for these characters are just that: simple, everyday people. Makoto’s long black hair, emerald eyes, and yellow cardigan simultaneously don’t stand out but make her the center of attention. Akane’s dark complexion contrasts with her white hair, giving her a foreign look. And Kei may as well be a background townsperson (in a good way) for how unassuming he dresses.Their various outfits, like Makoto’s pigtails and Chinatsu’s overalls, mix up how they usually look, adding even more strength to their designs.Of course, the more magical-looking designs deserve a mention. Inukai’s dog transformation, the Harbinger of Spring’s mask, and the paper man’s all-black attire. Indeed, their contrast with the normal, simplistic world Flying Witch presents makes their designs that much more intriguing.The show even employs reaction faces. They are subdued, often slight expressions of shock or bewilderment, bringing small moments of laughter yet keeping the show from going over the top in its delivery.The only real issue art-wise comes in the actual animation. The backgrounds and the designs receive the most attention, so the characters’ movement sadly does not. Most of the time, Makoto and the others are just sitting around the living-room table or chatting on a bus. Some more interesting segments exist, like when Makoto flies on her broom for the first time or when she’s chasing a pheasant, but these scenes are quite uncommon.Arguably, the unmoving nature of the characters fits Flying Witch. After all, less movement means more calm, and more calm means more peace, and more peace means more healing. Still, their lack of movement is noticeable, and it is enough to make the anime feel rigid rather than fun.CHARACTERSWith an anime like Flying Witch, it’s difficult to judge their characters in the traditional sense. The episodic format, the lighthearted, no-drama stories, and the lack of any character conflicts make Makoto and the other characters nothing more than themselves from start to finish.Not that that’s a bad thing. Because (again) with an anime like Flying Witch, it makes sense that the characters do not change. In fact, it’s almost thematic. Just as the story brings healing through showcasing the mundane parts of life, simplicity of character adds its own brand of healing: nostalgia, familiarity, and ease.Now, the problem with this approach is that it doesn’t leave the characters in what one would call a memorable light. Remember Kei’s design? His personality is just as dull. That’s not his fault; he’s simply being himself. He likes watching movies which makes him relatable, sure, but that does not make him a very interesting character.Same idea for Akane, Chinatsu, and even Makoto. The older sister drinks a lot, Chinatsu acts like a cute kid, and Makoto gets lost easily. But, because they lack so much on a character level (besides some niche traits like Makoto overproducing food or Chinatsu disliking bitter plants), they end up as little more than placeholders.Yet, that’s arguably the point. Kei reading a book in his room, Akane sleeping the afternoons away, and Makoto complaining about how the broom hurts her groin are not stellar character developments. But, much like the story and its portrayal of “magic,” these more simplistic aspects go right along with the show’s motif.That is, what makes them characters, makes them people, are not flashy occurrences but rather the everyday details that the audience can more than empathize with.If nothing else, the cast have their own roles to play when it comes to magic itself.One of the more obvious is Chinatsu. She’s a kid, so something like magic and what it can do has an even greater effect on her. As such, she embodies the wonder of magic.Akane is the most experienced and often hailed as a fantastic witch (by her own sister). Yet the magics she performs – creating animal-morphing chocolates, desaturating a landscape – show how much silliness and fun that magic can bring. So, she proves that magic does not have to be taken seriously.Makoto does not act like those folktale witches. She doesn’t have a crooked nose or green skin, and she doesn’t toil over a bubbling cauldron. (At least, not a big one.) Instead, she’s a sweet, kind girl who enjoys the outdoors, loves her family, and talks with her cat. In other words, she pushes back against the typical magic-user tropes – by being the complete opposite.Even Kei has his role. He’s a very quiet, very normal dude. He does not speak much let alone react to anything with more than mild amusement. In fact, the only time he seems to show any emotion is when spooky ghosts are involved. Thus, he demonstrates that magic is not something to be fearful of.Altogether, the characters are not the most impressive. However, they at least have these roles and a more thematic argument at hand, giving them a bit more strength than they otherwise had.SOUNDTwo pieces of music stand out from the others in Flying Witch: the opening track and the main track from the OST.The OP generates a lot of fun. The vocalist’s “Sha la la la…” followed by the quicker lyrics gets at that immediately with their shortness and silliness. The clapping in the background doesn’t just go along with the beat; it’s something that’s easy to clap to. And the guitar flourish, played near the beginning and right at the end, is a catchy little arrangement that starts and finalizes the track on a bunch of happy notes.“The main track” sounds vague, but it’s obvious which one it is. It starts with a simple acoustic guitar before gently wading into some light piano work. The piano itself jumps around in a calm manner – all while the guitar continues playing in the background. The beat the combo produces becomes a leitmotif that many of the other tracks use, getting at (once again) that familiarity and therefore healing feeling.The show does have other tracks, like those steeped in woodwind instruments or only relying on that acoustic guitar. They’re not as powerful as the leitmotif, but they have their own sense of simplicity that evoke similar feelings.On the lower end of the sound department are the ending track and a particular voice-acting job.The ED goes for a slower pace with both Makoto and Chinatsu singing individually and together. It’s a more reserved piece, aiming for a bittersweet tone that it mostly achieves. It takes a few listens to warm up to it, and it’s not necessarily a poorly composed piece. But with a loud middle section and a grander scale that does not mesh well with the rest of this laidback show, it does not hold up as well as the other tracks offered.As for the voice acting, there are two people worth mentioning. Minami Shinoda, in her first major role as Makoto, does very well as the kindhearted girl. However, Eri Suzuki as Chinatsu doesn’t quite hit the mark. She sounds more annoying than cute. Especially her “Yay,” which seems to come from an adult trying to sound like a kid rather than it does a kid naturally brimming with excitement. (She’s technically the former, but the latter was the desired intention.)(One other small shout-out goes to the voice behind the mandrake plant. His constant “ooooooooooooooooo” while Makoto and Nao were talking and afterwards made for a very funny scene.)ENJOYMENTI have a couple of favorite moments from the show.One of the first being the trick-and-treat episode. Watching Makoto cry at everything, Chinatsu laugh at everything, and then Chinatsu laughing at Makoto crying made for a hilarious scene.I also really liked when Akane mistook Nao to be Kei’s girlfriend. She started crawling on the ground, making encouraging sounds and gestures as she egged on Kei and left the room.Beyond these couple of scenes, though, I was merely content with the anime. Another way to put it, I neither hated nor loved it.A lot of that falls on the characters. They didn’t have much of a personality beyond just being nice to one another. Chinatsu could be silly, Akane could be lazy, and Inukai could be angry, but they were all a bit too plain.I understand that it must be this way. If everyone was shouting or had explosive personalities, they would not fit with the laidback atmosphere. And it’s not like they are unlikable characters. They are nice and happy and fun. I just would have preferred more out of them.Even so, Makoto was my favorite of the bunch. Her smile while holding that mandrake, her surprised face when a crow landed on her head, and her energy when in the forest made me very happy to see.Also, the paper man. He was a cool and ominous dude. Too bad he was only around for maybe twenty seconds tops.Flying Witch may not do a whole lot, but its heart is in the right place. The story’s message is meaningful, the art is pretty, and the characters serve specific roles. It’s a simple show – and that’s no card trick.SUMMARYStory: Good, healing and “magical” moments make for a heartwarming experienceAnimation: Good, pretty background art, healing greenery, nice character designs, subdued comedic reactions, and okay actual animationCharacters: Fine, while the cast lack any outstanding qualities, their everyday selves and roles in relation to magic give them at least some strengthSound: Fine, good OP, good OST, okay ED, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, not much entices besides a fun character or moment here and thereFinal Score: 6/10 her witch knowledge and abilities. Thankfully for her, the day to day happenings lend themselves to magical opportunities. And thus Flying Witch proceeds.This proceeding is nothing like work or routine. The anime is, after all, an “iyashikei” (or “healing”) show. Meaning, its contents are heavily designed to be easy, soulful, and happy in nature.And that is what the audience gets. Makoto hangs out with Chinatsu and Kei, Akane and Inukai, Nao and Anzu. She takes part in simple yet soothing activities, like finding herbs in a forest or pruning apple trees.The setting also aides in Flying Witch’s healing capabilities. The small, quiet town is not boisterous with the clamoring of cars and bustling venues. Instead, it invites a feeling of nostalgia, a sense that this spot is tucked away from other parts of the world. Their home houses all the “action,” but its open doors, small farm, and simple décor create comfort with ease.Even the anime’s comedic moments are reserved. Nao says to Chito (Makoto’s black cat) that she seems to have gained weight, so she jumps on Nao’s back and lightly taps Nao’s forehead with her tail. The anime does not aim for huge laughs on purpose since that would defeat its healing agenda.Of course, one cannot forget about the magic, for it is implied in the title. And, unsurprisingly and surprisingly, magic ends up being the most important part of the show and the least important part of the show.First, magic being the most important. Throughout the season, the anime showcases many magical events. Summoning a murder of crows with Akane’s help. Turning Inukai from a dog-girl into a full-fledged dog. Revealing a ghostly waitress through Makoto’s drawn circle.It must be noted that these magics are not flashy whatsoever. While these are some of the more obvious moments, Makoto levitating or speaking with Chito are just as magical. No matter how normal the anime (rightly) depicts them.Since these non-flashy magics coincide with the iyashikei tone of the show, they also bring about some of the best moments that the anime offers. Hiding cafés, flying whales, and glowing fish are not possible, but, precisely because they are magic within a non-magic world, they stand out as a wonder to behold.Second, magic being the least important. In many of the scenes, magic plays no role at all. Makoto, Chinatsu, and Kei get their picture taken by a kind old lady passing by. Nao does her best to cook food during their cooking class. Chito walks the same route two different times.Just as it was with the flashiness of the magic, it must be noted how mundane these events are. Picking radishes and making hotcakes aren’t life-altering events. But they demonstrate that life really is just that: a series of simple yet personable moments.For instance, it’s not the otherworldly people that visit the café; it’s the good luck that a pair of romantic ladybugs bring. It’s not that there are fish that swim in the ground; it’s the serendipitous glow of those fish in the nighttime sky. It’s not the giant flying whale; it’s the peaceful ruins of a civilization long since gone on its back.In other words, when the magic and non-magic are combined, the show’s main message reveals itself: The truly magical moments are the ones that have been “nearby” all along.The show does have small faults when it does not take advantage of some of its elements. The father gets sidelined hard, the Harbinger of Spring only shows up once (despite having a dancing part in the OP sequence), and Chinatsu’s whole witch apprenticeship (let alone Makoto’s own training) does not see a conclusion. Again, these are not deal-breakers, but they do stick out as odd narrative choices.Regardless, Flying Witch’s tone and its message carry it as far as any broom could. That is to say, pretty far.ANIMATIONFlying Witch does not try to dazzle its audience, but what it provides is a lot of prettiness over the course of the season.Especially in its backgrounds. Dense forests, a quaint café, and a nighttime shot of some cherry trees are detailed in both lighting and depiction. Even more importantly, their soft colors and simplicity further evoke a feeling of calm. Perfect for this healing anime.In particular, the plants do the most work. Trees, flowers, bushes, herbs, and grass play a major part in making the show a peaceful, nature-filled hub. And since green is often associated with health and healing, the focus on greenery only furthers the anime’s goals.Even the town itself, with its roads, parks, and buildings, show off how pretty the anime can look. It’s a location revisited multiple times – much like Kei’s family’s house – but it never ceases to feel inviting to walk within.The character designs go for simplicity as well. And rightly so, for these characters are just that: simple, everyday people. Makoto’s long black hair, emerald eyes, and yellow cardigan simultaneously don’t stand out but make her the center of attention. Akane’s dark complexion contrasts with her white hair, giving her a foreign look. And Kei may as well be a background townsperson (in a good way) for how unassuming he dresses.Their various outfits, like Makoto’s pigtails and Chinatsu’s overalls, mix up how they usually look, adding even more strength to their designs.Of course, the more magical-looking designs deserve a mention. Inukai’s dog transformation, the Harbinger of Spring’s mask, and the paper man’s all-black attire. Indeed, their contrast with the normal, simplistic world Flying Witch presents makes their designs that much more intriguing.The show even employs reaction faces. They are subdued, often slight expressions of shock or bewilderment, bringing small moments of laughter yet keeping the show from going over the top in its delivery.The only real issue art-wise comes in the actual animation. The backgrounds and the designs receive the most attention, so the characters’ movement sadly does not. Most of the time, Makoto and the others are just sitting around the living-room table or chatting on a bus. Some more interesting segments exist, like when Makoto flies on her broom for the first time or when she’s chasing a pheasant, but these scenes are quite uncommon.Arguably, the unmoving nature of the characters fits Flying Witch. After all, less movement means more calm, and more calm means more peace, and more peace means more healing. Still, their lack of movement is noticeable, and it is enough to make the anime feel rigid rather than fun.CHARACTERSWith an anime like Flying Witch, it’s difficult to judge their characters in the traditional sense. The episodic format, the lighthearted, no-drama stories, and the lack of any character conflicts make Makoto and the other characters nothing more than themselves from start to finish.Not that that’s a bad thing. Because (again) with an anime like Flying Witch, it makes sense that the characters do not change. In fact, it’s almost thematic. Just as the story brings healing through showcasing the mundane parts of life, simplicity of character adds its own brand of healing: nostalgia, familiarity, and ease.Now, the problem with this approach is that it doesn’t leave the characters in what one would call a memorable light. Remember Kei’s design? His personality is just as dull. That’s not his fault; he’s simply being himself. He likes watching movies which makes him relatable, sure, but that does not make him a very interesting character.Same idea for Akane, Chinatsu, and even Makoto. The older sister drinks a lot, Chinatsu acts like a cute kid, and Makoto gets lost easily. But, because they lack so much on a character level (besides some niche traits like Makoto overproducing food or Chinatsu disliking bitter plants), they end up as little more than placeholders.Yet, that’s arguably the point. Kei reading a book in his room, Akane sleeping the afternoons away, and Makoto complaining about how the broom hurts her groin are not stellar character developments. But, much like the story and its portrayal of “magic,” these more simplistic aspects go right along with the show’s motif.That is, what makes them characters, makes them people, are not flashy occurrences but rather the everyday details that the audience can more than empathize with.If nothing else, the cast have their own roles to play when it comes to magic itself.One of the more obvious is Chinatsu. She’s a kid, so something like magic and what it can do has an even greater effect on her. As such, she embodies the wonder of magic.Akane is the most experienced and often hailed as a fantastic witch (by her own sister). Yet the magics she performs – creating animal-morphing chocolates, desaturating a landscape – show how much silliness and fun that magic can bring.

To me most of the popular slice of life anime's are boring or they are washed out. Most anime in this drama also seem to be trying to hard and they still seem to be unoriginal and just like every other anime....yes flying witch's plot isn't original but the characters are not as stereotyped and the anime has no intent of showing anything sexual with the characters which I rarely see in anime. yes flying witch's plot isn't original but the characters are not as stereotyped and the anime has no intent of showing anything sexual with the characters which I rarely see in anime."", ""Makoto is a witch in training who moves in with her relatives to further her training. If you're looking for a true slice of life with a light sprinkling of magic, Flying Witch may be up your alley. It shares the feel-good family interactions seen in shows like Minami Ke. However, it lacks a comical equivalent of Kana and doesn't have any semblance of romance. This show literally goes nowhere. If you're like me and need some semblance of story or character development, you're better off looking elsewhere.Animation:This show has some pretty impressive, detailed backgrounds. Whether in a local pedestrian mall, a garage shed, or...walking outdoors, the characters are surrounded by vivid, meticulously-drawn scenery. If you like majestic mountains, green crop fields, and rustic towns, then this is your kind of scenery. Backgrounds aside, the show is standard fare. It's drawn in a bright but low-saturated palette, which fits the peaceful yet plain feel of the story. There is your standard fare 3D CGI used in all the vehicles and trains but luckily they're only used in a few scenes. The characters themselves are well drawn but actually look humorously plain sometimes compared to the detailed scenery. The show involves a lot of spiritual beings visiting the household so expect some rather odd looking characters- your reactions will probably be similar to that of Chinatsu. I actually think the best drawn character here is actually the cat Chito, who seems to have more personality than our rather boring male cousin, Kei.There is pretty much no action in this rather peaceful show. Likewise, despite there being a witch on a broom in a miniskirt, the camera keeps things clean.Sound:The light, guitar-backed op fits both the scenery and pacing of the show; it's a fair and relatively catchy melody. The ED, by contrast, has a much richer instrumentation and is sung by our main heroines. The BGM is rather playful in tonality, it relies heavily on brass instruments, plucked strings, and occasionally piano. It serves its role better than in your typical show and some tunes will become familiar by the end of the show.The primary VAs are relatively fresh. Minami Shinoda does a great job giving Makoto a gentle yet eager personality; she makes pulling out weeds very entertaining. I can't really say the same for our male protagonist- Shinsuke Sugawara's character is just plain boring- his voice gives him a rather dull character that never seems to be phased by anything. The show is, however, supported by a lot of veterans cast in secondary roles. You have Ai Kayano and Ari Ozawa voicing witch familiars (they don't actually speak words) and Kikuko Inoue voicing the residence's mom, her performance outright puts a lot of the other characters to shame.Story:There isn't that much to say for this category. The show basically has a bunch of interesting characters visiting the country residence and showcases a bunch of interactions between the cast. For instance, a good portion of one episode consists of multiple characters individually following the cat Chito while a large portion of another episode has our cast picking wild vegetables. There is actually a bit of educational material here in a similar vein to Silver Spoon but obviously to a lesser degree.The show is pretty episodic overall with just a few exceptions, and there isn't really any central plot or story progression. There's a bit of light comedy but otherwise it's just a lot of nice, peaceful scenes and interactions.Character:The show focuses on Makoto, her elder sister, and her cousin. There isn't a lot of background on many of the characters; the show focuses more on just interactions. I wouldn't expect much in the form of romantic developments or even dynamic characters; other than Chinatsu, the other characters are pretty much the same all the way through.There are some particularly interesting supporting characters, such as Inukai, but the majority of the interactions are simple conversations and occasional visits by unique spirits.

It is a comedy slice of life with aspects of magic/fantasy though not an insane amount.I quite enjoyed this anime after watching it. Unlike most anime it was not in a rush to shove as much detail down my throat as humanly possible. Which to be fair is often something i dislike about a lot of anime. Shoving 24 + EP worth of stuff into a 12 anime series. As follows will be my ratings and thoughts.Story: I\'m not gonna lie this anime had a solid story. Certainly not a...10/10 but easy to follow and quite nice to watch casually. It does not beat you over the head with anything like some other anime tend to do, but it also just goes at it\'s own pace. Grant you this pace is what makes people rate it poorly because they consider slow anime to be ""Boring"" or ""Pointless"". Lack of fighting or fast pacing does not make an anime bad.Art: This is one area i have to give my props. I will admit there are some instances where the art is not the best it could be, however, overall i think that this anime is well done in the art department and they strive to make a good impression.Sound: Ok so this is something i often don\'t pay much attention to when it comes to anime unless i am just flooded by amazing musical scores or awful dubbing and irritating sounds that exist for no reason. I rated this relatively high because the dubbing (japanese) was done well and the music was quite nice.Character: Ok so this one was a bit underwhelming for me if i\'m being fair. I loved the characters in this anime, but overall you don\'t see an insane amount of development from any characters. They pretty much go with the pacing of a slice of life that has little to no drama at all. This does not however mean that the characters have zero development. Development aside they have fun personalities, and each of them is quite unique.Enjoyment: LOL so this category is almost pointless to be honest. Though i understand why it exists. This anime was fun and just wholesome for me. It was something different and the characters themselves made things worth watching.Overall: So you can assume my thoughts based on everything above. This anime is not ACTION PACKED or some fantasy isekai that will have you vying for magical blasts and high end spells. It is one that does not take itself too seriously but still leaves room to take you along for the right. Again this anime has it\'s own style of pacing and is not quick to throw you into this world. This story though is very fun and genuinely interesting to just see the characters daily interactions. It might not be the most exciting anime ever but it\'s still worth the watch. 10/10 but easy to follow and quite nice to watch casually.

It might not be the most exciting anime ever but it\'s still worth the watch.', ""While at first you may think this is just another slice of life anime, well for me compared to other slice of life anime's this is pretty unique as it breaks several cliche's that we see not just in slice of life anime but in all anime in general.Here are some reasons.-Both parents have active roles in this series compared to the typical where they are missing or died or at work. we see our characters interact with them in their daily lives.- It's not High school-centric where most of the scenes are set in a school. no school clubs, school festival etc. we...see our characters on how they spend their everyday life and that's it. we also see our MC Makoto do some witch stuff though i think we could have seen more.-There are are no romantic buildups here, no childhood friend promises or jealousy, they closest one you can get is Kei saying that Inukai might be his type. not to mention like in a typical anime girls always wonders what their guy is doing right now. it's not the case here in flying witch.Makoto and Nao can interact with each other without thinking about Kei.-There's no fanservice. no panty shots beach episodes or ecchi scenes.The only thing i hoped for for this anime is that I wish they could have shown us more about the witch stuff.-The setting is also unique, since unlike what we in anime set typical countryside. where witches and occult stuffs are treated like a bad luck. that's not a case here. Makoto is a witch and everybody knows and accepts it. they also had some  few supernatural things going like the Whale who flies. the hidden cafe shop etc..When it comes to the characters, yes they all have active roles in which i like,  they are not your typical characters, for instances Chinatsu is not your sis-con loli, Kei is not your charismatic brother, he just works and helps the family. the only cliche character here is probably Akane where we typically see the hyperactive big sister. i just wish we could have also seen more of the harbringer and Anzu.The Sound and the Art is nice it's refreshing. the opening was nice and so as the mandrake. the transitions from slice of life to comedy was well done and so as the facial expressions.overall if you want to relax, then watch this anime and thank me afterwards. see our characters on how they spend their everyday life and that's it. we also see our MC Makoto do some witch stuff though i think we could have seen more.-There are are no romantic buildups here, no childhood friend promises or jealousy, they closest one you can get is Kei saying that Inukai might be his type. not to mention like in a typical anime girls always wonders what their guy is doing right now. it's not the case here in flying witch.Makoto and Nao can interact with each other without thinking about Kei.-There's no fanservice. no panty shots beach episodes or ecchi scenes.The only thing i hoped for for this anime is that I wish they could have shown us more about the witch stuff.-The setting is also unique, since unlike what we in anime set typical countryside. where witches and occult stuffs are treated like a bad luck. that's not a case here.

It matches almost every aspect of Aria while improving in certain areas.NOTE: The reason I am going to compare this show to Aria is because they both borrow the same mechanics to make their slow-paced show so amazing.Story: 5/10Slice-of-Life anime usually fall into the issue of not having a driving plot force throughout the show. This was somewhat prevalent in Aria's first season but was less of an issue in season 2 and 3. In Flying Witch there is almost no plot direction...between episodes. Some characters show up in later episodes but there really is no driving plot force in this show. This might be a plus for some people who like the episodic type shows (Like Mushishi and Cowboy Bebop) but I personally like there to be a connection from each episode to the next (even if it is a very small one). Tamako Market is another Slice-of-Life anime does a decent job of connecting each episode to one another so the payoff is much better in the end. Because of these reasons, I find that Flying Witch is lacking in the plot department. I love what I am seeing but it is due to the other elements of the show.Animation: 8.5/10Flying Witch flat out looks gorgeous every frame of the show. The character's expressions, the color, the backgrounds, everything looks very spot on. I felt that the animation was a little off in certain scenes but overall the show did very well in the visual performance department.Sound: 10/10This is where the show nailed it home for me. Like with Aria, the music and ambient sounds are 100% perfect. The backing music in every scene fits perfectly and enhances what you are seeing ten-fold. This is one of those shows that you should absolutely go out and get the OST. Not only the supporting music but the ambient sounds were spot on. The wind whistling in the background, the birds chirping, just everything audio wise made this anime feel like it was in a rural Japanese town. Lastly the voice cast was simply amazing. They nailed the dead-pan comedy parts and did an amazing job relaying their character's personalities.Characters: 9.5/10It's honestly hard to find any real issues with the cast in this show. They all feel incredibly unique and interact with each other so fluidly. Every scene that has a character interacting with another character(s) was just such a joy to watch. It is because of this key aspect that this show works so well; it is not a plot driven show but a character driven one instead. This is the same for Kiznaiver which did a very good job of allowing its characters to drive the show. If the cast is well-knit enough they will carry the show. It is one of the few things that can override a boring plot.The only reason this category is not getting a full 10/10 is because unlike in Aria there isn't a whole lot of character growth going on in Flying Witch. The show does the same thing as Aria showing the daily lives of a small cast but it does not show each character striving for a specific goal and achieving it. This might not be a fair complaint since Aria has three seasons and a OVA while Flying Witch only has this one season but I just do not see where the character growth is going to occur within this cast in the future.Overall: 8.3/10This is a fantastic Slice-of-Life anime that you should absolutely put on your “Want to Watch” list right now. It takes a slow, laid back approach to show to you the calm and serene features of this rural Japanese town while the cast helps provide the show with some genuine funny moments. If you are someone who cannot stand slow-paced shows then maybe skip out on this one but regardless you should give the first episode a try.Enjoyment: 9.9/10Thanks for reading my review!

Typically for me after watching 3 or 4 episodes of an anime all in a row, I feel a little drained. Flying Witch had almost the opposite effect, where I felt even better after watching it than when I started. The story is solid, with the characters all having a purpose and even if they only appear for one or two episodes they feel like real people with real lives. The art style works very well with the laid back personality this piece has. The into song is on point, and I still can't tell if I love or hate...the sounds the cats make when they meow. Overall this anime is a good way to wind down and enjoy an anime. the sounds the cats make when they meow. Overall this anime is a good way to wind down and enjoy an anime."", ""Many people call this show the definition of comfy and I have to agree.It's such a relaxing show with endearing characters that are all so likeable.The main family is just so wholesome and side characters are fun as well.The urban fantasy lets you experience the fantasy aspects at a fun pace and enhance both the comedy and the make the audience curious.The show spends quite some runtime with the characters cooking, shopping or sewing, but it never stops being entertaining.All in all this is a show that delivers on it's promise of rest and relaxation with a cute soundtrack, adorable characters and a bit of...good humor which culminates in the perfect escapist fantasy slice of life show, that just lets you forget stressful everyday life.That's a 9/10 for me. good humor which culminates in the perfect escapist fantasy slice of life show, that just lets you forget stressful everyday life.That's a 9/10 for me."", ""If this anime had 5 seasons I would definitely watch them all and replay it because it is just so good. But I think there could be a little more magic in the anime, I know it's a slice of life but ... anyway, the art is very good, the story was very elaborate, it's even funnier than I expected hahaha.incredibly the characters were very real built in a very short time, which surprised me a lot because they managed to develop 3 or 4 characters at the same time and still none is less developed than another which is really very good.after all these...anime is simply one of my favorites for sure. anime is simply one of my favorites for sure."", ""I've been watching a lot of action animes which include horror and thrillers. But at some time your mind asks you to watch something relaxing, taking a break from it. And Flying Witch provides you that. Following are the reviews so expect some spoilers.Story: 7The story is mainly focus on Makoto's lives with her relatives. I like how the story is played out. I was expecting to learn about witches but I ended up learning about farming as well.Art: 7The animation felt bit different but it was well made. I love the background of the series. They made the nature scenario well.Sound: 8Sound...was OK as well. there wasn't any off about it.Characters: 9The characters were well done, designing was great. There was room for everyone on it. The character development was great. My favorite character was Chinatsu. She is so cute I love her character. I think if anything better has done here was characterization.Enjoyment: 7Yes it wasn't that entertaining like how action animes are. But like I have said, it was relaxing in a way. There was a good story line on how Makoto interacts with people she meets. It was good to see. I enjoyed it.Overall: 7Again, some may call it boring. Yes it's not that entertaining. But it's relaxing. I have enjoyed it. It was a good little series. For anyone who likes taking his/her time off and want to enjoy such slice-of-life series, something to relax for, I recommend this. It doesn't have much to offer but it will give you good time.Thanks. was OK as well. there wasn't any off about it.Characters: 9The characters were well done, designing was great.

Have you ever asked yourself: What would Kiki's Delivery Service be like if it were a TV show instead of a movie? I think I found the answer to that question. Take Kiki's Delivery Service, remove all of the more overt fantasy elements, change the setting to modern Japan, make Kiki into a teenager, and have the whole thing still be sweet, wholesome, and plain nice. I present to you Flying Witch, a short anime based on the manga by Chihiro Ishizuka, the latter of which is still running to this day. I didn't watch this when it first came...out, as I was very deep into my anime burnout phase and I couldn't muster up any motivation to watch anything. But seeing as I've finally clawed myself out of it, I decided to give it a try, as some bloggers I follow said it was a great show. I finished it and I can wholeheartedly agree that it really is a sweet treat to watch.The story centers on a young woman, Makoto Kowata, a witch in training who, alongside her cat familiar Chito, is sent to live with her relatives in the countryside town of Aomori. She just turned 15, and in her world, when a witch turns 15, she is made to leave home to become more independent and spend her time studying witchcraft. She is taken in by her cousins, the Kuramoto family, namely her cousin Kei and his younger sister Chinatsu. Every day is full of fun surprises, from her encounters with an anthropomorphic dog fortune teller desperate to become human again, to all the peculiar magic training she gets from her older sister Akane. For those of you wondering, Flying Witch doesn't have much of a plot, as the show is very firmly rooted in the slice-of-life genre, so you won't find any overt action, drama, complexity, nor conflict here. Every episode focuses on much more mundane things, such as the characters going herb picking in the forest, finding fabric to make witch robes with, or riding on top of a floating whale. So if you're the type of person who prefers blood pumping action, this isn't the show for you.But what the show lacks in conflict, it makes up for in a lot of ways. For one, the whole tone of the show is very laid-back and down-to-earth, with very little in the way of exaggerated expressions or movements or zany comedy. Events and character interactions play out slowly and organically, like how real people would interact in real life. The pacing is deliberately slow, making you really feel like you're in a quiet countryside town where time seems to move at a more languid pace, and considering the tone the show is going for, it suits the feel of the show perfectly. Nothing is ever rushed or resolved too quickly, and while this may be a point of contention for those who prefer anime that have a faster pace, Flying Witch knows its sole focus is showing the characters in their daily lives and enjoying the things they do and the environment around them.The animation is fairly good, with the characters having realistic character designs (With some exceptions but even those are relatively muted compared to other anime), detailed backgrounds, and any exaggerated expressions being much more subdued than in most anime. But it also has a lot of understated details that really sell the show's setting, like how Makoto puts her broom in a parking space for bikes, or how Inukai's hamster familiar shivers whenever Chito is nearby. The music is fairly nice as well, with a variety of instruments that fit the feel of a scene when needed. But I didn't like how everyone was highlighted green in the opening theme, and I thought the opening song was kind of obnoxious.You can't have a good story or setting if you don't have equally good characters to back it up, and for a show like this, the characters can either make it or break it depending on the execution. Thankfully, Flying Witch's characters avoid a lot of the common pitfalls that give the slice-of-life genre a bad name. All of the characters' personalities and quirks are realistic, down to earth, and they behave like real people would, with no exaggerated or forced personality traits or archetypes oh so common in most anime, and the chemistry between all of them is also very well done. The show is filled with sweet moments between various characters that just make you smile, like how Kei and Chinatsu interact, seeing how different Makoto and Akane are as siblings (Yes, the silver haired, tan skinned woman is related to a pale skinned, black haired high school student. Don't ask, because I don't know either), Nao's interactions with Chito, and Anzu (My favorite character) gushing about anthropology with Kenny, a Siamese-ish magic cat who's said to be an anthropology scholar in his world. All throughout the series, we constantly learn new things about them, and the things we do learn about them never feel like the creators pulled them out of their butts, nor do these new traits contradict anything we learned about them before (Looking at you, Ni no Kuni movie!!). Having good characters and equally good chemistry between them makes the show very rewarding to watch, even if they're not the most complex. Really, most slice-of-life shows could really benefit from learning a thing or two from Flying Witch when it comes to characterization and character writing. Even the voice acting feels genuine, though, I won't lie, Chinatsu's Japanese voice can get really grating and shrill at times, to the point of sounding a bit forced.So if you want to kick back, relax, and watch a slice-of-life anime that's full of heart but not forced or obnoxious as most other slice-of-life anime, then let Flying Witch take you for a low key ride.

Although the magicians in this story do not have laser or light or beam effects that usually appear in magic anime. The witches in...this story are all very friendly and their witch activities are only in the form of interacting with supernatural beings, making potions, flying with brooms, researching, magic rituals, taking walks etc. And of course the witch's identity needs to be kept secret and only known to her family to avoid trouble. Even so, their activities are actually not much different from normal people in general.What I like the most is the visuals are refreshing and the vibe is relaxed, I hope there will be another season. this story are all very friendly and their witch activities are only in the form of interacting with supernatural beings, making potions, flying with brooms, researching, magic rituals, taking walks etc. And of course the witch's identity needs to be kept secret and only known to her family to avoid trouble.

You have a girl who is a witch and has to study witchcraft on her own. It is very calm and the plot is simple, too simple. Nothing ever happens, all witchcraft is reduced to pathetically simple and boring acts that, I guess, are supposed to be funny. The characters are bland and boring, and just as nothing happens...in the story, nothing happens in terms of them developing. There\'s a lot of ""cute"" and ""funny"" or ""heartwarming"" things in Flying Witch, but they ultimately feel very forced and unnatural.Art & Sound: The art is probably the best part of the show, with gentle colors and characters that are easy on the eyes, but it\'s not far above normal in today\'s standards (the mc girl looks like the girl from Bakuman). The Sound is pretty normal.Overall: In the beginning I liked the show, but as it went on the forced cuteness (and so on), combined with the fact that nothing ever happened made it grow more and more boring until I, after the 8th episode, couldn\'t take it anymore and dropped it.

I wouldn’t call it the best Iyashikei but it certainly fits the genre the best and fully goes for it, it doesn’t really step outside of it much at all. It’s rare to see a show go so fully into Iyashikei, majority that I’ve seen like to fall into multiple genres with Iyashikei as an aspect rather then the entire point, but flying Witch feels like it’s entire point is just to be Iyashikei.Flying Witch follows a witch - go figure - as she moves into a...new town, staying with her uncle, aunt, and two cousins. She’s staying there as she had to move out in order to study witchcraft outside of her home with her parents. It does feel a little pointless to move from living with direct relative to somewhat distant relatives, you’re still relying on your family to provide shelter for you. But it doesn’t matter too much because that’s not the point, the point is that we have a Witch now living in the country and calmness insues.Flying Witch like most Iyashikei is set in a small country town, and this always greatly increases my enjoyment, even if for a very personal reason. I love country towns in japan, I love the way the towns are laid out, I love the difference between wide open areas but then also small streets and alleyways, I love how clean and fresh the air is and I love how isolated it feels to be there. Whenever I’ve been to japan I’ve come out of my way to spend some time in rural areas because I just love the atmosphere there, it’s a very personal thing obviously but it’s adds to my enjoyment whenever an anime takes place in the country and captures the feeling and look right, which flying Witch dose.Flying Witch despite being an Iyashikei also has a very deep world that it does take some time to build, without weighing itself down with exposition. If you’ve read my Kemono Friends review then you know I love good world building and there’s plenty of it here. It does world building the same way flying with dose, where the characters act like real people and don’t just randomly explain things without reason. If they ever do explain things it’s to people who don’t know or understand these things and want to know more about it, mainly Makoto’s cousins. And oh god you don’t know who Makoto is and I kinda like this gag so I’m not gonna edit the character part in to be earlier.Our protagonist is Makoto, and I can’t believe I didn’t mention that earlier. As far as protagonists go she’s fairly generic, she’s a bit dumb and has a bad sense of direction which is a very common protagonist trait. She’s serviceable as a protagonist but most of the time I wasn’t too fond of her and she wasn’t what kept me around, but she does what she needs to do and I can at least admit the show would be lesser without her.Her cousins, Chinatsu and Kei are a mixed bag, cause while I love Chinatsu, I hate Kei. Well, hate is a strong word but I’m not fond of him at all. He doesn’t do much for the story and a lot of the time he just came off as annoying or a buzz kill, I don’t think he was mean to be written this way but the voice acting really kills it. His dialog could be interpreted a few different ways and I’m sure I’d enjoy him more in the manga, but the way the voice actor dose him makes me dislike him. This voice actor is Shinsuke Sugawara and he is not talented, I can not believe that the way he delivers the lines is what the director wanted, he does not have many roles in the past and this was also his first main role, I think it was a poor casting choice and I wish someone with even a little more talent or experience had been cast instead. Although, for reasons I’ll get into later, I think they didn’t want to spend much money of voice acting.Chinatsu is a cutie, she’s actually voice by someone talented who has a sizeable resume, thank god. And she’s absolutely adorable, she dose cute things and cute things… she’s really cute. What I’m saying is that the whole point of her character is to be cute, but also to be the person invested in the witch world who also doesn’t know anything about it, and thus the other characters can explain things to her and by proxy, us the audience. Chinatsu takes great interest in witchcraft and the ‘other world’ fairly early on and eventually even becomes an apprentice witch. We’re told it’s possible for her to become a witch but becoming one without being born into it is rare and takes a lot of hard work, which just reminded me of little witch academia, was bound to happen.We never see Chinatsu start to use magic or make potions on her own, she contributes in small ways the what the other witches are doing but overall we don’t see her begin to truly be a witch in any way and for the most part is still in an observing stage of learning. But as I said, she’s just there to be cute and she really is cute, watching her run around and act like such a small child never fails to make me smile and since it’s Iyashikei and is just meant to make me feel good she never really faces much conflict either, things are usually going good which just makes her more happy and thus me more happy.Makoto’s uncle and aunt don’t really do much, the aunt is really chill and fun and a total MILF, way too cute for her age, I like the uncle although he gets even less screen time, he’s got a real thick accent which always translates weirdly to subtitles but it’s a funny enough gag that Makoto can never understand her.Akane is Makoto’s sister and she fits into a character trope that really annoys me. It shouldn’t annoy me cause it’s not a big deal but she’s basically set up as a character that isn’t around much, she’s usually off somewhere and thus she isn’t a part of the story right away. But then, as soon as they’re appear in an episode they just keep showing up and staying around after that, usually there’s some excuse for why they went from always being away to always being present but it still bothers me a lot.So Akane is a set up as a nomad. Shows up for an episode and then goes away again, but next episode they’re talking about her and wondering when she’ll return, makoto says she’s doesn’t show up much and it’ll probably be a few months but then she just shows up there and then. And after that she just keeps being around the house and starts saying she just doesn’t feel like traveling for awhile. I am to an extent glad she’s there, cause she’s a good character but that small aspect will always bother me.She basically acts as a much more experienced witch then Makoto and she’s extremely well versed and has large knowledge about the ‘other world’ and other mysteries things. She helps explain things to both Makoto and Chinatsu (and the audience) often. She’s a pretty important character and I was surprised to learn that she was voice by Kana Aoi who has very little roles, but she did a great job here! I really liked her performance and I think it fit the character super well. Akane is also host to one of the best gags, where she accidentally ends up making a portion of the ocean and land in china black and white, it’s a really weird but artsy scene and I was hoping it would lead into Akane and Makoto needing to restore it back to normal but the show is very episodic.In fact, it’s not even episodic, it’s half episodic, most episodes being broken into two small stories, usually with some kind of connection. Early on most stories take a full episode to tell but it doesn’t take long for the show to become 2 stories per episodes. However there is one exception later on that I really enjoy and that’s the café “arc” can I even call it an arc. The second half of episode 7 is a story about Makoto, Kei, and Chinatsu going to café that’s hidden to normal people and only beings who know it’s there can reveal it and enter it.This café “arc” ends up carrying over into episode 8 and then takes up the entire episode as well. Meaning it takes up 3 sections basically, and it’s a really fun story too, this café has a ghost as a waiter, run by witches and has all kinds of crazy quests. Some of which have really cool designs, like the brining or night who shows up at one point, and then ends up being really nice and gives chiantsu a candy.The whole café section is full of fun little bits that made me smile or laugh or just feel happy and I wanted to stay there, the vibe of the café was great and I really think you could make a whole anime around just this café. I know the whole café with whacky quests is pretty generic but I really did enjoy this episode and I’d say episode 8 is my favourite from the series. Also pretty much every episode after this is consistently really good, the show definitely gets better towards the end.Part of the end getting better is in the increased world building, I already mentioned how the café has a ghost and the bringer of night, which were cool things. But from here on out they really just keep adding any neat idea they have. We see a postman from the otherworld who delivers witch newspaper, we see a whale that flies through the set and has ancient ruins on its back, we see land fish, and all other kinds of crazy creative stuff.The sky whale was a personal favourite, that was a really cool story and if it had been a full episode maybe i would of liked it more then episode 8. It was done with CGI that was actually really well done, the back was a super cool area and it combined with the ruins gave me Laputa vibes, this is another thing that is such a small part of this story but could be expanded into its own series or movie easily. I just love how deep each aspect of this world is, it really makes it feel grand and alive and I hope we keep getting more of both the manga and anime as I want them to continue to add creative ideas while returning to old ones often to expand on them. I don’t know if they return to ideas often but I hope they do.Music is a huge aspect of Iyashikei, at least in terms of when it’s animated. We all know that music can be used as a great mood setter and it would be too easy to destroy an Iyashikei by giving it a poor soundtrack or a soundtrack that doesn’t suit what it’s trying to achieve. This is true of all shows but Iyashikei has the one of the widest erays of things that can’t be used and absolutely won’t work.Luckily flying witch knows what it’s doing in this regard and has a great soundtrack fitting the subject matter and always giving a calm atmosphere. I found myself falling asleep many times while going through flying Witch, now part of this is cause I was watching it late into the night but the other part is that it’s just so calming. Of course I can’t read the subtitles if I close my eyes so if I ever got it the point of closing my eyes for too long I’d have to stop, but I think while this would be an insult to most shows it’s a compliment here. It really did its job well and when I had gotten home after a stressful day at uni this was a great way to wind down and just relax. I’m really glad I got to watch flying witch.If anything I said resonates with you then be sure to check it out yourself, dont focus on the score.

Just read what I said and you can figure out my thoughts fairly easily.', 'Flying Witch is a perfectly enjoyable wholesome anime to watch when you need a break from melodrama or crazy action or fanservice. The anime follows the experiences of Makoto, a witch who comes to live with her non-magical relatives. What follows is a series of pleasant slice-of-life moments as we get to know a little better a varied cast of characters.An interesting choice by the writers is to have most of the main characters completely aware and supportive of the fact that Makoto is a witch, with only a couple of characters actually being surprised by her magical abilities, which do not take up the...focus of the show. The majority of the show are kind-of one-shot stories of the the main character doing something new, and the show rarely revisits old themes. This helps keep the show somewhat interesting with a rotating cast of supportive characters, but it also means there is very little over-arching narrative. A good number of the episodes could be viewed out of order and it wouldn\'t be very noticeable, including the last episode.The biggest problem with the story is that there seems to be little or no growth for the main character due to the lack of a meaningful goal for our main character. One of the episodes highlights this fact when a character asks Makoto if there is anything she is struggling with or worried about, and Makoto is unable to think of anything. The show steers clear of any romantic subplots as well for all characters, and some potential conflicts within the show are addressed once (in the episode they originate) and largely remain unresolved. These little things ultimately led me to begin getting bored with the show, but since the series was so short I instead am left feeling warm, happy vibes and just a little disappointment.I feel like another anime did a better job of presenting a young witch living in a non-magical but largely accepting world in ""kiki\'s delivery service"", but this show was still enjoyable to watch. focus of the show.

The entire series is lacking any conflict or extensive developments, which were far and away the best parts of the show. The sister\'s arrival and the magical phenomena (the mandrake, burning the hair, the black and white river) were the best parts, but overall the series came and went and literally it was just a bunch of characters in a room talking about obvious and/or dull things with almost every other sentence ending in sugoi! (amazing) or eehhhh! They would call such random things amazing. Oh you...own a liquor store, or can spin around in a circle, or like to eat fried herbs, or can make curry? Amazing!That dynamic definitely enhanced the feeling the show gave off of just shallow, fake characters. Everybody was too happy basically all the time, and people would get excited over weird things. Three middle school boys were literally looking at a cat in a tree and say ""Amazing, that cat is so cool."" That just feels dumb to me.I only finished the show because I\'m a completionist and because I wanted to see if they would actually make some type of plot with the reason she moved there (to train as a witch).

However, the story does follow the season i.e. beginning in the earliest days of spring / last days of winter...and ending during the summer matsuri.The story was as simple or as complex as one would imagine the life of a high school student in a rural or semi-urban area of Japan. The “witchy” part of the story was realistic, not flashy, and depicted as something that could easily into daily human life.There isn’t a very strong plot, it is an anime depicting the daily lives of Makoto, Akane and the Kuramoto family. Since there is no strong plot, there isn’t a very strong ending either. However, it is a very satisfactory one i.e. an apt ending for people whose lifestyles depend on the seasons. There is a sense of new beginnings or the story continuing even in the last episode, which is a nice touch.Throughout there is an underlying theme of “It isn’t the place, but the people we spend life with” which is subtlety and wonderfully executed.Art:The one particular thing about the art that I noticed is the breathtaking backgrounds that depict the pastoral and the mountainous terrains of Japan. The artwork captures the charms of spending life close to nature very well. The food is another great part about the art, as it celebrates food as something that is beautiful, and also as something that brings people closer.Sound:The sound goes perfectly well with the series, and is the best thing about the series. The only complain I have is that the “Shan ran ran” of the opening soundtrack comes in too suddenly, and always startled me. Haha.I watched the subbed version. I would particularly point out the voice of Kei. It was so calming and it felt like a guardian spirit guiding me through life with his sound advice.Characters:They were sufficiently well crafted, and their designs matched the overall personalities. They were realistic with their strengths, weaknesses, responses, dreams and motives. There was something in each character that I could relate with or that I found endearing.I specifically liked that women in the series are very well fleshed out, and are not shown as someone whose only purpose in life is a man. Nana has a career, Makoto, Akane and Nao have their dreams and lifestyles. It is amazing.Kei and Akane are my favourite characters here, and the ones that I’ll always remember: Kei for his sweet, calming and guiding nature; Akane for her lifestyle, which is a dream of mine.Enjoyment:Overall, I enjoyed the series. I might not revisit it, for now. I personally felt that it is a series which doesn’t suit binge watching. You gotta watch it an episode at a time, and relish each one. and ending during the summer matsuri.The story was as simple or as complex as one would imagine the life of a high school student in a rural or semi-urban area of Japan.

Unfortunately, Flying Witch proved to be the lesser sorcerer between the two since the anime established itself to be plagued with boring pointless plot-lines which made me wonder why they even decided to animate this train wreck.The story starts with Makoto, the protagonist of the show, moving in to her cousin’s house in the countryside. After that she goes on all sorts of adventures while...encountering different people while training to be a witch. Each episode is episodic so you can watch it on any way you like though some characters will leave you in the dark since you haven’t watched the episode they were first introduced. My personal favorite among the characters is Akane since she is the de-facto witch in the surrounding place and some of the events that happened prior the story would not happen if it weren’t for her involvement which creates the plot for some of the episodes. However, it would have been better if the show introduced a goal other than Makoto training to be a witch for variation but looks like they just want to have a show were the protagonist will encounter every day, real life events and how she will handle on how to resolve it.Well, at least Chinatsu who wants to become a witch is a good distractor instead of just the story focusing solely on Makoto. Because of this most of the episodes in Flying Witch are either uninteresting, lacks zest in its delivery, or just completely unnecessary and has nothing to do with magic. Some of the episodes are fine and funny like the part where Chinatsu was shocked to see Makoto flew for the first time using a broom or where Nao freaked out when Makoto handed her with a live mandrake as a present which I understand it is related to witchcraft. But, how about an episode where it they just picked and cooked butterburs? Has Flying Witch turned into “Cooking Witch” instead? How about the episode where Chinatsu followed Makoto’s cat for half a day while our protagonist just arranged her stuff in her room while the older sister just napped the whole day? Was that exciting or what? And even if they showed witchcraft, it is in a very old fashioned method which takes time to prepare and is an agony to watch. I was hoping witchcraft evolved like time itself in this anime but looks like its still the same stuff they were doing like in the stone-age.Don’t get me wrong about hating Flying Witch altogether; I like the show’s graphics with its clean animation and character designs which is a bit life-like and not the standard big-eyed format seen in most shows, I like the soundtracks though I don’t have any aptitude for music, I like the concept of having witches in a slice of life genre but I guess no matter how good these elements are, boring plots would really kill a show for its worth.ConclusionOverall, Flying Witch may be best enjoyed by a younger demographic whose parents will feel at ease that their kids are watching a show that is not prone to graphic violence. Other than that, then you may want to look for a different show to watch.-DarkdaemonPK2First published on 08/16/2022 at https://myanimeroom.wordpress.com/.

The story pushes Conan into the background and focuses on Kid as the protagonist, but I found that to be more interesting, to be honest. There's also a pretty good twist on the story that I won't spoil here, but it was a good change of pace.The art is about on-par with the early Detective Conan TV series. It's good, I enjoy the character designs, and everything moves well enough... but there isn't any overly impressive or...flashy sequences.

All of the new characters don't really have the time to get too well developed over the course of 25 minutes, but the OVA still tries to give them a little bit of depth. By the end of it, I still managed to enjoy the moments the new characters had on screen... and I'd definitely like to see some of them return in future episodes.Overall, I really enjoyed this OVA. Parts of it definitely seemed somewhat average, but it really shined in other parts. Out of the Detective Conan OVAs I've seen (That is, the first four), It's definitely my favorite so far.I give this OVA a 7/10 flashy sequences.

Ningen Shikkaku: Director's Cut-ban,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7651/Ningen_Shikkaku__Directors_Cut-ban,"['This film is just the first arc from Aoi Bungaku, comprising the events of the book ""No Longer Human"", compiled into movie form. In this form, it won the Platinum Grand Prize at an Italian film festival. From what I have seen it seems like there is almost no sign of any difference between the series version and movie version except the ED being spliced out for obvious reasons, so you could just watch the first arc and rate this instead. As for my own opinion, this arc was fantastic. If there\'s any part of Aoi Bungaku you watch, make it this one. ']"
Hello World,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38816/Hello_World,"['""I just wanted to see her smile again.""Well, well. What have I got to say... That was some pretty good words coming from a guy who has spent so much time trying to get her to wake up again. This Sci-Fi romance film was something I wouldn\'t have expected to be extraordinary, I kind of kept my hopes down for the entire film. But after watching the movie, it felt... decent? good?  I was confused at that point. However, what I CAN say is that the romance was implied pretty strongly on the main character. Spending 10 years to save a girl you literally...just started dating with? That\'s some sheer determination there my good old friend. Enough sputtering filler phrases, let me start my review on Hello World.To begin with, the story felt... confusing? Especially at the end, it might make you go, ""what just happened?"" Well yeah, that was me as well. But if you got confused at any part during the movie other than the last, I suggest you go watch Steins;Gate again to turn yourself into a true mad scientist! (Not sponsored by Dr. Pepper)  However, you got to catch the information quickly especially at the first when it was the most crucial about his future self explaining about ALLTALE Quantum technology. If you missed that, good luck trying to understand the whole movie. If you didn\'t miss that however, good for you then! You have just gotten the whole gist of the movie. Now onto the romance, as a romance-freak, I don\'t know I should be happy or not. But all Naomi did was just follow his future self\'s instruction and got her in the basement. Why can\'t that happen to me as well? I want my future self to get me a girlfriend too! Sadly, this is indeed a Sci-Fi movie so I cannot complain and whine about it, but still!Now onto the art & animation, which the art felt lackluster in emotions for a Romance film. However, do keep in mind that this a full CGI film, so get ready to see some wack animation. I only noticed one however, but it downgraded the whole thing since that animation was literally one of the simplest ones that is given a lot of time, I can probably do it as well. Back to the art, although lackluster, there were a few scenes that were incredibly cute thanks to the visuals. So it depends on whether you care about the Romance or the Sci-Fi, and then you see it yourself from a specific viewpoint then on. What I have to seriously criticize on however is the amount of color they used in the movie. Oh my lord there was so much rainbow beams shining everywhere my eyes actually hurt from watching. That is one thing I want everyone to take note of : A LOT OF RAINBOWNot to mention, the music was pretty dope. It\'s honestly personal preference though since we all have different tastes in music. But for me, I loved it. As for the voice actors, they\'ve honestly done a pretty good job at... doing their job? There were some moments however that should\'ve been implied harder than what was screened. So... director\'s issue? I don\'t understand the industry that much so I assume I have no say in something trivial like this. But still, good job.Okay, Ruri and Naomi were so cute together it just felt amazing. (and then the story went downhill from there but let\'s not talk about the sad times) | Naomi in the future felt like a how a mentor should feel like, although there were *some* ""disagreements"", he has done his part well at tutoring himself in the past. Naomi in the past wasn\'t a wimp either, you can see the his development throughout the story through sheer willpower to save Ruri. He isn\'t that wimpy kid that doesn\'t even dare to enter the library anymore, he is a reliable and independent teen that people can rely on. As for Ruri, the only true character development she got was only when she is with Naomi. But without her, this whole story wouldn\'t have existed so she is still crucial for the story.Haha, I know everyone is waiting for this. If you hated this movie, you will want me to type here : I hated this shit 0/10 no watch pls. Vice versa, if you loved this movie, you will want me to type here : I loved this movie omg 10/10 pls watch. I\'ll be honest here, I have mixed feelings for the movie. For me, I love sci-fi theories and I read a lot about them. So naturally I understood and enjoyed the movie. But at the same time, I love to look at things on an unbiased scale. What about the people who just came here with no knowledge of sci-fi whatsoever? Will they know what\'s the butterfly effect? A parallel world? A paradox? Naturally, they will get confused and not enjoy the movie as much as I did. Personally, the romance contributed a great factor for those who did not understand the sci-fi stuff IMO. As I said above, I am a romance-freak, so I savored every moment of romance the movie contained. Now for the big revelation, I will get my enjoyment an 8/10.Overall, if you have epilepsy, I will not recommend this movie due to the amount of colors and the motion. If you do not however, I can recommend it if you like Sci-Fi or romance. Or else, if you just like anything you watch then why are you here? Go ahead. However, if you are a critic that hates CGI, romance and time traveling. Then please, do not watch this. I already warned you beforehand. Well then, signing off.

El Psy Congroo', 'I was going to hold this review back, but upon seeing what made it to the forefront of the reviews, I thought some differing opinions could spark conversation.TL;DR Score: 5 - First half good second half bad.Incidentally, you watch Another World AFTER this movie.Story:Most of the problems stem from the flawed and convoluted story. To put it simply, it\'s split into 2 parts. The first part is a fairly pleasant romance drama. The second part is mostly an action flick with scifi themes. I also don\'t mean that there are 2 stories, rather that the 1 story really shifts gears halfway through...following a decent plot twist.The first part is actually reminiscent of Orange, although with the key difference that the future MC time travelled instead of a letter. Basically, the future MC aims to hook up present MC with a girlfriend to avoid later tragedy. This is actually pretty good, because the future MC is a very decent character with fun interactions (I\'ll get back to this later). The pacing is well done because we\'re always on the edge of our seat to see how the Naomi (the MC) and his future self manage to pull off this unlikely romance. Part of why I say it\'s good would be because I\'m partial to character drama, but even if it wasn\'t amazing it was still enjoyable. Unfortunately most of this part is retroactively made worse by the fact that most of the plot here doesn\'t actually make sense when given information from the second part. In addition, most of the events that future Naomi ended up changing weren\'t necessary at all because they would\'ve happened anyway. The only reason that the ultimate goal ended up being so difficult was because all the previous unnecessary changes pinged the ""antivirus"". It was still enjoyable in the moment at least.The second part is mostly cheap action scenes with some scifi themes overlayed on it. When I say cheap, I mean that the amount of action scenes is disproportionate to their relevancy to the plot. It just seemed like an excuse for animations, and in my opinion they went on for far too long. This shift in focus was extremely unwelcome to me, personally. The second part also has another plot twist halfway through, but unlike the first twist, it is barely expounded upon and seems likely to confuse the audience unless they do some mental gymnastics. At the very end of the movie they reference that twist again (and failed to explain it again), and by that point most of the audience forgot about the twist because they didn\'t understand it so they\'re confused again. As a result the ending is not very satisfying, even as someone who >mostly< understood the twist (I have some grievances with it but I\'ll assume it makes sense). I saw some other reviews compare the twists to Steins;Gate, and I disagree here not because the twist wasn’t complicated, but because unlike Steins;Gate it establishes the rules, makes a plot twist by breaking the rules and implying the rules were false, and completely fails to properly establish what the true rules were in the end. So basically, it is extremely unforgiving to those who miss clues or such, which is not a good thing. People who are proud of understanding the plot twist should be proud, but that’s not good for a movie that supposed to have widespread appeal. Perhaps they could’ve spent more time on explanations rather than incessant action scenes.Something that perhaps only I didn\'t enjoy was that the technology was rooted in reality to the extent that I completely failed to suspend disbelief when they begun to stretch it. To try and explain one example without spoiling, for some reason specific data can only be moved but not copied... for some reason... when the data was originally a copy to begin with...Another stretch was the hilariously impractical visual portrayal of the antivirus.Art:It does fairly well when it sticks to 2D animation and some simple 3D animation (like during the romance drama scenes in the first half). When it tried to do more dynamic 3D animation, although sometimes it looks pretty good, it ends up looking atrociously bad at times. I only have the impressions of when I watched it in cinemas, but I remember thinking that some action scenes look like they could\'ve been made in Counterstrike (edit: on rewatch this holds true, although they\'re sparser than I remember). The overall variable quality of the animation actually did end up detracting from my enjoyment, which I consider to be very unusual considering the fact that this was a movie.Sound:Unfortunately I did not pay too much attention to sound, but it was pretty good and I don\'t remember any music being used in inappropriate contexts or such.Character:These were good when they were the spotlight of the movie, rather than 3D fight scenes. Naomi is rather generic, but at least he has some personality. Future Naomi\'s snarky attitude and overbearing nature was actually pretty great. Ruri\'s personality was sufficient to understand why Naomi would be attracted to her, and they have cute interactions. One thing that I did find fairly amusing was how Ruri, despite having no knowledge of the scifi shenanigans, just completely rolls with everything when being thrown into the deep end during the second half.One characterization moment that I did appreciate was when they showed how Naomi\'s passive nature affected his everyday life, and later contrasted it with the personality of Ruri. Although perhaps it was a bit on the nose, it worked and was a nice touch.One characterization moment that I didn\'t appreciate as much was how they developed future Naomi, because he ends up being a bit of a lone wolf character despite the fact that he didn\'t really need to be and that nothing in his backstory would suggest such a thing. He seems to have very good relations with his coworkers and such, but does not confide anything to them. This had fairly heavy implications on the plot as well.Enjoyment:Although I enjoyed watching the first half, the incessant action scenes and incredibly convoluted nature of the second half drained all the enjoyment out of me.Overall:I gave it a 5, mostly carried by the first half. following a decent plot twist.The first part is actually reminiscent of Orange, although with the key difference that the future MC time travelled instead of a letter.

As a result the ending is not very satisfying, even as someone who >mostly< understood the twist (I have some grievances with it but I\'ll assume it makes sense). I saw some other reviews compare the twists to Steins;Gate, and I disagree here not because the twist wasn’t complicated, but because unlike Steins;Gate it establishes the rules, makes a plot twist by breaking the rules and implying the rules were false, and completely fails to properly establish what the true rules were in the end. So basically, it is extremely unforgiving to those who miss clues or such, which is not a good thing. People who are proud of understanding the plot twist should be proud, but that’s not good for a movie that supposed to have widespread appeal. Perhaps they could’ve spent more time on explanations rather than incessant action scenes.Something that perhaps only I didn\'t enjoy was that the technology was rooted in reality to the extent that I completely failed to suspend disbelief when they begun to stretch it. To try and explain one example without spoiling, for some reason specific data can only be moved but not copied... for some reason... when the data was originally a copy to begin with...Another stretch was the hilariously impractical visual portrayal of the antivirus.Art:It does fairly well when it sticks to 2D animation and some simple 3D animation (like during the romance drama scenes in the first half). When it tried to do more dynamic 3D animation, although sometimes it looks pretty good, it ends up looking atrociously bad at times. I only have the impressions of when I watched it in cinemas, but I remember thinking that some action scenes look like they could\'ve been made in Counterstrike (edit: on rewatch this holds true, although they\'re sparser than I remember). The overall variable quality of the animation actually did end up detracting from my enjoyment, which I consider to be very unusual considering the fact that this was a movie.Sound:Unfortunately I did not pay too much attention to sound, but it was pretty good and I don\'t remember any music being used in inappropriate contexts or such.Character:These were good when they were the spotlight of the movie, rather than 3D fight scenes. Naomi is rather generic, but at least he has some personality. Future Naomi\'s snarky attitude and overbearing nature was actually pretty great. Ruri\'s personality was sufficient to understand why Naomi would be attracted to her, and they have cute interactions. One thing that I did find fairly amusing was how Ruri, despite having no knowledge of the scifi shenanigans, just completely rolls with everything when being thrown into the deep end during the second half.One characterization moment that I did appreciate was when they showed how Naomi\'s passive nature affected his everyday life, and later contrasted it with the personality of Ruri. Although perhaps it was a bit on the nose, it worked and was a nice touch.One characterization moment that I didn\'t appreciate as much was how they developed future Naomi, because he ends up being a bit of a lone wolf character despite the fact that he didn\'t really need to be and that nothing in his backstory would suggest such a thing. He seems to have very good relations with his coworkers and such, but does not confide anything to them. This had fairly heavy implications on the plot as well.Enjoyment:Although I enjoyed watching the first half, the incessant action scenes and incredibly convoluted nature of the second half drained all the enjoyment out of me.Overall:I gave it a 5, mostly carried by the first half.', 'Been invited to watch this-- advanced special screening in PH. Oct 28.It\'s definitely 100% CG but it\'s not a bad cg. It\'s a very well made cg, consistent, trippy -- there\'s so many ""inception-ish"" going  on and I understand why they made the whole thing in cg.- The characters are likeable like they are straight outta tamako market- The sound design is outstanding 10/10- Story is interesting, some parts are cliche but the plot twist is a bruh moment- art is.. its ajin on steroidsIm gonna rewatch it again when it airs here on the 30th.PS: I enjoyed this more...than Weathering with you. than Weathering with you.', '『HELLO WORLD』Movie ReviewA Sci-Fi Romance Film themed:What if you had the chance to change one important day?

Romance: 10/10.At first it was confusing for me, then I realized ""You\'re lucky if you\'ve already watched Steins;Gate"" as it\'s really the best Sci-Fi anime that ever existed. We go back to the movie, since it\'s a Sci-Fi anime, you would really be confused at first then until there\'s the time where you\'ll finally get the flow of the story.I can give it a 10 overall in the story but there were just some cliche scenes.P.S.That plot twist tho. It made me happy and broken-hearted at the same time.Animation: 10/10 MINDBLOWING!!If you\'re a fan of art or animation scenes then this movie is a must watch for you. There were some aesthetic and realistic sceneries that you\'ll love to see. The movie is CGI overall. ROYGBIV animation means a lot of RAINBOW colored animation and effects.

I could go into an endless stream of comical hyperbole in order to detail this, but I won\'t waste any time. If you\'re already familiar with how bad a Mado Nozaki story can be from Babylon or Seikaisuru Kado, don\'t be. This is much, much worse.Hello World attempts to be a sci-fi romance flick, but unfortunately fails at the latter, and stumbles all over the former. The romance in this film is supposed to be assumed as true, both because our protagonist,...Naomi Katagaki, gets roped into having a girlfriend by his future self, and also because it isn\'t actually developed in any real way aside from a montage of  uninteresting events set to a forgettable J-pop song, sandwiched by scenes of cliched romantic tiptoeing. Right after confessing to his future self\'s girlfriend, Ruri Ichigyou, all romantic development stops and the rest of the film is fully dedicated to the sci-fi aspects of the story, which are just as bad. I\'ll avoid spoilers, but basically the worldbuilding is conveyed either through long, awkward, and cumbersome scenes of expository dialogue, or through vague, confusing, and contradictory ""no actually"" moments. This, I assume, is Nozaki\'s attempts at writing a clever narrative, but instead comes across as two stoner tabletop game DMs having an imagination battle. None of it is truly creative or original, it\'s just a collision of tropes established by other stories.The characters are bland, trite, and have characteristics that are in opposition of each other. Naomi is introduced as the quiet, meek bookworm, but these aspects of his personality are quickly thrown away because they would hinder the plot progression, and he becomes able to process and adapt to reality shattering events with the same mental fortitude of an Elder Scrolls protagonist, and it\'s waved away because he\'s ""familiar with sci-fi books"", which should again clue you in on how creative the sci-fi aspects of this movie actually are. Ruri is introduced as the quiet, assertive bookworm. This is the part where I\'d talk about her, but she actually doesn\'t do anything. She\'s like the flag in a game of Capture the Flag, she\'s an objective, not really a character. If I were to write out all of the dialogue she\'s given in the film, it probably wouldn\'t even fill up two pages. This is the main love interest in a romance movie. Future Naomi is introduced as the reliable chad doing everything for his love, but he spends the entire movie getting cucked, sometimes of his own volition, which is quite unfortunate, but also a little funny, because I don\'t think Nozaki was intentionally going for that. There\'s no particular reason to subject him to that, he\'s written to be a sympathetic character, so I can only assume it turned out that way as a result of incompetence.I should also address the visuals. They\'re not good. The models are pre-shaded CG, meaning the shadows cast on them in scenes don\'t change naturally. A character will look out of a window and his face will be illuminated by the light streaming in from outside. Whether or not he is properly illuminated in this initial position is a different story, but the real disaster comes when he turns his head away from the window and his face remains fully illuminated. Only when his head is a full 180° away from the window do the shadows awkwardly pop in. This isn\'t something everyone will notice on a first watch, but once you do notice it, it becomes impossible to not notice, and remains distracting throughout the whole film. Aside from the shading issues, the CG models sometimes use the emotive faces found in a lot of 2D anime, and it always looks strange when they do. There\'s also various visual design choices which look absolutely hideous. For example, Naomi gets a glove that\'s an ultra-shiny teal. It looks absolutely disgusting because it has no visual cohesion with anything else in the entire movie, which mainly employs warm tones and then later an unsaturated aesthetic, and it\'s distracting in every scene that it\'s in. There\'s also lots of things with thin, rainbow colored stripes which look equally awful.In summation, this movie is head-to-toe awful (with the exception of sound direction, which was unremarkable), and is a generally terrible experience, far beyond the acceptable range of bad in the phrase, ""so bad it\'s entertaining"".

Watch at your own peril.', ""This isn't a formal review; it's more of a concise explanation. I suspect many people didn't grasp the ending of the movie, especially those who were expecting a lighthearted romance anime.In reality, it was Naomi who was struck by lightning and declared brain dead all along, while Ruri was the one attempting to save him. Essentially, everything depicted in the movie was essentially a dream within a dream.While both the OVA and the entire movie were animated in 3D, the scene before the credits shifted to 2D animation. This suggests that the simulation exists in 3D animation, while reality is represented in 2D. Hence, any...scenes presented in 3D form aren't real – why else would they switch to 2D animation at the end? It wouldn't make sense otherwise.Throughout the movie, Ruri was the same crow observing Naomi for three months. It was implied that whoever delves into the past can alter their avatar as they see fit.Ruri ventured into the past to gather data and synchronize Naomi's memories in an attempt to rouse him from his comatose state. Additionally, she was the one who guided him using the crow avatar from the movie's beginning to its end.Please note that this is simply my interpretation and shouldn't be taken as definitive. scenes presented in 3D form aren't real – why else would they switch to 2D animation at the end?

It\'s all good till this part.So, this boy one day gets to meet his future self who came from 10 years later to meet his past self but not so that he could try to change the future regarding the...tragedy that is yet to come for Ruri but instead he reveals that this world is all a simulation and all he wants to do is capture some joyful moments of Ruri. But it\'s all a trainwreck after it, could be spoilers so I am skipping out on it.Art and Animation 9/10Even tho it\'s CG but it\'s the good kind of CG, it\'s only disturbing for couple of minutes but then you get used it. For me, the background art was most astounding aspect of this movie, seeing Kyoto in an aesthetically rendered version of itself was really blissful. Can\'t say the same for character art tho, they were very similar to KyoAni.Sound 7/10The aural aspects actually made me enjoy this trainwreck of a movie, specially the insert song for the ending sequence. Even still I don\'t really remember any other outstanding soundtrack from it.Characters 4/10The character models and character writing was all pretty generic. First of all the main characters looked like they\'re stolen from KyoAni.And there\'s nothing much interesting about the characters in case of writing as well, socially awkward boy falls in love and now will do anything to save his love which includes fucking up a world. And lord, the female lead was so dull, I mean she didn\'t even say a single word seeing her lover do some stupid sci-fi stuff through his hand.Enjoyment 5/10I somewhat enjoyed the movie but too many ""What the fuck is this shit"" moments ruined my enjoyment from time to time.Overall I\'d give it a 5.2, truthfully it\'s another good concept but yet again suffering from bad execution of plot.

This has got to be my favourite movie of all time. I loved how they put so many plot twists because they are ones that just make your heart clench and aaaaaa I just love the format. To be honest I cried 5 times in this movie because the songs and the art and the story are so moving. At first, the only reason I even went to watch this movie was because I saw that Official Higedandism did an ost for this movie and I loved the song. When I actually went to watch it, I cannot...believe how much the song went so well with the movie! I don't really know if it's because it made me cry a lot or I was in love with Katagaya but I really recommend it to someone who like fantasy and romance movies. believe how much the song went so well with the movie!

This is not to say it’s bad: Hello World is sort of a hodge-podge of a film that wound up being rather successful despite also being entirely too ambitious.In the first five minutes, it becomes clear there is quite a bit more to this film then the synopsis would lead you to believe. The actual basic sci-fi elements are strongly reminiscent of The Matrix. The constant escalation of the action sequences involving those powers is reminiscent of classics like Akira. The idea...of trying to bring a dead loved one back is at this point a trope in anime, but in a sci-fi setting (and in large part thanks to the ending) is most similar to Hal. As if that wasn’t enough, it tries to also be a slice-of-life high-school romcom with bildungsroman elements at times to boot. Although it is not as successful as any of those films artistically, it tries to do so many well-worn plots at once it somehow comes off as fresh and interesting. If I described “Matrix but a high school slife-of-life romance with action-packed battle sequences,” it wouldn’t sound appealing at all, but Hello World somehow pulls it off.The plot is rather engrossing overall, but there were definitely times where the hodge-podge nature felt disjointed and overly convoluted. This was particularly true during some of the unimaginative moves during the climatic battle sequences that were startlingly juxtaposed with cliché romance jokes, almost like Evangelion but without a sense of irony. Further, some of the sci-fi elements felt a bit far-fetched and made up on the spot. However, at the end of the day I couldn’t help but enjoy trying to figure out the mysteries of the story as it unfolded, and the final twist left me way more satisfied in the end than I was throughout most of the film. With about twenty seconds left, my thoughts were, “That’s it? That felt like a confused mess?” But the last twenty seconds more than made up for it, tying together some of the most far-fetched sci-fi elements with lines of dialogue at the beginning about the protagonist’s desire to be a more assertive person in a nice, tight bow.Speaking of the protagaonists, the characters are where this movie becomes a bit more cliché. Naomi is a rather stereotypical lead for both a romance and sci-fi anime: kind of a nerdy virgin who is socially awkward, especially with the opposite sex. It’s nothing special, but I guess characters like that are tropes for a reason because it sort of works. His older self is a bit more interesting given his sense of passion for Ruri. Ruri herself starts out with a strong personality, but she kind of fizzles out into just another forgettable stand in for a love interest towards the end. Most of the other side characters aren’t very important, but the more colorful personalities are hinted at well enough in subtle ways, like the eccentric professor at Keito university.However, the area where this film fell most flat was in the animation and directing. Most of the fights felt very disjointed and awkwardly directed, with some rather obnoxiously low flame rates juxtaposed with overly fluid character movements creating an uncanny valley effect. Overall, the animation was riddled with corny-looking CG that was implemented rather poorly. The film had its moments of artistic competence, a lot of the background sets of Kyoto’s cityscape and streets were realistic and evocative (ironically enough, I saw an ad for this in Kyoto tower last month, which is especially funny given the climactic scene of the movie), and the more slice-of-life montages created a sense of character and relationship development very subtly with meaningful repeated transition motifs that were well animated. There was probably one or two music sequences too many, but they were well-directed enough to create a sense of nostalgia for the film. But, overall, the artistic direction felt even more like an incoherent hodge-podge than the plot, but unlike the plot was not tied together with a nice denouement. As a result, it felt more like a TV series with different episodes directed by different studios than a polished feature film in terms of animation.Overall, Hello World is nothing overly special like I was hoping for given the high-quality looking adverts and glowing reviews. It’s a perfectly fine film that dabbles in clichés, but spins them together enough to be interesting and with enough unpredictable twists to pique the interests of sci-fi, romance, and action fans alike. Further, the intriguing ending makes it worth the watch alone. If the art direction were a bit more refined and the characters a bit more original, this would’ve been a significantly better film.Plot: 8/10Character: 5/10Art: 5/10Sound: 6/10Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 6/10 of trying to bring a dead loved one back is at this point a trope in anime, but in a sci-fi setting (and in large part thanks to the ending) is most similar to Hal. As if that wasn’t enough, it tries to also be a slice-of-life high-school romcom with bildungsroman elements at times to boot. Although it is not as successful as any of those films artistically, it tries to do so many well-worn plots at once it somehow comes off as fresh and interesting. If I described “Matrix but a high school slife-of-life romance with action-packed battle sequences,” it wouldn’t sound appealing at all, but Hello World somehow pulls it off.The plot is rather engrossing overall, but there were definitely times where the hodge-podge nature felt disjointed and overly convoluted. This was particularly true during some of the unimaginative moves during the climatic battle sequences that were startlingly juxtaposed with cliché romance jokes, almost like Evangelion but without a sense of irony. Further, some of the sci-fi elements felt a bit far-fetched and made up on the spot. However, at the end of the day I couldn’t help but enjoy trying to figure out the mysteries of the story as it unfolded, and the final twist left me way more satisfied in the end than I was throughout most of the film. With about twenty seconds left, my thoughts were, “That’s it? That felt like a confused mess?” But the last twenty seconds more than made up for it, tying together some of the most far-fetched sci-fi elements with lines of dialogue at the beginning about the protagonist’s desire to be a more assertive person in a nice, tight bow.Speaking of the protagaonists, the characters are where this movie becomes a bit more cliché. Naomi is a rather stereotypical lead for both a romance and sci-fi anime: kind of a nerdy virgin who is socially awkward, especially with the opposite sex. It’s nothing special, but I guess characters like that are tropes for a reason because it sort of works. His older self is a bit more interesting given his sense of passion for Ruri. Ruri herself starts out with a strong personality, but she kind of fizzles out into just another forgettable stand in for a love interest towards the end.

That said, I don't think that the plot is the main appeal of this movie. That honour is reserved for the interactions between the main 2… well… I guess technically it’s 3, (I’ll get to that) main characters.We follow 16 year old Naomi Katagaki. One day he happens to meet himself from the future. A...bit on the enigmatic side but the older Katagaki declares that he came to help himself get a girlfriend. Not just any girlfriend. The girlfriend he had and lost due to an accident. The older Katagaki wants to be called “Sensei” so I’ll oblige, it will make it easier. Sensei tells Katagaki, to his shock, that the world he inhabits isn’t the real world. It’s just a record of the past saved in the memory of a super computer called Alltale. Katagaki takes it pretty well and agrees to help. Now Sensei has 3 months to teach Katagaki how to use a special tool to manipulate reality around him and how to get closer to Ruri Ichigyou and how to save her. But not everything is what it seems for both Sensei and Katagaki.Yeah… I told You it gets needlessly complicated. Let’s meet the cast.Naomi Katagaki - a 16 year old with passion for books and social skills close to zero. He reads self help book and tries to apply the knowledge in life but he fails everytime.Ruri Ichigyou - Katagaki’s classmate with a passion for books equal to his own. She’s assertive, reserved and doesn’t let people get too close easily.Sensei - Naomi Katagaki from 10 years in the future. He’s kind of a dick but the kind You can’t really hate. Despite him having a very specific goal he helps Katagaki out even when it could interfere with it. After losing his Ruri he became obsessed with seeing her again.To be fair there isn’t much to say about the cast without going into some spoiler heavy ground so I’ll stop with this.Like I said before the plot is a real train wreck when it comes to logic. Sensei would have achieved his goal even without, or just minimal, interactions with his younger self. But we wouldn't have a movie then so let’s roll with it for now. Sensei’s and Katagaki’s interactions are pretty solid. Sensei starts out as this know it all, holier-than-thou prick prick who guides Katagaki to his perfect girlfriend and doesn’t warn him when he’ll get slapped, only to turn into someone who could actually care for his protégé. He even allows Naomi to make a rather significant change to the past by helping him with his book problem.Now if You see the problem with the last statement than don’t worry, I’ll get to it.Katagaki’s and Ichigyou’s interactions are pretty solid as well. They start out as strangers and we actually see how they grow on each other with time. To the point that Katagaki actually wants to save her for himself and not only because he made a deal with Sensei. Yes, it is a bit rushed (It’s only a 97 min movie after all) but at least we get something to justify their affection. Now… across some scenes it’s made obvious that Sensei is a man with a plan, and that plan culminates with a big F-U for Katagaki just second  before hi and Ichigyou kiss.So let’s get down to it… the plot.It sucks. It makes little to no logical sense and even I had problems with suspending my disbelief. Let’s start with the obvious. Katagaki's world is described as a record, as in a recording. As in something that shouldn't be able to change, let alone interact with and respond to the viewer. It’s not described as an AI simulation or anything that could pretend to make sense. It’s described as a record. And still Sensei couldn't get the info he needed sooner, he just had to take Katagaki for a ride.That said, the ride in question is the problem in itself. It’s a record, Katagaki and Ichigyou would still get together. Ichigyou doesn’t need to be saved from the accident for Sensei to get what he wants so why even bother?The second problem is the fact that the movie is divided into two separate arcs with totally different tones. The first one when Sensei guides Katagaki is a pretty solid slice of life with a little bit of drama and comedy. I liked it. It wasn’t anything groundbreaking but the interactions between characters elevated the whole thing. The second is… yeah… it’s a ripoff of the last part of “Paprika '', only worse in every possible way. Basically we go from a dramatic moment that ended the first arc to an action flick that culminates with a battle with a damn kaiju. The reasons for that are so bland and nonsensical that I want to believe that someone lost this part of the script and they had to improvise.The way the story is resolved is also bad. But it would be a spoiler so I’m gonna just say that my reaction to it was “Seriously? That’s all?” and leave it at that.The show tries to put a spin on the time travel formula but it fails spectacularly. The plot is easily the worst part of this movie. That said, it's not total garbage. The first arc that focuses on interactions between our main trio is solid. You just need to forget about the needlessly overcomplicated “This is just a record” part of the story. If You can do that, You can actually enjoy a nice heart warming story about two people who realise that they like each other.The movie isn’t bad, it just wanted to do too much with too little thought put into its plot. That’s why I can’t recommend this with a clear conscience but if You don’t mind the logic and are willing to accept the shitshow that is the second part You can have an enjoyable time with this. bit on the enigmatic side but the older Katagaki declares that he came to help himself get a girlfriend.

It is not something as generic as weathering with you or Your name. Reading some reviews which have mixed ratings for the ending, I would say it is deeper and require deep understanding. Just note that it requires overthinking to understand the ending and not just with the ""oh"".I\'ll divide the art into 2. The artwork itself is beautiful. The way they draw the characters are clear and the contrast works with the Sci-Fi genre. However, the animation or 3D...animation felt very rush. They way they ran, the way it was animated felt odd.It is a very subjective matter. In my opinion, I have been spamming the song a lot even before I watched the movie. It suits my taste and it just moves to the groove. Though maybe there is 1 song that I didn\'t like, however it felt like the genre is just right for the moment.The character design, on the other hand, is unique. The male and female MC could\'ve improved a little bit since the voicing felt a bit off from the animation and the situation voice felt weird at times. There is Rie Kugimiya but.. as expected from her I guess. (FYI: when her voice appeared, the fanboy in me... let\'s not continue with that). The character\'s portrayal is interesting and the way they showed the adult version and young version with their views and struggles are definitely a plus point.Also, for those who reviewed as steins;gate carbon copy or time travel genre, it is not and from the start, it was never meant to be a carbon copy. So, please stop with the ""time travel"" cause it clearly wasn\'t meant as an actual time travel anime.Overall, I enjoyed it even more so than weathering with you(I watched it twice in the cinema). Some parts felt like they were rushed due to deadlines but the story was covered pretty well and they did not really leave out much details for the audience to overthink it.Though the ending does gives you the need to over assume how and why it happened. animation felt very rush.

I just finished watching this movie earlier and i have a lot of things i want to say about this Anime but first of all i want to say that this movie exceeded my expectations. when i first saw the movie trailer and at the same time knew that it was the same company who makes the movie Kimi No Na Wa and Weathering with you possible (by all means, i\'m fully aware that Hello World was not created by the same author as the 2 anime i mentioned above which is created by makoto shinkai), i admittedly expecting it to have an...open ending but it i was mistaken, So without further a do this is my full review about Hello WorldStory: I wont bother telling the summary cause you can read it here on MAL. So for starters the story was pretty interesting(Note: i read some part of the source material ,so i have a vague idea of what will happened in the story), The Story revolves around a certain boy who\'s so indecisive and a girl who has strong personality, sooner and later they became friends and the story moves with this development. The Anime has a concept of time travel(Technically), A Big Bang(yep your reading it correctly) and a romance/comedy( yup this going to be a sweet vanilla sugar story so if you a have high blood sugar then.... nah watch it anyways, its worth it!). What i love about this movie is they ended it with a conclusion(no left hanging and no plot holes) Score: 10/10Art: What should i say about this? The art and the animation won\'t disappoint you. Score: 10/10Sound: OH my goodness should i mention that i\'m listening to the song while writing this review(yup i definitely should and already did it) cause that\'s how good the songs and soundtracks they put in this Anime. Score 10/10Character: I think i found a new waifu <3 aside from new waifu the character development of each main characters was notable and amazing. Score: 10/10Enjoyment: Oh boi I enjoyed this movie so much and i really think that this movie was far superior compared to Kimi No Na Wa and Weathering With you(At least for me). Score : 10/10 would rewatch this definitely.Overall: if you read my review there\'s nothing much to say Here aside from one world to describe the Anime Movie and that it is a ""MASTERPIECE"" Score:11/10 open ending but it i was mistaken, So without further a do this is my full review about Hello WorldStory: I wont bother telling the summary cause you can read it here on MAL.

Mainly because of how its all 3D animated and sci-fi romance isn\'t really my type. What got me into watching this movie was because the trailer claimed that it was from the same company that made Weathering With You and Your Name and you know damn well how great those movies are so I had to give this one a chance.Let\'s start off with the the pros of the movieThe biggest point I can personally think of after watching Hello World was the animation, art and the soundtrack....Despite the whole movie being CGI, they did such a great job with it that I first thought to myself, ""Am I really watching a 3D anime?"". The scenes were very crisp and did not look choppy at all, the animation looked realistic and the art made it really seem like a 2D animated movie. The soundtracks also complimented the scenes very well, when an action is happening, the soundtrack playing makes you really pumped. When some romantic scenes happens, there\'s a piano track to suit the scene. Honestly, these points are all the great points I also thought about after watching Weathering With You and Your Name.Now for the cons of the movieI\'ll have to say the weakest point of the movie are the characters and the story. I personally like the character designs of the movie (kinda like Shinkai\'s works where the main characters dont stand out too much from the rest of the cast) but it lacked in character depth(?) should I say so myself. Ichigyo Ruri is definitely my favorite from the cast but damn she had no backstory at all! (or idk maybe i was dozing off when that happened lol) I felt like they could have done more to Ichigyo to make her more interesting like telling her backstory or at least giving the reason why Naomi liked her in the first place. The story was way too focused on the two main cast which are both the same characters but from different timelines just trying to get Ichigyo to like him. Aside that the story gets more confusing the longer it went especially the ending which I\'m not going to spoil, what I\'m just going to say is that the ending felt so much like Fireworks. Pure confusion.Overall, I give this movie an 8/10 rating. The movie was very enjoyable and had an unexpected twists, I honestly didn\'t expect this much action but I liked it actually. The art, animation and OST is really amazing but it kinda lacked in character depth and story. I do recommend watching this if you are a fan of Shinkai\'s work as it had just as eye-catching scenes.Thanks for reading my dumb review of the movie lol Despite the whole movie being CGI, they did such a great job with it that I first thought to myself, ""Am I really watching a 3D anime?"".

There were many takeaways from Hello World, and I think the biggest thing for me was that sometimes you’re gonna have to let people go, everybody who is in your life is meant to be apart of your journey, but not all of them are going to stay to the end.It’s intriguing to see Ichigyou be mostly unphased, even as she sees her boyfriend literally summon a black hole from...her hands. She is placed in a ridiculous predicament, yet she never questions the state she’s in, the world she’s come to know, and Naomi’s incredible power.The ending we received was very eye opening, as we get to see this recreated future with Naomi and Ichigyou on an entirely new world. I am slightly depressed to see Ichigyou’s cuteness diminished over the years.Story: 8/10Hello World introduces a really unique plot and concept. The story does contain cliches, but the concepts shown throughout are stellar. For whatever reason, animes that alter with timelines are usually really appealing and amazing, this film is no exception. I’m pretty sciency and philosophical, so I really took to the entire idea of the ALLTALE Quantum tech. I thought it was really interesting to see this perspective, where it’s possible to go back and forth with the present and past. Hello World bears similarities to Steins;Gate, as they are both Sci-Fi romances, and introduce some similar concepts. Both are great in their own right, and I really enjoyed both. That plot twist was well…a plot twist, and it was extremely suspenseful and exciting at that.Art: 9/10Initially you can see the flaws with using C.G.I in the characters, but later it gets unnoticed. It’s understandable, and was necessary for this film to be C.G.I given the objects we would see in the second half of the movie. The characters look very similar to that of Kyoto Animation, and I’m all for it. There were some great examples using C.G.I in this film, like when Naomi starts to alternate universes. Holy, that beautiful rainbow we got treated to in the end was really amazing and beautiful.Sound: 10/10Sound design was really god damn good. The application of music and sound effects in their scenes were perfect, especially toward the end. I could download the entire Hello World soundtrack and listen to it on loop. The voice actors were also pretty good, and I felt like they fit the roles really well. Of course their voice acting wasn’t out of this world, but nevertheless they did a good job.Character: 8/10All the characters don’t have all that much depth, the most depth we get is in future Naomi. That being said, Naomi and Ichigyou look so good as a couple together. I heavily respect Naomi's drive to do what he does, and he does a really good job being a mentor to his past self. Naomi’s past self isn’t much of a slouch either, the progression of this Naomi we get to witness is nothing short of impressive. Ruri doesn’t go through much character development, however Ichigyou is stupiddd cute, and she slightly reminds me of Azusa from K-OnEnjoyment: 9/10It’s been quite a while since I felt emotional about anything, and even though that farewell between the Naomi's was slightly cliche it still felt wholesome and impactful. I’m a big sucker for these school romances, and I thought that the romance in Hello World was really enjoyable. Even though there wasn’t much action, I savored every single moment of it. Not to mention that this was a Sci-Fi Romance, with very interesting theories, ideas and concepts that keep your head turning. With technology and knowledge increasing, it’s interesting to see the various possibilities our world has in the future, just a mere 6 years away.Overall: 8/10Overall, my experience with Hello World was extremely good. The themes that were expressed throughout were meaningful, and I think that’s important when you’re enjoying something. Graphinica killed it with this film, and I cannot wait to watch their other works. There are going to be people who critique, but I think you should definitely give this movie a watch. her hands. She is placed in a ridiculous predicament, yet she never questions the state she’s in, the world she’s come to know, and Naomi’s incredible power.The ending we received was very eye opening, as we get to see this recreated future with Naomi and Ichigyou on an entirely new world. I am slightly depressed to see Ichigyou’s cuteness diminished over the years.Story: 8/10Hello World introduces a really unique plot and concept. The story does contain cliches, but the concepts shown throughout are stellar. For whatever reason, animes that alter with timelines are usually really appealing and amazing, this film is no exception. I’m pretty sciency and philosophical, so I really took to the entire idea of the ALLTALE Quantum tech. I thought it was really interesting to see this perspective, where it’s possible to go back and forth with the present and past. Hello World bears similarities to Steins;Gate, as they are both Sci-Fi romances, and introduce some similar concepts. Both are great in their own right, and I really enjoyed both. That plot twist was well…a plot twist, and it was extremely suspenseful and exciting at that.Art: 9/10Initially you can see the flaws with using C.G.I in the characters, but later it gets unnoticed. It’s understandable, and was necessary for this film to be C.G.I given the objects we would see in the second half of the movie. The characters look very similar to that of Kyoto Animation, and I’m all for it. There were some great examples using C.G.I in this film, like when Naomi starts to alternate universes. Holy, that beautiful rainbow we got treated to in the end was really amazing and beautiful.Sound: 10/10Sound design was really god damn good. The application of music and sound effects in their scenes were perfect, especially toward the end. I could download the entire Hello World soundtrack and listen to it on loop. The voice actors were also pretty good, and I felt like they fit the roles really well. Of course their voice acting wasn’t out of this world, but nevertheless they did a good job.Character: 8/10All the characters don’t have all that much depth, the most depth we get is in future Naomi. That being said, Naomi and Ichigyou look so good as a couple together. I heavily respect Naomi's drive to do what he does, and he does a really good job being a mentor to his past self. Naomi’s past self isn’t much of a slouch either, the progression of this Naomi we get to witness is nothing short of impressive. Ruri doesn’t go through much character development, however Ichigyou is stupiddd cute, and she slightly reminds me of Azusa from K-OnEnjoyment: 9/10It’s been quite a while since I felt emotional about anything, and even though that farewell between the Naomi's was slightly cliche it still felt wholesome and impactful. I’m a big sucker for these school romances, and I thought that the romance in Hello World was really enjoyable. Even though there wasn’t much action, I savored every single moment of it.

This is a spoiler-free review.Honestly, the movie is good but not too good nor too bad.Story 6/10:Have you ever felt trying to repeat something in the past because you could\'ve prevented it? The film shows this feeling exactly the way I wanted it to be. The feeling of wanting to take something back from the past, driven by love, forcing you into harsh experiments just to get it back.In all honestly, the movie is good but not too good nor too bad.Why do I say so? It\'s simply because the plot wasn\'t fully showing us what was happening. Some...parts do not make sense because it felt like they were stretching the plot to get to the end. The journey towards the end was really messy. There are a lot of plot holes and unexplained concepts (I won\'t go into full detail because of spoilers). The audience were kept being shown different concepts and the movie kept doing so until we reach the end only scratching our heads. At that time the entire cinema audience were asking each other, ""What really happened at the end?"", ""Why did all of this happen?"". These questions are still yet to remain in our heads due to the lack of explanation and the clarity of the plot.Art 9/10:The use of CG in this film was the main star of the art. The way they used it is like ""eye-candy"". There are scenes where rainbow colors would sprout out of something, and honestly it looks really beautiful. The color schemes of each scenes really fit the feel. The orange-red sun shining around the school balcony makes me feel anxious, the bright greens and yellows of the forests makes me feel happy.  Not only that, the reds in some scenes really show an ""end of the world"" feeling.Not only color exceeded my expectations but the amount of flares from bright sources, such as sunlight and lamps, add intensity and a cinematic feel.Sound 8/10:The soundtracks felt relevant to the plot. The electronic music plays during something sci-fi happens. Overall the use of music made the scenes feel and sound way better. The sound effects were crisp. Although until now the sound of ""monsters"" sounded goofy. The voice actor for Ruri Ichigyo sounded as if she had braces on, which was quite irritating and funny to hear at the same time. Although her voice makes her a rememberable character, props to that!Characters 6/10:I gave this part a fair score because the main character, Naomi Katagaki is generic. I immediately already forgot about him and what he did because of ""genericness"". He\'s the type of guy who follows someone he doesn\'t even know and doesn\'t expect something to go wrong about that. He\'s your typical introvert character from a school setting.On the other hand, Ruri Ichigyo was an interesting character but not original. The character designs are from Yukiko Horiguchi which gave everyone a ""Kyoto Animation"" feel. Not only that but the other characters had a cute and fluffy feeling to it I can\'t explain. Somewhat a charm given to us by Yukiko Horiguchi, who worked for Kyoto Animation.Enjoyment 7/10:The film is enjoyable. It\'s worth talking for a while. The only downside on this part is that the messiness of the overall plot makes it less enjoyable. Also some jokes weren\'t just funny in my opinion.Overall 7/10:The show is enjoyable because of the great usage of CG and colors. The sound makes you feel the film through your ears.

It's such a shame that the concept wasn't thought out entirely, or at least, not explained correctly; what I saw in the first half was really promising, so I guess I got my hopes up.Okay, well, first I'll start with art and sound because those two things are the only things I can talk about with any degree of ease. The sound was alright; I mean, I'm not the biggest fan of just using songs over scores as background music for big moments, but the music...was still fine. The art was awesome, and I wish that I could deny that it was awesome because I hated the CGI on the characters so much, but it was gorgeous. The character designs were good, the backgrounds were bomb, the lighting was beautiful; that being said, the effects were a bit over the top and annoying and, as I said, I detest animation that's primarily CGI based. Not to mention the ten minutes of straight what the hell that made me feel like I had taken hallucinogens. I don't wanna drag on it too much, though, because everything that surrounded the sci-fi stuff-- even if not the sci-fi stuff itself-- was done perfectly.Okay, characters. Not as difficult to talk about as the story, but really where do I begin? There were three characters, and really only two considering Naomi is one person, though they are different from one another so maybe it is three. Whatever. They were... fine? Not really any development beyond the bear bones you needed for the story, and honestly, not a whole lot else either? They had their motivations-- or, at least, Naomi did-- and I understood them, but they were still a bit one-dimensional. Naomi did have a bit of growth for both his real and recorded self by the end, so that was good, but yeah.The discussion of the story is, obviously, what I dread the most about this review. It's concept is simple, but the bones of it still had me hooked in the beginning. I will say I didn't see the twist that comes in the middle, though maybe that's because the plot developments weren't built into the story that well. Everything seemed to happen at a really weird pace, and I suppose that was in an effort to propel the story into the second half where it got... weird. Here's the thing: with the twist the story had, I understand why it went the way it did, but that doesn't mean the execution wasn't badly done. Some parts of it, I understood-- the older Naomi's background, his motives, the steps he took to be where he was. The rest of it was an absolute hot mess. Actually, I'd even say that I understood the plot of the second half-- the problem was that the plot progression and what was happening in the outline of the story made no sense at all. So, sure, I understood what they were telling me was happening but not why those things were written to happen over a potentially better option. The ending, though, actually did make no sense. I didn't understand it; I tried to, it didn't track, and I gave up. In theory, I understand the result of the ending but not the ending itself.Truly, the beginning of this movie was heartwarming and had the potential to be something lovely. I think if the first half of this film were stretched out to be the majority of the length of the film, keeping the tone and subject the same as it was but just elaborating on existing scenes, it would've been a lot more successful. It could've ended with the same twist only done much simpler and shorter and without all the extra bits and characters and combat that the original ending had. Just that little tweak could've made it so much better and a lot more impactful, but unfortunately, what it ended up being was something that felt half-finished. I still enjoyed it for the most part; for about ten minutes in the middle and ten minutes at the end, I was kind of just staring at the screen, but the rest still captivated me. Would I watch it again? Maybe not, but do I feel like I experienced something special? I think I do, yeah. Do with that what you will and decide for yourself. It isn't bad at all, the ending just couldn't quite live up to the setup. was still fine.

No. The movie\'s half-baked, it wanted to tell a love story with a mix of science fiction but in the end, it\'s just a bog-standard romance anime. The ""Science"" in the movie could just be replaced by ""Magic"" and nothing different could have happened. There isn\'t any world-building and in the end, it just fucks us over by just saying that there McGuffin disappeared into some other dimensions...or universes. In conclusion, the movie isn\'t fun and give it watch to know what I mean. or universes. In conclusion, the movie isn\'t fun and give it watch to know what I mean.', 'It\'s a meh. Story lacked conviction. Im very disappointed in how this came out, the concept was very interesting but they downplayed it so bad. I swear this concept has so much potential. Characters were bland, there wasnt nothing going on between the MC and his girl. It\'s hard to think that someone would die for their girlfriend of a month and spend 10 years working on how to extract the ""consciousness"" from recorded data. The only intriguing part is the data. The idea that it isn\'t time traveling had its kown originality to it, thus not having a paradox would be totally logical... Props...to the concept, everything else sucked, thank you, goodbye. to the concept, everything else sucked, thank you, goodbye.', '(NOTE: I\'m a slice of life fan so I am very particular with emotions. This review is ONLY my perspective.)Okay, the movie is ""okay"". There are a lot of things to discussed on why I rated it 6 and why I think this could be better if it\'s a series.First, the phasing is ""fine"" and the music is ""good"". It was slightly overloaded with information but you can still keep up with it. I love most of the music, but some are a bit off especially when they\'re trying to move on to another phase.Second, the characters lack emotions. Now this is very crucial...for me since this would bring an overall impression for the whole movie. Although it\'s easy to read their feelings, it\'s very hard to empathize with them. In short, there\'s a ""detachment"" going on while watching the show. I guess phasing is also one of the factors why I felt like it. But the main factor is they\'re not just prioritizing their emotions and I would say the movie is overwhelmed with its ""sci-fi"" element.Third, poor voice acting. This is also one of the factors why I felt so detached with the characters and the story. I just couldn\'t feel it. There\'s something wrong with their portrayal and I guess they really didn\'t just give enough importance to it. With that simple personality the MC have, they could have done more with his voice because it is ""generic"".Fourth, this is a CG Anime. Now I would say it\'s not a bad attempt to have it as CG type of a show. The animation and action is actually pretty good. But personally, I\'m not just use to watch an anime with a ""video game"" type of look. I guess there\'s just that sense of ""normalcy"" I\'m looking for. I\'m not saying that it\'s bad, it\'s actually a beautiful art and I appreciate how they actually did it because they did explore a different approach on an anime film.Fifth, the unexpected ending was great. I could not tell you the details to avoid spoilers but it surely is mind-blowing. I got a lot of questions while watching the movie like ""Who\'s that lame crow who can talk?"", but that ending answered some of them and that scene alone gave justice to the film.Sixth, we all know that quantum theory is a very complex topic. That\'s why it\'s very hard to condensed it in tiny bits of information, especially when it should not be the focus of the story. But I guess sci-fi fans has no issue on it at all since the concept was used a lot of times already. I only encountered quantum theory in Marvel and DC films plus the mobile online game that I\'ve kept on playing. With that said, do I lack the knowledge? Or it\'s just very complex that I should get over with it and have fun watching the movie without giving it a care unless I want to be a scientist? (LOL)Last but not the least, it would be better if this was made as a series. If this was made like 24 episodes long, all the issues that I\'ve stated would probably be solved. Characters with backstories to support their emotions, phasing is way better, and quantum theory is supported with a lot of important information for it to go along with the story. Plus the viewers would appreciate  the couple ship more and they should be able to empathize with the characters.I find the concept and story interesting with a lots of drawbacks. This anime movie could go on par with ""Your Name"" if it was done better. Despite all the issues, the potential of this film could still inspire people in many ways, and that alone is enough for me to be convinced that it is worth watching. for me since this would bring an overall impression for the whole movie.

There was a lot of great shots that looked amazing, and alongside a good soundtrack this movie is definitely worth giving a watch.The animation was alright for the most part but there were moments where the characters movements just looked too unnatural and pulled you out of the immersion. Personally I'm not a fan of the CGI heavy animation style that was used but they did an alright job with it.The overall plot was interesting and kept me entertained throughout the movie, but it was a little mediocre. The main character didn't really have any motivation during the first half...of the movie, other than his future self told him to do it so he did. Maybe it was because of the animation style but I didn't feel that the characters were expressive enough. Sure they made a variety of facial expressions but I felt that were lacking a bit in human emotions. The main girl was a bit bland. I understand that shes supposed to be a shy and reserved character but they could have given her a bit more character development.Because of what I felt was very little character development I felt that Naomi falling in love was a bit forced. Very little of the two main characters interactions were shown in full, mostly being shown in montages or very short scenes. This made the love story and character motivation this movies downfall.Overall I would give this movie a 7/10 because it does have some redeeming features and is worth giving a shot if you have some free time and are looking for something to watch. of the movie, other than his future self told him to do it so he did.

It sported a deep and intricate plot that pulled at your heartstrings and changed the way you saw life after you saw it. I have not seen a masterpiece of this scale since Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. That's right, Hello World is our generation's Mona Lisa: underappreciated by the masses, but I'm sure future generations will stumble upon this masterwork and question why we could not appreciate it as they do.

The heavy theme that this movie was created around makes this movie have a unique feeling. The concepts are mind blowing, and the romance is heart melting.This review was written on the 10th of April 2020. therefore there may be references to the COVID-19 pandemic.Unfortunately, many people have not been able to watch this movie when it aired because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I highly recommend you buying the blue-ray release to help support the...studio who created this wonderful anime during this unfortunate timing.anyways onto the (spoiler free) review:Story 9/10:The story is themed and based around our rapidly growing technological knowledge. Virtual Worlds, simulated worlds, AI... without giving much away, this movie effectively ties each and every one of these aspects together. There are so many unique concepts and ideas in this movie it\'s crazy. The easter eggs and deep meanings behind many of the small details allows for cool concepts and ideas to be created by the community. This is the first time where I watched a movie and felt that each and every scene had it\'s very own meaning and purpose for being there. However, the one drawback for trying to be so ambitious is that the viewers can\'t help but think that there are many untapped potentials and points in the story. The story teases at some interesting concepts and plot points, but never dive deeper into them. This is most likely because of the budget and time schedule, I really hope an OVA or a sequal comes out to cover the untapped potential in the story and setting. (Although I haven\'t watched the spin-off yet)Art 9/10:Many anime fans are skeptical about fully 3D animes, and rightfully so. Many animes have crappy CGI and bad effects. However I can tell you that Hello World has done a great job with their animation and visual effects. The studio behind Hello World has developed their own unique shaders for this movie, it allows the visuals to be somewhere between normal 2D anime style, and 3D CGI. The animation is fluid, the effects are unique and exhilarating. No problems here, I would have given it a 8/10.... So why is it a 9? It\'s because they had a *reason* for the art to be in 3D... Intentional or not, in the last minute of the movie where the art turns to complete 2D... sit there and think about it...Sound 10/10:The OST track and sound effects for this movie is outstanding, not a trace of royalty free effects nor music. Perhaps they just masked it real well, but that\'s definitely a positive for me. The sound is definitely comparable to that of other high quality animovies such as Tenki no Ko or Kimi no Na WaCharacter 9/10:What do you expect from characters designed by one of Kyoani\'s major character designer? The girls are cute, the guys aren\'t overly cringy. Exactly what you want for a romance movie. (However, I still hate how they keep teasing you about this one character, but nothing ever happens... WHYWHYWHYWHYWH...)Enjoyment 9/10:During this unfortunate pandemic, this movie has definitely taken my mind off many things which I am grateful for. This movie was a blast to watch while I had to stay indoors. I am really thankful for a movie of this caliber to have released their blueray at this time.Overall 9/10:Everything about this movie was exceptional, but the 10/10 deal breaker was definitely the feeling that there were so many untapped plot points and untapped potential. However this isn\'t the movie\'s fault, it\'s already a 90minute long movie with full quality 3D CGI, it\'s already impressive that they made a movie of this caliber.Do you recommend?I *Highly* recommend this movie.I would like to repeat this again here, PLEASE buy the blueray release of this movie... Many studios who unfortunately had their movies release at an unfortunate time such as Violet Evergarden and Hello World are facing immense losses in revenue due to many countries issuing a \'stay at home\' order.

I mean, what could be better than a love story – overlaid with sci-fi themes and time travel. This story had so much potential. I could have overlooked the inconsistencies, the lack of character development, if there was one element that stood out. One element that would draw the reader in.In some movies, it’s the love story, and we can forgive the story other inconsistencies or less developed areas. In some stories it is the world building that captures you. In others still it...is the science behind the world – the exposition of deep philosophical intent. But unfortunately in Hello World, we fall short in every area, with not a single eminent to drive our interest and love we desperately want to give.I felt the writer (Mado Nozaki) didn’t completely buy the story himself. Its like he had some ideas, but something kept him from realizing the narrative’s true potential. He tried to blend stories such as the matrix, inception and closer to the current medium, Stein’s Gate – to bring us something wonderous and thought provoking. Except it fell flat. It felt the ideas were not completely developed and were able to stand a simple reality check.It’s almost as if the story and themes got too big, the science too difficult to explain. The viewer gets lost in trying to find something to connect with and care about. There is so much happening, the focus is lost on what drives the story – the three main characters (if we separate old/young Naomi into two people).I felt the love story was too rushed. I didn’t think the characters had proper, well characterization and motivation. Firstly for young Naomi to grow enough to begin a relationship with Naomi, but secondly – after very little interaction, Naomi devotes ten years of his life and tortures himself just to try and bring Ruri back. I simply wasn’t invested enough in the relationship. And the way Naomi blandly accepts he’s a simulation felt unrealistic and added to the pointlessness of his ‘life’ and my lack of care as to what happened to him.My second main gripe is that Ruri Ichigyou was just a plot device. Her character didn’t develop. She was just there to have things happen to her so Naomi could react. She is cute, and I felt the writer was trying to develop her character, but fell significantly short. She started off cold and aloof, and interesting, but we never got to explore that – or understand why she wanted to change and how or why she was changing. We get no sense of her motivations. Ruri is the a-typical damsel in distress, an object, rather than a person. For this I cannot forgive the writer, no matter how cute the artwork.The science was the aspect of the story that put me off the most. It was like the writer couldn’t bring the concepts together to create a coherent whole. He tried, there was a bit of an explanation, but nothing I was satisfied with. If the science is a motivation, then you need to explain it so I can buy it. It doesn’t have to be a deep and complex explanation, something that sets the rules of the world and gives the characters motivation and a reason for the viewer to care about what is happening. I didn’t buy the science here – in fact the explanation only served to make me care less about the characters, not care more. I didn’t feel like there was enough at stake.Ultimately I believe the elements for a good story were here – but it was let down by some sloppy writing. There was a deep psychological link that could have been explored to give the characters motivation – but sadly, the writers skill or lack of care meant this was not realised.So would I recommend you watch this?

It\'s easier for me to review it for each section instead of overall, so that\'s what I\'ll do.First half: Story-9, Art-3, sound-5, Character-7, enjoyment-8, Overall-7Story for the most part at this stage isn\'t anything special, but the reason why I have it rated at 9 is because the concept of being the main character in just a recording of the real world I think is a really interesting and unique idea. If they had just kept it at this and gone deeper into the moral and...existential conversation about this situation, I think this movie could\'ve really been something. I saw loads of the potential and it made me excited to continue the movie. The romance was decent, but where the first half really shines is the simultaneous simplicity and complexity of the idea they introduced.The art is the only part that I think the second half is better for, as this movie is only CGI because of the stuff they decided to do in that half. I came into the movie not knowing it was going to be CGI the whole way through, and I was very unpleasantly surprised once I realised that this was the case. Maybe it\'s just the fact that I wasn\'t prepared for it or the fact that I haven\'t watched much CGI anime, but it did notably impact my enjoyment for the first twenty minutes or so that it took for me to get used to it. The art style itself is fine.I didn\'t care much for the music. I didn\'t think the voice acting was anything to write home about. Overall average.The characters do have personality traits and the main character in particular does progress as a person in the first half. His relationships with his future self and his girlfriend are pleasant enough to watch and they do develop relatively naturally. Not bad.Overall, if the story progressed in the direction that the first half seemed to be taking it in, I think I could\'ve liked the movie a lot.Second Half: Story-2, Art-6, Sound-2, Character-3, Enjoyment-2, Overall-a generous 3The story is haphazard, they add on several layers of ideas and worlds onto their original plot, not a lot makes total sense, to the point where it breaks the immersion and disinterests you. I was very disappointed. The writers must have realised that the story made little sense because the final scene is a total cop-out. Would\'ve made me a little angry if I still cared about the story at that point.Art is average. I understood why they used CGI. I put it at a six because there\'s a short sequence where the MC is ""dying"" and the abstract art they use there looks pretty cool. I would\'ve given that an 8 or a 9 on its own.I was not a fan of both the music they used and when they used it. My preference. Voice acting was pretty much the same quality of the first half.Very little meaningful character development or interaction as most of the time is taken up by action or trying to explain the oversaturated new storyline. The only character that really develops in this half is the future MC and even then his arc is not very well flushed-out or developed.Overall it wasn\'t bad enough to make me stop watching, but only just. My disappointment is immeasurable. Fortunately it\'s only 1 PM where I am so hopefully I\'ll be able to salvage my day. existential conversation about this situation, I think this movie could\'ve really been something.

You\'ll be asking ""How?"" a lot throughout,  and thinking ""What the hell?"",  and at times this movie plays with your feelings in really weird ways.  Well you\'ll go on this ride,  but you won\'t truly get it until you finish it,  and then all the missing puzzle pieces kinda fit into place.You\'ll either like the explanation for all the weird imagery and plot devices used in this movie,  or you\'ll think it\'s super lazy and you were expecting this all along.  A few shortcomings with...the movie is there really aren\'t a whole lot of notable characters in this story.  There are really only 3 characters and a lot of \'extras\'.

Where the main character would do anything to be with their love again. ""I just wanted to see her...smile again.""The OST used was also amazing and it was a really fitting song for the anime.Overall for me Hello World was an anime i can definitely enjoy.

It deserves attention!For those who does not understand the plot, I don\'t know what\'s wrong with your brain. If you can understand Your Name or any same genre, fret not. ', '""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""TLDR: If you want a more than decent movie with 3D animation so good you want to pause it every five seconds to study each frame, watch this anime.Now here\'s the meat of the review.Animation: 10/10This movie is one prime example on how to properly use 3D CGI in animation. Normally, people would disregard anime that has 3D because it\'s usually bad and doesn\'t flow well with the entire style of anime. However, animation is all about motion. And this movie properly utilized the technology 3D animation can bring in order to highlight motion....Best example of this would be when Naomi was being chased while riding a bike through a city. What makes this special is the first person sequence, and when it changes to bird\'s eye view while he arranges the city like a Rubik\'s cube face. These types of sequences can only be achieved with 3D CGI.And the effects, let\'s not forget that. From the raindrops and how it wets Naomi\'s clothes, wind and smoke, even the time-stop disintegration effect when the Foxes got hit by his book is so damn perfect.Nevertheless, that alone doesn\'t cover how good the animation is. I watched this movie twice just to marvel at the animation during my rewatch.Art&Style: 10/10Not only the animation is good, but the art/style is so crisp and neat as well. Maybe this is also a byproduct of using 3D animation. Usually, I would give it 8. But what pushes this score to 10/10 is the minute details and composition of each scene.What do I mean by minute details? Things like how old Naomi doesn\'t have a shadow, or how the feathers of the crow fall by, or how tears fell in a different direction since the gravity is also at a different orientation. As for the composition, it clearly shows its expressiveness and artistry during the sequence after Naomi fell through the portal.Sound: 9/10Let\'s first discuss the music used in the film. Songs that were used are not bad, instead they\'re good and elevates the scene whenever they appear. They\'re not that special, but what makes these even better is that they made me want to hear more songs from these artists. So that\'s an easy 8 for me.As for the sound effects and sound design, they\'re perfect. As a person who studies foley in film-making, the sound effect is just perfect. The sound design modulates the voices, music and sound effects perfectly. It\'s really evident at the end of the movie when music slightly gets softer to highlight the voice and the sound effects. It\'s really subtle and I like it. Easy 10 for me.Story: 8/10I love anything with time travel in it. Now the first half of the movie is slightly cliche given that the premise has been done numerous times already. This story is not a tear-jerker like Your Name. And to be frank, I was slightly disappointed with its first half. I would have given it a 7, no even a 6 for that. But what pushed this story to an 8 is the 2nd half. It\'s a wild ride baby. The twist at the halfway mark and near the end really solidifies the story as an 8/10.Character: 7/10Ah the characters. They\'re not annoying god forbid, but they\'re neither good nor bad. I think part of the problem here is the voice acting. VAs sound a bit tired causing a dissonance between the cheerful expression on the character\'s face and the bland voice that they produce. Could have been better.Characters get slightly redeemed though. Now good characterization happens if there is good character development, and Naomi, both old and young version, shows a good one. Solid 7/10Enjoyment: 10/10I really enjoyed this movie as you can tell by the TLDR at the top. This movie is like a tech demo for 3D animation that coincidentally has a decent wild story. Don\'t miss this one. Trust me you\'ll have a fun time. Best example of this would be when Naomi was being chased while riding a bike through a city.

Trust me you\'ll have a fun time.', 'This ended up being quite the interesting discover after randomly stumbling across it the other day.""Hello World"" is a Sci-Fi movie with a core theme exploring how far one is willing to go for the person they love.The story will appear to be pretty standard, maybe even a little less than that on a surface level in the first half of the film. At this point, it\'s just the beginnings of a love story for the main characters, Naomi Katagaki and Ruri Ichigyou with the caveat that there\'s a ""guide"" for Naomi Katagaki that comes from someone in the form of himself 10 years in...the future. In the second half of the film you see a lot more of the Sci-Fi elements come to the forefront of the story. Initially I thought some of the directions the story headed towards would have been to the detriment to the film but by the end I thought everything wrapped up in a satisfying manner and made sense.I thought that the Art for ""Hello World"" was great, especially when it came to the background environment but that may have been thanks in part to the film being in 3D/CG. However the 3D then comes to serve as a detriment a little when it came to the Animation as I don\'t think that aspect of the film was the strongest. In particular, there was scene near the beginning of the film that involved a character\'s running animation that I thought was horrible. Funnily enough, there\'s a reason for the 3D/CG that will be made clear as you watch the film where even looking back at that particularly bad running scene I mentioned previously, it made sense and maybe even elevated that scene a little for me.The OST for ""Hello World"" was very good. The tracks had more of Romance anime vibe than a Sci-Fi one if I had to make any other comment on it. Also, the few insert songs that the film had were excellent.The characters may have been the weakest part for the film in my opinion. It\'s not like they were horrible or anything but I also wasn\'t able to fully get invested into them. That may be because the movie run time didn\'t allow for enough exploration of some of the characters that may have been necessary for me to connect with the characters or it just may be the characters weren\'t super interesting by design in the first place.In the end I was able to get quite a bit of enjoyment from ""Hello World"", especially when a came to the ""plot twist"". By the last third of the film, you would be able to feel that something like that may have been coming, but what happens in the end is all what was needed to elevate the film for me.

It almost felt like two different movies stuck together halfway through, since the story had a tonal/genre shift and became more convoluted. I will say I enjoyed the first half more. The second half went knee deep into the sci-fi time-muckery, which can just get confusing on your first watch.The art is very good. The backgrounds and set pieces are simply gorgeous. The character animation is 100% CG, which is only distracting for the first few minutes. Once you get used to it, you can see how well it was executed. Especially in the second half once stuff...started firing up action-wise.Sound design was pretty good, but I felt like the audio was unbalanced somehow. Characters spoke softly and then would yell at a much louder volume. Music and sound effects would kick in loudly as well, so I had to keep my hand on the volume remote.The characters were nice for the most part. Very cute and appealing designs, and cute personalities. Character motivations didn't make complete sense to me in some parts.Overall, enjoyable movie. I don't regret watching it, and I had fun with it.

How much time would you spend to just get one moment, to trade away everything to be with that person even if it's just for a moment.This movie captures the feeling of those who have lost people in their lives. It is a feeling you don't want to experience but one we all will eventually face someday. There is no greater pain then knowing that someone is not there anymore, the emptiness in our heart...that we can't fill up. That void in our heart, no matter how much you try to fill it up you will always just feel empty. We cannot recapture moments we lost, what is gone is gone, we can only create new memories, never redo old ones. But what if you can? What if you can have a second chance?

I have my guesses on what it is, but I'm not positive enough to put it on paper yet.The romance plot is sweet and it has it's cute moments in it. It gives us enough time to build up to their relationship and have those moments that makes you smile and tear up by the end.What issue did I have mainly with this? I ain't too big of a fan of the CGI. By no means do I think it's horrible but it's just very stiff movement at times. It's not that it's unnoticeable, it's pretty noticeable. But it didn't ruined my watching experience by any means at all.Overall, a sweet and tragic story about how love can drive us to go so far. To just have a moment again and to just to be able to enjoy a moment with someone again is something I would myself trade so many years for.

I never really heard about this movie until I went around and found it. I didn\'t really think to much of it and decided to check it out just like any anime (specifically Let me Eat Your Pancreas cause wow that was also a trip).Story:Well f*ck. This movie was a whole bunch of twist and turns that is gonna give you a headache. So, the first half of this movie was about this guy that goes back in time to see his younger self. He tells him to fall in love with this girl...that he used to date, and tells him to work with him to save the girl (the girl is literally the main focus of this movie). He gives him a glove and begins to train the young kid to protect the girl. Then character development until the big scene. First half of the movie was actually really good.Second half of the movie, is well what can I say, a sh*t storm. All you get out of it is a bunch mediocre fight scenes that could be found in your typical Sci-Fi anime. It starts to become more of a ""you can do it if you put your mind too it"" type of movie. I found it to be poorly written and boring. The first half of the movie wasn\'t perfect, but it was really good on how it built up the characters. The second half threw all of that out of the window, and said f it, we are gonna add in a bunch of fights scenes and a confusing and anticlimactic ending to the movie.6/10Art:CG in this movie is better than most I\'ve seen, nothing really that special, but colors are great. Nothing to really complain about.8/10Sound:I always think that a soundtrack molds and shapes a movie, and the soundtrack was above average. It wasn\'t good, but it helped develop characters and made the fight scenes more watchable for me.8/10Characters:The characters were very interesting. It was really interesting to see development in both of the main characters. Their chemistry with each other is very noticeable that you wonder if you could half that type of relationship with someone (LOL). You could see the heartbreak in Sensei\'s eyes when he found out that the girl didn\'t actually recognize him as him. Real tough. Don\'t really have any complaints about the characters.8/10Enjoyment:Enjoyed the movie until the second half, enough said.7/10Overall:Great movie, isn\'t really in my top 10 Anime Movies but it sure is one to watch if you\'re just looking for something to pass the time. You aren\'t gonna waste your time on this one.7/10 that he used to date, and tells him to work with him to save the girl (the girl is literally the main focus of this movie).

Is that sci-fi? Totally illogical and weird..And how come it has infinite storage?How can a computer summon those masked men(like, how does it create something?)Why are people not aware of that?What does Naomi do in the future? How?If it\'s an avatar, how can they shake each other\'s hands?The above are some plot holes (u could say)But other than that, it did a good job explaining the things properly..Like the regular story and the system which holds that data wants to synchronise everything..It tries to erase data which is not present or it tries to protect something if someone conflicts with it..Good logic:)Basic SYNCHRONISATION LOGIC!Rating it 6/10 cuz it has plot holes and bcz everyone can\'t understand it, should\'ve gone into more depth..Art-6/10This is a full fledged CGI animated movieI think they unnecessarily spent a lot of money on this..They spilled a lot of colours making it cartoon rather than sci-fiBut still the art was beautiful..Not sci-fi thoSound-6/10Weakest point of this movieIt never felt amazing and it always felt like ""something is playing in backfiring, but not enough good to make the entire scene flattering""They should\'ve concrete on this bcz the music and rythm could make it even better..The voice actors were good too..Character- 8/10Good characters..Main character Naomi Katagaki and Ruri IchigyoAnd his future self too..All the characters were crucial and made the plot good..However you can find devolpment in Naomi only, the transition from aloof to responsible was quite smooth..The character development never felt rushed unlike the story..His future self has a crucial role but i wished to see more of him..Like how he dedicated himself to overwrite the past and how he progressed with that sci-fi gadgets..We saw his dedication briefly.. but not enough to create an emotional dramaAs a sci-fi movie, they should\'ve gone to more depths, like more interaction between him and the gadgets he use etc.At this point I don\'t know whether I\'m making any sense or not, but you get the point.. I wished more as it\'s sci-fi(Feel free to comment on my profile so that I can elaborate on what I\'m trying to explain)And Ruri Ichigyo is a crucial character, without her the story wouldn\'t have existed lol. Good character, nothing more to say..Enjoyment- 9/10It\'s upto you whether you enjoy or complain about it..Try to watch it as an ordinary movie with little expectations.. you\'ll like it..From the beginning don\'t be like "" the protagonist is boring, I hate this movie"" or "" it\'s not sci-fi"" etc .Just don\'t try to find the flaws while watching it, you won\'t like it that way..Overall- 7/10I have mixed feelings..As a sci-fi, it didn\'t do a great job if you ask me..This movie explored very less SciFi elements..Like, it has good visuals (but they made it too colourful for a sci-fi)The characters were goodStory has its own pros and consGood one to watchI\'ll recommend it..VerdictFor all the people who think that it\'s a bad movie,It\'s a fun movie, it has it\'s flaws sure. But it\'s not bad eitherIt was overstuffed,overcoloured but it sure had a driving plot which will keep you till the end..The 2 main characters are the driving force for me to watch till the endOfc, it\'s the strong point of this movie..Feel free to comment on my profile if you wanna ask something..( I won\'t reply if you trash talk)Peace I\'m not going into the depths and write the entire story here but I\'ll just state the key points..This movie had a simple plot at the beginning but slowly becomes complex because of more and more stuff added.. like it\'s just very simple, an aloof protagonist, but he becomes a serious and responsible person at the endNice:)Main problem with the story is that, it never tried to explain the worldLike it\'s sci-fi, so atleast care to explain what\'s happeningIt did a good job explaining the technology involved in that worldBut it did a poor job explaining the two world term and data copy/transfer thing, ofc I understood what that is, but after seeing the reviews, I understood that this movie hasn\'t gone into the depths of them and not everyone can understand what that is..Can everyone understand what BUTTERFLY CHAOS EFFECT is?Poor world building and the representation was comicalWould you expect an advanced super computer summoning masked men to catch people?

Throughout the entire film, the animation was in 3D but when Naomi Katagaki awoke on the moon, he was in 3D as well as the setting. This is some grade A symbolism even for a small time 2019 film, and I\'m glad I took the chance to look at it.The story was ""very wide and shallow"" I\'ll admit despite being a science fiction oriented narrative. I had thoughts of what...was questionable in response to the virtual worlds and what was real or how would the changes in this world make a difference for the \'real\' Naomi Katagaki 10 years from the future. It was a clever idea to loop that ability for AI technology to predict behaviour of the coma stricken Ichigyou Ruri and repair her damaged brain. It could have gone more in depth of the different virtual worlds and the real world but I guess it\'s part of what makes it a mystery and it\'s passable how as it was.The 3D animation was very smooth and mimicked the 2D style well as opposed to the unconventional low budget 3D anime styles lacking in shadows and expressing depth via 3D models as a compromise. The colorful nature of the film is what appealed to me as well as the amazing soundtracks, both complemented each other well. was questionable in response to the virtual worlds and what was real or how would the changes in this world make a difference for the \'real\' Naomi Katagaki 10 years from the future.

Nothing beats this complex yet fluids perfectly after the theory is debunked (on youtube) the drawback of this show too, as you most likely will need to google to know what\'s happening.What a...great movie, again. great movie, again.', 'Art - It\'s CGI. The 2D portions are acceptable, the 3D portions are not. Nothing remarkable here.Sound - mehStory - Oh boy, where to start. Minor spoilers ahead.The first half had me quite interested. Only, halfway through it devolves into your typical sci-fi story about time-travel with ""quantum"" in it. It\'s just horrible. ""Quantum"" here is an alias for totally weird, of course. Nothing in the middle makes any sense. And there is honestly nothing deep about it either. It\'s just a guy about to die suddenly getting a lot of powers. It\'s cliche and downright cheap. This is the stuff you get when you...hold an author at gunpoint and ask them to write a sci-fi story with time-travel in 2 days.Then you have the fight scenes.CGI galore! You have fight scenes involving someone swinging around a book-on-a-chain(yeah, really), you have people jumping on cinnamon buns ... you get the idea. I wouldn\'t complain if this was something from Mario, but seriously, I cannot find any redeeming point about the fight scenes.Characters - Now these are actually good. Only, they get stuck in a story that is an utter mess. I feel bad for them, really.I can\'t recommend this movie to anyone. There is plenty of good science fiction around - read/watch that instead of this. hold an author at gunpoint and ask them to write a sci-fi story with time-travel in 2 days.Then you have the fight scenes.CGI galore!

I didn\'t expect it to be ""good"" or anything, but I will just say this. The story overall was quite good. It\'s a normal love story, where the main character comes back from the future and wants his love of his life to live and not be dead. That particular thing of a main character wanting to do anything to have his love of his life to be alive, is quite normal in most anime I\'ve watched and found interesting. Even though it\'s quite common for me...to see that, I mostly get bored and have nearly no high hopes for it. Even the way they chose to animate this movie was poorly done. The entire movie would\'ve been so much better if they didn\'t choose to animate it all, except for the ending scene, which I have to say, was quite good. Since I\'ve been watching anime and animated movies every now and then, I can tell when an animation or something like it, is poorly made, and this one is it.Even though I dislike the overall animation part of this movie, I\'d say it\'s worth a shot to actually watch it. I enjoyed it because the story was well done, if I turn a blind eye on the animation.Sorry for making a short essay of some sort, but I\'d say you should give it a try and watch it! to see that, I mostly get bored and have nearly no high hopes for it.

Since I\'ve been watching anime and animated movies every now and then, I can tell when an animation or something like it, is poorly made, and this one is it.Even though I dislike the overall animation part of this movie, I\'d say it\'s worth a shot to actually watch it. I enjoyed it because the story was well done, if I turn a blind eye on the animation.Sorry for making a short essay of some sort, but I\'d say you should give it a try and watch it!', ""Coming from someone who read the book, the book is meh and this film is horrible.STORY 3/10The story in the book is fine, it gets kinda convoluted and not making much sense near the end but then the entire premise doesn't logically follow to begin with. If you bought into the premise then the abstract and vague nature of the ending is not much of a stretch. It's a little silly but hopeful and imaginative. The issue is that the feel of the book is not communicated in this movie at all. I've seen people theory crafting and claiming this film's plot is elaborate and...even comparing it to Inception, which is an insult to Inception. The film isn't more than what meets the eye; it just does a bad job at explaining things that the book explicitly stated. Outside of that it skips details that help you understand the significance of most of its emotional scenes and flat out feels like an uninspired and minimalist adaptation of scenes from the book.ART 2/10I've seen those with the gall to say the animation and CG is good or even impressive. It's not. The CG is laughably bad at times and the only interesting moment of animation comes from one more trippy sequence near the end. The character designs are boring, Ruri looks somewhat ok. All the characters have one facial expression that they have for pretty much all of the film. Hardly any of the personality or charm that scenes in the book had are expressed through the animation and it comes off feeling incredibly flat and unengaging.SOUND 1/10The sound gets a 1. It's fucking awful. The voice acting will put you to sleep. The insert songs are cheesy and dumb. You will be laughing at how hammy it comes across. The actress playing Ruri had a partial lisp for some reason. These are C list voice actors at best.CHARACTER 3/10The characters in the book are more distinctive then they are in the film. Again this is due in large part to flat adaptation and script that leaves out a lot of the details. I'd be willing to bet some people who haven't read the book wouldn't have caught on to how the main characters were meant to be portrayed because they simply aren't characterized in the film the way they are in the book.ENJOYMENT 2/10This film is boring. It's tacky, cheesy, it sucks and I didn't like watching it.OVERALL2/10 even comparing it to Inception, which is an insult to Inception.

She...likes books, has a stubborn side, struggles to understand her smartphone, and is straightforward. These are character tropes that are shown in a montage and her character is not explored further than that.I loved the music in this one, very well done.Animation was a bit annoying at times but i love the colour palette. likes books, has a stubborn side, struggles to understand her smartphone, and is straightforward.

At this point, it\'s just the beginnings of a love story for the main characters, Naomi Katagaki and Ruri Ichigyou with the caveat that there\'s a ""guide"" for Naomi Katagaki that comes from someone in the form of himself 10 years in...the future. In the second half of the film you see a lot more of the Sci-Fi elements come to the forefront of the story. Initially I thought some of the directions the story headed towards would have been to the detriment to the film but by the end I thought everything wrapped up in a satisfying manner and made sense.I thought that the Art for ""Hello World"" was great, especially when it came to the background environment but that may have been thanks in part to the film being in 3D/CG. However the 3D then comes to serve as a detriment a little when it came to the Animation as I don\'t think that aspect of the film was the strongest. In particular, there was scene near the beginning of the film that involved a character\'s running animation that I thought was horrible. Funnily enough, there\'s a reason for the 3D/CG that will be made clear as you watch the film where even looking back at that particularly bad running scene I mentioned previously, it made sense and maybe even elevated that scene a little for me.The OST for ""Hello World"" was very good.

Don\'t get me wrong, that somewhat the same with Orange, although it was the letters thay came back to the past lol.

Nulbarich performed OST for the movie so I was stoked about that, visuals seemed pretty good, theme was something I like. As the movie began screening in other countries, I saw more and more very bad reviews and since the main arguments were imaginable my expectations dropped significantly.Now...that any biases are declared, let's get into the review:Story: 7/10The story might be complex and fantastic to some, but I found that it generally holds water given some artistic licensing. It wasn't too mind-blowing or amazingly original and creative to me, but it was a good, simple, realistic story. (realistic as in the motivations, development, etc.) The structure and pacing was solid, but I would prefer mixing up presentation technique (e.g. types of montages used) a bit more.Art: 8/10Something that stands out from the first few frames is the use of CGI. This doesn't detract from the movie by itself, however, as the movie uses the advantages of CGI very well. The movie also embraced the CGI as part of its aesthetic and complements the tech, sci-fi theme. Creative use of VFX and speed ramping made for some interesting compositions and sequences that you wouldn't see in traditionally drawn anime. However, the reason why I didn't give this section a higher score is due to some minor... mistakes(?) where some actions looked unnatural due to poor key-framing, I would guess, especially in minor character running loops and then some.Sound: 10/10Now, I might be biased, but Nulbarich is simply awesome and so was the OST. Sounds great on its own, suitable usage in the movie, really good. But the reason I gave this a 10 was also thanks to the thoughtful sound design throughout the movie - very consistent and high quality.Character: 8/10Half-way into the film, although there was obviously plot progressions, I didn't really think that there was significant character progression. I felt that some hinted developments didn't really happen, and I couldn't see the obvious thematic messages original anime movies would often scream out. After getting past the first part of the story structure, however, I realized that I had been focusing on the wrong things and was treating it as a conventional linear romcom/action movie. I recalibrated my mindset and focused on the things the anime focused on, and was satisfied with the realistic/logical motivations and development.Enjoyment: 8/10I wonder if I'm rating this too highly since it was above my expectations... Nevertheless, beautiful aesthetics both visually and audio-wise, world-building very solid, cohesion was there, and it kept me thinking and enjoying throughout.Overall: 8/10Overall, I'm giving this a high 7 / low 8. Some of the marks given in the sections above might be a bit lower but lesser than 0.5 points.The strongest part of this anime is the sound design and it plays a huge role in the immersion factor. The weakest link by far is the story, but if you don't think too much about it, the more enjoyable it'll be, perhaps.I feel that if you cannot wrap your mind around the world, disagree with the stylistic choices, or fixate on the things that the movie isn't primarily trying to narrate, it would be closer to a 6 or a 7. Conversely, if this is your first sci-fi anime, you might get blown away and get absorbed in a very rich and fun experience. that any biases are declared, let's get into the review:Story: 7/10The story might be complex and fantastic to some, but I found that it generally holds water given some artistic licensing.

It\'s an absolute waste of time, money and your will to live.The story is okay in the first half, but after the main plotline starts to begin (when Naomi enters the ""real"" world) plotpoints are not longer explained and dialogue gets replaced with useless flashbacks and dreadful CGI cameramovement. All the other characters besides our main characters get no screentime, characterdevelopment or personality traits.The visuals are a joke. During some scene they didn\'t even boder to draw textures over the bland 3D-modells and the movie looks like a bad version of Counterstrike:Source. The movie looks pretty...when it wants to, but the horendes character modells drain every single drop of life and atmosphere out of this movie. Also sometimes there are very questionable colourfilters that make the movie look like an old instagram pic from an 11 year old girl.The soundtrack per se isn\'t that bad, but way too loud sound effects stops the movie from even being half enjoiable for your ears.The film overall just isn\'t worth watching. The story is way too overcomplicated and  major plotpoints are just forgotten. Some consistent rules for worldbuilding are nowhere seen and stuff seems to happen just because. The characters are the best part even though the dialogues between them are as basic as it gets and you have no emotional attachment to them.

For many reason i think this movie better than Koe no Katachi and this movie in the same level of MasterPiece with Kimi no Nawa but Honestly if we compare with the Full of StoryLine concept and Ending as analys concept, and if you have a opinion about Kimi no Nawa is the best Anime Movie and sure thats right you must watch it. You know you will have a new list of The best Anime Movie like Kimi no Nawa. Yeah THAT IS HELLO WORLD MOVIEThanks for read mu Review 😁 just wondering about the last scene where Katagaki-san changed positions with Ichigyou-san at the end of the Movie but I'm sure I'll understand it soon.

It was a bit different and unfamiliar at first, but I continued watching, and found myself immersed in an experience that was rather different than usual.The story itself was well written into a way that would make you question your existence and life. It's just really thought provoking, and it makes you think about life. The sound, the art, everything was well done into a way that you'd forget the art...style is unfamiliar.I'd say the only thing that's just ok is the characters. The characters aren't anything unique or special; they're just some average characters on any show or film.

I came here as usual by watching a short on a different platform and seeing the characters.The movie doesn't need a massive review but what it does need is recognition for being deep. There are classics like 'Weathering with You', 'A Silent Voice' and 'Your Name' etc. This wants to be at their level, almost but not quite. It is a fantastic watch, it is also slightly rushed but equally any slower and it would have dragged. I know that is a contradiction but it is just that sort of movie.What's great? The animation, the story, the...complexity, and the ending. Some real feelings in this one.Who knew a world could have so many layers. complexity, and the ending. Some real feelings in this one.Who knew a world could have so many layers."", '""Hello World"" starts off basic: the main protagonist from 10 years into the future comes back to tell the main protagonist (Kagasaki) that his girlfriend (Ichigyou) is going to die in 3 months and he has to retrace the timeline for now but on the day of her death, he has to do something different. But it\'s also not basic. The catch here is that the main character is just data and he\'s not really real... or is he? And there\'s an unexpected plot twist that turns a cutesy romance anime into a super science fiction one.However, because ""Hello World"" tries so hard to...be a romance yet science fiction anime at the same time, it ends up lacking in both worlds. It really felt like ""Hello World"" was throwing as much romance as it can in the first half and then as much science fiction as it can in the second half. Intermixing two different genres can be hard, although ""Steins Gate 0"" (a similar anime) seemed to have done it perfectly (unpopular opinion: I didn\'t really like ""Steins;Gate"", but I gave ""Steins Gate 0"" a chance and loved it).On the other hand, ""Hello World"" is, in fact, an insanely cute romance anime. Kagasaki and Ichigyou were really cute together, and the development of their love story flowed naturally and truly built on each other\'s character. The art and sounds in ""Hello World"" are also really beautiful. ""Hello World"" is one of those movies where the graphics are so HD and 3D that the anime seemed like real life... but better because of its vibrancy. The epic EDM and trap soundtracks definitely work with the visuals and settings as well. However, I think the most beautiful part of ""Hello World"" was the character development. Each character manifested into an entirely different person by the end of the show (the ending, I must add, is quite ambiguous so if that\'s not for you, then ""Hello World"" is not for you). But this manifestation is what sets ""Data Kagasaki"" apart from ""Kagasaki from 10 years into the future"" in a beautiful way that conveys the importance of self-confidence and love.There is a lot to digest from ""Hello World,"" but with its amazing visuals, sounds, and characters, it is definitely worthwhile. be a romance yet science fiction anime at the same time, it ends up lacking in both worlds.

Honestly it has it's cliche moments but it has been a very enjoyable watch.

Romance and Action.Romance part is the first part which was very enjoyable. Throughout the rest of the movie we find out more about the personality of the MC.Overall, I was going to rate it '9' but...I felt like if it wasn't CG it would have been more enjoyable and engaging.

This movie, Hello World, tells that with the story of Naomi and Ruri.It's a touching movie where it resonated with me even though I don't have a partner/love of my life (lol). It's a nice concept on paper with some nice moments and probably could've been a bigger hit given much more screen time, better animation, and execution.Story:The story is really...good but it's just lacking in the development aspect. In this I mean, Old Naomi. We get a fast flashback of what happened to him and a summary of what he's been studying and doing these past 10 years, trying to get into the ALLTALE System and go into the past. Overall, if he were given more development I would probably rate this more higher. But, other than that the story of Young Naomi and Ruri is pretty good, but just also needed more screen time in my opinion.Pacing:I already addressed this above, with the movie lacking in screen time. It just really needed more development for the characters, but unfortunately, the budget for it wasn't probably big enough.Art:For a 3D Anime Film made in 2019, it's pretty good. There were times when it felt like they ran out of budget and felt like they rendered the scenes using a different program (The bike chase scene lol), but I think that's just me. The background art is really good, with some scenes blending with the 3d aspect of it. If you were a new anime watcher I think you probably wouldn't have noticed it was 3D some of the times.Characters:Naomi and Ruri's love development story, though it was short, it was something I really enjoyed it, with me being a typical romance story enjoyer. I liked how Young Naomi understood and complied with Old Naomi, trying to help his (fake) wish come true of making a world where Ruri didn't get struck by the lightning and being happy with her, trying to see her smile just one more time.Sound:The OST for the movie is pretty alright, there wasn't anything particularly bad about it and I enjoyed the OST's. There were also times when I felt like moments could've been better given much more appropriate music and sound effects for the scenes and their voice acting. They hired amateur VAs which I don't mind because some movies do that to give a chance to new VAs but, I think this movie would've improved with proper voice acting for the MCs.Personal Thoughts:Frankly, if I were the Old Naomi, I would've also done the same with that desperation in mind, trying to save the love of my life. But, that plot twist got me. Because (According to a theory and my personal belief) it turns out that Naomi was the one that got struck by lightning and in the future, Ruri developed the  ALLTALE System which she used to make a reality/simulation with the help of the past records making a world that instead of Naomi being struck by the lightning it was Ruri, so that she may save Naomi. But for the sync to occur he must be in a mental state where he saves someone. So, in the end, when he sacrifices himself for young Naomi, Ruri is finally able to sync his mind with his body. Easy, simple, and foreshadowed by the movie (Azu_303, 2021, Youtube Comment). With the 3D world being the simulation and at the end of the movie, where the real world is 2D.I hope Naomi and Ruri (1st 3D Simulation) have a wonderful and happy life inside their new universe and also for Naomi and Ruri in the real (2D) world.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie.

Then if you somehow avoided watching ""The Matrix"" (1999) I don\'t even have anything to say to you. If you did watch both of them and loved them, you\'ll higly likely to enjoy ""Hello World"" too.---Disclaimer: I\'ve watched and read a lot more of non-anime/non-manga (30d/60d at the time of the writing vs. months of movies and shows) and I mostly care about a good story. I also can\'t watch subbed anime, so my rating of sound isn\'t something to care about.This is my second review and I get a feeling that all the time I\'ll write a review will be when someone in the internet is wrong. And now all of those saying that this show is a rip-off of matrix are wrong.This movie mostly caught my attention by its name since it has a lot to do with my profession. I was totally misguided by it, but it isn\'t too bad of a thing and I totally didn\'t waste my time in vain watching it (well it depends on what you understand by ""wasting time"", but whatever).# StoryStory is mostly based of a rather old movie ""The Thirteenth Floor"" (1999) but with focus shifted from existential and complex questions to romance side of thigs (not that they weren\'t present in the ""Thirteenth Floor"") with common highschool life setting. There are also some elements and ideas from ""The Matrix"" (1999), so actually it\'s a mix of those two (glory days of GITS & Parpika definitely passed, but oh well). Truth be told story is promising, but in my opinion is either too rushed (probably ~90 minutes is just too short for it) or poorly composed, it would\'ve been best to make it in a series with 12 episodes or so. Story itself just can\'t be bad since it\'s heavily ""inspired"" by ""The Thirteenth Floor"" and it has it\'s own promising ideas too, but characters bring it down a lot.Ending isn\'t that surprising and somehow is expected (not sure if it is the case for those who didn\'t watch floor though) but is really good and makes title of the movie much more suitable :)# ArtArt kinda looks like a render from a game and is definitely memorable. It\'s not actually masterpiece in any way but it just has something to it that looks very interesting. After I\'ve watched it I understood that all backgrounds and objects around them are statically drawn and/or animated by hand when characters look like computed game models drawn not by human but a CGI. Personally I don\'t think it\'s bad and it somehow appeals to that ""in game"" feeling which fits story really good.# SoundCan\'t say much about voice acting since I\'ve never heard it, but as for soundtrack it\'s rather bad IMHO - it may be because I don\'t really like electronic music, but I remember fondly soundrack in Far Cry 3, so that also may mean that soundtrack is just not right. As for effects I didn\'t find them annoying and it is as much as I can tell from any anime/movie/show.# CharacterBoy oh, boy... It is not totally bad, but in contrast with the level of a story it may be rather annoying. Questions arising constantly in my mind were: ""Why whould I care about his feelings about her when total screentime of them together is this short?"", ""How in hell did she actually felt anything about him/them?"", ""Why the fuck would he spend ten years trying to save her when their romance was at THIS level?"" (I wouldn\'t mind if it was shown not as a romantic feeling but as a sympathy and/or pity). As I wrote earlier this questions could be mitigated just by having more screen time and full-blown anime series would just be great for that purpose.# SummaryIt\'s not half bad, so you should watch it if you like Sci-Fi stuff like that (as a romance it is a total failure in my opinion), as for recomendations (I\'ll probably make it my rule to provide them in every review) I don\'t really know what to recommend since actuall idea of ""Hello World"" is this good, but:- Steins;Gate (not that deep on existential side of things, but heavy on timetravel and consequences)- Re:Zero (not about simulation and getting directions from your future self, but have that ""game"" feeling to it while having some parts similar)If you were interested with this movie for it\'s name just like me then it\'s not what you expect it to be and if you do know something good in that particular setting don\'t be shy and write me a message about it :) Ending: 10/10 (although it\'s kinda expected, but still great)If you didn\'t watch ""The Thirteenth Floor"" (1999) stop reading this and go watch it before anything else if you came to ""Hello World"" in hope to see some decent Sci-Fi.

At the start, it appears to be a simple, sweet anime but it develops into so much more than that. \'Future\' Katagaki is such an intriguing, complex character whilst \'present\' Naomi is filled with the naive charm of youth being a stubborn teenager...but having a hero\'s heart. I love Ruri - she is totally herself & I want her to be my spirit character lol.While the first part of the film plays out like your \'standard\' \'romantic\', high school anime the second part will blow your mind! This is where it gets trippy - a bit of a mix between Inception, Doctor Strange & I don\'t know what else. It\'s crazy but this is where the animation shines - the colours are brilliant.So why only 3 stars? Well, the final part is where it loses some coherence - the science part takes over a bit & I just got really confused about a few things... However, it is definitely worth a watch for the stunning animation & thought-provoking story.Bonus: The Crow is awesome!P.S. I\'m curious to know if the creators are Doctor Who fans...

There's even a girl that MC finds cute in the beginning and she seems qurious about him too, but they never even talk.The storyling although interesting, is very complicated filled with scientific terms and explanations which can be really frustrating if you don't understand how anything works.It's not advisable to watch it if you get seizures.Overall, i really liked it but i watched twice because the first time i was confused about what really happened and then i watched it again very carefully to understand. also open to everyone's interpertation.ConsMost of the side characters don't contribute anything to the story.

You don\'t get to watch sci-fi movies like this very often and in my opinion its criminally underrated.I watched it and i dont understand it fully and i think if i would watch is 2-3 more times i would still not understand what...the actual fuck happened there.

First half was really nice, but second half could have been better.Story: 6/10Art: 7/10Sound: 6/10Character: 7/10Enjoyment: 7/10--------------------------------Overall: 7/10My favourite qoutes:“Dating is something that you can’t do alone...let’s try it together, shall we?”""I just wanted to see her smile again.""', 'Had a blast watching this with my friend, it\'s safe to say that I enjoyed every second of this movie.Every moment of us discussing the movie with each other during and after the movie is amazing. We went from this theory to that theory, every single thing. It\'s safe to say this movie can help your imagination run wild.Now, on to the actual review.The main plot (˵ •̀ ᴗ •́ ˵ ) ✧ :The focus of the story...is on the love story of the main character Naomi (Main Character) and Ruri (Main Heroine). It\'s still your basic, run of the mill Romantic story of the main character risking everything to save the girl he likes. If we look at it from a wider perspective, the concept is still not that new, many version of the main character risk every version of himself to save the girl/woman he loves.What makes this movie unique to me, is how they potray it. They don\'t use Quantum physics and those stupid stuff that most movies use when they can\'t provide an explanation to the existence of the multiverse, they use what is more ""real"" - Simulations. You could argue that with the use of simulations, all the things that happened in the movie is just pointless and basically amounts to nothing in the real world, but you\'d be wrong. All the simulations here are almost too real to be just simulations. They are basically a multiverse, just bounded by the fact that they are running under a supercomputer. We never even witnessed the real world in the movie btw.The story technically got an ending, but I dare say that we only got to see the happy ends to the 2 world. The ending also makes the story even more different, because this time the one saving the main character is the main heroine.I\'ll rate the plot a 10/10The Character development:This might be the most disappointing part of the movie. I wished the character development could be better, though there is a chance part of the original work was cut from the movie due to some reasons.There is little to no character development, some part of the movie we can see the interactions between the two main characters (Mostly at the old book fair part, where all of the characters of the movie basically got some screentime). Then there is close to 0 developments, which doesn\'t makes much sense to me. Ruri just basically understood everything after she got back and does not even question a single thing??? Still boggles my mind, then again, content could be cut.Character development could only settle for a 4.Overall, this fits the people whose got a thing for Sci-fi best. Even though, I would still recommend people who watches Romcoms, Romance as a whole to try this out. I hope you enjoyed reading my review. is on the love story of the main character Naomi (Main Character) and Ruri (Main Heroine).

I hope you enjoyed reading my review.', 'I personally found the movie kinda confusing at first, until i read some reviews and watched Another World, a 3 short part episodes that explained Senpai Naomis world. Im not a huge fan of the CGI but i understand why they used it.Which explains the moon base and the real world. The fact that almost all of the movie was 3D proved that in both worlds it was in fact a simulation, which is a clever design. Moreover, the ending scene is in 2d further showing its not a simulation.So one of the theories by @Azu_303Naomi was the one who was struck by lightning and...Ruri made a simulation where he was the one who survived, but for the sync to occur he must be in a mental state where he saves someone. So in the end when Senpai Naomi sacrifices himself for child Naomi, Ruri is able to sync him back with his body.It was a good story, it just needed to be implemented better, but all the twists and turns will make it a compelling love story.

The start and the mids of the movie was good but as it got to the end it was a bit disappointing. But i never had high expectations for endings towards anime movies considering its like 4 episodes worth and wanting to cram everything into an hour plus means they had to sacrifice important buildups and explanations.Story:For the story i enjoyed the start till the mids of it. But getting to the end it felt really rushed and i had so much...to take in. Though as it got to the end i understood the story more and is still enjoyable either way. it\'s just the way that the story was connected that maybe couldve been arranged better. Still a jaw drop when it showed that older naomi woke up from his coma/simulation.Art: Im not really a big fan of CG because it feels very forced within their body movements. but other than that ill go as far to say it was pretty good.Sound: Was a surprise when the song ""Yesterday"" was added into the movie. Sound was decent no complaint.Character: Pretty good except i find it hilarious how Ruri didnt really react much when the events were going on.At most i rate it a 7.5/10 just because the concept was very interesting. Overall good movie! to take in.

Overall good movie!', 'THIS IS MY REVIEW AND MY OPINION, YOURS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT.""Dating can\'t be done with just one person, so let\'s do it together."" -Ruri, and my friendThe movie is basically a demonstration of the butterfly effect. The act of saving someone\'s life, can greatly impact what\'s around you, not just you and them. Oh yeah, there\'s also multi dimension. The message I got from this is:Your actions matter more than you think. It\'s not just you, but the others around you. Trying to save someone dear by manipulating time and history (and perhaps dimension), can affect not just you, but others, even your environment.Anyway, that\'s...one of the many movies that my friend recommended. I\'ll just say it, it\'s well... good. It\'s good enough that it can\'t be called as bad or average, but it\'s not good enough that it can\'t be called as one of the best. I think it can\'t even be called as one of the \'good anime movies\', but well, some aspects of the anime can potentially attract you.

What I got was a Sci-Fi film with a romance subplot and some big twists to its narrative...on its second half.For a full CGI animation, it felt really smooth and enjoyable, at times i even forgot it was a 3D animation, the world feels very good and vivid.The second  half  completely changes the tone of what was being presented, by switching into some action Sci-Fi themes, however I found it enjoyable enough for the context of what was happening.Also, reading some information of the film after watching it made me realize a detail in the ending that just completely changes how you saw the entire movie, and brought me a kind feeling to appreciate it more even after having finished, I would've been oblivious to the fact that is presented on that last scene had I not read up a bit more into it.Overall I enjoyed it a lot coming from completely no expectations and just seeing what it had to bring to the table. on its second half.For a full CGI animation, it felt really smooth and enjoyable, at times i even forgot it was a 3D animation, the world feels very good and vivid.The second  half  completely changes the tone of what was being presented, by switching into some action Sci-Fi themes, however I found it enjoyable enough for the context of what was happening.Also, reading some information of the film after watching it made me realize a detail in the ending that just completely changes how you saw the entire movie, and brought me a kind feeling to appreciate it more even after having finished, I would've been oblivious to the fact that is presented on that last scene had I not read up a bit more into it.Overall I enjoyed it a lot coming from completely no expectations and just seeing what it had to bring to the table."", 'Hey we need a new movie!

Writing a happy ending for something that will never exist. The romantic aspect was sped up to the point that the audience don\'t get to really connect with the romantic plot that the story could have offer. BUT the plot twist was good for the main protagonist because if the audience gave it some thought they\'ll understand why the...twist and ending works out for the protagonist. It\'ll make a lot of sense too if one can conjure up a theory of what really happened.Art: Oof, personally the cgi is a bit effy and I hate cgi animated anime but the art style isn\'t bad. It is watchable and doesn\'t hurt the eyes as much as other anime cgi. But it doesn\'t mean you can\'t notice the weird cgi at times. But that ending is slick as the comparison of going 3d to 2d makes a great touch of representing the fake and real world.Sound:  Not the best OST in the world since they could do more with different scenes but there is a scene that was empowered by the OST that I thought was great.Character: Protagonist motives and character development is what makes THIS movie. Naomi adult version is willingly to do everything to see Ruri again while his young self is trying to understand the feeling that adult version had with Ruri.  Their interaction is great to care for both of them despite the sudden moment that happens. Ruri isn\'t there for any development except as a plot device and romance. I don\'t necessarily hate her because she was sweet enough to care that she can live happy with Naomi.Enjoyment: I think the concept was interestingly entertaining to watch even though the sped through the romance part. Still a better 2019 movie compare to another movie that came out that year. If you can connect and make theory, it\'ll make understanding the movie better.Overall: I enjoy it. If I was able to wipe my memories to watch it again, I would. But watching a second time may not be for me since the plot twist is known. Honestly one of my favorite romantic anime movie of 2019.

I was immediately hooked on the premise. I can´t remember when I last watched an original sci-fi anime movie.Story – 8/10The premise of this show is extremely interesting. Set in the near future in Kyoto (Thank god not Tokyo again), this anime has some very cool ideas of how technology will be used in coming years, with the main focus being mapping and simulating our world through surveillance. Over the course of the movie, more and more layers are added to the...multiverse plotline.Hello World is separated into two story-parts. There is a huge plot-twist in the middle of the movie that splits it into a funny, light-hearted romantic comedy with sci-fi elements and a dark, twisted Christopher Nolan-esk action drama.Now, while I don´t think any of the concepts and twists in this movie are 100% original, the story itself works really well and the plot-twists are unexpected and sudden. The pacing is also really good. The last third of the movie gets a bit convoluted but not to a point where it harms the experience.Another thing that I would like to add here is that there is actually a post-credit scene that really surprised me as it delivers a key plot-point that wasn´t explained earlier.Definitely wait for the credits to finish!Art – 8/10This is a fully 3D animated show and I have good news for you.In the last decade, fully CGI animated shows always struggled to exactly replicate the humanoid figure. Even the fantastic “Knights of Sidonia” , while having insane mechdesigns and fight-scenes, gets weighed down by it´s clunky and unrealistic character models.This is the first CG anime where that is not an issue. The character models look almost exactly like if they were hand-drawn. This is a major step for the anime industry.Other than that, there are some REALLY trippy scenes in this movie that are animated fantastically. However, I don´t think anything done in this movie couldn´t have been done by traditional animation, which is why I can´t really go higher with the score in this category.Sound – 7/10The BGM is solid and very charming, especially in the first half. I think the directors took some inspiration from Makoto Shinkais works, especially “Your Name” and “Weathering with you” here. There are multiple montages and vocal tracks seemingly implemented in the movie. Again, the change between the comedic first and the dramatic second half becomes apparent in the OST.Characters – 7/10There are actually just 4/5 characters in this movie. The cast is really small, which, in my opinion, helps the movie a lot. Our main character, Naomi, is your average anime protagonist, but as the story progresses it actually makes him extremely interesting and relatable. What I mean with that is the very...interesting(!) relationship between him and our main “villain”. Please go into this movie as blind as possible as to not get spoiled. I guarantee you that you will be surprised.Other than that, there is not much to be said here. Our female heroine Ruri is pretty unique especially at the start, but her development gets sidelined in the final arc.Enjoyment – 8/10This was a nice, interesting take on the sci-fi genre. It is always refreshing to watch new-gen anime movies that tell stand-alone stories and don´t belong to an established franchise. If you like sci-fi, drama and romance this is a movie for you, although I think this film can truly be enjoyed by everyone, especially believers of 3D-Animation!- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 8/10 multiverse plotline.Hello World is separated into two story-parts.

To the mind-bending visuals reminiscent of \'Inception\'; to the heartfelt writing embedded into the script, this movie masterfully intertwines these traits to make a time travel movie that really feels refreshing and astonishing.For the most part, the use of time travel can be quite convoluted and perplexing, (since there are various iterations of it) but \'Hello World\'s\' use of it is simple to understand. The characters are all amiable and...well-crafted and do not give off the corny romance vibe but are more classy.

Para syang nasa gitna ng 2D at 3D. Ang magandang example ay gaya ng CGI parts ng DBS Broly or yung models ng DBFZ. Pero kahit na ganon; ang astig pa rin ng visuals. Sa ilang scenes para kang nanonood ng “Spider-Man: Into The SpiderVerse” at naglalaro ng isang Dating Simulator (kung di nyo alam kung ano...yon, ask Jet).

It’s relaxing and energetic at the same time. And I’m not just talking about the beat, pati na rin sa lyrics.

Pero dahil sa ginawa nya; nag-cause sya ng problema sa sarili nya, kay Ruri at sa past self nya. In the end; pinili nyang maging responsable at harapin ang consequences ng kanyang selfish act. Relatable ang character nya sa mga adults at good example naman sa mga batang takot sa consequences. I love this anime movie so much. Dineliver nila yung message na gusto nilang i-hayag without making any bullcraps sa storytelling (di gaya ng Fireworks). Malamang pasok to sa TOP 10 Anime Movies ko. Hehe.8/10', '9/10Honestly, I am not a fan of animes that use CGI or have time-travelling elements as both tend to overpower the anime itself sometimes. With that being said I was initially wary of watching this movie as the movie uses both CGI and the story involves some sort of time-travelling element. But boy, am I glad I gave this one a try.Hello World was truly one of the best anime films I\'ve ever watched. Everything was intricately and beautifully done.Story:For a film that uses some sort of time travelling/futuristic theme, the story was actually quite easy to follow. It started of as your simple cutie...love story set in a futuristic world (OR SO YOU THOUGHT) and even though in the middle and towards the ending when there were already a bunch of time commotions happening, surprisingly enough, I was still able to follow it. Usually when I watch anime films I get bored in the middle but with this one, I was glued at my screen all through out. I feel like the ending was able to wrap a lot clearly, and while I admit that the story is far from perfect, I honestly can say that this is one of the nicest stories I\'ve seen on an anime film yet.Art:This is probably my favorite part of the film. THE ART HERE IS TRULY A MASTERPIECE. Usually when animes use CGI, they tend to overuse it a bit or overpower the anime, but the CGI use here really fit well with the theme. I\'m honestly not sure if a big reason why I wasn\'t as bored as watching the film was because of the art, but the art here is truly one of a kind. There were times where I felt like the art was somewhat similiar to the art used in ""Into the Spider-verse"". Irregardless, the art made me feel like I was watching some sort of Banksy/Warhol art exhibition here. I can\'t gush about the art enough.Sound:I MEAN HELLOOOOO, LOST GAME AND THE LAST SONG THO? Aside from that I felt like the sound used here wasn\'t bad at all too. Like I said with the art, I felt like the sound used here was also able to complement the story/the movie quite well.Character:Usually when you watch an anime there is always some sort of ""villain"", but in this case (semi-spoiler alert) I felt like there really weren\'t any established villains here. I also enjoyed the character development of all the chararcters here especially Naomi and ""Sensei"". I felt like both were able to grow exponentially and were written greatly. Also Ruri was written good as well.Enjoyment:In case it isn\'t obvious, OF COURSE I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. Everything was done beautifully after all. I guess the reason why I\'m rating this as 9/10 is because there were still a few kinks in the story but overall, I cannot compliiment this movie enough. I really and thoroughly enjoyed it. love story set in a futuristic world (OR SO YOU THOUGHT) and even though in the middle and towards the ending when there were already a bunch of time commotions happening, surprisingly enough, I was still able to follow it.

I really and thoroughly enjoyed it.', 'Essa obra-prima tem alguns pontos importantes que fizeram o anime receber nota 10 na minha lista e eles devem ser ressaltados:1.Animação impecável: o filme é completamente feito em computação gráfica, o que me deixou meio receoso a princípio, mas o fato de terem tentado aproximá-la ao máximo da animação 2D padrão, acabou por tornar a animação perfeita e que não peca em nenhum momento na minha sincera opinião.2.História e personagens incríveis: a história consegue te prender em todos os momentos, mesclando romance com Sci-fi, os últimos momentos, aproximadamente os últimos 30 minutos do filme te apresentam uma perspectiva totalmente nova de todos os acontecimentos e...só no final você consegue entender o que aconteceu realmente ao longo do anime. Os protagonistas são totalmente guiados pelo amor, o que os fazem tomar até mesmo ações ""anti-éticas"", tornando o plot algo que prende qualquer um.3.Trilha sonora perfeita: as músicas são incrivelmente bem feitas e se encaixam perfeitamente em cada cena do filme. só no final você consegue entender o que aconteceu realmente ao longo do anime.

""Hello World"" is quite a decent anime/movie (or whatever you call it since this is CG instead of the traditional 2D) on its own, great music and and lovely art.My only issue with this movie is that the mechanics of the ALLTALE wasn\'t explored that much. I understood the motivation of the future MC and how things work with the ""duplicate world"", but I found myself scratching my head on the second half, where all hell broke loose on what was supposed to be the ""real world"" which is the future Naomi\'s world,...which seems to actually be another data world found on the ALLTALE.*SPOILER ALERT*The end especially confused me because old Naomi ended up in another world and the ""future"" Naomi is actually in a space station by the moon.I will watch this again in time to see if I missed any details, and also its spin-off which is ""Another World"", in order to have a better understanding of its story.All in all, I will say this is a Good Movie/Anime, with a few takeaways on the mechanics of their world. which seems to actually be another data world found on the ALLTALE.*SPOILER ALERT*The end especially confused me because old Naomi ended up in another world and the ""future"" Naomi is actually in a space station by the moon.I will watch this again in time to see if I missed any details, and also its spin-off which is ""Another World"", in order to have a better understanding of its story.All in all, I will say this is a Good Movie/Anime, with a few takeaways on the mechanics of their world.', 'I have to admit, I went into this movie with low expectations after even procrastinating for an entire week because I thought it wouldn\'t be worth the watch as soon as I noticed it was 3D. Boy was I wrong, I never imagined that one of the best movies I would ever watch would be a 3D OR romance film, yet here it was, both at the same time, and yet I can say with certainty that in my personal opinion, this is the best movie I have ever watched....The world created was charming in the way that you know as little about it as we know our own world, and yet terrifying for that very same reason since we would never know which ""reality"" is the original. The characters make understandable choices for the most part and the romance theme is very heavily represented by 10 years of waiting just to see your loved one smile again.The sounds felt amazing and the music during the final stretch almost reminded me of a personal favorite, Camellia. As for if I enjoyed this movie, of course I did. I think that the true charm of this story is held within the fact that it gives itself an actual infinite amount of futures, the fan could imagine a continuation in any way they wanted to, and it wouldn\'t be wrong or right, rather it would be every possibility since it will likely never be observed.The things in this movie, while not all possible, are theoretically much closer than they may appear to be, and I really appreciate that. I don\'t always enjoy it when impossible things happen in a movie, as it can ruin my immersion, but I was immersed in this story to the very end, as a movie should strive for.Overall, I doubt that I will ever enjoy a movie as much as this one again, as it\'s been an extremely long time since anything, much less a movie, has left that warm feeling of satisfaction with me, and I wish to feel it again, because now I see just how great a feeling I have been missing out on this entire time.

This is my first time writing a review, so I hope you’ll find it helpful, I do apologize if I fail to phrase something correctly though.(5)Story: so for the story, I decided to give it a 6, and the reason as to why is that the movies plot was very plain in the beginning and very messy in the ending leaving many plot holes, and also leaving most viewers confused. I did however enjoy the last plot twist, I would’ve liked a bit more explanation though since it also confused me even more.(Minor spoiler alert for art)(7)Art: the entire movie eccept for the...very last part was CG, and many have complained about that. I felt like it fitted the movie though, since everything was supposed to be portrayed as virtual until the very last part. They could’ve made it look a bit better in my opinion though, cause I felt myself cringing a bit in the beginning. Others might be fine with the awkward movements, but that’s all up to preference. Anothee thing, be prepared for lots and lots of bright rainbow colors.(7)Sound: the soundtrack was pretty good! I gave it a 7 since it wasn’t anything special, but it fitted the movie and fit the mood. As for the voice actors, they did a wonderful job and portrayed everything pretty well. The sound overall didn’t really make a huge impression on me, but it wasn’t bad, so that’s why I decided to go with 7.(6)Character: as for the characters, I liked that the main character didn’t seem like a huge shy, book loving, cliche boy but actually had some uniqueness to him. They failed to make the fl seem interesting though, and the reason why I’m saying that is because she was a very 2 dimensional character with barely any personality. She started off as cold and distant but immediately after getting just a teenie tiny closer to the mc changed as she became closer with him as if her previous wall didn’t exist. They did show it again with the idol-like character, but I failed to feel a connection with her as a viewer, even though the movie was centered around the mc wanting to save her. Another character that was kind of odd was the future version of the mc, who dated a girl for like what a week and then spent years and years on trying to save her. It didn’t make sense, and his only role in the movie was to guide the mc.(6)Enjoyment: Though all of these thoughts went through my head throughout the movie, I did somewhat enjoy it. It was a decent movie, and it actually started making me pumped at the middle, sadly this feeling quickly faded due to the confusion and poorly written scenes.Overall I’ll give it a 6, since it was good, but not something I’d recommend to others.

Mainly because of how cute Ruri is.The twist is gut wrenching, and leaves you wanting an answer.The story isn\'t flawless, but it has a humorous attitude, it\'s emotive, has a nice atmosphere and becomes artistically fun and impressive. The...amount of time and energy probably put into the art in the second half is amazing to me. There are some really interesting looking or detailed scenes.This movie will constantly remind you of Into the Spiderverse with it\'s art and themes.

It is pretty underrated considering not many people know about this movie.Story - The story on paper is really good, but the writers could have done a better job expanding on it. I feel like they needed to add more time to develop the relationship between Katagaki & Ruri. Their relationship development was very rushed. They should have added more interaction between those 2, like more conversation, cute dates, banter, bonding scenes, etc. If they done that, then the that would make the audience more invested into the main couple of the movie which would have made...the ending even more emotional and feelsy. I feel like I wasn\'t very emotionally invested into their relationship due to how it was rushed. Also, adding a flashback scene where Katagaki & Ruri were on that fireworks date would have made it much better as well. Showing them having fun and being super close and uwu together during that date, then leading up to the part where she gets striked by lightning and ends up brain dead will have REALLY brought out more emotional investment from the audience as well. If you add those points to the movie, then you potentially have a Kimi No Na Wa level movie. Other than that, the story was great!Art - Although I\'m not particularly fond of the 3D style animation, I did get use to it and it\'s not too bad. The art style and visuals are incredible though. Gives me Weathering With you/ Your Name vibes.Sound - The music was very good. In particular, during the scene when the song ""Lost Game - Nulbarich"" came on, it gave me chills. It was very emotional scene and that song just made it 10x more feelsy.Characters - Characters were decent, but like I mentioned above, if the writers spent more time developing the love relationship, it would have be 100x better.Enjoyment - I enjoyed the movie a lot.Overall - Overall, the movie is very good 8/10. Great story, great music, great visuals. It had the potential to be a 9/10  if there was more relationship development to make the audience become more emotionally invested in the characters for that emotional ending.

Sengoku Basara Ni,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6634/Sengoku_Basara_Ni,"['ARE YOU READY GUYS? PUT THE GUNS ON! LET\'S PARTY~!Season 1 of the Sengoku Basara anime over a year ago was my first foray into the Sengoku Basara franchise. I\'ve never played any of the games up until this point, though I have pre-ordered the North American version of ""Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes"" (known in Japan simply as ""Sengoku Basara 3""), as well as the first season of the anime on BD. I\'m surprised this series got licensed, but you\'ll hear no complaints from me!Sengoku Basara is a rare gem. Although I haven\'t played any of the games yet, I do know that most video...game-based animes tend to dilute the original content, and merely seek to milk the successes of the franchise in the anime market. You know, a cash cow. However, I and many others who have witnessed the glory of this and the still-airing second season can say without a doubt, that this is an anime everyone should be watching. It\'s too bad it seems to fly in fairly low under the radar in comparison to most of the other shows airing this season. However, maybe this review will help to get it some well-deserved attention.STORY: 7 (Good)This isn\'t a show you watch for the story, or at least, not for a deep plot. The most you\'ll get plot-wise from this anime is the development of the war between the various feuding nations, some strategic insight into what each of the various groups plan to do, and some twists and turns involving the outcomes of said plans. However, the best part of Basara is that it doesn\'t attempt to complicate itself or force the viewer to have to remember specifically what\'s going on; you\'ll find yourself more than content just going with the flow. As such, the plot falls short of anything more than average, but it makes up for it by remaining concise and to the point. Don\'t worry about it too much: You\'re not meant to.ART: 10 (Outstanding)Very few shows get a budget so big as to allow them to really shine. In Basara, you\'ll see no cheap backgrounds, no long runs of still-frames; you\'ll see nothing that\'s not breath-taking at least once every couple of minutes. The battle scenes are top-notch, over-the-top, fluent, and extremely well choreographed (as far as any anime can be choreographed). Watch it and see for yourself. There\'s really nothing more that can be said. Think Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, only much more polished and elegant.SOUND: 10 (Outstanding)The music fits the mood and represents the time period in which the story is supposedly set (that is, the music is ""traditional"" most of the time), yet Basara is not afraid to whip out the odd rock track and turn it up a notch when the situation is appropriate. It\'s the perfect blend of music when the time calls for it that immerses you in the traditional period of the samurai, and of simpler times, but it calls you back to the action when necessary with blood-pumping, high-tempo riffs that fire up the man inside of you. Simply amazing.CHARACTER: 8 (Very Good)In terms of individual character development, there isn\'t anyone that really starts at a point and grows. I suppose Yukimura Sanada would be the closest thing to a character who starts out young and inexperienced, and the one we see grow the most to become a leader in his own right. However, in a show like Basara where you have a myriad of original characters, all extremely different and unique, it\'s hard to give the spotlight to just one or two and grow them up in only 12 short episodes (per season). But it didn\'t bother me much at all, I still rooted for Masamune Date whenever I could get the chance. The characters are all so likable, and well positioned in their respective roles that you feel like you know them already. So while Basara is technically a little weak in the ""development"" department, it remains strong in presenting a wide cast of original, likable characters in such a short episodic run. This is no simple feat, and deserves credit. You\'ll even find yourself rooting for the enemy sometimes because they\'re so damned cool.ENJOYMENT: 10 (Outstanding)Basara is all about enjoyment, really. This is where it shines. There\'s nothing more fun than seeing two opponents jump off their horses, shoot up into the sky in a blaze of colors, and engage one another in a battle of epic proportions, completely blowing away any nearby bodies in their vicinity. There\'s nothing more epic than seeing a lone samurai get so fired up that he PUNCHES THE OCEAN AWAY with his bare fist. Does it sound ridiculous to you? Of course it does! That\'s what it\'s all about: Ridiculous, epic, over-the-top, hot-blooded manly action. You thought Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was at times enjoyable, even if it made no sense? Then if you\'re not watching Sengoku Basara, you\'re missing out. You really are. There are many more epic moments you\'d find yourself pausing the episode to re-watch, even before moving on because you thought it was so awesome. That\'s a quality essential to any good anime: One that leaves you wanting even more. It\'s really a rare trait in today\'s industry of ""security"", where companies know that all they have to do is put out generic moe garbage, and their business can... Well, stay in business. Thank goodness for taking risks, Basara. It\'s what makes you stand out above the crowd.OVERALL: 9 (Great)I wanted to give this a 10 pretty badly, but it does have it\'s flaws. I\'m not going to dwell on them, but if it has one single-biggest flaw, it would be such a short episode count. If each season were able to hold up a solid stack of 26 episodes each, then the characters and the plot would have more time to be fleshed out more appropriately. It\'s not bad for half that count, and arguably the show would be degraded if it ran on *too* long, but that\'s my opinion on the matter. Otherwise, it\'s a great watch.This is definitely the most underrated show of 2010, and it\'s too bad it\'s not getting more attention, at least in terms of outward appreciation. I\'m sure there\'s a lot of people who simply watch it every week and don\'t bother to discuss it much, and I can sort of understand. It\'s not the type of show you spend a lot of time discussing, you mostly watch it for the thrills, and repeat week after week until it\'s over. Then move on. While there\'s nothing wrong with that, it\'s unfortunate that mediocre shows such as K-ON! seem to attract much more attention than rare gems such as Sengoku Basara. I would even go so far as to say that Highschool of the Dead (airing along with this show in the same season at the time of this writing), a show that doesn\'t come nearly as close in terms of production values and has even less of a plot, is somehow apparently able to cast a popularity shadow over Basara. It might just be that Basara doesn\'t appeal to as many people as HotD does, but if that\'s the case, then anime really is in trouble in the coming years. Let\'s hope the fanbase realizes that shows such as Basara are worth watching, and worth supporting. Basara at least reminds me of a time when anime was original, when studios and producers weren\'t afraid to step outside the known formulas and mix things up. Sure, it\'s based off a video game, but in my eyes, the fact that it can be this good with that being the case means that the execution was probably about as flawless as one could hope for, given the challenges of creating such an entertaining product from another product\'s already existing formula and ideas, and managing to add it\'s own spin on the materials while remaining original in it\'s own way. No easy feat, and unquestionably deserving of high regard within the anime fandom.If you haven\'t seen this show or the previous season yet, do yourself a favor as a fan of the anime genre: Go and watch it now. Dip your feet in, you won\'t regret it. And if you do, well, then stick to your precious K-ON! and keep wishing for a second season of Angel Beats. YOU JUST DON\'T GOT YOUR GUNS ON.To the rest of you, GET YOUR GUNS ON. game-based animes tend to dilute the original content, and merely seek to milk the successes of the franchise in the anime market. You know, a cash cow. However, I and many others who have witnessed the glory of this and the still-airing second season can say without a doubt, that this is an anime everyone should be watching. It\'s too bad it seems to fly in fairly low under the radar in comparison to most of the other shows airing this season. However, maybe this review will help to get it some well-deserved attention.STORY: 7 (Good)This isn\'t a show you watch for the story, or at least, not for a deep plot. The most you\'ll get plot-wise from this anime is the development of the war between the various feuding nations, some strategic insight into what each of the various groups plan to do, and some twists and turns involving the outcomes of said plans. However, the best part of Basara is that it doesn\'t attempt to complicate itself or force the viewer to have to remember specifically what\'s going on; you\'ll find yourself more than content just going with the flow. As such, the plot falls short of anything more than average, but it makes up for it by remaining concise and to the point. Don\'t worry about it too much: You\'re not meant to.ART: 10 (Outstanding)Very few shows get a budget so big as to allow them to really shine. In Basara, you\'ll see no cheap backgrounds, no long runs of still-frames; you\'ll see nothing that\'s not breath-taking at least once every couple of minutes. The battle scenes are top-notch, over-the-top, fluent, and extremely well choreographed (as far as any anime can be choreographed). Watch it and see for yourself. There\'s really nothing more that can be said. Think Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, only much more polished and elegant.SOUND: 10 (Outstanding)The music fits the mood and represents the time period in which the story is supposedly set (that is, the music is ""traditional"" most of the time), yet Basara is not afraid to whip out the odd rock track and turn it up a notch when the situation is appropriate. It\'s the perfect blend of music when the time calls for it that immerses you in the traditional period of the samurai, and of simpler times, but it calls you back to the action when necessary with blood-pumping, high-tempo riffs that fire up the man inside of you. Simply amazing.CHARACTER: 8 (Very Good)In terms of individual character development, there isn\'t anyone that really starts at a point and grows. I suppose Yukimura Sanada would be the closest thing to a character who starts out young and inexperienced, and the one we see grow the most to become a leader in his own right. However, in a show like Basara where you have a myriad of original characters, all extremely different and unique, it\'s hard to give the spotlight to just one or two and grow them up in only 12 short episodes (per season). But it didn\'t bother me much at all, I still rooted for Masamune Date whenever I could get the chance. The characters are all so likable, and well positioned in their respective roles that you feel like you know them already. So while Basara is technically a little weak in the ""development"" department, it remains strong in presenting a wide cast of original, likable characters in such a short episodic run. This is no simple feat, and deserves credit. You\'ll even find yourself rooting for the enemy sometimes because they\'re so damned cool.ENJOYMENT: 10 (Outstanding)Basara is all about enjoyment, really. This is where it shines. There\'s nothing more fun than seeing two opponents jump off their horses, shoot up into the sky in a blaze of colors, and engage one another in a battle of epic proportions, completely blowing away any nearby bodies in their vicinity. There\'s nothing more epic than seeing a lone samurai get so fired up that he PUNCHES THE OCEAN AWAY with his bare fist. Does it sound ridiculous to you? Of course it does! That\'s what it\'s all about: Ridiculous, epic, over-the-top, hot-blooded manly action. You thought Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was at times enjoyable, even if it made no sense? Then if you\'re not watching Sengoku Basara, you\'re missing out. You really are. There are many more epic moments you\'d find yourself pausing the episode to re-watch, even before moving on because you thought it was so awesome. That\'s a quality essential to any good anime: One that leaves you wanting even more. It\'s really a rare trait in today\'s industry of ""security"", where companies know that all they have to do is put out generic moe garbage, and their business can... Well, stay in business. Thank goodness for taking risks, Basara. It\'s what makes you stand out above the crowd.OVERALL: 9 (Great)I wanted to give this a 10 pretty badly, but it does have it\'s flaws.

At first glance (from the original Sengoku Basara anime) I was hooked from day 1, the animation pensmenship was so detailed, you could tell this was'nt a cheap knock off of sorts. The fight scene's were brutally and powerfully animated (and thankfully not subjected to replaying the same actions over and over again). After the first series had finished, I waited (for a seriously long amount of time) with other anime fans...by my side too, and the day finally arrived. Sengoku Basara Ni (Or 2, if you'd like to call it), kept everything at a vantage point from its predecessor, the full blitz and blownout battle field wielding all its former glory of hack and slash action was everything I waited for. I've watched upto the latest ep so far, and I truly recommend this for anyone who's looking for a climatic story with fierce competion. by my side too, and the day finally arrived.

So i already know how the story goes. It still take jidaigeki's plot, which i didn't mind, but the different of the character design from the real ones this time, i think will affect a huge plot of the story than the previous.

The continuation of Sengoku Basara and I couldn\'t be more pleased...Everything is a 9... duh!? It\'s like watching Gintama + Bleach with all the familiar voices around...The battle for peace is never easy and these guys have it bad... friends vs friends... family vs family... and like the 1st series, this one is all action from beginning to end... and of course a little conversation, here and there...I\'d say that the fight scenes here are better, the story more focused and the characters can really stand out on their own... leaders from the first series took a backseat this time so that means...more characters! it\'s great, yeah sure! but I haven\'t really digested all the names and places yet and here are more names to memorize... geez! well, not complaining...Their previous enemy was a Devil now it\'s an Ape (or is it a Gorilla?)... anyway, at least I can say that this one\'s more worthy than Oda Nobunaga since he just doesn\'t fight in the end... the main characters are pretty much the same: Masamune is still arrogant but charming, Yukimura is still an idealistic brat, Kojuro is still the ever loyal right eye... sadly, Sasuke got less screentime... Musashi (a new character) now provides the comic relief... I think they focused more on Ichigo, i mean Keiji, this time around... but we won\'t really see him fight... he actually provides all the talking and the drama...There are also a couple of surprises here like a ghostly apparition (?) and some people who we thought are dead but seemingly are not... nani?!Music is still darn catchy to me... and this time we get 2 ED songs... I personally like the first one better...For those who enjoyed Sengoku Basara, I would definitely recommend SB Two... it\'s a fast-paced, action-packed, testosterone filled ride...  :)On a side note and it kinda went something like: ""once he swings that hot spear, i just cannot keep my cool"" or ""i would like to see how he holds those spears""... was this intentional or does the subs need improvement? am i missing something?!?I know that this anime has hot guys in it but if this continues then maybe it\'s a sign that it\'s time to throw in some women!
