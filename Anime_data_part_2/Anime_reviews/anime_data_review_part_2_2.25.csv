Tales of Symphonia The Animation: Sekai Tougou-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8995/Tales_of_Symphonia_The_Animation__Sekai_Tougou-hen,"['Story 10Tales of Symphonia is my favorite Tales game( My first) i have ever played. Thanks to Tales of Symphonia i have gotten into the Tales series and have played most of all the Tales games out there--even the Japanese versions.  : ) Tales of Symphonia: Sekai Tougou Hen or Tales of Symphonia World\'s United is the third and final OVA of the Tales of Symphoia The Animation. This takes place after the Tethe\'alla arc.As you may know Lloyd and the others are now trying to unite both Sylverant and Tethe\'alla as one to prevent the Mana of both worlds from being depleted,...As seen in the opening song( which is the most beautiful song ever)  we get to see Kratso, Yuan, Martel, and Mithos and the whole Derrs Kharlan war incident that happened with them.Art 10Exact same art as the game version, What else can i say : )Sound 10Opening song ""Honto Uso (ホ・ン・ト・ウ・ソ)"" by Me. OMG i cried watching this opening T__T Most beautiful opening I have ever seen.  I haven\'t seen the ending theme yet as i haven\'t finished watching the first eps.  I shall reedit this part out.Characters !0I like how they portrayed the characters here in the anime then the gameEnjoyment 10Tales Fan can really enjoy this series. New fans of Tales can too also.

I love the entire Tales series.', 'With the first part being less than great and the second being a fair bit better, the third and final part to the Tales of Symphonia story, and thankfully it makes for a nice conclusion.The Short Version:(+)A satisfying end to the series.(+)The characters come full circle(+)Sound is again back to form(-)Yet more Houdini characters (They appear then disappear)The Story (8/10): This is the point were the overarching story that begun in part one and was in the background for the entirety of part two, reaches it\'s ultimate climax and my god is it good. Having more modified than change the original objective, the span...of the story has increased while somehow feeling as focused as it was in part two. Surprisingly, there is a theme within the story, and it\'s a problem that still exists in our actual world. Prejudice. This question makes think for a little bit in-between all the drama and such, and it\'s refreshing for this series, that previously didn\'t really have a question or meaning at all, tackling a concept that is so prevalent and obvious in today\'s society. (Although I have a problem with one scene that has really out of place humor)The Characters (8/10): With the entire cast already having plenty of previous screen time, each of them individually feel like proper characters (In my review for part one I said, ""None of these characters can hold the show by themselves."" I take that back for this part.) As for what comes with the conclusion of any given anime, revelations between characters are made, every secret is revealed, and the villains motives are brought to light, which in the case of this anime are actually rather grounded compared to other extreme examples (I\'d compare the final goal to Lelouch\'s from Code Geass). The villain himself though believes in \'the ends justify the means\' approach to things.The Art and Sound (8/10 & 7/10): The art just keeps getting better as this series wears on, it is much more standard for ufotable if still a bit downgraded, but it is an improvement from the previous entry. (I\'m pretty sure this is because the upped their game with their lighting and shadows).The sound is also an improvement from the last entry, the OP has again to the level of part ones but it\'s more akin to modern day OP\'s with the momentary rapid score then slowly down to a more steady pace before picking back up as the episode name pops up, the ED is still on the same level as the previous two though, just with up-tempo vocals this time. Everything else when it comes to sound is good enough to be considered standard but nothing really jumped out at me and made me say, ""That one part was great.""What do I think of this anime?This was a fitting ending to the series, it\'s just a shame that you have to go through two lackluster entries to get here. I can not suggest buying this series, it would be preferable to stream the entire show.Would I recommend this anime?Yes, without a doubt. I still highly recommend that you go back to the start and work your way back up to this point, but yes. Please watch this show. Just remember, since this is a threequel, you\'ll have to watch the first two parts of it in order to get here, and they\'re not really the best material to watch.Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one. of the story has increased while somehow feeling as focused as it was in part two.

If you are interested, don\'t be shy to check it out! (Link\'s in my bio)Also: I\'ll be posting the same review for all three seasons, since I made a general review for the series, not the seasons in separate.Ok, so if you guys don\'t know, Tales of Symphonia is one of my FAVORITE animes, along with the rest of the Tales of Series. After i finished ToS, me and a friend had found other animes in the series as well, which we both love to death.So my friend said she found an old...Gamecube game that her father owned called ""Tales of Symphonia."" It was an anime RPG about a girl, Colette, was chosen to be an angel, and the Chosen to regenerate the world. A few days later, I saw she was an anime on YouTube, and it was a good thing a stopped her there, because that was when things got really sad and intense, and she probably wouldn\'t have looked that happy in first period that day. But anyways, we started watching the series from episode 1, and we finished the series in a few weeks time. For a short anime, Tales of Symphonia is a very good anime, that is really worth watching and re-watching over and over again. I\'ve only watched the series 3 or 4 times, but my friend said she\'s seen it around 30, maybe 40 times.Anyways, let\'s get started on the review! Hope you all like it!WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Story: 10/10Ok, so I\'m sorry if I\'m taking this not hard enough, but like I said before, I LOVED this series. It\'s one of those short stories where you rewatch them over and over again. And only for 11 episodes, it surely brings out its potential.Tales of Symphonia takes place in the kingdoms of Sylvarant and Tethe\'alla. where three races of people lived; humans, elves, and half-elves. The half-elves believed that their race was treated unfairly, and formed a pact, called the Desians. The Desians were defeated long ago by the hero, Mithos, and the goddess Martel, but, over time, their power had weakened, and the Desians has risen once more. Meanwhile, Colette Brunel, a 16-year old high-school girl, has been chosen to become the Chosen Angel of Regeneration. Her friends, Lloyd Irving, Genis and Raine Sage, accompany on her journey of regeneration, only to find that out that her journey was more like a sacrifice, if you know what I mean. Now, the gang must try to get her back, while saving the world from hatred. Recruiting a new team of allys, Lloyd and his friends set off to save Colette. and the rest of the world.Like I said before, this is a beautiful story. I\'m not going to go much into detail, due to some really big and sad spoilers, but it\'s a really good story to the anime, and I definitley give it a 10/10.Art: 10/10Again, I really feel like I\'m being to easy on this anime, it\'s just I love this anime a LOT. The art style is beautiful in this anime. The special effects, the battle scenes, the designs, EVERYTHING. And I gave it a 10 for art, because everything was beautiful. I\'m sorry I\'m giving everything on this a ten, I just really fell in love with this series as a whole, art, characters, everything.Another thing I really like about the art is the character designs. My favorites are paticualry Sheena\'s, Colette\'s, and Presea\'s. They\'re very unique, compared to your typical combat skirt, or suit of armor. Like I said, maybe I\'m being to easy on this anime, maybe I\'m not. But anyways, another 10/10 for the art.Sound: 9/10Ok, I really love the soundtrack to Tales of Symphonia. I have all three theme songs on my iPod and I listen to them ALL the time. It\'s just you don\'t want to listen to some of them too much, especially right after you finished the series. It kinda stirs up some of the sad scenes from the series (*cough cough* DEATHS *cough cough*) My friend says she hardly ever cries, but this was the first anime that was really hard to watch in public. Even so, there are some themes in the ToS soundtrack that make me smile, while others get me teary-eyed. Whether you see that as a good thing or not, I really enjoyed the soundtrack, even though it gets you in tears at times. So basically, I\'m giving it a 9/10, not another 10 suprisingly.Characters: 10/10Okay, so like I said before, I LOVED everything about this anime. The cast is AMAZING. Like, theyre the kind of cast that you grow attached to, no matter what kind of character they are. And by that, I mean your characters can range from the pervy and outgoing Zelos, to the quiet and strong Presea. And I\'m going to admit, I love each and every one of them. It\'s just one of those animes where I can\'t choose just ONE favorite character. Like, this is one of those animes where you love ALL of the characters. So yeah, basically another 10 for Symphonia.General/Enjoyment: 10/10Yeah, I know, not really a big surprise here. I said this many a time before in this review, I LOVED this anime a lot, and there\'s really no flaws that I saw in it, unlike the past couple of animes I had just given reviews on. And if you\'re like me, and loved the series just as much as me, I\'d reccomend trying the game if you can afford it, as well as others in the series, like Tales of the Abyss, Zestiria, and Vesperia. Yeah, what I\'m trying to get at is that it\'s a really good series, and I think at least everyone should at least try it before they bite it. It has a little of everything for everyone; drama, action, adventure, a little comedy and romance... Yeah. Anyways, yeah, a big One-O goes to this anime, its a great anime, and I highly reccomend it for anyone. show less Gamecube game that her father owned called ""Tales of Symphonia.""

Biggest disappointments with them are that some of the plots here would have made for some nice, full-length episodes. Most notably, the siblings of Tanaka and Oota, Rino and Saya. They really did not get very much screen time at all in the anime, so seeing them have a dedicated special felt sad due to how short these are. The special with the WacDonald's worker, Saionji, felt like it fit the short length of the specials the most.I enjoyed my time with all of these, and at the end of the...day, we should always be grateful to see any manga adapt into an anime, as well as those that are raw anime.

It\'s mainly due to the fact that they were incredibly boring in contrast to the original show.Overall: 6, Not completely awful, but as someone who was excited to get a bit more of this show after the final episode, I\'m quite disappointed that this is all it was.

Tenchi Muyou! in Love,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1006/Tenchi_Muyou_in_Love,"[""First off I would like to begin by saying that I am a big Tenchi fan. I feel this movie  is one of the best that I have seen in while(although i know its been out for some time now as well).  It uses the limited amount of time for a movie well by taking the characters we already know and giving them a serious new problem to figure out in a completely different setting. The characters once again use their own unique talents to help solve it, but the movie provides the viewers with some new important information about Tenchi's mother and...father. It also shows how the stage was set up for Tenchi after he was born from the house to his mother. The only downside that I could see in the movie was that the arch villain, Kane, lacked a little development outside his need to stop the people who had imprisoned him in the past. The movie did a good job keeping me on the edge of my seat especially toward the end and also made me smile and laugh throughout. I would highly recommend picking up the Tenchi Muyo! Movie Collection father. It also shows how the stage was set up for Tenchi after he was born from the house to his mother.

Movie Collection"", 'Maybe rewatching this as an adult was a mistake. I used to love this franchise when I was younger. Seen everything of the classic ""Tenchi"" stuff excepting GXP multiple times. Even read some of the manga. This movie is just... \'sad\' is being kind.The best things that can be said for this is that the soundtrack is very good and the animation quality is still pretty good, even with the anime hair. It looks nice and it\'s detailed and bright, with that extra polish movies typically get. I also still love the way they animate Ryoko and her abilities. Still my favorite version of teleportation,...and I love watching her fight.The plot just doesn\'t make any sense whatsoever. Every infodump scene is nonsense that couldn\'t even be classified as junk science and none of the characters do things that make logical sense in any fashion whatsoever.The opening is supposed to be an emergency scene where we preview just how powerful Kain is. But nothing any of the police officers(?) says make sense. They\'re studying time? Time is passing? Oh no! What will we do when time and space are moving! (Paraphrasing a line one of the characters says) Kain sucks the space station into a black hole. Then... makes it reappear, but severely damaged. Because. Because? Sailor Pluto may be a character I love but jeez this short scene makes even less sense than her character timeline.How did Kain escape? We never know. It doesn\'t seem like he can get more powerful in his prison cell. Washu at least compensates for this at the end by commenting that he\'ll probably escape again, so best murder him before that happens cause you know... he kills planets and stuff. But if this \'galactic cannon\' exists in the present, prior to Kain escaping, and they clearly are not attempting to reform and eventually release him, and he did all those bad things... why NOT execute him? Are they studying him? When Washu goes into the database for the police they don\'t seem to have learned anything about him so all this time has passed and studying him hasn\'t seem to have done anything for them, if that\'s what they\'re doing, and he somehow escaped his prison so... maybe just use the cannon on him to be safe?Why would someone even build a cannon that can destroy galaxies? What is the purpose of that? As a way to keep the Jurai in check? And if Kain destroyed the entire Galaxy Police force, where did Washu get the cannon from? Or is that at the university she got kicked out of? Why does a university have a galaxy destroying cannon?So Kain gets powerful enough to escape his prison somehow. Okay. Why... go after Achika? Why go back in time? Did he lose control of his power and get kicked back in time after traveling near Earth for some reason - which was nowhere near his prison cell - and then, well, he\'s \'attracted\' to Jurai energy so he found Achika? It\'s less silly than thinking he planned this out. He clearly doesn\'t know who Achika or Yosho are ahead of time. Although it\'s odd that he\'d go after Achika rather than Yosho, considering that Yosho might be stronger. Maybe Yosho really is just that good at hiding himself.I feel like if a sentient supernova, as Washu puts it, were able to break out of an impossible to break out of dimensional prison somehow, probably going to the planet with lots of Jiraians on it would make more sense than traveling to some random planet and then going back to the past. Particularly when there are fewer powerful Jiraians there. In the present you have Yosho, Tenchi, Ayeka, Sasami, and all the equipment from Ayeka and Yosho\'s ships. In the past you just have Yosho and Achika, and the remnants of past Jiraians who settled there long since. Kain doesn\'t seem to be out of control of his powers. His time travel was deliberate. So... why? It\'s not like Achika trapped him originally. Why not travel back and kill the people who imprisoned him in the first place?The A-Team gets told one instruction: DO NOT INTERACT WITH ACHIKA BECAUSE THAT COULD CAUSE A PARADOX! So what do they do? Immediately do their best to interact with and interfere with Achika\'s life. I mean already the answer to PARADOX is ""stalk teenager in the past"" so whatever.And why is the random galaxy police officer there? Can the galaxy police travel back in time? Kain should already be in prison in 1970. Why doesn\'t the dude alert headquarters if he\'s from that time period? How did he track down Achika? Washu at least has Tenchi to go on for her calculations. What the heck is this officer relying on to track Achika down? For that matter, why isn\'t the information that officer had available to Washu when Washu looks up the database info about 1/3 of the way through the story? I like watching Ryoko fight, but the dude is literally there just to pass time by telling us information we should have learned earlier.Why doesn\'t 1970s Yosho know who Ayeka is? He should be able to at least tell that she\'s from Jurai, at the least. I get it, past him is only in like five seconds of two scenes. Maybe he\'s just observing to see that nothing goes wrong. Maybe he doesn\'t know she\'s his sister. I guess. But... still.Why is Mihoshi a teacher and Kiyone is a janitor? There\'s no reason for them to pick one over the other, but Kiyone makes better sense as a teacher because she has the sense to figure it out more than Mihoshi does. Sure, Mihoshi could probably still screw up a janitorial position, but how would she pass as a teacher? Her entire time on-screen is devoted to how bad a teacher she is. Hilariously, somehow, in the next film she\'s shown doing cleaning work. There\'s no story reason for why Kiyone went with the janitorial position, unless you editorialize that Kiyone hates kids and/or teaching and Mihoshi hates manual labor and/or cleaning?And then there\'s the climax. Achika and Noboyuki get sucked into this other dimension/alternate timeline(?) Washu found. The A-Team needs to get them out. Interestingly the dub has Tenchi say that he doesn\'t want to die. The sub doesn\'t. I get it, the audience should know that, after the whole plot of the film, Tenchi\'s parents not getting together and having Tenchi means no Tenchi, but it was a bit... odd. Why does Ryoko \'save\' him? She\'s not saving him. There\'s no way to \'save\' him if his parents are sucked into the void with no way to return.So the A-Team needs to get to the parents, even though there\'s no way to pinpoint their location. Oh, I know! We\'ll transfer Achika\'s brainwaves to Tenchi! And Ryoko can lock onto the coordinates of that!...I really think whoever translated for the sub did a bad job. Like I hope that\'s what happened. If not, like. What? On the one hand, maybe it\'s sort of an ""Assassin\'s Creed"" genetic memory thing before AC was a thing. Doesn\'t really explain how pulling on Tenchi\'s ""genetic memory"" of his mom would pinpoint her present location unless he\'s like... looking through her timeline. In which case, she shouldn\'t \'sense\' him. Because he\'s not connecting with her. He\'s just looking at events that have already happened in HIS past.Basically the climax is ""we can\'t find the spatial coordinates so let\'s transform monkeys into apple pies to solve the problem"".Hey remember how the series fridged Tenchi\'s mom? Remember how everything we know about her, from the movie and the various series, makes her sound neat and interesting and powerful and she would sure be an interesting character to see a story about? Remember how this ending basically explains how she got fridged?Skip this. It just... is not worth it. Listen to the soundtrack somewhere else. The dub handles what jokes there are better, because the sub actors have no intonation, but the \'jokes\' are also poorly timed and the script is just bad, so whatever. and I love watching her fight.The plot just doesn\'t make any sense whatsoever. Every infodump scene is nonsense that couldn\'t even be classified as junk science and none of the characters do things that make logical sense in any fashion whatsoever.The opening is supposed to be an emergency scene where we preview just how powerful Kain is. But nothing any of the police officers(?) says make sense. They\'re studying time? Time is passing? Oh no! What will we do when time and space are moving! (Paraphrasing a line one of the characters says) Kain sucks the space station into a black hole. Then... makes it reappear, but severely damaged. Because. Because? Sailor Pluto may be a character I love but jeez this short scene makes even less sense than her character timeline.How did Kain escape? We never know. It doesn\'t seem like he can get more powerful in his prison cell. Washu at least compensates for this at the end by commenting that he\'ll probably escape again, so best murder him before that happens cause you know... he kills planets and stuff. But if this \'galactic cannon\' exists in the present, prior to Kain escaping, and they clearly are not attempting to reform and eventually release him, and he did all those bad things... why NOT execute him? Are they studying him? When Washu goes into the database for the police they don\'t seem to have learned anything about him so all this time has passed and studying him hasn\'t seem to have done anything for them, if that\'s what they\'re doing, and he somehow escaped his prison so... maybe just use the cannon on him to be safe?Why would someone even build a cannon that can destroy galaxies? What is the purpose of that? As a way to keep the Jurai in check? And if Kain destroyed the entire Galaxy Police force, where did Washu get the cannon from? Or is that at the university she got kicked out of? Why does a university have a galaxy destroying cannon?So Kain gets powerful enough to escape his prison somehow. Okay. Why... go after Achika? Why go back in time? Did he lose control of his power and get kicked back in time after traveling near Earth for some reason - which was nowhere near his prison cell - and then, well, he\'s \'attracted\' to Jurai energy so he found Achika? It\'s less silly than thinking he planned this out. He clearly doesn\'t know who Achika or Yosho are ahead of time. Although it\'s odd that he\'d go after Achika rather than Yosho, considering that Yosho might be stronger. Maybe Yosho really is just that good at hiding himself.I feel like if a sentient supernova, as Washu puts it, were able to break out of an impossible to break out of dimensional prison somehow, probably going to the planet with lots of Jiraians on it would make more sense than traveling to some random planet and then going back to the past. Particularly when there are fewer powerful Jiraians there. In the present you have Yosho, Tenchi, Ayeka, Sasami, and all the equipment from Ayeka and Yosho\'s ships. In the past you just have Yosho and Achika, and the remnants of past Jiraians who settled there long since. Kain doesn\'t seem to be out of control of his powers. His time travel was deliberate. So... why? It\'s not like Achika trapped him originally. Why not travel back and kill the people who imprisoned him in the first place?The A-Team gets told one instruction: DO NOT INTERACT WITH ACHIKA BECAUSE THAT COULD CAUSE A PARADOX! So what do they do? Immediately do their best to interact with and interfere with Achika\'s life. I mean already the answer to PARADOX is ""stalk teenager in the past"" so whatever.And why is the random galaxy police officer there? Can the galaxy police travel back in time? Kain should already be in prison in 1970. Why doesn\'t the dude alert headquarters if he\'s from that time period? How did he track down Achika? Washu at least has Tenchi to go on for her calculations. What the heck is this officer relying on to track Achika down? For that matter, why isn\'t the information that officer had available to Washu when Washu looks up the database info about 1/3 of the way through the story? I like watching Ryoko fight, but the dude is literally there just to pass time by telling us information we should have learned earlier.Why doesn\'t 1970s Yosho know who Ayeka is? He should be able to at least tell that she\'s from Jurai, at the least. I get it, past him is only in like five seconds of two scenes. Maybe he\'s just observing to see that nothing goes wrong. Maybe he doesn\'t know she\'s his sister. I guess. But... still.Why is Mihoshi a teacher and Kiyone is a janitor? There\'s no reason for them to pick one over the other, but Kiyone makes better sense as a teacher because she has the sense to figure it out more than Mihoshi does. Sure, Mihoshi could probably still screw up a janitorial position, but how would she pass as a teacher? Her entire time on-screen is devoted to how bad a teacher she is. Hilariously, somehow, in the next film she\'s shown doing cleaning work. There\'s no story reason for why Kiyone went with the janitorial position, unless you editorialize that Kiyone hates kids and/or teaching and Mihoshi hates manual labor and/or cleaning?And then there\'s the climax.

It had everything. Action, romance, comedy and fantasy all combined into a half hour of greatness. IN LOVE is the first feature film of the Tenchi franchise, released in the golden years of anime, the 1990's. A space being known only as Kain has escaped space police custody and plans on traveling back to 1970 to kill Tenchi's mother, and destroy her and Tenchi's royal bloodline. After viewing some old videos Tenchi's mother mysteriously disappears from the film and Tenchi himself...starts to dissipate. Now he and his friends must travel to Tokyo, 1970 top stop Kain from killing his mother thus preventing him from ever existing. In an ultimate showdown in a alternate dimension.If you loved Tenchi and 90's anime as much as I do, there is a lot to take from this film. The artwork is drawn in the certain old fashion style and the music is charming. The actual film starts out like a slice of life as everyone adopts to their new lifestyle while trying to protect Tenchi's mom. There is laughter, Ryoko and Ayeka share some their classic banter and other great characters return like Washu, Sasami and co. The third act of the film is a bit slow, going more into the fantasy aspects of Tenchi, where as I was more enjoying the casual school life with a little bit of mystery as to Kain's appearance. But the ending was beautiful because it was your classic anime ending. I don't know why, but endings to anime films, usually from the 90's always get to me. If you love Tenchi Muyo, you will love this film. A classic in 90's anime culture. starts to dissipate.

Tetsuwan Birdy Decode,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3974/Tetsuwan_Birdy_Decode,"[""I will freely admit that I'm a fan of the original Birdy the Mighty. I watched the original OVA back in 1997, and I loved the show for it's surrealistic sci-fi premise. When I heard that the show was being remade into a 13 part TV series, it goes without saying that I was looking forward to it.The original Tetsuwan Birdy manga was created by Yuuki Masami (who is more well known for his Mobile Police Patlabor series), and ran in Shounen Sunday Super magazine. However, Yuuki's work on Kyuukyoku Chojin R (The Ultimate Esper &quot;R&quot;), for the same magazine eventually led to the manga...being abandoned. The original manga was received rather well though, which led to it's adaptation as a four part OVA.It wasn't until a few years later that Yuuki went back to the original Tetsuwan Birdy series, and instead of continuing with the series from the time it was abandoned, he decided to do a complete revision of the series from scratch. The new series, Birdy the Mighty II, began serialisation in Weekly Young Sunday magazine in 2003.The story for both the original OVA and the new series generally follows the same path. Intergalactic police officer Birdy Cephon Altera and her cyborg partner Tute arrive on Earth in pursuit of a wanted alien criminal and, whilst chasing that criminal, she accidentally kills a high school student named Senkawa Tsutomu. However, this is not the end for Tsutomu as the Federation that Birdy works for will provide him with a new body. In the interests of not causing undue alarm to the people around him (and letting him continue with his life), Tsutomu's &quot;soul&quot; is merged with Birdy's body (allowing them to switch between each other), whilst his new body is made.In all honesty, I preferred the story in the OVA. The new series, whilst being more in depth, also tends to drag its heels with regards to the plot. The OVA had a much tighter story, and the pacing was far better because of the time constraints. The new series, whilst giving more information, is also guilty of not using the extra time in the series to drive the story forward. Indeed, there are to many occasions in the new series that can only be described as &quot;filler&quot; moments (thankfully though, there's no real filler episodes).The most noticeable thing about this series is the quality of the artwork and the animation. The character designs are very much in keeping with both manga, however the level of detail in the designs is superior than that of the OVA. The backgrounds are often very well done, and the CG sequences are very smooth, especially during the sequences in space. A-1 pictures have done some excellent work animating the show, and nowhere is this more noticeable than in the various action sequences. The various fights and chases are extremely fluid and surprisingly detailed.Sound is another big plus for this series, and is definitely better than that of the OVA. The sound effects used throughout the show are generally very good, although some of the effects can be a little odd in their usage. The OP is a pretty good J-rock track by Hearts Grow, entitled Sora. I have to admit that I much prefer the track used for the ED though, as it seems more in keeping with the slightly whimsical nature of the show.Birdy is actually a pretty good character on the whole. During her time on Earth she moonlights as an up-and-coming idol named Arita Shion. The nice part about giving Birdy a &quot;secret identity&quot; is that it allows more of her playful personality to come to the fore.Tsutomu, on the other hand, is more of a typical high school boy of the type that appear in many anime. The relationship between Birdy and Tsutomu works surprisingly well however, especially during the time they share one body. There is a definite chemistry between the two characters that was never really developed in the OVA, and the conversations between the two are often lively.The downside though, is that a number of the other characters aren't developed well (or at all in some cases). Some of the more prominent characters (Nakasugi Sayaka and Satyajit Shyamalan for example), could have received a great deal more development than the show provided, especially in the case of Shyamalan.That said though, this is still a entertaining series. There's enough going on in the show to keep you interested, although the end of the show was rather predictable. I did enjoy the series on the whole, and whilst it may be superior to the OVA in many respects, it doesn't have the same pacing or the tight storyline of the original.This is a show that action fans may enjoy, but it may also appeal to those who want to see a strong female lead. If you simply want a show that's got action without being too serious, then it may be worth giving this a try.Given a choice though, I would go for the OVA before watching this. being abandoned.

The story itself was good in this series.  Maybe they had spread it over 12 ep. instead of just 4 OVA's back then.   I remembered watching the &quot;Birdy&quot; first OVA's  many moons ago and I was like &quot;eh&quot; about the anime back then.  When I saw they were coming out with an 12 episode series, I was willing to give it a try and happy I did.  It's refreshing to see a anime thats different...from your run of the mills anime.  I'm sad that it ended, but I've enjoyed every episode and can't wait for the 2nd season.The animation was crisp and smouth especially the fighting scenes.  The color palet theyused  is very soft, not to loud in some anime I watched.  Also the voice acting was great.  Also the bgm was good not to heavy, just right.  I also enjoyed the OP and ED music they used. Very up-beat and goes with the anime.The characters designs are great. Every one was drawn completly different from the other and aways wore something different. Also they we're believable and wasn't annoying.Overall, I really enjoyed this series to the point that when it finished I wanted to see whole series again at that point. I strongly recommend  &quot;Tetsuwan Birdy Decode&quot; To anyone who want to see something different. I also recommend that you watch the first OVA's before watching the series to see the diffence between them. from your run of the mills anime.

Therefore this version is going to be reviewed on its own merits.I actually found this show when it was recommended to me on Netflix. It looked interesting so I gave it a shot.  Birdy had a pretty original premise and that was what initially got me hooked.  It seemed like it was going to be mostly an action-based series with aliens thrown in, which is exactly what it is at times, but a lot of the fight scenes are pretty intense and fun to watch....The story didn\'t focus entirely on the intergalactic alien hunter aspect of the series though which was nice, call it a pleasant case of Multiple Personality Disorder.  It added a little bit of comedy, mystery, and some romance from Tsutomu\'s part in the series.  This worked out to be a nice balance as it gave enough to satisfy the cravings of those action junkies out there while providing general entertainment for those other viewers.The show climaxed nicely with everything that had been building up and the ending was so bitter-sweet that it actually made me like the series more.  However, the ending was far from conclusive for the Birdy franchise as a whole.  The last episode left with more questions and mysteries left unsolved than when the season began, working as a nice setup for season 2.  Unfortunately I will say that the show has a tendency to drag its heels at times, moving the pace to almost a crawl occasionally.  And while no episode is truly filler as something important to the story always happens, there still were a lot of moments that served only to slow the series down.I thought that the art for Birdy was pretty good, actually really good, which is most likely the result of it being a newer title.  There was a pretty nice mix of CGI and animation which helped when combined with the overarcing theme of sci-fi and aliens.  The fight scenes were always nice to watch and were nice and dark and gritty.  On the flip side when the animators wanted to they came out with some really nice looking peaceful and artistic scenes and some nice everyday animation.My only problem with the animation was that sometimes things looked TOO nice.   It kind of reminded me of watching the special effects that you see from movies in the 70\'s or 80\'s in that things didn\'t look right with the rest of the scene. Sometimes the animation would be so intricate and detailed that the scene or one aspect of the scene would look clunky or awkward in regards to the rest and that took away from the overall experience at times.All of the characters had extremely unique appearances so there was no possible way of confusing one character with another, I\'ll chalk that one up to a plus for the animators and animation.  The development of these characters was not quite as refined however.  Most of the character development in our main twosome is through Birdy by means of various flashbacks and references from other characters, but these are usually left untouched and are a part of the slew of mysteries that were left at the end of the series.  Birdy\'s alter ego Shion Arita, while not making many appearances, served to add a dash of humor to the series at times too.  Tsutomu was a pretty average male anime lead but he grew up a bit over the series, apparently dying does that to you, or maybe it\'s just puberty, I can\'t say for sure, and there were definitely times where he showed some balls throughout the series.On a side note this reminds me of another point I wanted to make.  Despite the fact that this show is about a teenage boy sharing a body with a hot alien girl, Tsutomu always remains a perfect gentleman and doesn\'t act weird when he\'s riding around in Birdy\'s body.  The series refrained from using that plot point as an excuse for having weird ecchi moments with Tsutomu and Birdy for cheap kicks.  This show was about as un-ecchi as you can get.  Birdy takes like 20 baths over the course of the series but not once does Tsutomu try to say or do something weird or perverted with their body, which makes me give major props to the director of this show for not tailoring to those who only picked up the series because there was a hot alien girl as the main character.Some of the background characters have important roles in regards to the main story.  Others have absolutely no relevance to it at all.  And still others appear to have some role but that role is unknown for now and the viewer won\'t know for sure until...you guessed it, season 2.  As for the primary antagonists, they aren\'t really given a good amount of devlopment either but it doesn\'t particularly hurt the story in any way.The opening theme ""Sora"" wasn\'t anything unique but it was still pretty good and I liked it while the ending theme ""Let\'s Go Together"" is just a fun and peppy ""just don\'t give a fuck"" kind of song that was always pretty enjoyable.This was a pretty good action show.  It was a pretty good sci-fi show.  It was also a pretty good looking show with some good characters and a good plot.  Basically what I\'m saying here is that Birdy the Mighty: Decode is a solid show all around and if you don\'t mind it being a bit slow, I don\'t see why anyone wouldn\'t enjoy it.  It\'s diverse in the genres that it throws at the viewer, it\'s a unique story, and it leaves you wanting more at the end.

No one can tell me that alien crime fighters with swelling bosoms aren’t quality entertainment. So I sat there, legs crossed, pondering what I could watch. I took the necessary steps, asked a few of my friends who lurked in the dank recesses of their mother’s basement, desperate carnal housewives and of course, the internet. To my surprise the vast archives...Google unfurled the arms of its vast archives to reveal Birdy: a futuristic Venus, flecked tresses and state-of-the-art thong.

On the contrary, it’s a blend: a large helping of action and science fiction, a few doses of political struggle and a shot of comedy some zest of romance thrown in for good measure. These elements play friendly enough together, but this is where the series falters; the plot strands tangle themselves into a distracted wreck.It starts modestly enough; Birdy has come to Earth from Altaria to investigate Geega, a smuggler who nabbed an unknown alien artifact.

Birdy the Mighty is forgettable plotwise due to a tired genre of Alien superiority. The whole ""Aliens are stronger than us but we must survive somehow"" premise is dealt by the novels like ""War of the Worlds"" by H.G. Wells or even t.v. shows like ""Star Trek"" in a greater and more investing manner. The sharing of a body aspect however is quite interesting as it leads to clever and fun character interactions.Art: 8. The aspect of this show that really brought me in was the direction...in which the art took. I saw a show with clean animation and cool character designs. I wasn\'t disappointed, but I also wasn\'t blown away. Birdy\'s movements in battle however are truly stunning. The animation style shifts during fight scenes to something else entirely. It takes the simplistic approach of a bare minimum to show movement and coherence and blasts it in front of you in full glory. The fights in this show are something to behold.Sound: 9. Birdy the Mighty has a stirring and befitting soundtrack. Similar to the Christopher Nolan ""Dark Knight"" movies, the soundtrack in exciting scenes drives and pumps you up. It creates a truly atmospheric feeling that draws you into the anime as if you were really there.Characters: 8. The character dynamic between Birdy and Tsutomu, who share a body after Birdy accidentally kills Tsutomu, is refreshing and interesting to watch because the two are at polar ends of the spectrum. Birdy is a stubborn but likeable action hero who stifles crime with her fists and Tsutomu is just an everyday guy trying to maintain his life while dealing with extraterrestrial affairs. However the supporting cast is quite weak and the villains utterly boring.Enjoyment: 9. I really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to any action lovers. Shows like this really demonstrate that if every component is at least good in the show, the show can be great. The overall product is what really struck me as nearly poetic as profound themes are lightly explored. However this is still an action show and should be watched as such, just expect to pick up some things along the way. in which the art took.

In her chase after an interplanetary criminal, Birdy accidentally destroys Tsutomu's body in her fight with the criminal. However, through some alien power, Birdy saves Tsutomu's mind by absorbing it into her body. While Tsutomu's body is being repaired by scientists in the Federation, he must share a body with Birdy and help her protect...the galaxy. (Keep in mind that Birdy can shapeshift back and forth between her body and Tsutomu's, and that she can surrender or grant control of the body to Tsutomu.)The story is a unique cross between slice-of-life and science fiction. However, the series can be extremely confusing with the plot going every which way- political intrigues on the planet Altaria, Tsutomu's relations with his classmates, the mysteries surrounding Shyamalan Satyajit. The flow of the plot feels too fast though- again, too many events squeezed into a mere thirteen episodes. Even so, the show keeps a great balance between humorous and serious moments. I was disappointed in the lack of the more perverted humorous scenes I was expecting- like Tsutomu overreacting while being in a hot female body, for instance, or Birdy's reaction to being in Tsutomu's body.The animation and sound are great. I enjoyed both the OP and ED, which really matched the cheerful, determined mood of Birdy and Tsutomu. The art style of the series was great- I especially liked how the expressions of the various characters were animated, with good taste too (none of those overused, overdramatic face faults many other animes favor). I felt that the animation worked very well, almost seamlessly with the music and voice acting.Unfortunately, the only characters that I truly liked were Birdy and Tsutomu. And even then, admittedly, Tsutomu was the typical weak, jaded, yet gallant boy who works (in Tsutomu's case, is forced to work) with a powerful girl. Most of the other characters seemed very flat. Tsutomu's classmates all can be relied on, in every scene Tsutomu's not there, to complain about his abscence, make fun of him, and/or whine about their own circumstances. The main 'villains', Shyamalan and Capella, seem disappointingly stereotypical of the devious, calculating, power-hungry baddies, although they aren't totally unoriginal. Then again, there weren't many opportunities for side characters to develop very far, seeing as the show focuses mainly on the two main characters.Overall, Tetsuwan Birdy Decode possesses an original and fresh background, interesting character development, and is overall a good watch. However, to me, the storyline felt somewhat rushed and the side character interactions were admittedly much less interesting than those between Birdy and Tsutomu. Despite these shortcomings, the show is very entertaining and worth the watch. the galaxy.

I also wasn't expecting much with a premise about a high school boy sharing bodies with a hot alien super cop. Now I am so glad that I decided to buy this series and hope more people seek it out in the future.I was expecting loads of fan service, but that was kept to a relative minimum. I found the story to be decently paced and the characters to be developed well. The fight scenes were well done and overall the animation was nice. I have a few issues...with the English dub, but that is mostly word choices in a few spots that didn't seem necessary. I also found the music to be catchy and can easily recall the OP tune in my head. While it isn't fantastic, I do believe the series in underrated and deserves a little more attention as an overall good anime.Overall this series is a 5/5 star in my book, and I hope more seek it out in the future. with the English dub, but that is mostly word choices in a few spots that didn't seem necessary.

Reboots aside, this is one of the best shining examples of story and character done right. With one exception. For the most part the characters are believable, you can understand why every character acts and portray themselves surprisingly realistically. But the main villain. He's almost a disappointing level of why. He's great for memes and in his own way feels like he belongs somewhere, but that place isn't here sadly. While this is a fun anime,...it's never had anything to really take you out of belief till he shows up and it's blatantly obvious. Aside from him, I do love the art style but it isn't always top quality, especially in action scenes when visuals are needed, and I've heard people don't always enjoy the audio but I don't recall it really but not to say there isn't any. I can definitely say this is a fun anime with natural characters and relations between the them. No forced romance here. There is some ecchi though but it doesn't really get too in the way. I would recommend this to most people.Review for season 2 continued and if you need more to go on. it's never had anything to really take you out of belief till he shows up and it's blatantly obvious.

That was a mistake, because this anime is awesome.  It has so much going for it, but I think the key thing is that while this anime is centered mostly around high school kids, it's not childish.  It's a mature story, and very well told. Not a lot of plot holes, not a lot of moe, or nosebleeding, and it actually intersperses adults naturally with children.  It's not like most animes today where adults are these far away uninvolved authority figures who only show up at key...times to push plot.  You had adults working side by side with the kids to figure out what was going on.  I liked that as it made the anime feel more realistic and mature.I also liked the main characters, Birdy and Senkawa.  But, especially Birdy.  Strong, capable and intelligent, but also goofy and humorous at others.  The villain, Shymalan was pretty strong as a villain as well, but a bit too arrogant, so you knew what would happen with him eventually.  But, what was great about it, is that there are other forces at play behind Shymalan, throughout the anime which left you guessing what was actually going to happen with the Ryunka and where the anime goes from here.  There's a lot of double crossing, and government subterfuge involved in this anime, as alien forces are jockeying for power with Earth as a pawn in the middle.I also loved that this anime wasn't focused on keeping things happy and upbeat.  There's a fair amount of death in this.  So, even though it has a kind of animation style and feel like it should be more peppy and sweet, it's really a more serious anime with serious consequences.While Birdy was great and I'm going to jump straight into the sequel, it did have a few flaws.  Mainly, the ending was predictable.  As soon as they revealed a way to have a somewhat happy ending, you knew instantly how things were going to play out in the finale.  So, while it was still a good ending, it was easy to see how things were going to finish.  Still, it managed to happen in a way I didn't quite expect, so I was still a little surprised.Another thing was the cast had a few irritating characters.  Particularly Natsumi, who was way too naggy as Senkawa's childhood friend. She just never stopped nagging. She is definitely someone's future ex-wife.  Really, most of Senkawa's childhood friends were irritating. Ryouta was just a constant jerk all the time for no reason and I can't remember his name, but the guy who was so overly hyped about exploring abandoned buildings was extremely irritating. I wanted him to die.  Fortunately the latter two didn't get too much screen time to drag the anime down.Other than that this was a very good anime.

This beautiful show is gorgeously rendered with stunning linework and visual aesthetics. The tone of the story matches the art very well. The fight scenes are so dynamic and the movement of the characters can be so fluid and artistic at times, that it comes alive to the viewer.The musical score is reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop, with flowing and moving musical pieces that will remain in memory long after the show is over.The characters progress and grow beyond that of a linear plane...and are deeply emotional. As the deep and well developed story progresses, so does Birdy as she encounters more obstacles.All in all, Birdy the Mighty is my favorite anime.

Please watch this show to experience the beauty for yourself.', 'Tetsuwan Birdy Decode is an anime from late 08 based off of a manga from the mid to late 80s. It was originally written by Yuuki Masami. The anime was handled by A-1. Yes, them again. And this one came out before Kuroshitsuji too. Which will officially make it the earliest A-1 anime I’ve reviewed. I don’t know what to expect since their quality is so variable. Let’s have a look.Story:We open with our titular Birdy in pursuit of some criminals. Turns out she’s a federation security agent and yet she doesn’t wear gold. In any case, she captures their getaway driver but they scarper....Cut to some time later, Birdy and her squid friend have tracked the criminals to Earth. Because of course you have to set things on Earth instead of an alien civilisation. It just makes things so much more interesting when we see the usual scenery. Also, much easier than developing an alien culture. Any way, they manage to confront one of the crooks only to have him play operation human shield with a random civilian, thereby getting said civilian sliced in half. They transfer his consciousness into Birdy’s body while they fix his and the misadventures of these two swapping places and clashing begins.Let’s start with the biggest narrative problem, the aesthetic. This series takes itself pretty seriously while including some really goofy content that’s actually impossible to take seriously. For example, the main characters sharing a body and having to swap control and forms, because I guess Birdy can shape shift. That’s an element you’d expect to see used for goofy sitcom style shenanigans, but this series largely tries to use it for drama. Including having situations where people die or get hurt because these two find themselves in an awkward predicament. Then we have one of the major antagonists, Shyamalan. This dude looks like he’s intended as a stand in for M Night Shyamalan & happens to completely unsubtly have the same family name. Again, this is something that could be great in a comedy. A criminal Shyamalan parody who sets up dumb twists for his crimes. Robs a bank while taking hostages, turns out the small children in the crowd are his accomplices and they pull out comically large weapons that would only be legal to buy in America. He hijacks a plane but it turns out that he owns the air line and he’s technically allowed to have one of the planes go somewhere else, it’s just terrible customer service. That could be hilarious. But this series just plays him as a subdued, narcissist and tries to have some serious scenes with him that you can’t actually take seriously because he’s a fucking M Night Shyamalan stand in.There are also a lot of little plot details that don’t go anywhere. The undercover modelling career Birdy has for, like, an episode and then doesn’t get mentioned again. The whole issue where Tsutomu’s mind might envelop hers but it never really becomes an issue. But I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt on these in general since there is a second series. Maybe that one actually does something with them.With that being said, the series does have some interesting stuff. What little we actually see of the alien society is pretty neat. The narrative has enough intrigue to keep it compelling, even if impossible to take seriously. To be honest, I am kind of interested in seeing the second series. The big climax has some strong moments and I do appreciate that they resolve the major conflict of the series and leave a more minor thing that crops up as the sequel bait.Characters:The characters in this, at least the major and important secondary ones, are largely pretty decent. Shyamalan is kind of your generic “I am super important and therefore can do what I wish for my goals” types of villains & a lot of the class mate characters are pretty dull too. There are also the “mysterious” characters who may get some development in the second series but are just vaguely cryptic in this one. Our main pair has some complexity to them. I appreciate that the series doesn’t push a romance with them, giving Tsutomu a different girl he likes. Because it’s just really stupid when a series goes “we pushed these two characters together with some contrivances. Now they’re in love.” Hayamiya is interesting. Tuto has his moments. I kind of like that he puts on the guise of super flamboyance and seems to enjoy himself doing it but has significantly more to him. There are too many characters out there who are just flamboyant.Art:The artwork is nothing spectacular. In general, it looks fine and the stylistic way they do action for it can really work but the characters look a bit plain and the backgrounds are just functional and kind of bland. Like Mito, the aliens are largely just animal people but this series does put considerably more effort into making them look interesting. I actually kind of like the alien designs, when they don’t just look human. Pity you see so little of them.Sound:There are some good performances from Chiba Saeko, Sakamoto Maaya, Irino Miyu, Itou Kanae & Kawada Shinji. Even the actors who voice less than interesting characters do pretty darn well in their roles. The music from Kanno Yugo is quite good.Ho-yay:Tuto is, I’m pretty certain, not straight. Him aside, none of the other characters really come across as being romantically interested in anyone of the same sex. It’s like the exact opposite of the stories I write in that regard.Final Thoughts:Tetsuwan Birdy Decode has some pretty severe problems. It has elements that would only work as comedic but played far too seriously. Its characters range from mundane to pretty good and its art has a lot of meh to it. Overall, it’s not a bad anime by any stretch but I can’t call it a good one either. It’s an average work that had the potential to be so much more with some effort and thought. So, I give it a 5/10. Next week, Pokemon: Mewtwo no Gyakushuu. Cut to some time later, Birdy and her squid friend have tracked the criminals to Earth. Because of course you have to set things on Earth instead of an alien civilisation. It just makes things so much more interesting when we see the usual scenery. Also, much easier than developing an alien culture. Any way, they manage to confront one of the crooks only to have him play operation human shield with a random civilian, thereby getting said civilian sliced in half. They transfer his consciousness into Birdy’s body while they fix his and the misadventures of these two swapping places and clashing begins.Let’s start with the biggest narrative problem, the aesthetic. This series takes itself pretty seriously while including some really goofy content that’s actually impossible to take seriously. For example, the main characters sharing a body and having to swap control and forms, because I guess Birdy can shape shift. That’s an element you’d expect to see used for goofy sitcom style shenanigans, but this series largely tries to use it for drama. Including having situations where people die or get hurt because these two find themselves in an awkward predicament. Then we have one of the major antagonists, Shyamalan. This dude looks like he’s intended as a stand in for M Night Shyamalan & happens to completely unsubtly have the same family name. Again, this is something that could be great in a comedy. A criminal Shyamalan parody who sets up dumb twists for his crimes. Robs a bank while taking hostages, turns out the small children in the crowd are his accomplices and they pull out comically large weapons that would only be legal to buy in America. He hijacks a plane but it turns out that he owns the air line and he’s technically allowed to have one of the planes go somewhere else, it’s just terrible customer service. That could be hilarious.

Next week, Pokemon: Mewtwo no Gyakushuu.', 'This is one of those strange shows where one of the main characters dies before the main plot is even really talked about. I can’t help feeling like I have heard this story somewhere before, where two people have to share one body for a time period. I just can’t think of the show at the moment. Many of the characters personalities bother me; Birdy’s is a little two out there in the English dub. Tsutomu’s friend is positively the nosiest person in this. She will not leave him alone for a second and buts her nose into his business constantly. Sadly, they also bring...people in suddenly without much info and leave you to figure out what the heck is going on for a while. There are a lot of cut scenes back and forward from different areas and they don’t really click where they are supposed to come into play.The artwork is a little interesting and sometimes not consistent enough to be the best. Many times, the artwork feels really lazy. Many times, the characters lose shape a lot and some look off, no eyebrows and don’t have really great facial looks to it. Overall, it’s pretty bland and un-detailed with 3D spliced all over the place from outer space to just little camera angle changes. Sad thing is that you can actually see and know that its 3D without even having to look too hard. The outfit Birdy wears is really too showy and ecchi, made mostly for fan service it seems and I don’t get why almost every step seems to have this flint and medal look where sparks fly.When it comes to the voices, it’s all over the place. Tute is one of the best I think, the English voice actor, J. Michael Tatum (known for Sebastian from Black Butler and Scar in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) sounds a lot like Shinji Kawada, the Japanese voice actor. He seems to have the perfect voice for the knowledgeable character in these. Birdy on the other hand… well… I like her Japanese voice better then her English one. Her Japanese voice sounds more like one of authority then her English Teen pop voice. Even when she’s relaxed in Japanese, she sounds more like a investigator.Unfortunately, I lost interest in most of the show after the 3rd episode because of a certain character was pretty much thrown out of the show. To me, that character was the only worth watching in this show. The rest really got on my nerves. people in suddenly without much info and leave you to figure out what the heck is going on for a while.

While the series does seemingly set itself up as a typical space action-adventure about an alien agent stopping criminals, it does quite a bit to make itself stand out. It sets up Tsutomu having to share Birdy's body after his body accidentally gets wasted by Birdy during a fight with a thug. This sets up the entertaining chemistry between the two characters as they often get at odds with one another over who gets to snag control of Birdy's body as Tsutomu wants to retain whatever normalcy...he can in his life while Birdy wants to press on with her mission on Earth where possible.I've seen a number of reviews online criticize about how they find Tsutomu's character to be rather annoying as he complains very often throughout the series. But considering the kid's a teen, I think his complaining is justified as he deals both with the typical things a kid his age would go through combined with adjusting to his unique circumstances of sharing a body with an attractive female alien agent. His character does develop throughout the series as he learns to cooperate with Birdy as she helps her out at some points within the series and develops a relationship with one of his classmates that the series takes enough time to properly develop and make it credible that Tsutomu would fall for her, especially as said classmate is another central character in the mission Birdy undergoes in this series.As for the central plot to the series, it is a typical case of an alien threat setting out to wipe out humanity via a powerful weapon. The show takes its time laying out its developments in regards to Birdy tracking down the alien thugs and finding the location of the weapon they brought to Earth. The series tosses in some twists in regards to who has it and what it is capable of with some elements being fairly typical and others somewhat surprising to see unfold. This becomes prominent in Birdy the Mighty Decode's second half where we get introduced to an influential human character whose plans with the weapon are fairly typical of shallow anime baddies and the weapon's nature bringing about some shocking developments involving said mentioned classmate with Tsutomu. One major flaw with Birdy the Mighty: Decode is that it makes mention to some character alliances and aspects of Birdy's past that aren't expanded upon in this season of the show, especially with the show's lack of a proper ending.In terms of visual presentation, Birdy the Mighty Decode is a mixed bag. While sporting decent-looking scenery and having moments of great animation in action scenes, the character designs look rough and don't have much in the way of detail. The show also takes occasional shortcuts with its animation featuring static shots of the characters, speed lines and some other apparent methods.While not a perfect title, Birdy the Mighty Decode made for an entertaining series thanks to its unique character chemistry with Tsutomu and Birdy, Tsutomu's developments and some of the later developments involving the alien weapon. It looked apparent that the show still had more to tell considering the hints dropped of Birdy's past and said mentioned character alliances thus I plan to give Birdy's second season a shot at some point. he can in his life while Birdy wants to press on with her mission on Earth where possible.I've seen a number of reviews online criticize about how they find Tsutomu's character to be rather annoying as he complains very often throughout the series.

I really did. But a bigger budget, and 8 more eps to retell a rather tight story from 1996 does not a good show make.I may have NOT given the it enough of a chance,but I find it impossible to sit down and rewatch it. The art is lovely, the character design is well done. The audio is crisp and not over laden with overly dramatic themes The pacing feels very off and the story simply wanders, perhaps a gift of the extra time to fill and I didnt give a hoot about any of...the leads by the 2nd ep,a  very bad sign for me. Perhaps veiwing Kashimashi has influenced my opinion of this series. the leads by the 2nd ep,a  very bad sign for me. Perhaps veiwing Kashimashi has influenced my opinion of this series.', '""Tetsuwan Birdy Decode,"" or ""Birdy the Mighty: Decode,"" is a smartly written  show with decent production values and a good hook. It is not an ambitious show however. Birdy the Mighty is a show that proves to be quite entertaining, but its not likely to leave you with much after the credits roll. There\'s nothing wrong with that, but its something to keep in mind when deciding to watch it or not.Birdy\'s characters are likable enough, but not particularly complex. The show does provide a nice duality between public and private life though. Whether its Tuto\'s charming mix of effeminate charisma and straight faced...mentorship, or Birdy\'s public role of air headed, demure pin-up girl contrasted with her brash, independent nature as a galactic cop. Birdy and high schooler Senkawa also have fairly good chemistry together. The story makes sure to establish early on that Birdy and Senkawa\'s relationship is strictly platonic, which is good because sexual tension between two people sharing the same body could prove more than a little unnerving.I don\'t recall the music too well outside of a fantastic opening and a catchy ending. That doesn\'t necessarily mean the score was bad, it just wasn\'t particularly memorable. At least it wasn\'t distracting, and sometimes that\'s all that matters.The art is smooth and clean, with a soft color palette. It does tend to get rather sketchy when there\'s a lot of movement on screen, making the action hard to follow sometimes. Conversely, the sketchiness allows the fight scenes to be fluid and dynamic. In my opinion, it was a fair trade-off.As far as conflict goes, I found it hard to take the main antagonist seriously. Perhaps that\'s due to the fact that he takes a passive role in the story and rarely interacts with the protagonists. Or maybe its because he has a tendency to spew rather cliched villain rhetoric. It doesn\'t help that he\'s an Indian television producer named after M. Night Shyamalan. The dubious homage is a tad bit humorous, but it really doesn\'t help his credibility as a villain. Although to be fair, it could rightfully be argued that he\'s not the main threat, but to follow that line of thought any further would be to risk delving into spoiler territory.Birdy the Mighty: Decode is a show that\'s consistently entertaining, but very rarely impactful. If you\'re looking for a meaningful animated experience, you\'d be wise to look elsewhere. But if you\'re in the mood for something fun, and occasionally touching, then you could do a whole lot worse than Tetsuwan Birdy Decode. mentorship, or Birdy\'s public role of air headed, demure pin-up girl contrasted with her brash, independent nature as a galactic cop.

I\'m not really sure what compelled me to watch it, since I\'m not usually drawn to anime with title art such as this, but I started watching and I couldn\'t stop. Birdy definitely surprised me with her confidence and character development. The story itself didn\'t feel ""cookie cutter"" and the music went along very well. ', ""Birdy the Mighty: Decode, as I’ll refer it to as, isn’t what I expected based on its cover. It’s a mixed-genre show with some fun action and entertainment.  However, by no means is this a terrible show, but it is fairly above average and competently made.* I will note that this is far from an ecchi anime. It's actually a reboot to the 90's 4 episode OVA.* I will also note that this is based on a more objective 5 as the mean instead of 7 in standard grading.Story- 5/10Intergalactic criminals have opposed the Federation and snuck into the backwater planet called Earth. Now...our bodacious female lead, the extra-terrestrial federal investigator Birdy Cephon tails down their track. However, an ordinary high school student named Tsutomu Senkawa was caught in the crossfire in the chase as Birdy smashes his body. In direct share of her fault, she loans her body for his conscious to live until they repair his body.The idea of the body sharing of our two main characters, the male teenage student, Tsutomu Senkawa and Birdy Cephon Altera, is the main focus of the story. With their quirky interactions and squabbles, both attempt to balance their contrasting lifestyles; Birdy hunts down criminals that landed on Earth while our male protagonist continues to be a high school student in the midst of all things.The format for the first part (first 6 episodes) initially follows a more episodic stand point in which it introduces a monster of the week and various characters to flesh out its universe. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really go anywhere nor does it well congeal together, making it seem disjointed and weirdly paced.However, the second part (the latter part) of the story becomes a better story arc with Tsutomu and that follows more of a mystery story that slowly builds up to the show’s climax. It becomes much more focused on its characters and it has its moments, but it is fairly straight-forward and predictable with its ending. Also, the resolution to amend the problem is there, but it’s seemingly rushed with a minute worth of explanation.Characters- 6/10The main character definitely is Tsutomu. He is your average high school student who doesn’t act outrageously based on his adolescent mindset. However, he is a bit bland but it is certainly entertaining to see the platonic interactions between him and Birdy, making him more likable as a character and less cringe-worthy on its gender-bending premise (though I prefer it to call it an identity switching, similar to superheroes).  He shines more in the second half but that would be spoiler territory.Birdy is, however, the much better character. Despite her cheesecake appearance susceptible to loads of fan service, the nudity is toned down very much and helps complement her personality. Her Earthling persona as Shion Arita, the pin-up model, is a façade to her true self and her more serious attitude to chase the criminals. Her enjoyment in taking baths becomes an avenue for her to unwind after her job as it’s different from the regimented healing tubs she is accustomed. It’s a shame her secret identity doesn’t get further expounded or gets used.The others are characterized quite decently such as Tuto, Hayamiya and many of Tsutomu’s friends, however, they lack proper screen time for them to be memorable. In addition, they aren't exactly relevant to the overall story which again makes them more of a hindrance at times than an asset. Unfortunately, Sayaka Nakasugi, one of Tsutomu’s friends, seems too dull and too stereotypical despite a lot of screen time. However, she isn’t as bad as the main antagonist who has more characterization from his parodied name than most of his clichéd dialogue.Music-7/10Overall, the music is fine and enjoyable to hear. It’s pretty well rounded with rock, piano, and sometimes with more funky and jazz sounds. It accompanies the show well, but they aren’t quite memorable and doesn't use its repertoire of music to the fullest. The biggest downside to it would be the repeated looping that I noticed within a 5 minute interval of the romantic piano music.Animation/ Art-8/10Either you like its style or not.It’s one of the biggest highlights of the anime and has a great production value in 2008. The style provides thin contours and softer colors which makes it easier on the eyes and helps tone down the fan service it appears to carry.Colors schemes of the blue moonlight and orange sunset are used a lot, often appealing landscapes and wonderfully used great lighting effects. The CG (or CGI) is implemented in the backgrounds that blend fairly well. However, the most noticeable use of CG would only be in Birdy’s ship, Lailalo, that appears on a few occasions and even then it isn't too jarring.Character interactions rely less on the cel animation and often have characters move more dynamically than more traditional anime. However, some won’t like this style and prefer the smoother framing of animation with more vivid colors.There are also some well-animated fights. The choreography is well done without panning elsewhere despite Birdy’s skimpy outfit. Heck, within one fight scene a female robot gets her clothes blown off for reasons to animate her easier rather than to titillate the audience. Unfortunately, the astounding kinetic motions are few and far between each other in the course of 13 episodes to really consider this a heavy action-oriented anime.Enjoyment- 6/10 for the first six episodes, 7/10 for the latter episodesI was fairly impressed with this series as it did entertain me for what it wasn’t. It’s definitely a light and enjoyable action anime with likable characters without the use of panty shots and  groping that normally I would expect from the cover and its heavy focus on high school students. However, for what it is, it's just painfully generic for my taste and I had to slog through the first few episodes.As I kept watching, I started to get impressed with the second part as there was a more definitive direction. It has some touching moments for me and I praise it for not gradually ruining my interest but to slowly build it up in expectations and continue improving.Overall- a mid 6/10It’s an anime that’s certainly well-rounded in genres and doesn’t necessarily do anything wrong. It has its fair share of comedy, romance, action, and slice-of-life and juggles it well. It, however, just doesn’t have that impressive WOW factor and plays it safe. It may even come off as fairly generic for more avid anime fans. But don't be fooled by my low score as  it can still be great fun.Fortunately, it does set up a solid premise near the end in which it helps compliment to the OVA (the Cipher) and the more engaging sequel (Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02). our bodacious female lead, the extra-terrestrial federal investigator Birdy Cephon tails down their track.

Heck, within one fight scene a female robot gets her clothes blown off for reasons to animate her easier rather than to titillate the audience. Unfortunately, the astounding kinetic motions are few and far between each other in the course of 13 episodes to really consider this a heavy action-oriented anime.Enjoyment- 6/10 for the first six episodes, 7/10 for the latter episodesI was fairly impressed with this series as it did entertain me for what it wasn’t. It’s definitely a light and enjoyable action anime with likable characters without the use of panty shots and  groping that normally I would expect from the cover and its heavy focus on high school students. However, for what it is, it's just painfully generic for my taste and I had to slog through the first few episodes.As I kept watching, I started to get impressed with the second part as there was a more definitive direction. It has some touching moments for me and I praise it for not gradually ruining my interest but to slowly build it up in expectations and continue improving.Overall- a mid 6/10It’s an anime that’s certainly well-rounded in genres and doesn’t necessarily do anything wrong. It has its fair share of comedy, romance, action, and slice-of-life and juggles it well. It, however, just doesn’t have that impressive WOW factor and plays it safe. It may even come off as fairly generic for more avid anime fans. But don't be fooled by my low score as  it can still be great fun.Fortunately, it does set up a solid premise near the end in which it helps compliment to the OVA (the Cipher) and the more engaging sequel (Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02)."", ""Tetsuwan Birdy Decode is a story with a great premise, that was unfortunately underutilized by the creators. I had high hopes when entering this series, it had me eagerly waiting to see how the story may develop, but it did not live up to my anticipations, and my interest was steadily dropping after 3 episodes.Let’s first look at what the first episode leaves us with. The series starts off with a flashy and entertaining introduction of the female lead - Birdy Cephon Altera an intergalactic police officer, and moves on to showcasing her earthly alter ego - a rather promising introduction. We are shown the...incident regarding Tsutomu Senkawa, and the start of one of the main plot points - two people sharing one body, and with it a common predicament.The story up to this point has left me hopeful, a likable protagonist, interesting setting to explore and a good (but not unusual) art style with well drawn animation on top of that.The aforementioned elements stay there, but are hindered with bad handling of the script. New arcs and characters are layered on top of each other and left behind, often with no need to introduce them in the first place. The anime tries to do too much in it’s 13 episodes and ends up leaving underdeveloped bits all over the place. The show declines in quality, to the point where watching the last 2 episodes was almost a chore.Let us now look at the characters, of which there is a big quantity with a questionable quality. I already mentioned the female lead and I would say she is the most well written out of the entire cast. We have another fun individual - Tuto; then archetypical school types; a simple, bland villain; and others. The show's writers try to use these characters in creating emotional moments, but those moments lack the necessary depth and have little effect on the viewer.Sound is rather good, I wasn't a huge fan of the OP and ED, but they may be quite appealing.Animation was, as I already said, well drawn.I can recommend this anime to you if you want some action, but you’ll have to go somewhere else for a good story, as it left me shaking my head with disappointment at the ruined potential. incident regarding Tsutomu Senkawa, and the start of one of the main plot points - two people sharing one body, and with it a common predicament.The story up to this point has left me hopeful, a likable protagonist, interesting setting to explore and a good (but not unusual) art style with well drawn animation on top of that.The aforementioned elements stay there, but are hindered with bad handling of the script.

The original OVA was based on the older manga, while this one is based on the new series that fleshed out the story a bit more and added some new characters.I've got some question. Why is M. Night Shyamalan the villain? Were they trying to say that there was going to be a twist ending? Was the twist that he died? He was so convinced that he was creating a perfect society and that...he would be chosen for it but he was literally the first person to die.I wasn't really having much fun with this series, it was more of a chore to watch than anything. The ending song slaps, but the rest was pretty mediocre. Needs more Shion Arata and less Birdy alien stuff. 7/10 he would be chosen for it but he was literally the first person to die.I wasn't really having much fun with this series, it was more of a chore to watch than anything.

The gist of it is more or less the same, but Decode is completed. Although the rating on MAL is pretty decent, I remember this being a series with a fairly lukewarm reception back when it came out—at least the first season, and i can see why.It starts off well enough. A typical sci-fi action/adventure that sometimes looks merely okay or a bit generic, but the production values shift rapidly to be something more awe inspiring. There\'s a lot...of great key animation here, especially coming alive during the numerous action sequences. The problem with a number of ""sakuga fests"" is that, like Naruto, it\'s not uncommon for them to be like dumpster dives where you end up swimming through banana peels and sludge, but you at least find a few nice items--in this case, animation--that (hopefully) makes the tedious and/or gross experience worthwhile. Fortunately, all of these slices of nice animation are presented in an isolated format for your viewing pleasure on Youtube, so while dumpster diving may lead to some unique finds, you can forego the diving part and just get right to the good stuff when it comes to anime. Is BM: D like that? Sort of... it\'s not a slog like Naruto or Bleach or some LONG shounen. It has nice qualities, but it\'s definitely flawed.To begin with, it has one of those storylines following an intergalactic police organization. There are many different races populating various far-flung planets, most of which seem far more advanced than earth. Nothing wrong with it as a concept. Though I\'ve personally never seen it pulled off in a truly great way. Birdy tracks down several alien criminals to earth, and while the story doesn\'t differentiate itself from your average sci-fi anime much, hunting down Geega and Bacillus is quite entertaining, the fights have immense energy and dynamism, the story is well-paced for about 3-4 eps, and there\'s a mystery slowly unravelling, almost like a detective story.Then it goes off the rails. Senkawa and Birdy are fused, which leads to an interesting dynamic between the two, but it feels squandered since most of the runtime switches between the main sci-fi plot, and then to the slow dump that is the school-based slice of life segments. Obviously we\'re going to have school life segments if the two are sharing the same body, but the writing is nothing exceptional in these parts and the pacing is atrocious. Many segments seem like filler. For example, when Senkawa is not present for Nakasugi\'s party, and we\'re presented to several scenes... there\'s really no point to these parts.The same for the urban exploration scenes. I\'m not one of those people who constantly nags if something isn\'t integral to the plot, but it needs to have interesting thematics or ideas, develop the character in some way, etc. This is literally just padding in almost all instances here. Another awkward bit is how Senkawa\'s classmates are pestering him to continue with the urban exploration club that Senkawa started in the first place. It might have made sense to introduce this AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW INSTEAD. I mean, we all know what Senkawa is up to at the beginning, and it wouldn\'t make the fact that the building he randomly picks to explore happens to have a criminal space alien and Birdy--to clumsily advance the plot--any less ridiculous, but still... most of the subplots are also very sloppy, and though the information we learn from these scenes eventually fleshes out aspects of the story, they don\'t feel well integrated. What is even the point in the serial killer subplot in the subways?! (I\'ll concede that this might have had a purpose that I missed, but it didn\'t seem like it did, other than for Capella to have a quick run-in with Birdy and introduce herself to Shyamalan; they could have easily done this without that subplot.)The villain is basically an Indian version (he looks exactly like every other character, just with darker skin. lol) of Bill Gates, who wants to depopulate the planet, of course, though he poses it as selecting between the ""chosen"" versus the ""chaff,"" or whatever epithet you prefer--sort of accelerating evolution. This seems to be the no. 1 go to choice when an author doesn\'t know what to do with his villain. I feel like this is practically every other anime villain nowadays. It\'s not even a spoiler to confirm that he ends up being the chaff as well, because that\'s what ALWAYS happens, so the creator can smugly be like ""Ha, look at my good boy characters triumphing over this narcissistic elitist eugenicist."" I don\'t know whether to sigh or yawn.There is also some definite filler when it comes to the sci-fi side of the coin: when Birdy heads back to headquarters, she is embroiled in a conspiracy involving a race of... dog people who are rebelling against the Federation. It has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot, though it introduces a few new characters. Most of the aliens look really, really stupid. Almost the entire show could have just as easily remained on earth, and the only parts we really needed from here would be a quick court sequence and a bit of exposition, the introduction of Nechia Geeze, and a few choice sequences, and we would be better off.Although there are some enjoyable moments, and occasionally good chemistry between Birdy and the main, a decent opening, etc., it\'s really the great fight scenes that are the main attraction. Do the surrounding scenes enhance these fight scenes because of character motivation and emotions? Eh... not much, tbh. There are really only 4 or so especially good fight scenes. Aside from the opening action, there is the fight with Geega, two fights with Bacillus, and the fight with Ondine. Other than that, there\'s some crappy stuff with the dog people... then the ending sequence is good, but it\'s anti-climatic as an action sequence. If season 2 is better as a series overall in comparison to season 1, then this might be worth trudging through. It\'s just a pretty average and inconsistent series when there are so many better ones out there.

There\'s a lot of potential for a story that starts off with a boy that has to co-exist with another person in the same body since his body got destroyed.However, Tetsuwan Birdy Decode fails to follow up on the character relationships between Birdy and Senkawa.See, Senkawa is portrayed ""realistically"" as to how a normal person would if he was in his predicament. Predictably, he complains, asks for explanations, and is basically a nuisance to Birdy who is trying to protect a tragedy from happening. The thing is, Senkawa is really a boring character to watch....He\'s selfish: He wants to preserve his daily life so much that he\'s willing to get in Birdy\'s way of her own investigation on criminals. Maybe rightfully so, since he got killed by Birdy and she\'s the one who put him in this situation to begin with. Sure, Senkawa is not out of character, and nor is his personality surprising or inconsistent, but I suppose the main problem is that Senkawa just kind of, learns to live with Birdy in a surprisingly normal way. He just ""realizes"" that Birdy is doing something greater than his worries about everyday life, but it\'s done in such a formulaic way that I couldn\'t find any emotional investment to either character.Look, he sees Birdy\'s partner die, and that\'s when he realizes, ""oh shit, this is more serious than I thought,"" which is just kind of lazy writing. There\'s no real drama or conflict that Birdy and Senkawa should be having for being in such a weird arrangement, and instead of an organic conflict and resolution, you kind of just have Senakawa being stubbornly selfish turn into a much more understanding individual without much of a struggle, which is just extremely lazy writing. Senkawa could have understood the brevity of the situation in a much more natural manner, or there could have been a much more of a gray matter than a black and white one.Then, there\'s Birdy herself. She\'s similarly selfish for good reason too: she doesn\'t want to cooperate with Senkawa to continue his everyday life as it takes away time from her investigation. Yet, she\'s also the dominant person in the relationship, being able to take control of the body if she so wishes. Yet, there\'s also the point that Senkawa could take over Birdy\'s body if their compatibility did not mesh together. There really could have been a good arc of understanding each other that didn\'t involve shock value, but instead, gradually taking a look at each other\'s lives, and seeking compromise or understanding. But no, this stuff doesn\'t happen.Even Senkawa and Birdy\'s conversations are always the same. Senkawa does something stupid, Birdy takes a mental jab: rinse and repeat. There\'s not much of a serious conversation or good slice of life and comedy that I\'d expect from the duo. In fact, the bond between Senkawa and Birdy is shallow. No dialogue, no story arcs between them, and instead, we get --oh boy-- the most formulaic story that\'s poorly paced and lacks in execution. Even the most simple things about living in the same body does not happen in this story. Come on, switching genders? Senkawa never getting flustered about seeing a naked girl\'s body in the bath when Birdy takes over? Don\'t even tell me about how it\'s because that\'s just blatant fanservice. Look at Birdy\'s skin-tight bodysuit. But yes, I wouldn\'t really like that either, but at the very least, surprise, right? He should be surprised? I doubt it\'s because the author didn\'t want ecchi scenes, but rather, he doesn\'t even care to have the least bit of an attempt in a deepening of connection between Birdy and Senkawa.The story...it\'s terrible. It all hinges on the fact that Senkawa\'s in love with another person, yet she\'s also the reason that Earth is going to be destroyed. Cheesy, right? Not necessarily bad, since of course, there\'s Birdy\'s mission conflicting with Senkawa. Yet, the love interest in question just kind of randomly falls in love with Senkawa, and vice versa. The love between them is even more shallow than the relationship between Birdy and Senkawa. It\'s forced and lacks substance, which is not what you want when the entire latter half of the story is focused upon her. But of course, the first half of the story is equally flimsy. The show focuses on so many different things that there\'s a lack of substance to anything. There\'s Birdy just chasing different criminals for four episodes straight with nothing to show for it, just a criminal of the week sort of format, and then you have the awful homeland arc, where Birdy has to come to her home planet to report on things. Certainly, the show tries to do worldbuilding, but it\'s all so terribly done. Court systems, pontiffs, judges, are shown in the different world, but for what? It\'s basically a replication of earth, except that these people are different species and tech is way higher. I just find it weird that the show had explain all of these things when you know, basic stuff like, how is the technology to travel at warp speed possible is never explained, and how daily life is conducted is never explained. I\'m going to suspend my belief on the mundane stuff, so don\'t explain it, but why not explain the actual sci-fi stuff?In fact, I just realized this now, but I\'ve certainly watched this show a long time ago, and I\'ve forgotten about it completely because it was so unmemorable and bad. I only realized that after watching the entire show and in the midst of writing this very review. I watched this...TWICE so you don\'t have to. In fact, I only watched the entire thing because the second season apparently is good, but I don\'t even care anymore. Nothing will justify watching this first season. If anything, just skip this entire season and watch the second. There\'s nothing you really need to know. I\'m going to just drop this entire series.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryAside synopsis, I have to say I expected this Anime being one of those older ""niche"" series that probably are utter boredom. But it was actually much more enjoyable than I imagined it to be. Anyhow the progression felt great, I also grew into characters. And I did really like Sayaka. Anyhow, development and story felt as well quite nicely wrapped up. Obviously story goes one but for ""act 1"" it was good.✦Art & SoundArt was somewhat flat, but in a enjoyable way. Animation also felt quite...nice. There was subtle touch of obvious fanservice, but nothing bad.Now as for music&ost, I wasn\'t fond of the songs in this anime, especially the ending theme. But OST I did quite like. Especially I loved the ""Sayaka theme"".✦CharacterMC with straight-man slapstick act. Who is whiny at start, gets used, ends up with humane values and risking for those.Main girl (Birdy) the mischievous agressive-type girl. Who has bad habits, but ultimately is quite caring.Rest are side kicks mostly with various personalities, but my fav is Sayaka. Quiet/kind beautiful ojou-sama with a bit of sadness.There were also bunch of aliens, who were okay and Villains were also quite acceptable.✦Enjoyment & OverallEnded up adding comments to each section so I don\'t really have else to add. As said, unexpectedly good Anime. Finished almost in a day. nice.

Finished almost in a day.', ""Tetsuwan Birdy Decode, or Birdy the Mighty: Decode, the sexy, cute and ungodly strong detective Birdy.This review also contains the review of the OVA Tetsuwan Birdy Decode: The Cipher but I'll be judging them separately.For a start, I say this series isn't all that bad. If you are looking for a series to binge on, I guess Birdy isn't a bad choice to be. Of course, this isn't a very popular series but still feel that you should check it out for yourself. With that, I will explain parts that I like and dislike of the series. Firstly, the show gives off the 2000s vibe....Of course, it was made in 2008 but if you have watched it you would understand what I mean. I want to point out that there was a similar vibe from the show FLCL in the first 3 episodes but sadly it disappeared thereon. Story-wise, I feel that it's alright. Not how or where I wanted it to go but still fine either way. The show went for this 'Sci-fi saving the world' type of show which I would have preferred a Sci-fi blend with slice-of-life where the main character has an alien living in the same body and they have to figure out their corporation in daily life. I say that because of the fact that the supporting characters are so on point and well-built people. They fell alive and so real, plus they are so enjoyable to watch. Birdy and Tsutomu are such a lovely pair and Tsutomu school life with his friends just makes you want more of it. Hence I say the show should have aimed at a more fitted genre due to the great characters. That is to say that the 'Sci-fi saving the world' idea is kinda shallow and bland, I feel it's not that interesting and kinda weak. But I must say this was one of the biggest cameos I have seen in any anime, the man himself, freaking M. Night Shyamalan is in this show and he wants to destroy the world. Rad. However, as much as it is a pleasant surprise to see him, his intentions were weak and poorly shown. Like it just speaks the question to me what he would do after reaching his goal, the show does a crap job on that.-SCORES-Character- 7/10: Love the chemistry between Birdy and Tsutomu, love Tsutomu friends and company, hate the villains and bad guys as they are shallow and poorly written.Art- 8/10: I must say they did a fine job on the art, especially with it being made in 2008. The only issue I had with it is that at far shots, the character's faces are off and poorly drawn.Writing- 6/10: The weakest part of the whole show, didn't answer all of the M. Night Shyamalan's intension and doings plus even when they did it doesn't really make sense or hold up. Additionally, I just wished they included more issues with the everyday life of Birdy and Tsutomu living in the same body. It just speaks to me more as a fan and realism of the show. Other than that the writing is pretty 'meh'.Sound- 9/10: Geez the OST for this series is amazing, you can tell if you pay close attention to them at scenes, there are synth beats with beautiful strings arrangements at other scenes. Really, they outdid themselves on the OST.Overall, I say this is a fine series but the only flaws are it's an antagonist and intensions.Decent to Strong 6And as for the OVA, it was pretty good, wicked intro.Decent 7 Of course, it was made in 2008 but if you have watched it you would understand what I mean. I want to point out that there was a similar vibe from the show FLCL in the first 3 episodes but sadly it disappeared thereon. Story-wise, I feel that it's alright. Not how or where I wanted it to go but still fine either way. The show went for this 'Sci-fi saving the world' type of show which I would have preferred a Sci-fi blend with slice-of-life where the main character has an alien living in the same body and they have to figure out their corporation in daily life. I say that because of the fact that the supporting characters are so on point and well-built people. They fell alive and so real, plus they are so enjoyable to watch. Birdy and Tsutomu are such a lovely pair and Tsutomu school life with his friends just makes you want more of it. Hence I say the show should have aimed at a more fitted genre due to the great characters. That is to say that the 'Sci-fi saving the world' idea is kinda shallow and bland, I feel it's not that interesting and kinda weak. But I must say this was one of the biggest cameos I have seen in any anime, the man himself, freaking M. Night Shyamalan is in this show and he wants to destroy the world. Rad. However, as much as it is a pleasant surprise to see him, his intentions were weak and poorly shown. Like it just speaks the question to me what he would do after reaching his goal, the show does a crap job on that.-SCORES-Character- 7/10: Love the chemistry between Birdy and Tsutomu, love Tsutomu friends and company, hate the villains and bad guys as they are shallow and poorly written.Art- 8/10: I must say they did a fine job on the art, especially with it being made in 2008.

I loved almost everything about her and her personality is what I liked most in the anime. That doesn’t mean that I do not think the other aspects weren’t good as well.Story (8/10): The story isn’t complicated, but it has a few nice twists. It begins quite simply and slowly introduces you into a more complex network. Though thanks to the slow introduction, it’s all quite easy to understand. More than half of the episodes had an exciting end, leaving me eager to watch the next episode.Art (8/10): The animation is...nice, it has a soft touch. Backgrounds are detailed but I would have loved a bit more details in the characters (for example in the eyes), but it didn’t really bother either. I truly enjoyed the action parts, because those were nicely animated (and accompanied with suitable sound effects). I particularly enjoyed the way Birdy’s multicolored hair moved around.Music (9/10): music of the beginning and ending themes matched with the animation, they also contained a soft touch. The ending theme made me happy every time I heard it, but since the story isn’t all about sunshine and rainbows, that felt sort of weird.Characters (8/10): Almost all emotions are shown quite brightly, though some emotions seem to have a bad timing and aren’t as touching as they could have been. As already mentioned, I really liked Birdy’s character, she’s sad when she should be, upset when she should be, … Though she seems to have a great capacity of hiding her emotions as well. During the story, no one really seems to undergo any character-development, but all characters are shown with much detail.Enjoyment (9/10): I was totally absorbed into this anime and could not let it go (I constanly desired to watch another episode), so I truly enjoyed this anime.Overall (8/10): the anime had a lot of good aspects, and a few flaws. I think anyone who can appreciate action, romance and science-fiction would probably at least be entertained by this anime (of course I cannot speak for all of you).I’m truly looking forward to watch Decode II. nice, it has a soft touch.

Birdy the Mighty Decode to be exact, but does it really matter?Tetsuwan Birdy Decode is a remake of some nineties OVA, that being an adaption of some eighties manga, which was written by Yuuki Masami, who also wrote Patlabor. It is directed by Akane Kazuki who also directed Escaflowne and Noien. It tells the tale of  Senkawa, who is in great anime tradition an ordinary high school student... Until he dies. Birdy Cephon went to Earth to chase a mysterious artifact called the Ryunka as an intergalactic cop, but while battling with a bad guy, accidentally kills him. To make...up for it, Birdy puts Senkawa's conscious in her body until it is fixed. Senkawa can live a normal life... Expect when Birdy switches into his body to battle some villains. This causes several problems for both Birdy and Senkawa of course! However, what is the Ryunka? Could it possibly be closer than Birdy or Senkawa can imagine?Okay, so the premise doesn't sound good at all, but surprisingly, there's zero jokes created from the fact that a boy shares the same body with a big-breasted girl, and they can switch who's in control/who's body is up. Heck, there's even a few bathing scenes, and all Senkawa has to say is that Birdy is using his body too much for just relaxing! No, the premise can actually be seen as a flimsy excuse to get Senkawa to follow Birdy around everywhere. All the problems it causes are pretty minor and typically just used for comedy. Instead, most of the plot comes from the very vague artifact simply called the Ryunka.One of my favorite things about this show is the fact that Birdy and Senkawa never get any unresolved sexual tension between them. Senkawa has his eyes on someone else, and the one time Birdy shows any strong feelings towards Senkawa seems to be as she thinks of him as a friend, and her “buddy”. In the age where all lead female and male characters are destined to end up with each other, this is definitely a relief.  Another cliché Birdy ignores is that it kills off what seems to be a major character very early on. One of my least favorite things about anime is the refusal to kill off main characters (and even if they do it's in the last few episodes or something), and it also came unexpected. The main romance isn't annoying either (though it does progress a little too fast). Also, the way Birdy and Senkawa meet in the first episode, while is rather coincidental, doesn't really seem that way due to good writing or direction or something like that.The characters are a good part of this show. Senkawa... I can't tell if he's supposed to be a dull harem protagonist or not. If so, then he is the best one. He has a good personality and reacts realistically to his situation. Birdy herself is charming and manages to get several good lines with Senkawa. The side-characters are also good. Senkawa's classmates are also fleshed out for useless classmates who serve no purpose expect to show us Senkawa's normal life before all of the events of the series happened.The voice acting is very very good, and all the characters' lines sound real and not like they're just said by some person reading a script. The music is decent enough, the opening being very catchy and the ending being good enough, but with lazy visuals. The animation is also very nice. The character designs are usually good, but every once in a while they draw the noise weird, like a scribble on the face that just looks out of place. The fight scenes are rather neat though.However, the thing is, they are still a few holes that need to be explained, mainly on what exactly is the Ryunka? How was it made? Fortunately there is a second season. Now, I haven't seen it yet, but there's a good chance it will explain a few of these plot holes. Could be this season was just build-up or something. You never truly know.So, I can recommend Birdy to all anime fans out there. While it shouldn't be too high on your priority list, it is still definitely worth a watch in there somewhere. And you'll learn how to ignore Birdy;'s outfit quickly, though you'll think an agent who does a lot of fighting would have much more armor. up for it, Birdy puts Senkawa's conscious in her body until it is fixed.

It has an interesting concept but, it failed my expectations.The series was good and all but the only factor I didn't like about it was the fact that it was about a high school boy who falls in love with a sickly girl who is possessed with a virus called, the Ryuka, but keeps denying it until the very end of the show.However, the factor that I like about the show was that it was about a space cop whom was on a mission but accidentally kills the said boy and now the both have to share a body....Dividing their time between saving the galaxy and whatever high school boys do.The relationship between the main female character, Birdy, and the main male character was very sweet sister-brother relationship.

The OVA only has 4 episodes so I hoped for a bit more of the same, even though this seemed like a reboot rather than a continuation. Sadly, this series just doesn\'t cut it and I\'m pretty disappointed in it. So what makes this a worse watch than the OVA? Well...- Story & ThemeThe main story has altered, but overall it\'s the same theme and setting. That\'s not really a problem, the new story isn\'t worse or better than the original, and though the story isn\'t the...best I\'ve seen it\'s not too bad either. The body switching problems gets a bit more screentime since there is more time here to address it, but it\'s still not the main focus of the story and that\'s fine.- Characters & WritingWow, they really dropped the ball on this one. The characters and the writing for them was great in the OVA, but here we\'re reduced to seeing the usual tropes and blandness we\'ve seen a hundred times before. The dialogue and behaviour is predictable and cookie cutter and there are no real characters anymore, just vessels for the story. The antagonists parents were a great part of the OVA, but here they go away first thing that happens and while his sister stays behind she doesn\'t add anything or have a persona beyond ""assertive sister"". The same can be said for the others; character interaction or development simply isn\'t a thing in this, only archetypes and tropes. The biggest letdown compared to the OVA for sure.- Graphics & StyleThis too feels like a step back compared to the OVA. The animation is only really fluid when it comes to a few 3D animated scenes, but movements and other animations are choppy and dull. The style is also bland and lacks personality and even the cinematography is boring. It\'s the bare minimum paint-by-numbers style one can expect from something that isn\'t obviously bad, but it never really rises above that.- Music & SoundNot too bad over all, but the opening and ending themes sound as if they\'re the same music that\'s in every other anime from this time. Again, bland and forgettable.- ConclusionThe whole series seems low effort and if you enjoyed the OVA you will probably not enjoy this. I can see people liking it, but it\'s really not my cup of tea. It\'s bland, easily digestible and done more to a formula than it is a labor of love and art. I\'d have loved to see a reboot or continuation in the same style as the OVA, but I can\'t really recommend this as anything but something to watch in the background while you do other things.

I saw it for the first time in 2012 and never finished looking, I can\'t answer exactly why.Now that I have given him a new chance, I can say that he is somewhat individual and dull. The typical sci-fi concept of good alien vs evil alien.Somehow I had a ""lilo and stitch"" vibe all the time while watching it.The basic idea of \u200b\u200bthe divided body is interesting and you could discover somewhat creative processes and approaches, but otherwise, there is nothing more.The plot is enormously transparent and flat until the end, one only...hopes that the implementation of the events will surprise since the content does not do it anyway.The pacing makes it difficult for me to judge whether it is good or bad. They had the attraction of constantly adding little flashbacks to the scenes, especially episode 4 (the terrorist attack) had enormously deterrent pacing which fluctuated too much. However, the creativity in the process could compensate for this.The greatest strength of the anime is without a doubt the two main characters, who have an interesting connection to each other and have a notable personalities. One cannot speak of ""profundity"" here, the word is out of place here. They are simply dull normal, but personable.Towards the end, the protagonist became more of a hypocrite, but that is still a very realistic process, so understandable.Another good aspect of this is the antagonists if I can call them that. There seem to be several groups with different roles, so it\'s hard to say who belongs to which side.The animations are fluid, at least as far as the fighting is concerned. Little can be expected of the details here, as the dynamics take over completely. Towards episode 11+ the animations slipped down, they tried to distort the whole scene so much that it looked action-packed and dynamic, which made it just ghastly. No aesthetics at all.And then there was the music ... on the one hand, the intro was quite individual and the outro was probably one of my favorite outros. On the other hand, the Osts have been used so badly, I thought I was watching a cheap action film from the 80s. The main thing is to play loud music in the background, regardless of whether it fits the topic (especially episodes 12-13), as long as things explode and the music roars, it looks like a final fight. Wrong, this cost me a couple of lives.ConclusionA sci-fi title that is well worth seeing and despite its low standards it has average entertainment value. I would never watch this anime again, but it can be entertaining for in between.Enjoyment - 6 hopes that the implementation of the events will surprise since the content does not do it anyway.The pacing makes it difficult for me to judge whether it is good or bad.

Shinryaku! Ika Musume,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8557/Shinryaku_Ika_Musume,"['The problem with the anime industry is the continuous failure to capitalise on titles that are actually good, and instead redirect time and resources to producing shows that leave you as empty as a tectonic bowel movement. Every genre has suffered this iniquity, but while most bounce back with other, much better offerings (comparatively speaking), comedy continues to prove the medium\'s ""Achilles heel"". Those of you who are fans of Gintama may disagree with that perception, but consider for a moment the number of anime released during the last year that have borne the ""comedy"" label.Now have a think about whether they made you laugh,...or simply made you smile (or in the worst case scenario, made you want to punch the people who made it in alphabetical order).Based on the manga by Anbe Masahiro, Shinryaku! Ika Musume (Invasion! Squid Girl), tells the story of Ika Musume, who has come from the sea to exact revenge on humanity for polluting the waters of Earth, and she plans to do this by conquering the world.Unfortunately her first foray onto land doesn\'t go as planned ...The series is presented in the style of a sketch show rather than as a continuous narrative, with each episode split into three independent stories. Normally this approach would present several problems where plot and character development are concerned, but thankfully that isn\'t the case here as each tale is well crafted and paced, with little time wasted on pointless trivialities (which is ironic as there are people who would consider the whole show to be trivial). In addition to this, there is an autonomy to each chapter that allows for a variety of themes over the course of one episode, and this makes for some decent storytelling and visual gags.As an aside, one thing that should be pointed out is the rather obvious homage to the first ten minutes or so of Up! that occurs in episode five. The nice thing about this particular chapter is that there has been a conscious effort to follow Pixar\'s example and simply use music, sound effects and imagery to tell the story, and the result is something ... rare, especially in terms of audio/visual choreography.Which brings up an interesting point.On the surface Shinryaku! Ika Musume looks a lot like the common or garden moe based ""comedies"" that abound these days, but as everyone knows, one should never judge a book by it\'s cover. The design principle verges on the generic at times, and this rather simplistic approach to the characters is reflected in the backgrounds and settings as well. The animation is generally decent, with nice movements and some interesting ways to use tentacles (I never thought I would ever use that sentence in an anime review), but the initial perception may be that Diomedea simply didn\'t try hard enough to make the series look great.There is something that should be taken in to account though, and that\'s the fact that Ika Musume wasn\'t only made to make you smile. The main purpose of the series is to make you laugh, and that it does. The ""generic"" look of the show allows for a number of well executed visual gags and parodies, as well as some creative moments like the Mini Ika Musume chapter. In addition to that, the style of humour actually works better when the viewer is comfortable with the imagery, which may be the reason why Diomedea opted for a look that many people will already be familiar with.After all, it\'s reasonable to assume that the majority of viewers would find the slapstick comedy aspect out of place in a series series featured stunning scenery and beautiful characters, no matter how funny the show was.One thing that is slightly annoying about Ika Musume is the devilishly catchy opening theme (Let\'s Invade by ULTRA PRISM featuring Kanemoto Hisako), which may have been designed to loiter in the viewers head, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. That doesn\'t mean it\'s a great song though, as it\'s a very typical example of the ""cute"" J-Pop anime introduction - with everything that entails.On the other hand the ending theme, Metamerism by Ito Kanae, is a melodic ballad that\'s rather pleasant on the ears (even if it is a tad generic), but seems a little out of place in a comedy show. As for the incidental pieces, they range from slightly ditzy jazz styled jingles to the slow piano piece of the Mini Ika Musume chapter. Unlike many other shows though, the music is only pushed to the fore when the occasion demands, and one will generally hear it as a very subtle accompaniment to the on screen action (it should be pointed out though, that a good portion of the series features no music whatsoever).As with any comedy, delivery is everything, and it\'s here where the seiyuu really shine. While the voice acting may sometimes be a little on the bland side, the characters really come alive when there\'s something quirky or funny going on. Kanemoto Hisako\'s performance as the precocious invader from the sea is actually pretty good, especially as her only other main roles are in Sora no Woto and Kore wa Zombie Desu ka. Her coordination with the other voice actors, especially Fujimura Ayumi and Tanaka Rie (the Aizawa sisters, Eiko and Chizuru), allows for some nice comedy set pieces.Which brings up another point.By its very nature, comedy isn\'t the greatest tool for characterisation or development, especially as the usual methods can seem out of place amongst all the slapstick. Ika Musume neatly sidesteps the issue by inserting a few choice tales that highlight a particular bond or personality trait, but it does this by creating a metaphor which can sometimes change the whole tone of the series. That said, any growth is sporadic, and there are occasions where viewers may find themselves wondering what the point of a particular chapter was.There is a plus though, as the series creates comedy pairings between disparate, and sometimes unlikely, characters, which adds to the whimsical nature of the show. Eiko and Ika-Musume represent the primary straight and funny ""men"", but in truth there are multiple parings, trios and groups that form over the course of the series, all of which is only achievable because the characterisation is actually pretty decent for a comedy anime.Now I will be honest here, as I didn\'t expect to like this series as much as I did. That\'s not to say it\'s a classic, as there are definitely better purebred comedies out there, but when compared to many of the more recent offerings in that genre, the charm, quirkiness and feelgood atmosphere of Shinryaku! Ika Musume is definitely a step in the right direction. The series bears a few similarities in terms of style, content and layout to such comedy worthies as Potemayo and Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu (but without as much insanity), whilst Mini Ika-Musume didn\'t simply remind me of Pixar\'s Up!, but also of Binchou-tan.There is something to bear in mind if you decide to give this show a try though. Comedy is probably the most subjective genre in any medium as it requires far more investment from the viewer in order for it to work, and one of the things that we in the West often forget is that the vast majority of anime are made for the Japanese markets. Because of that it becomes difficult for Westerners to relate to certain aspects of the humour, but that doesn\'t automatically mean a series is bad just because we don\'t understand it.Besides, after some of the debacles that have been produced over the last few years by an industry that\'s trying a bit too hard, it\'s a welcome change to watch something a little bit silly. or simply made you smile (or in the worst case scenario, made you want to punch the people who made it in alphabetical order).Based on the manga by Anbe Masahiro, Shinryaku!

The animation is generally decent, with nice movements and some interesting ways to use tentacles (I never thought I would ever use that sentence in an anime review), but the initial perception may be that Diomedea simply didn\'t try hard enough to make the series look great.There is something that should be taken in to account though, and that\'s the fact that Ika Musume wasn\'t only made to make you smile. The main purpose of the series is to make you laugh, and that it does. The ""generic"" look of the show allows for a number of well executed visual gags and parodies, as well as some creative moments like the Mini Ika Musume chapter. In addition to that, the style of humour actually works better when the viewer is comfortable with the imagery, which may be the reason why Diomedea opted for a look that many people will already be familiar with.After all, it\'s reasonable to assume that the majority of viewers would find the slapstick comedy aspect out of place in a series series featured stunning scenery and beautiful characters, no matter how funny the show was.One thing that is slightly annoying about Ika Musume is the devilishly catchy opening theme (Let\'s Invade by ULTRA PRISM featuring Kanemoto Hisako), which may have been designed to loiter in the viewers head, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. That doesn\'t mean it\'s a great song though, as it\'s a very typical example of the ""cute"" J-Pop anime introduction - with everything that entails.On the other hand the ending theme, Metamerism by Ito Kanae, is a melodic ballad that\'s rather pleasant on the ears (even if it is a tad generic), but seems a little out of place in a comedy show. As for the incidental pieces, they range from slightly ditzy jazz styled jingles to the slow piano piece of the Mini Ika Musume chapter. Unlike many other shows though, the music is only pushed to the fore when the occasion demands, and one will generally hear it as a very subtle accompaniment to the on screen action (it should be pointed out though, that a good portion of the series features no music whatsoever).As with any comedy, delivery is everything, and it\'s here where the seiyuu really shine. While the voice acting may sometimes be a little on the bland side, the characters really come alive when there\'s something quirky or funny going on. Kanemoto Hisako\'s performance as the precocious invader from the sea is actually pretty good, especially as her only other main roles are in Sora no Woto and Kore wa Zombie Desu ka. Her coordination with the other voice actors, especially Fujimura Ayumi and Tanaka Rie (the Aizawa sisters, Eiko and Chizuru), allows for some nice comedy set pieces.Which brings up another point.By its very nature, comedy isn\'t the greatest tool for characterisation or development, especially as the usual methods can seem out of place amongst all the slapstick. Ika Musume neatly sidesteps the issue by inserting a few choice tales that highlight a particular bond or personality trait, but it does this by creating a metaphor which can sometimes change the whole tone of the series. That said, any growth is sporadic, and there are occasions where viewers may find themselves wondering what the point of a particular chapter was.There is a plus though, as the series creates comedy pairings between disparate, and sometimes unlikely, characters, which adds to the whimsical nature of the show. Eiko and Ika-Musume represent the primary straight and funny ""men"", but in truth there are multiple parings, trios and groups that form over the course of the series, all of which is only achievable because the characterisation is actually pretty decent for a comedy anime.Now I will be honest here, as I didn\'t expect to like this series as much as I did. That\'s not to say it\'s a classic, as there are definitely better purebred comedies out there, but when compared to many of the more recent offerings in that genre, the charm, quirkiness and feelgood atmosphere of Shinryaku! Ika Musume is definitely a step in the right direction. The series bears a few similarities in terms of style, content and layout to such comedy worthies as Potemayo and Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu (but without as much insanity), whilst Mini Ika-Musume didn\'t simply remind me of Pixar\'s Up!, but also of Binchou-tan.There is something to bear in mind if you decide to give this show a try though. Comedy is probably the most subjective genre in any medium as it requires far more investment from the viewer in order for it to work, and one of the things that we in the West often forget is that the vast majority of anime are made for the Japanese markets. Because of that it becomes difficult for Westerners to relate to certain aspects of the humour, but that doesn\'t automatically mean a series is bad just because we don\'t understand it.Besides, after some of the debacles that have been produced over the last few years by an industry that\'s trying a bit too hard, it\'s a welcome change to watch something a little bit silly.', 'I would never imagine, in my lifetime, to see a squid this adorable!Im telling ya, after years experiencing Squidward from SpongeBob Squarepants, I started to give up hope for all squids in the world...That is until I met little Ika-Chan...So what\'s so special about another failure invader anime? Don\'t we already have a frog for that?How can you say that! Squid>Frog anytime!Anyways, the story isn\'t very deep and there\'s no much of a plot buildup however the comedy and cuteness is enjoyable nevertheless. You\'ll have a drama episode, a horror episode (Oh damn that doll was scaaaaary) and also a tearjerker moment (I...love you Chibi Ika!)The artwork was exceptional. It was able to portray the scenery of a beach perfectly to go along with little Ika\'s antics. The characters are well drawn especially in the expressions department.Sound? Who doesn\'t like the sound of the beach! Great choice of background music to enhance the surrounding. I especially liked the squeeky sound you get when the tentacle rubbed against each other. (Reminds me of rubbing two pickles with each other)Ika\'s character is developed nicely (Even though it\'s mostly appealing to lolicons). However she\'s still a kid at heart. But thats just the way we all like it. Coupled along with a ""geso"" at the end of every sentence, and WHAM! Try to resist that awesome cuteness! Other characters support her well (both her and her mischiefs)This anime definitely has a considerable amount of re-watch value. The comedy doesn\'t get old easily. And I guess people would of course want to see my Chibi Ika! (But not those puppets.. That thing gave me nightmares!)Overall, it\'s a must watch for all you who adores cute and lovable things! If you dont? Then the comedy would still entertain you nicely. Personally, my favorite part about this anime is Ika\'s assimilation into the human world. It\'s nice when an invader understand how not all humans like us are bad. What? You think you\'re good too? Heck no...

Not because of the actual premise, although it does add a little to it, but on the way it’s structured. It reminded me of my childhood shows with three separate story arcs that had a basic theme. With an anime plot involving a cute squid girl trying to invade the entire planet by herself only to be undermined by many people who own a food court near a beach, you’d think that would speak of random hijinks that will only appeal to prepubescent girls. Fortunately, there can be some merits here...that could appeal to any age group.Squid Girl has a plot that is hardly focused or has any substance to the original goal that the squid character, Ike, intended to do. It mainly involves her trying to learn about humanity and the culture of Japan that she is settling in. It’s essentially a show based on culture shock and how foreigners try to adapt to a different country that they have no idea about. The tone of the series is light-hearted and comedic; they handle it pretty well without hampering the basic premise conflicting with the comedy. It’s pretty entertaining to watch and, at times, funny to see Ike acting very holier than thou upon the people she meets when she has no power over the others whatsoever.With a show like Squid Girl, you need to supply great characters that are both funny and memorable to watch. While some garner a lot of entertainment, others are not fully realized and don’t add much depth to the comedy. The best ones that I liked the most were Ike, Eiko, and Chizuru. They all have so much great chemistry together and make many great gags work perfectly. Chizuru provides some of the best scenes involving her having a friendly personality. Still, once something terrible happens to her or the workplace, she turns menacing to the person doing the trouble-making. Ike herself, voiced by the always charming Hisako Kanemoto, gives the show a great sense of passion towards making this Slice of life atmosphere into an entertaining comedy with her constant alluring presence in every scene.Unfortunately, not all of the cast hits the level of greatness and our three main characters. Sanae, Takeru, and Goro all don’t have the same great chemistry with Ike as she does with Eiko and Chizuru. That’s not to say they’re terrible, they do have some funny moments, but it’s essentially just them acting very googly-eyed over Ike’s presence in the world that quickly doesn’t have much to go for in the grand scheme of things. For example, Sanae’s only gag for existing in the show is to be all lovey-dovey over Ike and nothing else. Sure it does get a few laughs, but after a while, the joke falls flat and gets old quickly. If it weren’t for Kanae Itou’s sweet voice playing Sanae, I would probably think lesser of Sanae, to be honest.Another problem with the show was how each plot arc ended so abruptly. There are times when a plot arc would end, and it didn’t feel like that particular scene felt any closure for it. It ends relatively quickly, and we’re brought up in a different scene. The problem is that they interlude between a different arc by showing a cut of arrows that are supposed to tell us that we’re doing a different arc. Still, it happens so fast that you barely notice it because the arc beforehand hardly had an ending. In turn, some of the arcs felt rushed or weren’t finished in the writing process during production.In short, I thought there wasn’t anything special to be found in Squid Girl. It might be something that you might show to your younger daughter to have some fun with, but on the other hand, there is some decent humor for adults. It might be a stretch to say that this is Japan’s answer to Spongebob. The only difference is that Spongebob had a lot of great memorable characters while Squid Girl only had three that are even worth discussing over. It’s a harmless show for what it is, a decently entertaining show for older kids. Even with some of the adult innuendo thrown in, that’s at least that's something that most kids' shows are hardly about these days.Grade: B- that could appeal to any age group.Squid Girl has a plot that is hardly focused or has any substance to the original goal that the squid character, Ike, intended to do.

Ika Musume is quite a refreshing retake of the slice-of-life comedy scene.  It was really nice to finally get one that didn\'t cop out and take the way-too-overused (high) school setting.

Right now.  Hell, if it weren\'t for a few instances of light profanity (""damn""), the show probably could garner a G rating.  (I don\'t see what the point of even including any profanity at all was.)When writers decide to incorporate moe into their works, they always have to be careful to observe the line between moe and moeblob--that is, if you overdo the moe, they lack any other definable traits--physically or character-wise.  They become defined strictly as MOE.  (Oh gawd K-On!)  Well, I\'m pleased to report that Ika Musume does not cross that line (although there are a few precarious instances when that line is flirted with far too intimately).Ika is moe, yes, but moe mostly in terms of her personality.  She is laughably curious about everyday things we don\'t think much of, like umbrellas, birthdays, and fireworks.  She\'s afraid of inflatable killer whales and sharks, but thinks nothing of walking through cemetaries at night, nor is she even scared of ghosts.  She came to ""invade"" the surface world, but her good nature keeps getting the better of her and pushing her goal farther away.  She acts menacing, but it\'s obviously a bluff, as she obviously cares about the well-being of those around her.  She even has a couple funny speech naunces to top it all off.The show really IS all about Ika.  She is, by far, the character with the most colorful personality, range of emotion, and variety of facial expression.  The supporting cast isn\'t bad, though; some of them actually have some depth and undergo development, but equally as many are just flat in terms of personality.  (This isn\'t to say they don\'t add anything or aren\'t entertaining, though; quite the contrary.)Animation and art are quite crisp, clean, and clear: the show is quite pleasing to look at.  Bright and vibrant colors make up the vast majority of the spectrum utilized, and scenes are mostly sunny and light-hearted.  Animation is pretty well-done as well, with no real problems or corner-cutting I could see.  Facial expressions--particularly those of Ika--are great.  All in all, quite effective and above average.The OP is alright, sung by Hisako Kanemoto (Ika\'s seiyuu) although it begins by chanting ""Shinryaku!"" over and over again, in the most annoying pitch possible, at a volume twice as loud as the rest of the show.

And it starts as soon as the episode begins, so you\'ll have to be really fast to avoid getting your ears blasted.  The ED is actually a pretty touching piece that I would call Ika\'s theme song, since the lyrics fit her so well.  The voice acting is pretty great, but Kanemoto definitely steals the show: she acts the squidding INK out of her role. ;)Shinryaku! Ika Musume is quite the enjoyable break from the hum drum stereotypical school comedy scene.  It deserves a chance just for daring to be different and breaking from the mold.

Ika Musume is quite the enjoyable break from the hum drum stereotypical school comedy scene.  It deserves a chance just for daring to be different and breaking from the mold.  It even incorporates some pretty emotionally touching moments in there as well.Now, I\'m off to conquer the rest of this thing you humans call MAL de geso!', 'I was eating instant ramen while watching the first episode... I never thought I\'d start a review with that sentence, but it leads to a point. I almost threw up when Ika Musume did you-know-what to the pasta, but then I was choking from laughter by the time the episode ended. The entire series left me a similar impression, from disgust and rejection to appreciation and attachment.\'Shinryaku! Ika Musume (Invasion! Squid Girl)\' is an anime series that appears to be flawed in almost every way imaginable, but somehow... somehow, I found this series to be extremely enjoyable and memorable. Ika Musume has invaded my mind.Case...1: Premise.Incompetent invader from another world appears, and gets her butt kicked in the very first encounter with human beings. After that, the ""invader"" joins the family, but still plans for world invasion while easily getting distracted by all the unfamiliar things on Earth. It\'s baffling how similar the premise of this series is to \'Keroro Gunsou\'. In fact, if they toned down Sanae and violence by a bit, it would totally pass for a children\'s show. While nothing can excuse the show\'s lack of originality and the fact that nothing makes sense with the premise, \'Ika Musume\' has a lot going for it that makes it different from an average show.Case 2: Lack of Direction.One would expect a simple friendship comedy from such a premise. Ika Musume bonds with family members and others in town, then gets inspired by their kindness, right? While that\'s one of the themes of \'Ika Musume\', there are also a lot of other things going on. A lot of actual battle scenes with Ika Musume\'s tentacles, a lot of slapstick comedy, a lot of depth in some episodes (Mankind\'s triumph over nature? Bonding with the mini-Ika Musume? The umbrella episode?), a lot of romance, and slice of life? Loli moe-blob? Other than comedy, it\'s hard to say what this series is, as it\'s packed with themes despite the triple episodic chapter format. Ironically, the lack of direction (central theme) in the story was offset by the direction (presentation by the director). It didn\'t exactly feel like this series went all over the place and got nowhere, it felt like I got to see many sides of Ika Musume\'s story.Case 3: CharactersAt first, Ika Musume seems like nothing more than a moe-blob dewa naika? A deliberate attempt for cuteness de geso. The squid hat, the dress, and over-sized eyes seem like obvious moe ploys de geso. However, her appearance is actually a part of the story ja naika? Her character really grows on you dewa naika? Other characters were also stereotypical cardboard cutouts de geso. Especially the way they random appear in different episode limits their character development ja naika? Still, they somehow manage to leave an impression, and their personalities are very distinct ja naika? What all characters possessed, was inherent charm that makes you care about them de geso. Despite how incompetent she is at invasion, you would find yourself rooting for her dewa naika?Case 4: BuildupYes, every one of Ika Musume\'s sentence ends with ""jana/dewana-Ika(Squid)?"", homophone of ""Isn\'t it? / Don\'t you think?"", or ""de-geso(tentacle)"", a cuter(?) version of ""desu"". It was kind of cute at first, but gets annoying very quickly... and this persists for almost the entire duration of the show. However, she stops just when you\'re totally sick of it, and just like the supporting cast in this show, I felt like it\'s not her without her quirky speech. I actually missed it. That chapter would\'ve never worked unless you\'re certain the audience would be emotionally attached by then, and I was attached despite finding her speech to be very annoying. The director has done an excellent job in building up for moments like this, also mixing in a couple of slow and emotional chapters with fast-paced slapstick chapters.Case 5: RetroThe physical and pun-heavy comedy in this series is really old fashioned, but I found myself laughing through the stupid and predictable jokes nonetheless.The character design other than Ika Musume, and the atmosphere also had a really retro anime feel to it. The way Ika Musume, the Invader From the Bottom of the Sea, and the action/scary scenes stood out from the rest of the show was really wonderful. This is my first series with Diomedea as main animation studio, and I have to say I\'m really impressed. Color specification and consistency of drawings were particularly stunning.Case 6: OPThe OP \'Shinryaku no Susume (Advance the Invasion)\' is SUCH a bad otagei song with strained anime voice, but the way it starts and the beat is just so addictive. I found myself skipping it after the second episode, but drawn back and listening to the whole thing by second half of the season. ED was a poignant song that makes you reflect back on the story, and had a nice simple touch with an object variation added to each episode.BGM was rather ordinary , and didn\'t play a big part in the show.Ika Musume\'s voice by Kanemoto Hisako was absolutely perfect, which made her character all the more adorable. Everyone else also sounded like they should.I was very skeptical about this series, but I\'ve been captured by the tentacles of Ika Musume.Dream and magic is what traditional anime is supposed to be all about, and this series takes it back to the roots. I can\'t guarantee you would like it, but \'Shinryaku! Ikamusume\' is definitely worth a shot if you haven\'t seen it already. 1: Premise.Incompetent invader from another world appears, and gets her butt kicked in the very first encounter with human beings. After that, the ""invader"" joins the family, but still plans for world invasion while easily getting distracted by all the unfamiliar things on Earth. It\'s baffling how similar the premise of this series is to \'Keroro Gunsou\'. In fact, if they toned down Sanae and violence by a bit, it would totally pass for a children\'s show. While nothing can excuse the show\'s lack of originality and the fact that nothing makes sense with the premise, \'Ika Musume\' has a lot going for it that makes it different from an average show.Case 2: Lack of Direction.One would expect a simple friendship comedy from such a premise. Ika Musume bonds with family members and others in town, then gets inspired by their kindness, right? While that\'s one of the themes of \'Ika Musume\', there are also a lot of other things going on. A lot of actual battle scenes with Ika Musume\'s tentacles, a lot of slapstick comedy, a lot of depth in some episodes (Mankind\'s triumph over nature? Bonding with the mini-Ika Musume? The umbrella episode?), a lot of romance, and slice of life? Loli moe-blob? Other than comedy, it\'s hard to say what this series is, as it\'s packed with themes despite the triple episodic chapter format. Ironically, the lack of direction (central theme) in the story was offset by the direction (presentation by the director). It didn\'t exactly feel like this series went all over the place and got nowhere, it felt like I got to see many sides of Ika Musume\'s story.Case 3: CharactersAt first, Ika Musume seems like nothing more than a moe-blob dewa naika? A deliberate attempt for cuteness de geso. The squid hat, the dress, and over-sized eyes seem like obvious moe ploys de geso. However, her appearance is actually a part of the story ja naika? Her character really grows on you dewa naika? Other characters were also stereotypical cardboard cutouts de geso. Especially the way they random appear in different episode limits their character development ja naika? Still, they somehow manage to leave an impression, and their personalities are very distinct ja naika? What all characters possessed, was inherent charm that makes you care about them de geso. Despite how incompetent she is at invasion, you would find yourself rooting for her dewa naika?Case 4: BuildupYes, every one of Ika Musume\'s sentence ends with ""jana/dewana-Ika(Squid)?"", homophone of ""Isn\'t it? / Don\'t you think?"", or ""de-geso(tentacle)"", a cuter(?) version of ""desu"".

It gives a nice setting for a comedy like this, but there's still not much to it. To be fair though, you wouldn't expect much from the story anyway, so you probably wouldn't be disappointed at all.The comedy however, is simple and funny. It doesn't need much cultural reference to understand, and its jokes aren't forced or awkward. It has a comedic style similar to Azumanga Daioh, and maybe also like a crazier version of Yotsuba, which also applies to the art style.The characters...all follow a common archetype, but it doesn't make the show feel cliche and boring. Though Ika Musume is the center of the comedy, each character has their own comedic traits, and are all combined in a very balanced manner.All in all this makes a great comedy, and a very enjoyable slice of life. But, if you're looking for something with a great story, tear dropping drama, or maybe some gorgeous art, this is definitely not something you should watch.I take that back, after watching episode 5, I must say, there is actually some tear dropping scenes.  And some very heart warming moments. all follow a common archetype, but it doesn't make the show feel cliche and boring.

And some very heart warming moments."", 'Ok, so just 2 more episodes and this anime is already nearing its end, so what can I say about this anime? Well, let\'s put it this way according to how I rate this anime:STORY:Originally, the plot of this story is about nature fighting back against humans who pollute the seas with garbage and with the help of squid girl Ika Masume and her so called invasion force of half human and half squid, which,by the way she seems to had forgotten bring it along with her at the start of the anime- talking about letting a girl do a grown-up\'s job. But,only to get...sidetracked by working in a seaside eatery, fumbling around as she learns with the everyday life on the surface and having a  relationship (including harassment from 2 lesbians Cindy and Sanae)  with the surface dwellers, though, the comic side of it is cliche, I thinks that it still deserve a fair score of 6.ART:I have nothing to say about the art of the anime,but the artist\'s impression on how the characters and the background were drawn would literally give one an impression as to what the anime is without telling the audience about its synopsis. Then again, there were some awkward parts of the character\'s appearance e.g. the sharp ends that were sticking out on the left side of Eiko and Chizuru\'s hair,the design of Ika\'s tentacles and the baseball team were Ika participated. But in fairness one can simply just forgive it, so, a fair number 6 it is.SOUND:No comment for the sound, and I like the opening theme of the anime, so it deserves the number 6th spot for its rating.CHARACTER:I don\'t have much comment for most of the cast, but for Gorou to be called ""Life Saver,"" kinda make the term an awkward definition of his occupation, I don\'t know for sure if it is the fault of the author or is it the translation, but the proper noun for the said character\'s role is ""Life- Guard."" Also,I\'m no marine biologist, but,if Ika Masume is a squid girl then she belongs to the species of cephalopod and should only have 8 tentacle instead of 10, she should also swim using jet propulsion instead of using her tentacle and she should also have    chromatophores  that enables her to either hide,glow or communicate with other squids in the water and depending on the species of Cephalopod an ordinary squid can live only about 10 years in captivity . I guess both the author and artist don\'t know anything about squids except when eating it as sushi. Then again,who cares? As long as the character entertains,then it is decent enough to rate it as number 4.OVERALL AND ENJOYMENT:Decent enough to be viewed by all ages, so number 4 it is.Trivia: Humboldt Squids can grow as much as 30 feet.It is  estimated that there are at least 1000 tons of non biodegradable garbage floating around the world\'s oceans.Japan is a known consumer of Whale meat , according to Greenpeace data. sidetracked by working in a seaside eatery, fumbling around as she learns with the everyday life on the surface and having a  relationship (including harassment from 2 lesbians Cindy and Sanae)  with the surface dwellers, though, the comic side of it is cliche, I thinks that it still deserve a fair score of 6.ART:I have nothing to say about the art of the anime,but the artist\'s impression on how the characters and the background were drawn would literally give one an impression as to what the anime is without telling the audience about its synopsis.

Its intriguing title led me to watch over the weekend and I feel glad that I watched it.Story 3/10Story in itself is not very great at all. It is one of those short animes but it does not do much with its story though thats mainly the fact that it is for the most part a comedic anime. The line, ""I am Squid Girl, emissary of the sea,"" would make you think what else could Squid Girl do with herself besides spit ink and use her tentacles.Art 8/10Its a pretty...generic art style but yet its not overdone. Some of its realistic art skits are really amazing and it made me laugh a lot. Its as simple as that.Sound 9/10The music is really good. The opening is very loud and takes a little to adjust too but it really grew upon towards the end of the anime. The credits are very soothing at the very end of each episode. Overall  I would say the sound in general describes this anime very well. Its not too overpowering but at the same time its very relaxing in general.Character 8/10I find many of the supporting characters in this to be rather ""prop-like"" in the sense they are generally used as comedic relief. However many of the main characters such as Eiko and Chizuru show that average ""grown upon attitude over annoying main character"" as the anime progresses on. However I don\'t find this very bad at all, in fact it actually kept very hidden which in turn makes it really interesting. As for our main character Squid Girl [aka Ika] she has the style of an annoying but also comedic main character role within the anime. Though I really like her as a whole and she reallly grew upon mea s the show went on. She was always there to make you laugh with her llack on human knowledge which makes her quite unique.Overall 7/10I really enjoyed this anime but the lack of story made me feel like there was something missing from it. Though thats not to say its a bad anime. If you enjoy many small comedic skits and very semi-realistic events yu will love this anime. There are not many spots it will make burst out in pure laughter but yet you will never be in a bad mood when watching this anime.

The ending is a slow song compared to the opening and is decent as it a nice comparison. Voice acting is ok, they do there job in making each character adorable especially Ika whose ~de gezo is addictive.Art is simple, the character designs are really simple and not a lot of detail goes into them, there actions however are well drawn and animated and some unatural parts can be forgiven like the sisters hair. Backgrounds are simple as well but they don't require super high detail, one thing i didn't like and never like in any show is lack of movement in those backgrounds, some wide shots including people on the beach are completely static.Characters the most important part of this show as i makes up for the simple art and sound. Ika Musume or protagonist is the messenger from see who want to take revenge for the pollution of her home, the ocean, things don't quite go as planned as she is soon forced into working off her debt, the comedy of her imagination and her love of shrimp are the driving force for this show. Eiko is the one that forces Ika into working at her beachhouse and does not hold back when Ika screws up. Chizuru is Eikos sister and on the surface is the most caring of the two and really cares for Ika but deeper inside lies a more darker Chizuru and is one of the things that Ika is terrified of and she seems to always come to the rescue in various events. All side characters are great though are used to repeat jokes, we have a lifesaver who has a crush on chizuru, a girl who is stalkeresque towards Ika, a group of MIT graduates that believe Ika is an alien and wish to study her but get on your nerves no end. The sisters little brother and Nagisa a girl terrified of Ika make up the cast.Shinryaku!

The is that a girl called Ika Musume, which I think is japanese for Squid Girl, comes to the surface to invade the human race for polluting the ocean.

She subsequently gets side-tracked and ends up working at a beachside restaurant stall. The story, while creative, is essentially just a framing device for the zany comedy. So the real important question is: does the comedy work?  The answer is an ardent yes. The situations Ika Musume ends up in are generally pretty mundane but her involvement adds a surrealistic element that works very well. The result is pure hilarity. One of the best aspects of the humour is that it never falls...into the realm of using random pop culture references as jokes, which so many inferior comedies do. The humour is also very natural. It always arises from the situation and feels very natural for the characters.The characters are really what makes the comedy work. They have just the right blend of major and minor characters to make any potential situation humorous. The major characters are also well developed. Which is surprising, since comedies have a tendency to use stock characters.The art is decent. the backgrounds tend to be really vibrant and detailed. When they draw normal sea creatures they do it very well. The only real art issue is that the characters all have similar faces.The voice work is decent. It doesn't really stand out, but it's suitable for the characters and emotions are expressed well. The music is really hyperactive and upbeat. It suits the series perfectly.The yuri factor is an 7/10. Sanae loves Ika. Ika has a thing for Nagisa and Ika and Eiko share some really homoerotic moments. The only issue I have with the yuri in this is that some of it, specifically those with Sanae, seems pretty exploitative. To put it simply, it seems like it's put in, not because it works for the characters, but because the writer finds it funny.My final rating for Shinryaku Ika Musume is an 8/10. It has a few issues, but it's hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. The humour isn't forced or based on random pop culture references.

For example, some people can like Love Hina for being some new turn of the Harem genre but most of them (including me) hated it for how annoying and juvenile it is. Others like Azumanga Daioh & K-On! For being innocently enough funny to entertain people for all ages without being too edgy and for others, they find it either too boring or moe for their taste. For me, comedy is...one of other favorite mediums of today, simply because I like to laugh at some good humor material and the keyword being GOOD.Squid Girl has come to the land from the depths of the sea to conquer humanity for its pollution of the ocean. Unfortunately she ruins the first house she uses as an invasion base and has to work to pay for repairs. Of course, she can't overcome the Aizawa sisters who manage the house, so who know whether she can subjugate humankind.The premise is the fish-out-of-water plot with a lot of comedic scope and while watching it, I enjoyed some of the antics that Squid Girl gets herself and a few others into. The show goes by showing 3 part episode, with the segments being 7-8 minutes, much like American cartoons in the past, present and future, so I can see a little inspiration from that and for those who love to use puns a lot, this show has plenty of squid puns to go around, even the episode’s title cards uses them.I really enjoyed the characters and their interactions with each other, especially the main character of Squid Girl, who really wants to be taken seriously as an invader but is not up to the task of that, considering she can’t even conquer a local eatery shop but for her character development, she plays it as being a cute mascot-like character without being overly annoying and grating and she never once toss aside her plans for world domination for no reason but it’s not like she’s going to invade any time soon with the Aikawa sisters, with Eiko as the strong-minded and no-nonsense sister who always need to keep Squid Girl in check and there’s Chizuru, who I think if Brock from Pokemon & Sakura Matou from Fate/Stay Night had a baby with the mindset of Ryoko Asakura from Haruhi Suzumiya and it’s her and she was even more of a bizarre character in the show than the title character and the sister’s little brother Takeru, who is more akin to Squid Girl as a playmate; Sanae, Eiko’s neighborhood friend who is very obsessed with Squid Girl, so much that is frightening and enters into Hentai territory; Nagisa, a surfer girl who is actually afraid of Squid Girl and she’s very paranoid about it. Plus, Squid can use her fear for her advantage but mostly it’s just to mess with her. There are other characters including the American scientist Cindy Campbell (not the one from Scary Movie), who and her three fellow scientists from MIT want to study Squid Girl to see if she’s an alien; Kiyomi Sakura, a minor character later on in the show whom Squid has become close friends to and Goro, the lifeguard who Squid riles up every now and then and also has a crush on Chizuru.The animation was done by Diomedea (or previously Studio Barcelona), whose only known project I have heard from them is…..Kodama No Jikan….okay, not the best title to be represented but this was some great animation, especially when it came to animating Squid’s tentacle movement. Also, since this is a gag-based anime show and for that, it was acceptable for doing that, maybe not on par with Azumanga Daioh & Sgt. Frog but it’s very good nevertheless. Now, I didn’t mind the music here that much but it was rather fitting and appropriate for the show, although if you ever sing this to somebody’s ears real loud, you are most likely to get punched.Now, I know there are two seasons of this show but I just been commenting strictly on Season 1 and their dub done by Bang Zoom Entertainment and was released by Media Blasters and I thought about the voices on that. Christine Marie Cabanos has been one anime VA rookie that I personally want to succeed in the business, (to me she’s a younger version of Stephanie Sheh), and her performance as Squid Girl fits the criteria of her cute and upbeat nature. I will say for Cristina Vee in her role as Nagisa is very similar to her role as Mio in K-On! (very paranoid and easily frightened) but then again, I don’t know if the K-On!! dub was produced before or after Squid Girl but it’s hit or miss and I really enjoy the dub.FINAL VERDICT: While not being something I would add to my top ten lists, this is a very fun and energetic show that never gets too boring or too hostile. I enjoyed all the characters, even the minor ones who can manage an impact into the series and the gags can be very funny although the squid puns did get too old too quick in my opinion. I do wish that Season 2 will get dubbed someday since Media Blasters no longer has the license to that one and possibly get Sentai Filmworks to license it and get the original cast back on that. one of other favorite mediums of today, simply because I like to laugh at some good humor material and the keyword being GOOD.Squid Girl has come to the land from the depths of the sea to conquer humanity for its pollution of the ocean. Unfortunately she ruins the first house she uses as an invasion base and has to work to pay for repairs. Of course, she can't overcome the Aizawa sisters who manage the house, so who know whether she can subjugate humankind.The premise is the fish-out-of-water plot with a lot of comedic scope and while watching it, I enjoyed some of the antics that Squid Girl gets herself and a few others into. The show goes by showing 3 part episode, with the segments being 7-8 minutes, much like American cartoons in the past, present and future, so I can see a little inspiration from that and for those who love to use puns a lot, this show has plenty of squid puns to go around, even the episode’s title cards uses them.I really enjoyed the characters and their interactions with each other, especially the main character of Squid Girl, who really wants to be taken seriously as an invader but is not up to the task of that, considering she can’t even conquer a local eatery shop but for her character development, she plays it as being a cute mascot-like character without being overly annoying and grating and she never once toss aside her plans for world domination for no reason but it’s not like she’s going to invade any time soon with the Aikawa sisters, with Eiko as the strong-minded and no-nonsense sister who always need to keep Squid Girl in check and there’s Chizuru, who I think if Brock from Pokemon & Sakura Matou from Fate/Stay Night had a baby with the mindset of Ryoko Asakura from Haruhi Suzumiya and it’s her and she was even more of a bizarre character in the show than the title character and the sister’s little brother Takeru, who is more akin to Squid Girl as a playmate; Sanae, Eiko’s neighborhood friend who is very obsessed with Squid Girl, so much that is frightening and enters into Hentai territory; Nagisa, a surfer girl who is actually afraid of Squid Girl and she’s very paranoid about it. Plus, Squid can use her fear for her advantage but mostly it’s just to mess with her. There are other characters including the American scientist Cindy Campbell (not the one from Scary Movie), who and her three fellow scientists from MIT want to study Squid Girl to see if she’s an alien; Kiyomi Sakura, a minor character later on in the show whom Squid has become close friends to and Goro, the lifeguard who Squid riles up every now and then and also has a crush on Chizuru.The animation was done by Diomedea (or previously Studio Barcelona), whose only known project I have heard from them is…..Kodama No Jikan….okay, not the best title to be represented but this was some great animation, especially when it came to animating Squid’s tentacle movement. Also, since this is a gag-based anime show and for that, it was acceptable for doing that, maybe not on par with Azumanga Daioh & Sgt. Frog but it’s very good nevertheless. Now, I didn’t mind the music here that much but it was rather fitting and appropriate for the show, although if you ever sing this to somebody’s ears real loud, you are most likely to get punched.Now, I know there are two seasons of this show but I just been commenting strictly on Season 1 and their dub done by Bang Zoom Entertainment and was released by Media Blasters and I thought about the voices on that. Christine Marie Cabanos has been one anime VA rookie that I personally want to succeed in the business, (to me she’s a younger version of Stephanie Sheh), and her performance as Squid Girl fits the criteria of her cute and upbeat nature. I will say for Cristina Vee in her role as Nagisa is very similar to her role as Mio in K-On! (very paranoid and easily frightened) but then again, I don’t know if the K-On!! dub was produced before or after Squid Girl but it’s hit or miss and I really enjoy the dub.FINAL VERDICT: While not being something I would add to my top ten lists, this is a very fun and energetic show that never gets too boring or too hostile.

From what I heard, the director who made ""Hare and Guu"" is in charge of this, so this already kind of gives it away that this is going to be a fun one.Much like Hare and Guu and other animes, it only goes up to certain quality of story and art, but what matters is the characters, and the anime does a good job giving a brief character description in the first episode and still be fun while elaborating it.So for those of people who want serious...action, drama or love, there won\'t be much here (or much from what I saw), and those of who wants light, relaxed and just enjoyable entertaining and valuing funnies more, then this will be good. action, drama or love, there won\'t be much here (or much from what I saw), and those of who wants light, relaxed and just enjoyable entertaining and valuing funnies more, then this will be good.', 'DISCLAIMER: This is more a review of both seasons, but it works just fine as a review of s1. There won’t be any spoilers for s2 either (not that there’s really much of anything to spoil).SoL and Comedy anime are 2 genres I have a weird history with. I often enjoy them, but they have to be paired together with some other genre to usually interest me. If a show’s genres are just SoL and Comedy I often am not interested in it. HOWEVER, Squid Girl is one of the few exceptions, and it’s quite the delightful little show. Years ago when I saw this...show cross over with Splatoon I didn’t think much of it, but I’m glad I finally got around to checking out.--STORY—Using the absurdity of Ika as a character and the generally ridiculous cast, Squid Girl is about the misadventures of a well…Squid Girl that’s come to invade humanity, and take revenge on them for polluting the ocean. Of course, she’s mostly harmless and ends up getting enslaved into working retail after putting a hole in a shop’s wall to pay for the damages. From there, you get 3 mini eps each episode with most focusing on Ika learning about new stuff and experiencing culture shock, meeting the eccentric inhabits of the beach, trying to be an “evil invader” and failing miserably, etc. There’s really not much to say, you’re not here for the story really. You’re here to laugh, and unwind with some relaxing entertainment. Not to say the “story” isn’t entertaining, but Squid Girl relies nearly entirely on its characters. I will say that the 2nd season’s gags weren’t as funny as s1, but it was still enjoyable.--CHARACTERS—I’ll be real if you’re gonna enjoy the anime, you REALLY have to like Ika considering the anime pretty much revolves around her. Not to say the side cast doesn’t get their moments and even sometimes some good character development (if only for it to often get undeveloped and is mostly just used for a gag), but most of the anime is about her antics. Thankfully, I do actually quite love her as a character.She’s arrogant, unreliable, holier than thou, greedy, selfish, mischievous, etc., and yet its contrasted well by her being generally clumsy, dumb, reckless, a pushover, addicted to shrimp, etc. I think what makes the dynamic work so well is that squid abilities aside, she really is just a cheeky little girl that for all the bravado and theatrics she pulls, she gets lonely, sad, angry, etc. like any other girl her age would. She over time comes to genuinely care for the weird inhabitants of the beach, and they more or less become almost family to her. 90% of the time she’s being a turd she gets repercussions for being one, so it’s not like she’s just a brat that gets away with everything. Combine all of this with her unique squid abilities and rather unique speech, and you have a very cute, fun, and unique mc.Side characters range from having decent development, for mostly just being there for a reoccurring gag. I will say the reoccurring gag characters are actually used fairly creatively for the most part. Even Sanae, who is probs my least fave gag character, still has a few eps where her gag is used very well and is hilarious. They’re overall a very nice side cast, and I love their interactions with Ika. I think my fave bits were the ones with the 3 Stooges, if only cuz their va’s just make the role come to life.--ART/ANIMATION—Anime replicates the original artstyle of the manga very well. Animation isn’t amazing or anything, but it’s def good enough and gets the job done well. Even rarely it’s surprisingly smooth, but you’re not getting insane animation here. There’s plenty of interesting visual gags they do to keep your interest, and facial reactions, cartoonish movement, etc. are used well to enhance the comedy.--SOUND—The OP and ED are quite catchy for this series. The general soundtrack is nice too, but nothing I’d add to a playlist. Voice acting is good, and I especially love Hisako Kanemoto’s performance as Ika. She does all the silly girl’s facets very well, and brings the character to life.--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION—I really enjoyed Squid Girl.  It’s cute, funny, and is just nice if you need some relaxing anime. I’d rec it for people who don’t normally like SoL, and want something that does it with a twist. OC, it’s also good for any fan of comedy as well.

Ika Musume, I became incredibly interested. It was great: an original premise, incredbile art, and seemingly exciting characters made it seem like an above average show. Thankfully, the actual anime did not disappoint completely.Story:There is not much wrong with the story, but there is also not much amazing. The whole ""I want revenge against humans because of pollution"" thing is never really taken farther than a several jokes an episode. Each episode simply covers Squid Girl discovering new things with comedic outcomes  which isn\'t that bad.Art:Other than characters, this is probably the most outstanding aspect of this show....There is incredible attention-to-detail in virtually every scene, and the characters\' artwork is adorable. The only negative comment I have to say about the art is the incredibly cheesy sub-titles that pop up two to three times an episode. They look exactly like the shitty WordArt that\'s included in Microsoft Office.Sound:Winner of the ""Fucking Great Opening, but Awful Ending"" award. Seriously, the opening theme is catchy as hell and fits Squid Girl\'s personality to a T. On the other hand, I disliked the ending a lot. I abhorred hearing that screeching voice right after the show ended.Character:Like I mentioned before, the characters are wonderful. Each and every one has their own interesting personality. And, of course, the main character is a squid which is just awesome. My only complaint with the characters is that there ISN\'T ENOUGH CHIZURU.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this as much as most shows, but it was not completely in love with it, per se. Some episodes dragged on, and I saw myself pausing and coming back later to finish them. This was not the case with every episode, though, just one or two.Overall:Shows like this need to be made more. I\'m not speaking specifically about squid-girl shows, but about  anime with new concepts and premises. In an ideal world, production companies would take chances like this more often.

Ika Musume is a squid who is fed up with humans who throw their trash into the ocean, so she decides to conquer the humans. Too bad she is just a little girl with no knowledge about the human world. The idea is very interesting and reminds me a little of Yostuba&!, though the main characters are quite different. The premise is often made fun of, as it...is a mere excuse for all the comedy. This show never takes itself very seriously and it shouldn't. I would've liked for some more conquering failure, but I'm okay with what we got.8/10 (Premise & Usage)Art:The artwork is very simplistic like in most comedies. This allows for better focus on the characters and the gags. On occassion it showed us what is could be capable of, but never did it really inspire awe. It still works quite well, so I won't go to hard on this category.6/10Sound:That opening...it will be stuck in your head for days. This is Ducktales level catchy. Sure, it's a very stereotypical cutesy song, but it's just so damn good! The ending is very calm and relaxing, almost like a heavy axe coming down to end the wacky ride, but I like it. The Anime itself doesn't use much music, the sound effects work well. Nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible + a good ending song + a really, really catchy theme tune.9/10 (it's really that catchy)Characters:Are these characters bland? Maybe a little. Does it hurt? Not at all. They all fill out their roles perfectly and combine to an eccentric cast with great chemistry. The hothead, the secretly scary one, the innocent boy, his mean friend, the Ika addict, the scared one, the alien believer...they all work and that's what counts. Ika herself is easily the best written character of the show. She does not fall into a stereotype, she's not brave, not completely dumb, not a tsundere, not innocent, not even a bad luck magnet. She's a little of everything, almost like a real person. Sure, she isn't very deep, but did you expect or even want that? No, you don't.9/10Enjoyment:I had a lot of fun. 12 episodes is a perfect length for this show. Long enough to provide you with lots of good comedy, but just short enough to not bore you if you marathon it. I gotta admit, at times I wasn't too pleased with its episodic nature (there's 3 mini episodes per episode), but I never got bored by it. I expected mindless, lighthearted fun and that's exactly what I got. I know there's a second season and I will very likely watch it.9/10Overall:8.2/10 is a mere excuse for all the comedy.

However this one was different, all the jokes were genuinely funny and the story surrounding the whole series was (while admittedly silly) well put together and enjoyable to watch.Unlike most anime this one follows a non-linear style where story is episodic, where each episode is a self-contained story that is loosely connected to the larger story as a whole. I feel like it adds to the atmosphere as well as helps to make the jokes that much more funny. It allows the writers to focus on how to make each individual episode good rather...than to make the series have an overarching plot that keeps the viewer watching each episode. By using this style there is no need to watch it all in one go and you can watch it in pieces whenever you have the time.In this anime, there is no great evil threatening to take over the land, nor is there a need for our hero to find some sort of hidden power from within. This anime simply revels in each episode and makes the most out of what it has, and it really show. It makes for a fun and entertaining ride as you watch the series progress.Ika Masume, or squid girl, is a comical and sometimes outright dimwitted character that is always the focus of each episode.

She then decides to get out of the ocean and try and take over the world and teach the humans a lesson!She then bumps into two girls called Eiko Aizawa and Chizuru Aizawa, and it turns out they they are sisters who own a small cafe/restaurant right outside the beach....Ika Musume ends up breaking a wall of the restaurant and she ends up working in the restaurant with the two sisters. From there on, Ika Musume has many different adventures and half of the time she forgets that she's on the surface to invade!I gave the story an overall 6 because I really enjoyed the story with its comedy, however I feel as if it could still be improved.

She tries to act tough about taking over the world, but she really doesn't know what she's doing!Eiko is the type of girl who will force her employers to work hard. She usually gets angry at Ika Musume because Ika likes to fool around and other things. She also doesn't care much about Ika's safety when she makes Ika do things in the restaurant.Aizawa is Eiko's sister and she is very polite and kind to everyone, including Ika Musume. Unlike her sister, Aizawa cares more for Ika and her safety, and she has grown a liking to her fellow squid friend. However, annoy Aizawa in any way and she'll unleash her fury, and it's very scary!I gave the character section an 8 because I just love how all of the characters have completely different personalities. A sign of that in an anime is great, since you don't want many characters and those characters have the same personality, because that's boring.Enjoyment: 7What can I say in this section, really? I just loved the anime so much. It's different than the other anime that is currently out there, mostly because it involves a squid girl!

For the most adorable invasion of mankind since Night of the Lepus.Yes, it’s not Godzilla, it’s Squidgirl, a vertically challenged moppet who looks almost human, save for the series of blue tentacles that make up her hair. Or Ika Musume, as Japan calls her.She comes ashore one day, bursts into the Lemon Beach House, and announces to the first gathering of humans she sees that this world... And all the people in it... Now belong to her!Unfortunately for her, this declaration is met with laughter, and she soon winds up working a low level job at the very beach house she just threatened. Like Ika, this beach house is owned run by a small family of siblings... They have no parents, because it’s an anime. The most important of the three is Eiko, a high school student who acts as a foil for all of Ika’s hare brained schemes and delusions. Takeru is a little boy who... genuinely acts like a child, surprisingly. He gets along very well with Ika, as he’s more than willing to play along with her. And their oldest sister, Chizuru... Well, telling you about her personality would spoil one of the greatest moments of the series, even though it happens in episode 1, so I’ll just leave it at ‘she’s awesome.’The animation is nothing special, but it’s a little above average by Slice of Life standards. There are a lot of key frames, but when it wants to impress you, it will not hesitate to do so, saving it’s budget for moments that really need it. Yes, the allocation of the budget may be a little too noticeable for some people, but you can’t argue with results, because whenever there’s action or physical comedy going on, there’s really nothing to complain about. Aside from the main character, the character designs are a little on the bland side, but they still have kind of a natural feel to them. Well, natural by anime standards.And speaking of our hero, the animation style works particularly well in favor of the Squid Girl herself, whose various cephalopod abilities make up the bulk of that action and physical comedy. For a good idea of how her tentacles work, think of her as a really mean parody of Lucy from Elfen Lied... the four deadly vectors have been swapped out for ten mostly harmless hair-tentacles that seem to have even more impressive abilities than Ika herself has. They’re powerful enough to break through a wall, strong enough to lift heavy objects, and fast enough to create a sonic boom, yet they’re also delicate enough to thread a sewing needle. And they can seemingly stretch indefinitely. On top of this, she can breathe underwater and use bioluminescence to glow in the dark.And yet, beyond these abilities, Ika herself is... Well, I don’t want to say stupid... Perhaps ‘naive and gullible’ would be better. Her knowledge of the human world seems very arbitrary and inconsistent. She’s able to do complicated math problems in her head, but she doesn’t know that she can’t eat the images on a 3D TV. It’s odd, but hey, it’s an episodic children’s show. Even My Little Pony had problems like that. And for what it’s worth, while Ika may be a little inconsistent, she’s a very entertaining little pain in the ass.As enjoyable as the title character may be... Your choice of dub or sub will influence this, but more on that later... I can’t really say as much about the supporting cast. I wouldn’t go as far as calling them bad or unlikeable... Okay, maybe a few of them are... They’re just not all that interesting on their own. They’re mostly used as props for Ika to interact with, and to be fair, this is done to great effect. They support her, as a supporting cast should, but none of them ever really stand out, as they either get too little screen time to justify their presence or so much screen time that their best qualities become Flanderized. The only one that ever really rubs anybody the wrong way is Sanae, Eiko’s childhood friend, who has a lesbian crush on Ika... Which would be fine, if she weren’t so damn creepy and obsessed about it. Honestly, she’s the only real element of the series that I wouldn’t call kid friendly.The English dub, for the most part, is pretty underwhelming. It’s a parade of no names and small timers, with the only big actors being Carrie Savage and the increasingly impressive Christina Vee. for the most part, the performances are either bland or adequate, although nobody really bombs it. What really surprised me was the performance behind Ika, who’s played by Christine Marie Cabanos. I’ve never really liked her as an actor... I thought she was miss-cast in K-ON!! and Madoka Magica, and while I didn’t mention it in my review, I freaking HATED her in Oblivion Island. But here, she was actually kind of good. She won’t be winning any Oscars any time soon, but her “every ridiculous thing I say sounds completely normal to me” delivery was a pretty good approach to take.The Japanese track is infinitely better than the dub, however, and Hisako Kanemoto blows Cabanos completely out of the water. Actually, the performances are better all around, even if you can’t understand the language. Which I can’t. The dub isn’t horrible, and it should be enough to please those who insist on watching it, but unless you’re eager to hear a barrage of fish-related puns, the Japanese track is definitely recommended.I mentioned earlier that, aside from Sanae, this show is pretty kid-friendly, and I meant it. The stories are simple enough for a kid to comprehend, without ever really feeling too dumbed down. It’s episodic, split into threes like a Nickelodeon cartoon, but there’s still a sense of progress and development with the characters. It’s set on a beach, so there’s naturally a lot of scantily clad bodies walking around, but aside from that, there’s barely any traditional fan-service at all. It’s the story of an incompetent Invader losing touch with their origins as they adapt to human culture, and while we’ve seen that about a million times, it’s done pretty well here, with the constant otaku pandering that almost ruined Sgt. Frog left completely out of the equation.The writing can get corny, and the characters can get a little stale at times, but it still smells of genuine effort and imagination. It never stays in a rut for too long, and there’s always a good laugh waiting around the corner. Actually, the writing in this show is a lot like the animation... It;’s hit or miss, but when it hits, it REALLY hits, and it doesn’t always need to rely on comedy to be enjoyable. There are some surprisingly touching scenes, including a chibi segment in episode five that’s so brilliant and creative that, with different music, it probably wouldn’t feel out of place in a Fantasia movie.Squid girl is available from Media Blasters, surprisingly. They’ve released the first season stateside. You can stream it legally on Crunchyroll, buy the DVDs on amazon, or just watch the whole thing for free on Netflix. There’s a second season, but it hasn’t been licensed, and I haven’t seen it yet. I will see it eventually, and when I do, I have some pretty high hopes for it... I want to see Ika’s home world be explored and explained a little more, I want a few certain characters to get some more screen time, and I want a few other certain characters to die in a fire.In the end, Squidgirl is kind of a mixed bag. It’s a bit of an underachiever in almost every category, but it still makes for some great light-hearted, mostly family friendly fun. I guess the base breaker for most people will be Ika herself., seeing as how the best points of the series Some of you may find her unconscionably annoying, and I can understand that sentiment completely. This show is not for you. For the rest of us, myself included, she is nothing sort of adorable and charming, and if the rest of the cast has to act as her props, then good job... This show is hilarious. It’s not one of the best comedies out there, and repeated viewings over a short period of time may leave you feeling cold... Once or twice a year at best is advised...

But for what it is, I loved it.I give Squidgirl a 7/10.', 'I\'ve known about this anime for a long time know and I\'ll would always pass it by or say is this a gross hentai. One day in the App Store I was looking at the crunchyroll apps and stumbled upon the squid girl one. For some reason I was drawn to this one and the blue exorcist one, BUT I DIDN\'T USE THE BLUE EXROCIST. Watching episode instantaneously drew me in. Squid girl is a very funny anime about a girl who tries to ""invade"" the surface to punish humans for polluting the sea. While trying to do so she becomes drawn to human customs...and forgets to invade, fails to try to invade, or even being distracted by something while trying to invade. It like the anime keroro gunso/Sgt.Frog but less about the invading. Though I praise it so highly some people might not like it\'s humor because we all had different things that are funny. I laughed like crazy when I was 7 from seeing a bird on Saturday night live and the bird did nothing. Mind you watching squid girl will always let you have a good time and make you smile. and forgets to invade, fails to try to invade, or even being distracted by something while trying to invade.

Mind you watching squid girl will always let you have a good time and make you smile.', 'Similar to many shows of the same genre, Ika Musume is episodic with multiple stories within each episode.  This, coupled with the writer’s ability to keep each and every section independent of repeat humor, kept the anime fresh from episode to episode, which is especially important given the fact that I watched this anime while it was airing.  Nothing hurts my attention to an anime more than watching an anime with an overall plot weekly; since I’m usually watching multiple shows at the same time, it’s hard to keep track of what’s going on, when and where.  With Ika Musume, I could...kick back for my weekly 30 minutes and enjoy good laughs and fuzzy feelings.GraphicsThe graphics of this show are pretty generic, with the soft colors and simple designs.  One thing I was appreciative of was the consistency of art throughout the episodes.PlotAs stated before, I really loved how each skit was unique in humor and didn’t rely on older jokes to generate laughs.  You can pretty much pick up any episode in any order and still find yourself enjoying Ika-chan’s ridiculous gullibility.  The only reason I don’t give the plot a full 10 is because of the final episode.*SPOILER*Whereas the previous episodes are episodic and don’t really cling to any serious ideas of character or purpose, the last episode suddenly throws in a very serious loss of self.  With reasons unknown, and never given, Ika-chan suddenly loses all her squid abilities: tentacle power, glow, and squid ink.  Her subsequent disappearance doesn’t amount to anything, as she comes back without regaining her skills, nor any hint about why she’s lost them.  This makes her sudden recovery, with the endangerment to Eiko’s life, all the more unbelievable.  I guess I’m supposed to assume that she regains everything because of a sudden realization of her affections for humanity, for the friendships that she has made?CharactersShinryaku! Ika Musume boasts a relatively small cast of characters.  Ika-chan and Chizuru were my favorite characters by far; their weirdness and coolness were in completely different leagues, but still memorable in ways their fellow characters were not.  While Eiko was one of the first introduced characters, I never felt much attachment to her–she lacked any twists to her personality.  However, I didn’t feel any need for more from her.  She was just…there.  The same goes for Takeru.  In fact, I had to look up his name just to talk about him here >.< Cute? Sure, he had his moments.  Memorable? Obviously not.  Cyndi, Sanae, Nagisa, and Ayumi all feel pretty much on the same level; they serve the purpose of promoting Ika-chan’s cuteness.  As such, any attachment I have to them is an attachment to the scenes they share with Ika-chan.SoundI always have a hard time commenting on sound.  Unless the music was truly unique enough to catch my attention, I don’t really pay attention to it.

It's cute, funny and just down right odd, but in a good way. It's nothing great by any means, but it does have decent animation, an adorable protagonist, and some pretty funny moments. Most of the lead cast besides Squid Girl herself, are pretty boring and one dimensional however, they all have good moments at least once. The story is nothing to be looked into, but it does fit the tone of the show. This show kind of reminds me of a softer, weirder japanese version of Invader Zim in a way. With the main protagonist trying to...take over the world and failing in comedic fashion. Something i just don't understand is why they had to add small scenes of weird sexual innuendos into a children's anime, but okay. If you can do it without being blatant and obvious, go for it, but two scenes really stood out of place. With what was given and while taking into account that this wasn't meant to be the greatest show ever, it did it's job. It made me laugh.

Thankfully episode 2 i got really into it and enjoyed the rest of the show.Squid Girl herself is pretty awesome and kind of adorable in her own way. I always liked the idea that she is some ancient being from the sea but just has the body of a middle school girl and isn't the brightest.Each episode i found myself laughing. Even the 1st episode that i didn't think was the greatest. There is even...one episode that is more like a side story that the crazy girl made up that is actually kind of sad. They even changed the color pallet to be more grey and less colorful. It's kind of weird with it being in this comedy show but it is nice.Easily for me the thing i dislike the most is the Scientist group. They aren't fun, They're boring and most of all they're annoying. I kind of like the blonde chick of the group. But i feel she is kind of wasted on them.I also don't like at the start how much everyone seems to shit on Squid Girl.The little boy of the group i'm not a big fan of either. As soon as i saw him on screen i was immediately thinking i wasn't gonna like him for the entire season and i was  right. But he's not that bad in the end i guess. He did have some moments that made me laugh.The art is nice and charming in it's own way. Kind of has a look of 2006 anime mixed with a modern look to it.The music i like.

Yes the overall story is pretty bad the characters are underdeveloped and the style of them feels rather american, but for some reason I cant stop watching, the way Squid girly is so oblivious of human life and all the squid related puns are amusing. I will defiantly continue watching but there has to be no way she will ever take over the world. ', ""Ika Musume is a perfect example of how to create an amazing moe, slice of life anime. The premise is so simple, its a squid girl who invades humanity after becoming frustrated with how humans have treated the ocean by polluting it. When she actually does come to the surface though, she finds that the humans are surprisingly tolerant of her despite her repeated threats to invade all of humanity and she quickly builds close bonds with the owners of a small restaurant on the beach, as well as many of the people who frequent the beach.Despite having such a simple premise, I was hooked...from the very first episode and ended up watching the whole first season in 3 days. Ika Musume is a very emotionally impacting anime, with a level of sweetness that soothes your soul and gives you a feeling of optimism. While I think anybody could enjoy it, I would especially recommend this anime to anybody who is feeling sad or down for whatever reason.The first reason why the anime feels so warm is how well the beach vibe is captured through the art. Everything is wonderfully colorful and cheerful. Its almost like you can feel the warmth of the beach through the screen. The sounds of the ocean and tropical sounding music along with the imagery added greatly to the immersion. Personally I've always thought of beaches and tropical locations as being among the most cheerful environments, so the setting was great for this anime.The second biggest reason is the characters. In order for slice of life to be done as well as this one is, you need to have characters that audiences connect to so well that you are interested in watching them even when they are doing relatively simple things. If you like the characters enough, something as simple as a hike up the mountain can feel great to watch. By the time I finished this season, I had this odd feeling that I had known the characters all my life even though I only started watching 3 days ago.The sweetness of all the characters is inspiring. It was very heart-warming to see this girl who is such an oddball be treated so warmly and with such acceptance from all the other characters. There are many cute moments in this show that will make you want to hug one of the characters.I'm sad to see that this anime only has two short seasons. I feel like this series has enough potential that it could've been turned into a long running show. But I do think this show has a lot of re-watch value. I can easily see myself re-watching this a few months down the line.I am certainly in no hurry to part ways with little Ika and the beach community, but I also can't seem to stop myself from watching at a fast pace and writing this review early despite not having seen the second season. To conclude this review, I'd recommend this to anybody who's looking for an anime with a very warm atmosphere that will soothe your heart, but I especially recommend it to anybody who's feeling sad or down in any way. Watching something so sweet can be very therapeutic when your down on negative thoughts.

To be honest I rarely can appreciate jokes and gags in anime, so I am very harsh critic. Yet, I must admit that Ika musume had managed to tickle me pink on a few different occasions. They took a simple idea, and made it work well.Ika musume follows… well Ika Musume as she attempts to conquer land to take revenge on the atrocities humanity commits on the seas. However, due to unfortunate circumstances she damages the frightening Aizawa Chizuru's precious shop. Thus, in order to protect herself from...Chizuru she ends up working off her debt in their beachside restaurant.In reality I have no issues with the deliver of the comedy, or content of the skits. While the majority of them are rather slice of life style jokes the addition of Ika Musume's ocean born naivety and abilities makes the content pretty silly. Her original purpose of conquering humanity isn't typically the focus of the skits, but they don't forget to make her act the part when she should. However, I found that the episodes at the beginning of the show were a bit boring, and that the later episodes are a decent improvement in quality as the characters build better relationships with one another.The majority of the characters don't feel particularly distinguishable, but their relationship and interactions with ika musume is what makes them interesting. I think nobody can explain this better than Aizawa Eiko, Chizuru's younger sister. She really has no unique character traits at all, but she looks out for Ika-chan and makes sure to tsukkomi whenever possible. However, the comedy takes advantage of this 'simple' character and manages to deliver the jokes in an extremely satisfying way. The characters do have their unique way of interpreting Ika-chan whether it be something to dress up in cute clothes, an alien specimen, or a advertisement tool.The show is a moe comedy in reality though. Take for example the 'moe' chapters of mini Ika Musume where nothing really happens except Ika being miniature size and acting cute. That being said I don't think that having a really moe segment actually makes the show better; although, i admit it can be adorable. Ika Musume is in actuality a genius (for example, a living calculator), but cannot seem to escape the short end of the stick every skit. For me it was a combination of frustration, and amusement as Ika-chan proceeded to be ruthlessly teased on throughout the show. The skits were well done, but I have always had a disdane for main characters who do everything right yet can't get a break.Overall, I think that if you are looking for a lighthearted comedy Ika Musume does it right, and does it pretty well. My score is somewhat low due to my unusually dull sense of humor, but I won't say that this will have you laughing your ass of either. However, if you are in the mood for some strange slice of life comedies with moe squids then I don't think you have to look any further.

For opening is so-so. Both opening and ending song is not bad. The story is good, balance of the comedy and SoL. Some episode are predictable, for SoL watcher of course. As for character, each of them are unique. they have their roles well within the story. For Art style, like other SoL anime, simple and classic. Realistic? Definitely not, it\'s a Squid Girl.For me, i enjoy this anime.Recommended for you to spend your days in chill sofa with big TV and snacks. Not recommended for Action fans anime, Obviously. For them, they will say ""boring anime"". ', 'An anime that brought me particular enjoyment. Not to due it splendiferous comedic value alone, but the fact that the comedy worked in flawless tandem with the evolution of the main character Ika, culminating in the beautiful final episode.Now i praise the characterization, due to the growth I got to Ika as the season progressed.Now as for the story, i found it to be old hat, but it worked very well, and was surprised to see how engaging it was kept with such a limiting setting such as the beach.In all this anime is worth the watch if just for humor alone. ', 'Squid Girl, I want to eat you.AUTHOR\'S NOTE:I picked up Shinryaku! Ika Musume after watching a particular .gif that made me laugh my ass off. At first, I was very hesitant in watching such a show due to its childish animation. It looks like a show for kids. I was wrong. Ika Musume\'s cover might look innocent on the outside, but it also has a very disturbing comedic undertone that many may look past on. I hope this review will give you a inkling of what I\'m talking about, de geso.STORY (7/10):Shinryaku! Ika Musume begins as environmental propaganda. When humans begin abusing their existence and...treat Mother Nature like trash, she tends to strike back with tremendous force. So, Mother Nature threw up Ika Musume from the sea to land, in order to set mankind straight. The mysterious creature that ascended from the depths arrives to Japan and initiates an invasion that will enslave all land dwellers. However, our tentacled cephalopod realizes that an invasion would be impossible when she encounters friends, thus hilarity ensues. Pretty simple storyline, isn\'t? Borrowing from the popular Nickelodeon cartoon, Invader Zim, Ika Musume attempts to invade Earth, though ignorant to the fact that the Earth is a bigger place than she had initially thought. Nevertheless, the storyline transforms into a story about a innocent girl with sinister plans that lives in a world that is not of her own. She is forced to play the ""rules"" (social norms) and is slowly introduced to the world of mankind, starting from the very bottom. Certainly, Ika Musume does in fact ""invade"" our world, but in a totally different way. Instead of conquering the land, she ends up conquering the hearts of the characters and viewers alike.ART (7/10):Quite colorful and spontaneous, the anime doesn\'t let the viewers peel their eyes away for a second. From episode one to the final episode, the background moves with the characters. Every emotion that is felt from a character is noticeable. Although the animation does not stimulates your eyes with exquisite visuals, viewers will not be interrupted and confused. Many of the characters have similar facial designs and eyes, but due to their unique personalities, each animated face give a refreshing quality depending on their character.SOUND (7/10):The OP ""Shinryaku no Susume"" by Ultra-Prism has a fiery sound, much like a superhero theme song. On the contrary, the fast-paced melody is quite fitting to the anime. The EP ""Metamerism"" by Kanae Itō sets a lullaby that becomes a tranquilizer for all the comedy and ridiculousness that this anime tosses at the viewers. Slow, yet catchy, it is a satisfying end for any action-packed anime that wants to bring the curtain down to a close.CHARACTERS (9/10):This is where it gets really weird. I swear every ounce of comedy, whether it is dark or light-hearted, is squeezed out of the characters. It is interesting to note, that every character have their own unique comedy effect towards viewers, due to their salient personalities. Ika Musume, is our anti-hero/heroine, who has come from the sea to invade Earth. Her innocence, curiosity, and many times, her ignorance becomes a staple comedy factor to the anime which can only be satisfied through irony. The anime is also split into ""mini-fillers"" which stars a chibi Squid Girl, who entertains our viewers with outrageous adventures that is both hilarious and moe. The Aizawa family (from oldest to youngest), Chizuru, Eiko, and Takeru, are the caretakers and victims to Ika Musume\'s menace. Their relationship with Ika Musume is a cycle of heart-warming comedic scenes as they learn from each other what it means to be a lost child in a foreign world, and what it means to have a loving, caring family. Sanae Nagatsuki fills the disturbing comedy void that this anime shamelessly exposes, which is one reason why Shinryaku! Ika Musume is NOT an anime for kids. At first, Sanae is a friend and classmate of Eiko who has a mutual relationship with her pet dog. Until Sanae is introduced to Ika Musume, the girl turns into a creepy stalker and a obsessed pursuer for Squid Girl\'s love, and don\'t ask me if she\'s into yuri or has a plain rapist mentality. Sanae engrosses the viewers using dark comedy with her ""M"" personality.The supporting characters also have their own unique personalities that I wish to delve on, but I don\'t think I want to go on any further. It doesn\'t mean they are garbage characters, as they fulfill their duties quite well and turns the spice of the comedy to high, depending on their screen time they get in the anime. You just have to watch the anime yourself.OVERALL (8/10):Honestly, I\'ve enjoyed Ika Musume to the fullest. It is difficult for me to say this anime is a revolutionary work in the making, but I do encourage you to take a stab at it. I must admit that Ika Musume is slapstick comedy at its finest, ranging from plain ridiculousness to classical. I definitely had some moments where I could not stop laughing at how ludicrous some scenes were and would feel really guilty at how fucked up it was. Anyhow, I highly recommend anyone with a sense of humor to entangle their tentacles into this anime and enjoy it as much as I have. treat Mother Nature like trash, she tends to strike back with tremendous force.

The series is episodic in its story lines and it is the type of anime were you can enjoy it with out a brain. The main character herself seemed to me the child of a tentacle hentai, if you know what I mean. But other than that it is an anime in which is enjoyable for most audiences. It is more of a comedy than anything else but it is some thing to watch in between dramatic anime or just some thing...to make you awkwardly smile. to make you awkwardly smile.', ""ignorant people who disrespect the sea, meet your doom.... yea, thats how it basically starts out. there tends to be at least 1 dramaish moment an episode, that really makes this series drag, but despite that its probably one of the better, if not the best, anime of 2010.this is based off manga who chapters feel like a 4koma, but in full manga form. as of chapter 46 (i have no idea what its up to in japan, but im at the very least doubleling it) none of the parts in the anime that tend to drag along for to long are in...the manga, im hesitant to call it filler... because i don't know. but even with them this is a great show for just fun watching it, as almost every episode is standalone.the art, its almost like they went to great lengths to make the anime the exact same artstyle as the manga, and it works. not many anime put this much effort into making the manga -> anime conversion work right, in most you can find them lacking in some way, but i personally cant with this one.the characters are the main reason that this anime turns out to be so enjoyable. there isnt much depth in them at all, what you see is what you get, and the parts that drag on are the ones that try to make them have depth.over all i can recommend this one to anyone who can stand comedy, as i have recently met people who cant. the manga, im hesitant to call it filler... because i don't know. but even with them this is a great show for just fun watching it, as almost every episode is standalone.the art, its almost like they went to great lengths to make the anime the exact same artstyle as the manga, and it works. not many anime put this much effort into making the manga -> anime conversion work right, in most you can find them lacking in some way, but i personally cant with this one.the characters are the main reason that this anime turns out to be so enjoyable. there isnt much depth in them at all, what you see is what you get, and the parts that drag on are the ones that try to make them have depth.over all i can recommend this one to anyone who can stand comedy, as i have recently met people who cant."", 'I give this anime an 88/100For some of you who know my taste in anime, I\'ve never really watched a PURE comedy series. The only true comedy series I\'ve really seen was Ouran High School Host Club, and that was long ago. But even so, Ouran is still technically a romantic comedy (though I really love it!), and I\'ve never really encountered a PURE comedy anime that I really liked...that is, until Shinryaku! Ika Musume came around.I mean, how can you resist a story about a cute little squid girl who claims she wants to take over the world, but doesn\'t know beans about the...human world nor does anyone take her seriously!? I read the premise of this before it came out and approached it with caution, and much to my surprise, the show is soooooo adorable in the best of ways! Even though Ika Musume came to earth because of her anger about ocean pollution and littering, this isn\'t really the theme behind the series. Then again, I don\'t know the whole point of this series at all! But who cares!?Alright, I\'m gonna start off with talking about the soundtrack first. The soundtrack fits the series very well, and I often found BGMs that ALMOST sound similar to the soundtrack for 07-Ghost (especially during the scene where Chizuru attacks Ika Musume at the end of the first episode and karate chops her tentacles)! Plus the show has the catchiest theme song EVER! It\'s so wonderfully catchy that its almost impossible to get it out of your head!Now, onto the characters. The main cast are what really make this series shine. Ika Musume, our favorite little squid girl, is just adorable and wonderfully developed throughout the series. Her innocence regarding the human world is so endearing, especially when you consider she\'s a sea creature who wants nothing more than to rule the world! The other characters are nice too, and the best part? They\'re not stereotypes at all! They\'re actually ordinary people with a few quirks here and there. In my opinion, Eiko is kind of like the voice of reason for Ika Musume, Chizuru is basically the friendly older sister with a possibly deadly alter ego sleeping inside of her, Sanae, albeit being a bit too fangirly over Ika Musume most of the time, can be sane and normal when she wants to be, and this is shown in the final episode. But my favorite minor character has to be Kiyomi, the little girl whom Ika Musume is friends with. She\'s soooo adorable!I would\'ve rated this series a bit higher, but my reason for this? Well...I thought Cindy Campbell and her scientist friends were a bit too weirdly portrayed and overly obsessive about aliens. I especially didn\'t like the scientists. They were the only bad thing about the series. I loved it when Chizuru rebuked them and stripped them and made them beg for her mercy in that one episode.But I honestly feel that the #1 best thing about Ika Musume is the 7 minute segment featuring ""mini"" Ika Musume at the end of episode five. I would give that single segment a 97/100 if it were just a standard anime since it\'s short but so adorable, cute, endearing, sad, and just plain simple and to the point. That particular segment seriously MADE the series for me. And it made the series for a lot of other people too, especially since it\'s inspired the creators to include segments in later DVDs!All in all, if you\'re looking for a cute and refreshing comedy anime with good characters, a nice atmosphere, and mildly great comedy, than Shinryaku! Ika Musume is the one for you! I know I really liked it! In fact, it\'s the ONLY fall 2010 anime I ever watched! The other ones didn\'t interest me. You should try it!

In truth, I was inkspecting this anime to be trash, and I was not dissapointed. It is trash; simply the best kind of trash. If you were to look at my ratings you would see a wall of 7s followed by a 9 for enjoyment. This is because my enjoyment of Shinryaku! Ika Musume massively exceeded the show\'s actual quality. There were moments where I was laughing uncontrollably, but the fact remains that in terms of actual quality the show is fairly...simplistink.Shinryaku! Ika Musume sinks or swims on its main character, Ika. All the other characters feel a squiddle one-note with the inkception of the other major character, Eiko. However, Eiko\'s role as the ""Mature one"" limits the enjoyment of her character. Therefore; the show\'s enjoyment stems primarily from Ika, with other characters providing entertainment through inkteraction with her. This means that if you don\'t like Ika, you won\'t like the show. However, I think this is a moot point, as Ika hershelf is such a vibrant and eninkmatic character that it doesn\'t really matter.To conchclude, while Shinryaku! Ika Musume is hardly a masterpiece, it is most certainly a lot of fun. If you\'re worried that it seems a bit fishy, why not give it a watch and see for yourshellf. I highly reccomend it if you\'re after something entertaining. It is inkredible how much joy can be developed from such simplistink execution. simplistink.Shinryaku!

From what I remember, the story itself was good. The plot was interesting, a squid girl who leaves the ocean because it's polluted? Pretty original, if you ask me. The art is relatively good, and the voice actors were pretty good (even for the dubbed version)Each of the characters were very special in their own way, but of course Squid-Girl stood out the most, with her peppy and cute personality. Overall, the show was enjoyable and very worth the while. I'd recommend this anime to anyone that enjoys comedy...and slice of life. and slice of life."", ""Shinryaku! Ika Musume is a lesser known gem that excels in a genre that did not become popular until many years later.Shinryaku! Ika Musume is a lighthearted, comedic slice of life in which many traits of modern anime within the same vein can be traced back to earlier titles like this. I loved things like Gabriel DropOut and Dragon Maid, but Shinryaku! Ika Musume seems to have done many of the things those more modern anime prior even to their conceptualization. The comedy is of good quality, and the characters are funny. The art is moderately above-average for its time, and the music is catchy...with a lot of uniqueness and character to it. Sadly, the second season drops this for a much more generic and unrelated opening theme.Overall, I really liked this. With a new job, I hardly have time after work to do anything but drink and sleep, so it's difficult for me to watch more complicated anime and write an in-depth and meaningful review for them.

It is cute, there are many recurring characters who you'll love the instant you meet them and the show is funny too. What more do you want?Story 8/10Each episode is divided into 3 smaller episodes. The episodes themselves are, in my opinion, so easily thought of that even a child could come up with it. For example(mind you, this does not happen in the show itself): >Ika-chan goes to the supermarket because she has to...buy some things for dinner. Instead of buying the needed suplies she buys some icecream. The money is now gone and she is in trouble, because Chizuru is going to kick her behind<This could be an episode of Shinryaku Ika Musume, it's that easy. Does that mean that Shinryaku Ika Musume story is boring? NO, NOT AT ALL! Altough the stories are easy to come up with, they are well written and unless you've seen Shinryaku Ika Musume a couple of times like I have, you won't think about how simple the plot line is, you just go with the flow and enjoy it. Mainly because Shinryaku Ika Musume is so funny that your attention is diverted from the simple plotline. For that reason, I give the story an 8.Art 7/10There's not a lot I can say about the art. I think most people would give it a 6 since the art is like any other regular anime. To me, however, because I like regular anime art, I gave it a 7. That is the sole reason. The art is definately not outstanding.Sound 6/10Expect a lot of sea in your ears. That's all folks!Character 9/10The characters are in one word: AWESOME. All the recurring characters are something special. You'll bond with them the moment you meet them. Every character has their own little quirks which makes this comedy so good. You'll meet Ika-chan who finishes her sentences with Geso, the san baka(three stooges) who destroy more than Ika-chan ever will, scary Chizuru and many more lovable characters.Enjoyment 10/10I have watched this anime 3 times and I'm planning on watching this one for a fourth time pretty soon! Before I watch Shinryaku Ika Musume I tend to watch tons of action and psychological anime so afterwards I can relax with Ika-chan and her friend.I enjoy every episode, even after watching it 3 times. This show is simply amazing. For me, it's definately a 10 out of 10.I recommend this anime to anyone who likes cute things, the slice of life genre and likes a slow paced, relaxed anime.

The art is definately not outstanding.Sound 6/10Expect a lot of sea in your ears. That's all folks!Character 9/10The characters are in one word: AWESOME. All the recurring characters are something special. You'll bond with them the moment you meet them. Every character has their own little quirks which makes this comedy so good. You'll meet Ika-chan who finishes her sentences with Geso, the san baka(three stooges) who destroy more than Ika-chan ever will, scary Chizuru and many more lovable characters.Enjoyment 10/10I have watched this anime 3 times and I'm planning on watching this one for a fourth time pretty soon! Before I watch Shinryaku Ika Musume I tend to watch tons of action and psychological anime so afterwards I can relax with Ika-chan and her friend.I enjoy every episode, even after watching it 3 times. This show is simply amazing. For me, it's definately a 10 out of 10.I recommend this anime to anyone who likes cute things, the slice of life genre and likes a slow paced, relaxed anime. This is not an anime for people who crave action, because you won't find that here."", 'Invader from the Sea turned to a waitress at a beach shack! ~geso.We\'ve seen in anime that even the devil gets a part time job to psychics wanting a mundane life to the perfect classmate\'s awesome antics and all, this rendition is not different, character jabbing and GREAT comedy to go along with it ~geso.Shinryaku! Ika Musume is one of those comedies LA has been on LA\'s comedy anime bucket list for a great deal of time and really the anime didn\'t disappoint by the end of it. Let\'s DIVE right in shall we? ~geso.Shinryaku! Ika Musume\'s narrative structure is that of the typical comedic...set piece lasting roughly 5 minutes each, rounding up to 3 or 4 large skits within one episode, largely following Ika Musume\'s daily life in trying to take over the world or those surrounding her and this plot structure though simple, pays off quite well due to the comedy given ~geso.This being a character-centralized kind of sitcom, LA might as well start talking about the characters before even talking about the comedy. Let\'s start with the titular character herself Ika Musume (or Squid Girl) voiced by Hisako Kanemoto, she is the narrative focus of the anime (to be expected) as we see her interacting with the human civilization as well as her plans for world domination through mundane ways made funny, Chizuru and Eiko Aizawa (Rie Tanaka and Ayumi Fujimura respectively) are both the tsukommi to Ika Musume\'s antics as well as keeping everyone in line, Eiko more to Ika Musume, Chizuru to EVERYONE. Sanae Nagatsuki voiced by Kanae Ito is an utter fangirl on borderline stalking to Ika Musume. Takeru Aizawa voiced by Miki Ootani is the younger brother of Aizawa sisters and is generally the character to involve Ika Musume in the mundane world domination plans. Nagisa Saitou voiced by Azusa Enoki is the only ""sane"" one of the cast, actually fearing Ika Musume\'s plan for world domination, which in turn Ika Musume likes to tease her with because she likes being feared. Gorou Arashiyama voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura is a lifeguard but has a crush on Chizuru, he normally is involved when Chizuru, Eiko or Nagisa is involved. Finally Cyndi Campbell voiced by Hitome Nabatame is an investigator trying to get Ika Musume into her lab so Ika Musume can be experimented as an alien. LA\'s favourite character though she doesn\'t get as much screentime and is an odd ""main character status"" but satellite character to Eiko (but later episodes gives full focus to Chizuru breaking her status as a satellite character), Chizuru was LA\'s favourite, well because of her being the MOST badass character in the entire series ~geso.Really all these diverse and wacky characters really drives the comedy for this anime. Ika Musume being the centralized comedic focus of the entire anime, Ika Musume either is the catalyst starting things off like her running gag of wanting world domination, or her mundane fascination of human culture through whenever she encounters Takeru doing something, new powers or talents Ika Musume taken to either over the top results or again, her not being taken seriously, instead being used for mundane chores or Ika Musume gets involved later in other situations only to make it even crazier or evolve the other comedic skits in the process of her ""intervention"" ~geso.Many of the character-focused skits do have their running gags such as Nagisa\'s fear of Ika Musume, Eiko\'s boke to tskuommi routine with Ika Musume as well as any of the other wacky cast, Sanae and Gorou\'s obsession with Ika Musume and Chizuru respectively and Cyndi\'s obsession in trying to get Ika Musume into the lab, but where it makes the comedy and running gags not as stale from it\'s conception onwards is Ika Musume\'s involvement and just making the running gags evolve along with Ika Musume\'s involvement with it all, from Eiko and Ika Musume\'s relationship grows as Ika Musume gets integrated to Eiko\'s home to Nagisa\'s relationship and how she feels about Ika Musume\'s presences. Add in the fact that the pre-established comedic skits LA already mentioned gets combined in the later episodes due to certain wacky characters meeting up with one another giving almost unpredictable results on the matter as well as some of the more genre-switching ""silent comedy"" like the Ika-tan skit to ""slice of life"" like Ika Musume gaining an ""accidental"" best friend of Kiyomi Sakura voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi (which later gets a sports genre skit) to ""scary-horror"" with ""supernatural phenomenon"" which is linked to Ika Musume\'s fascination of human culture taken in the more scary superstitious route (which is ironic due to Ika Musume essentially being an anomaly herself) in between the largely comedic nature of the anime and you got a really good slapstick yet wide ranging comedy about a Squid Girl who isn\'t taken seriously with goal of world domination with oddballs and wackjobs surrounding her. LA\'s favourite skits would go to anytime Ika Musume finds out a new power about herself, the entire deal with Nagisa\'s fear of Ika Musume (as it changes things up of Ika Musume not being the boke to Eiko\'s tsukommi, instead Ika Musume is the tsukommi to Nagisa\'s boke), the combined skits due to the obvious wacky hilarity that ensues and finally Ika Musume\'s attempts at world domination through mundane ways were some of LA\'s favourite comedic skits ~geso.Though LA said that the comedic running gags do evolve, the majority of them goes back to status quo is some ways or another, (though in a slightly deviated stance, same skit, differing results) those being Cyndi\'s obsession of wanting to get Ika Musume as a test subject, Sanae\'s obsession with Ika Musume to Gorou\'s crush with Chizuru, these skits though sometimes deviating from it\'s typical running gags, it ends nearly the same way it does though sometimes the great punchlines does mask this, but even with that, it\'s easily compensated with the variety of comedic skits, newer and older or characters you just didn\'t expect to meet up and start interacting with one other (be it similar goals to Ika Musume or just weird meetups in general) as well as some of developed comedic skits really changing things anyways ~geso.In terms of animation done by diomedea, the character designs are very standardized, the only exception being Ika Musume herself who has probably the most unique character designs, obviously what with her being a squid girl and all. The backgrounding is overall nothing much to talk about, but the more ""overexagerrated"" animations given can bring more variety to the animation as well. LA\'s most prominence in the animation would go to the character designs as Ika Musume herself was a memorable character designs further helped with the wacky antics she gets up to, the other cast members are rather noticeable usually because of their hair color or their wacky behaviour but nonetheless even that\'s helped due to their screentime and all ~geso.In terms of voice acting, the voice acting is decent to say the least with some notable performances from Kanae Ito with her borderline yandere vocals, Rie Tanaka\'s dual vocals of her sweet to red-eyed with anger vocals were pretty well done. LA\'s favorite voice actor would actually go to Ika Musume\'s voice actor, Hisako Kanemoto. Why?, because of Hisako constantly being in character with her ""squid"" accenting of ""~geso"" at the end of her sentences. It may not be much and some people might found it annoying, due to Ika Musume going through several ""whining moments"" within the anime, but Hisako Kanemoto is the only one with this kind of accenting and her ""in-character"" quite honestly made Hisako Kanemoto deserves this spot, ""annoying"" or otherwise ~geso.Shinryaku! Ika Musume is a very well done sitcom which is greatly helped by our titular character of Ika Musume, LA said it before but she\'s the glue that holds this anime together, both comedically as well as relationship-wise towards the other main cast as well, which was perfectly shown the last episode. Shinryaku! Ika Musume is one of those comedy animes where it has a simple setup but it pays off soo well due to the wacky character chemistry towards one another, the variety of comedy from straight up slapstick to character jabbing to it\'s great punchlines. Even though Shinryaku! Ika Musume has a bit of the ""status quo is god"" syndrome (and it does stay even during it\'s more unpredictable times), Shinryaku! Ika Musume nonetheless does evolve from it typical comedic skits, bringing us funnier comedic skits in the manner of combining skits together through it\'s characters or one-off skits different from it\'s own genre to give us something new which in itself makes it a VERY good character-centralized sitcom about one squid girl trying to take over the world ~GESO!!!!!!!! set piece lasting roughly 5 minutes each, rounding up to 3 or 4 large skits within one episode, largely following Ika Musume\'s daily life in trying to take over the world or those surrounding her and this plot structure though simple, pays off quite well due to the comedy given ~geso.This being a character-centralized kind of sitcom, LA might as well start talking about the characters before even talking about the comedy.

For starters, the show is about a squid girl who wants to invade the surface. Nothing to get confused with here. Much like something like spongebob, it's structured where there's a general plot and setting introduced into the first episode, and afterwards each episode is made with multiple story arcs that can introduce characters, develop characters, and make you laugh your butt off. The art was quite pleasing to the eye. Bubbly and fun. Bright and colorful. Nothing too out of the ordinary. The characters are nice and cheerful. I would describe most of the...characters as being 2D without much more to them besides that they're all unique. This includes Alex, the dog. As for enjoyment, I would rate this a 8. Most comedy genre titles won't make even make me smirk. However multiple times throughout this anime, its just too funny not to laugh. There are way too many times I had to close the door to my room while watching this anime just so I don't creep out the rest of my family.I would definitely recommend this anime to any anime fan.

(Also for ""getting laid."") And we humans still need to remind ourselves that our environment is not something you can mindlessly throw in the trash can.Said trash can is where latter message went; with this ""comedy"" called Shinryaku Ika Musume.

She has no weak spot or exploitable weakness. She just cuts anybody down to size. Despite her sweetness, her character\'s NO GOOD.2) Japan\'s blatant anti-American, ""non-Asians are stupid / the bad guys (if they\'re not hot chicks or cute jailbaits)"" strikes once again here.

It's my first anime review on MAL, and since I've completed this series just recently, I'd like to do my impressions for it before going back to other series I've watched earlier.STORY:Shinryaku Ika-Musume does not have any real plot, rather every episode is made up of three short skits that illustrates the humorous everyday life of Ika-chan (the protagonist) and her 'adoptive' family. Just like other similarly structured comedies such as Crayon Shin-Chan and Seitokai Yakuindomo, each skit is either a hit or miss: you either have a good laugh at the end of every seven minutes or you go 'jeez~'.However, let...me assure you that Shinryaku Ika-Musume will definitely have you ROFL at the end of every skit. At least I do. Unlike a lot of other comedies which usually consists of repeating the same old joke every episode until you are totally bored, Shinryaku Ika-Musume doesn't. You can see Ika-chan playing with her friends in one skit, and the next you see her fooling the three MID scientists. The same joke rarely repeats itself. Every skit is well-crafted, and it brings you a broad smile on your face at the end.ART:Shinryaku Ika-Musume sports some good character designs, most unforgettable of all includes Ika-chan and of course the three MID scientists. Other than that, the art throughout the whole series is pretty standard.SOUND:I wonder why slice-of-life comedy series seldom gets awesome soundtrack. Probably because it's a 'slice-of-life' series, it's meant to emphasize the everyday lives, not some epic story or things like that. That being said, the soundtrack of Ika-Musume is also not something you would look out for.On the other hand, the OP and ED of the series are quite good. The OP, 'Shinryaku no Susume' is catchy and fits the overall mood of the series. The ED, 'Metamerism' was a weird choice for such a lively show, but nevertheless it was a decent song.What I particularly enjoy most about Shinryaku Ika-Musume's sound is the voice acting. Ika-chan's voice actress was obviously a correct choice - she managed to inject life into the cute character. Another character who had a great voice was Chizuru (I call her Brock Ver. Female, just to let you know).CHARACTER:Because it was a show made up of character-driven skits, the character development was done quite well. Each character had enough screentime and had good development. As the show progresses, we see more and more different perspectives of the characters. Obviously the one who got the most development was Ika-chan. Other people, such as Eiko and Sanae, was developed well too. However, Chizuru still remains my favorite character.OVERALL:All in all, Shinryaku Ika-Musume is one good comedic series that I would recommend to even my friends who don't watch anime.

It's very reminiscent of a lot of the other comedy anime I've enjoyed that involve some sort of alien/demon/outsider adapting to regular life in a modern human society. It's kind of like a reverse isekai in that way.Ika Musume herself is a pretty funny character, but a lot of credit has to be given to the ensemble cast. The characters and their interactions really make or break a show like this as I find...character driven comedy to be the best for this kind of setting. I really like the attention to little details like how the hole Ika busts in the wall in the first episode is always still there in the background until it gets patched up, but even then it's done obviously on the cheap and is still really obvious.I like a lot of the running gags like how her weakness is shrimp and how stupid she acts when tempted by it or how she's always tormenting the one girl who's afraid of her. Overall it's a decently funny show and probably a good one to watch with friends. 8/10 character driven comedy to be the best for this kind of setting.

I thought it kind of overplayed everyone's distinguishing characteristic (like Chizuru's martial arts) to the point where season 2 might be a strained pale parody of the original which outstays its welcome, but that's not a big problem if you stop with season 1. "", ""I'll be honest:The first time I watched this anime, I thought it was quite possibly one of the worst shows ever made in history, mainly because at the time, I thought Squid Girl was obnoxious and the plot of the series didn't seem to develop that much, as it was supposed to centre around a squid girl living in an ocean who was fed up with the pollution of the sea, and wanted to get revenge on all humans, only to result in her actually just playing around with other children and the owners of the beachside restaurant and not really accomplishing her supposed mission.If...you're looking for a certain anime that is somewhat plot-heavy, Shinryaku Ika Musume is most definitely NOT the show for you. However, as time went on, I decided to give this show another shot, and not take it as seriously as I did the first time, and I actually found this show to have quite a lot of potential, despite its misleading plot.I really regret being harsh on this show at the time, as the humour in this anime is very similar to that of Azumanga Daioh, a famous slice-of-life show that is known to have quite a lot of hilarious slapstick comedy, such as Chiyo-chan and Osaka getting smacked in the face with a volleyball time and time again, and similar humour can be shown in this show, as there is a scene where Squid Girl throws up squid ink all over Chizuru after sneezing.At least Azumanga Daioh gives us a more genuine description of what to expect in its respective show, whereas Shinryaku Ika Musume just misleads us into something we did not expect.Anyway, let me give my ratings for the six key anime elements:Story - 6/10To be honest, I thought the story set-up was excellent. When I read a description of this anime, I was expecting it to be jam-packed full of action. It was supposed to be about a little girl in the form of a squid vowing to get revenge on the human population for polluting the sea, but as soon as she sets foot on earth above the ocean surface, that's when the show instantly begins to lose its plot, as she doesn't really do much to accomplish her mission, and instead just goofs around with other kids and the owners of the beachside restaurant by doing things such as having a fake birthday party for her, and having her consume shrimp to get over an illness that she just caught.Art 10/10I'm in love with the artwork. It is all bright and colourful and the character designs look adorable with their blobby-looking faces.Sound 10/10The voice acting is cute, and the opening theme song is extremely catchy, though to some people, it may seem annoying as many people dislike high-pitched anime girls singing.Characters - 9/10Squid Girl is hilarious, as she doesn't understand the concept of everyday human life. For example, when she sees children playing with inflatable sharks and fish, she mistakes them for being brought out of the sea and murdered so that the children can take advantage of them.Eiko is another hilarious character, as she is often portrayed as being embarrassed by squid girls antics, an example being when squid girl gets sick from consuming so much seafood that in order to cure her illness, she has to consume some more shrimp.Enjoyment - 9/10Like I said, this anime does mislead you into thinking that it is a plot-heavy show, but It's still a good slice-of-life comedy if you don't take it too seriously. If you liked Azumanga Daioh, you are guaranteed to enjoy this show as well.Overall 9/10This anime is a must-watch, as it is jam-packed full of comedy. It may not have much in the way of a story, but the witty humour of this show is what gives this anime lots and lots of potential. :) you're looking for a certain anime that is somewhat plot-heavy, Shinryaku Ika Musume is most definitely NOT the show for you.

It was supposed to be about a little girl in the form of a squid vowing to get revenge on the human population for polluting the sea, but as soon as she sets foot on earth above the ocean surface, that's when the show instantly begins to lose its plot, as she doesn't really do much to accomplish her mission, and instead just goofs around with other kids and the owners of the beachside restaurant by doing things such as having a fake birthday party for her, and having her consume shrimp to get over an illness that she just caught.Art 10/10I'm in love with the artwork. It is all bright and colourful and the character designs look adorable with their blobby-looking faces.Sound 10/10The voice acting is cute, and the opening theme song is extremely catchy, though to some people, it may seem annoying as many people dislike high-pitched anime girls singing.Characters - 9/10Squid Girl is hilarious, as she doesn't understand the concept of everyday human life. For example, when she sees children playing with inflatable sharks and fish, she mistakes them for being brought out of the sea and murdered so that the children can take advantage of them.Eiko is another hilarious character, as she is often portrayed as being embarrassed by squid girls antics, an example being when squid girl gets sick from consuming so much seafood that in order to cure her illness, she has to consume some more shrimp.Enjoyment - 9/10Like I said, this anime does mislead you into thinking that it is a plot-heavy show, but It's still a good slice-of-life comedy if you don't take it too seriously. If you liked Azumanga Daioh, you are guaranteed to enjoy this show as well.Overall 9/10This anime is a must-watch, as it is jam-packed full of comedy. It may not have much in the way of a story, but the witty humour of this show is what gives this anime lots and lots of potential. :)"", ""Story: The Story of Shinryaku! Ika Musume is about a Squid Girl who wants to take over mankind for polluting the ocean. When she submerges from the sea, she deices to take over a beach house called the Lemon. While showing off she tries to kill a mosquito she breaks one of the beach house's walls. She is then force to work until she pays of the damage she caused.Art: The art style of Shinryaku! Ika Musume was pretty good. I quite liked how scenery and the beach were styled in each episode.Soundtrack: The soundtrack for Shinryaku! Ika Musume is awesome. They really chose the...right music to suit the right times in the animeCharacters: I loved all Characters because they all had a different appeal to them.

Ika Musume a 10"", 'Well, basically the story is about a very cute squid girl who wants to invade earth and punish humanity for polluting the sea. And that’s it! There is no specific or complicated plot whatsoever. It is just about the everyday life of the protagonist and other characters. It can be so funny and touching as well. Every now and then it’s good to rest from complicated storylines and plots. It is also nice to see some light stories sometimes.Everyone has their own fair share of uniqueness or weirdness. And the weirdest of all is Sanae with her very creepy yet hilarious obsession with Ika-chan....Most of the characters are adorable and interesting. But of course, the most adorable and interesting of all is Ika Musume. Everything about Ika-chan is just so damn adorable and cute; from appearance to personality to the way she talks and to her unusual antics. Her naivety to almost everything is making her even cuter. Because of her naivety, she’s easily fooled or people make fun of her which is no doubt giving her more cuteness. Let’s not forget her unique abilities and weird antics which are just so adorable. With her suppose devil plan, she’s sure is very simple-minded and can be air-headed sometimes. She’s also so easy to satisfy. And the mini version is even cuter.The animation and artworks is unique on its own way. The characters’ design is what making all the difference. But of course, the most nicely done is Ika Musume herself. She’s one of the cutest and most adorable characters I’ve ever seen. Her dress, shoes, and very squid-like head are making it a complete package. And my goodness! Her tentacles are just irresistible. Her “geso” at every end of her sentences just completes the whole cuteness of Ika-chan.It may not be the most exciting and amazing series out there. It doesn’t even have a spectacular yet complicated plot that others have. However, it is definitely not boring and there is absolutely no dull moments. It is fun, nice, and heart-warming series.

Any who, This anime is wraped around Squid Girl (or Ika Musume in the Japanese anime), who intends on ink-vading the Earth to protect the sea. To be honest... when I first saw this anime I thought it was going to be about a hippy trying to get mankind to take better care of the ecosystem, but it actually isn't like that very muchat all. The show's a comedy about a freaking Cthulu (H.P. Lovecraft) wanna be trying to gain the control of the land for squid sake. "", ""'Shinryaku! Ika Musume' is an extremely wholesome and cheerful show with a touch of misanthropy. Things can get pretty goofy or whacky, but there are also times where it might make you cry (in the good way). The characters are oddballs, but that's what makes them so lovable. Squid girl's attempts to take over humanity are as cute as they are amusing. It might even motivate you to take better care of the environment. This show may be too childish for some audiences, but it's quite heartfelt and positive so you might like it anyway. IMO, this show is pretty underrated. "", ""This anime is highly recommended for those of you who like anime that tells the daily lives of the characters. Yes, this is Ika Musume, when I first met me I really liked this anime, with its funny comedy and cute characters.But unfortunately when I re-watched it for the second time, this anime felt bland, is it because I already know the plot? No friends! A good anime is an anime that you can watch repeatedly without getting bored, that's what is called the best anime.It's a shame that this anime isn't one of those, when I watched it for the second time...it was very boring, the story was boring, it just tells about ordinary everyday life, d and slowly adding new characters.Even so, I would still recommend this anime, because despite all the disappointments, I liked this anime, but for the first time watching it and not to be watched again. it was very boring, the story was boring, it just tells about ordinary everyday life, d and slowly adding new characters.Even so, I would still recommend this anime, because despite all the disappointments, I liked this anime, but for the first time watching it and not to be watched again."", 'Let\'s just say... my friends say that I am most likely to grow up and start a religion called ""Squidgirlism""Story:Ika Musume features short, cute stories (3 per episode) and most of them are stand-alone.  There really is no plot, aside from Squid Girl wanting to invade humanity and failing, but it is incredibly entertaining and I loved every minute of it.  It is one of the few comedy anime to make me burst out in laughter many times over.Art/Sound:The art is, again, cute, and Squid Girl\'s design is very memorable.  Both the Japanese dub and the English dub are good (quite surprising),...and the OP ""Shinryaku, Ika Musume!""/""Let\'s invade!"" is probably one of the most comedic and memorable OPs that I have ever seen.  I loved it!Character:Though there is little character development, each character has a distinct personality, and you can always count on them to follow their norm.

Review covers both seasons and the 3 OVAsPositives:+ Ika Musume is adorable, both in design and behavior.+ The cast of side characters is very good with a few exceptions.  The 3 Stooges in particular made me actually laugh out loud a couple times.+ Not really very ""haha"" funny most of the time, but it\'s sweet and pleasant in the way that...the best slice of life anime is, and will probably get you to smile at least.+ Art and animation is pretty great for such a simple show.

It\'s the kind of series you could show to people who aren\'t into anime and not be embarrassed by Anime Bullshit.Negatives:- I realize this conflicts with the point directly above this, but Sanae is an exception to the rule and the scenes with her are often cringeworthy. Mostly by design, but that doesn\'t make them any more enjoyable to watch.- Characters can be a bit one-note.  They often just repeat the same gags over and over with slight differences each time.  It\'s the kind of show where you can watch any episode out of order and it will still work, but that also means that there\'s no overarching plot and the characters are no different than when the series started.- Feels a bit repetitive when you watch it over the course of a few weeks rather than week-by-week as the episodes come out, for reasons mentioned above the best slice of life anime is, and will probably get you to smile at least.+ Art and animation is pretty great for such a simple show.

Still probably will make me laugh once I revisit this great anime! All the characters have charming moments to them and the show overall is just a treat to see. This show also has  a very fitting art style that just adds a lot to the overall plot of the show which I think lots of people will grow to like. If you also like the ocean...there are plenty of jokes related as such so you will get a kick out of that. There was also a collaboration with Splatoon 1 which actually was the reason I discovered this show! The ""Inkling Girl"" outfit in Splatoon 1 was the main reason for me ever discovering this anime and I\'m grateful for noticing because this anime is great.

Top wo Nerae! & Top wo Nerae 2! Gattai Movie!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1911/Top_wo_Nerae___Top_wo_Nerae_2_Gattai_Movie,"[""Recommendation: Watch the original series instead.  This is basically a long summary with nothing new whatsoever, so only come here if you're looking for a quicker rewatch.Starting out, I wondered if I could get away with simply watching these movies instead of the series considering that they both reflected the same story. I knew the series would have more material, but maybe these newer movies might have updated visuals, or might tell the story better or at least more succinctly?  Unfortunately, no: I'm pretty sure the movies have no new scenes, the visuals are the same, and the plot moves past succinct...here.Both series are condensed enough, but these movies condense past the point of comfort.

They already have excellent reviews on MAL, so I won't unnecessarily delve into them here.  But I'll just say this: if you don't like Gunbuster (Top wo Nerae), please still give the significantly more modern sequel a chance (but do know that although the stories and characters of the two OVAs are mostly separate, you'll enjoy Diebuster (Top wo Nerae 2) more having first finished its predecessor.  It's a spoiler to say why).  Dazzling protagonists that evolve well throughout each episode... rare beasts indeed, but we find one in both.

Towa no Quon 3: Mugen no Renza,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10714/Towa_no_Quon_3__Mugen_no_Renza,"[""Towa no Quon 3 is definitely the strongest of the episodes thus far. Set mostly in a sub-sconscious/dream world, this installment focuses on the traumatic pasts of the main Attractor (superhuman good guys) Quon and the main antagonist cyborg Kazami. It sets up a very emotional stage that allows the viewer to understand the motivations behind both young men as they struggle against each other, showing how their own misjudgements about each other differ from reality. (They both had assumed the other emotionless or without humanity, but at least Quon is able to understand Kazami's past)As I've been watching these mini-movies, I've been wondering how...the creators of the anime were attempting to handle show continuity versus making each movie stand alone on its own merits.  I feel that this balancing act plays into how they showcase character development as well as the pacing of each episode. It would certainly be possible for someone new to come into the series at any point thus far and not lose too much by means of explanation. The only overarching plot so far is that the evil organization Custos is trying to study/eradicate the superhuman Attractors, who are merely trying to live their lives in a world they don't really belong. I don't mind the lack of any complex or continuing plot, but some may find sticking with this series difficult if they aren't drawn to it for the characters or the animation.Like the previous installment, this outing focuses on a theme (dreams) and how they can be used to revisit past trauma in an emotionally revealing way.  Even though the cyborg Kazami is on the wrong side, he is consistently set up as a sympathetic character to show that people can do evil things even though they believe they are acting righteously.  But no matter which side a person is on, the existence of Attractors and their powers has affected everyone in the story, changing their lives irreversibly.  The show therefore makes it understandable how some can want to eradicate them while others can fight endlessly to protect them.The animation in this episode had me polarized.  It might just be because I'm paying closer attention to the details, but the animation in the first 2/3rd of the episode felt very lackluster - generally the only thing moving in any of the scenes was a character's mouth, and the backgrounds were mundane (except, of course, for the superb Custos HQ, with its cyberpunk feel and random green text on computer screens).  This is more than made up for later, however, in the dream sequences in the last third of the show.  The scenery is much more attractive and detailed, and in many scenes very different animation technique are used to show the strangeness of a dream and to very much highlight the horror of past traumatic events.  It works excellently well, and the music adds a layer of awe to it that makes it quite a thrilling experience.The brutality of the nightmare sequences somewhat make up for the lack of fighting in the rest of the episode, but it's clear the focus here is more on drama than action.  While I wouldn't say the series is shying away from action, I do believe it might attempt to steer it almost completely towards dramatic action, as Quon takes more and more punishment in battle physically (and this time psychologically).  The situation definitely feels like it will intensify, and fans of the first two shows should definitely find a lot to like here as well. the creators of the anime were attempting to handle show continuity versus making each movie stand alone on its own merits.

Many examples of anime movie series include Kara No Kyōukai (or The Garden of Sinners), Broken Blade & Mobile Suit Gundam UC Unicorn. The film series is directed by Umanosuke Iida, known for directing anime such as Devilman, Vandread, Hellsing (the original one), Mobile Suit Gundan: The 08th MS Team & Shangri-La. Unfortunately, before the movies were...released, he passed away of lung cancer at the age of 49 in 2010, and that’s the same year that Satoshi Kon passed away from pancreatic cancer..…..OK, let’s just get to the review.In a futuristic Tokyo, unique human beings who have awakened distinct powers are being hunted by a secret organization named Custos. Known as ""Attractors"", these exceptional humans are joining forces to defend themselves. They are led by a boy named Quon, an idealist who is determined to save all the Attractors he can.Now here’s the thing about these films: They are quite reminiscent of the dark superhero genre and mostly the X-Men franchise, which are the majority of which they are parallel to, such as, ordinary people who have these powers that they can’t control, which have affected their past and scarred them for life and they are being taken in a facility, much like Professor Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters to an extent and like that, they are being hunted down by a secret organization that wants to do them in. Yeah, this idea isn’t exactly wholly original but it’s an interesting concept and premise and I can say for that reason alone, it works on paper and it does work on the big screen.As for the characters, they are actually very stock characters with hit or miss qualities about them with having powers that can cause consequences and mostly regret. The main character, Quon, who has lived over a millennia, from witnessing his family being slaughtered and wanting vengeance ever since. Now I say Quon was some similarities to Wolverine but here’s the difference between them….Wolverine has more charisma and personality than Quon as that character seems unmotivated most of the time but he is not the all-mighty God-mode being that most people would suspect as he gets his ass kicked a lot in fights but he does manage to heal himself after.  There’s Yuri, the flirty but competent attractor whose powers aren’t exactly developed but can maintain it; Kiri, the innocent young girl whose gift is her voice and with it, she can only use it to heal or to destroy and I got to admit, that trait is close to being the character Rogue. Tei is the telepathic woman who can communicate with others from many distances but can relive painful memories of the past. Miu is the young girl that can communicate to animals but her limiter enables her to speak normally and also the animal’s language. Takao is the smart-alecky, lazy, but complacent attractor who talks shit sometimes but not so much to be an asshole.  Yuma is the boy whose power is to erupt colored orbs from his body whenever he’s upset or angry and the antagonist Genji Kamishiro is the class-A comic book-style villain who wants to control all the Attractors and to gain order……so, yeah, he’s the typical villain and last but not least Towa is Quon’s younger brother, who is believed that whoever contacts him will have their powers increased.As for the animation, I can safely say that BONES did an excellent job on this, especially the fighting animation where it feels so fast-paced and often gritty sometimes and that goes to the art style of the show, too, especially with some scenes that would be gruesome for younger eyes. The main theme for the show called “Reckless” by LAZY is somewhat thrilling and yet unintentionally funny for every time I hear, “Feel Rock Emotion, Burning Rock Emotion” because I know they use Engrish in some of the lyrics, but it still feel silly once you heard it so many times.For the dub by Sentai Filmworks, I can see why I said that Quon had no charisma and that’s thanks to Corey Hartzog and his lackluster performance as Quon sounds too chill, even in a tense situation, but I will say that, I’m pleased with the rest of their performances including Jessica Boone as Yuri, Emily Neves as Kiri & Monica Rial as Tei.FINAL VERDICT: After seeing some lackluster titles from BONES (No.6, Ghost Slayers Ayashi), this is an improvement and the kind of quality that BONES should have put in most of their shows. It’s a concept that seems foreign to Japan but if handled well, it can turn to be pretty impressive. I could easily recommend this to people who are akin to any Marvel comic character. released, he passed away of lung cancer at the age of 49 in 2010, and that’s the same year that Satoshi Kon passed away from pancreatic cancer..…..OK, let’s just get to the review.In a futuristic Tokyo, unique human beings who have awakened distinct powers are being hunted by a secret organization named Custos.

This could be as simple as finding a one dollar bill on the ground when you need it the most or saving someone's life when they are just inches from death. Well, if miracles exist, then so should be hope right? Well, perhaps what fans could hope for is someday, that the Index or Railgun franchise would get a movie adaptation. Now, the time has come and it's here. From an action packed series of science and magic brings forth...a new experience in the form of film adaptation for the first time ever.Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki (A Certain Magical Index: The Miracle of Endymion) is a film based off the franchise known as Toaru Majutsu no Index. (also known by its English name as A Certain Scientific Index) The film is designed as an side story in part of the Index franchise. As such, expect some of the supporting and main characters to make appearances with roles in this film. It is important to note that fans should already be somewhat familiar with at least season one of the Index series. Otherwise, the experience you get out of this film might not be as special as you'd hope for.I had high expectations of the film and I am thankful to say that those were met. The film itself takes place in the same setting as the TV series, Academy City (sometimes referred to as the Experiment City) a sovereign city-state where technology are highly evolved. Among its cities' residents though are students and scientists whom the latter conducts research on psychics known as Espers. However, the film itself steps forth beyond just science but also crosses with the magic realm.The timeline of the film is assumed to take place between the Remnant and Daihaseisai arc. (refer to the TV series for insight) But because the setting is at the location of Academy City, expect some advanced technologies to make it on screen. Take the Endymion for an example. Based on a name from Greek mythology, Endymion is a pivotal factor in this film as influences both the science and magic sides. It also serves as a symbol of pride for Academy City as well as an instrument of war for military purposes. The mysteries of this technology is revealed in the movie and fans can interpret its revelation in a variety of ways. It's more than just a space elevator, much much more. It's a new story to tell and hope to remember by.No story can be complete without its characters. In this film, it is crafted from the basis of a new character named Meigo Arisa. As an upcoming rising star, she plays the role of a singer with both a gift and mystery regarding her origin. Although labeled as a level 0, her character is prominent especially when we learn about the influence she has according to a certain magician. Arisa's name also is literally translated as 'sound' so expect to hear quite a bit from her in the form of her songs. After all, it's the songs that attracts the other main characters like Touma and Index early on as well. It seems like fate has plans for them because Arisa does get a surprise regarding her singing talent. More importantly though, we also learn that there are also other people who wants her but for much contrasting reasons.Among other characters that we might be familiar of includes Academy City's ranked #3 Railgun, the only and one Misaka Mikoto. Going by perhaps a more catchy name as BiriBiri (as nicknamed by Touma), she makes an electrifying appearance in the film with not just her skills but also in her outfit. Fans of the A Certain Scientific Railgun franchise might also be delighted to see her friends (Kuroko, Kazari, and Ruiko) make appearances as well. After all, friends have to stick together to bring miracles. On a more badass side, we also see an esper who is unmatched on the level 5 ranking charts.Perhaps dream also are soaring high for Arisa because her inspiration to become a singer. There is no doubt that the girl has talent and it's why Index and Touma became entranced by her voice in the beginning. However, the reason others wants her are for more reasons than just talent. That talent isn't just singing but for purposes that crosses the lines between science and magic. For a particular girl on the magic side, it is her duty to protect Arisa. We see that later on, this girl represents a sense of miracle because a certain incident in the film. In fact, you might be somewhat surprised at what you'll yourself. Miracles comes in surprises and this film also brings in some surprises of its own.So the film incorporates many other factors with its characters. There's a variety of them such espers, magicians, idols, immortals, witches, and wizards. All of them comes in a package as they display their powers to the audience. If that wasn't enough, there's a sense of mystery. Obviously, all eyes are on Arisa as she is a person of high interest. There's many questions going on regarding her origins and why she is so important. There's also a sort of metaphor with her Arisa's character going on as her singing represents inspiration and hope. We hear it like just music but behind those lyrics is a girl who is selfless with a big dream.Like its original predecessors, the film also adapts some of its more humorous moments. In fact, Arisa shares a similarity with Index that could cost quite a budget out of anyone's wallet. Then, there's Kuroko who retains her fantasies and awe to her onee-sama, Misaka Mikoto. If bad luck hits home, then Touma's name is written all over it. There's the gimmicky and cliched moments where Touma gets himself in compromising positions as well. This should be nothing new though considering the result of a double edged sword from his Imagine Breaker.Action wise, the film maintains a solid formation with its fighting scenes. There's intensity from both the science and magic side. Flames are expected in the forms of magic while there's also electrifying sparks flying in the air from Biribiri. As both magic and science side clashes, there's that sense of both fear and antagonism regarding our new uprising idol – Arisa. However, also expect fan service. Unfortunately, the film doesn't omit these factors after shower scenes. There's also reused character designs in the form of lolis as Kamachi often spotlights them on the screen. That is hardly refreshing. Anyone familiar with the Railgun manga or Index novels will instantly realize this. Those who have been following the animated Railgun series recently will also find a similar pattern. Lastly, there's some main characters who doesn't seem to get the spotlight they deserve. In fact, they seem to be more in the background as supporting characters. I'm referring to a certain albino boy that is famously known for a certain experiment in Academy City. As a fan of his character, there's some disappointment that hit me home.As this product is set on a theatrical screen, expect cinematic animation. Most noticeably, this film is performed with vertical resolution complete in concrete details. Therefore, expect more focus on backgrounds and details at many various scenes that are can be noticeable. The adaptation of Academy City is also presented with strong artistic values to reflect its scientific structures. Arisa's character design gives her an outlook that fuses between an ordinary girl with pink hair and an idol singer with her flashy outfit. Other new characters gives off their magical look like the witches hat and trooper like outlook. The way most of the movie is shown reflects on the animation of scientific and magical values. Clearly, this movie should be watched under at least 720P or higher to get a full pleasant experience.Because a good portion of the movie focuses on Arisa, she is the star and coming with her is that magnificent voice. Her voice performs a variety of songs with various purposes. I give praise to Sachika Misawa for her role as Arisa. Not only does she voice her character but also the various songs performed in the film that clearly shows her talent in the music industry. As an upcoming idol in the fictional world of Index though, there's also a sense of miracle in her voice. It seems to inspire hope/miracle and Arisa's songs presents that. The OST remains consistent during battle scenes and those where comedy pops out in the open.I don't entirely believe in miracles because not everything happens at that moment when you want it to. However, I got what I wanted and that's an enjoyable experience from Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki. The Toaru Majutsu no Index franchise is already massively successful with its spawn of the spinoff, Railgun. Similar results also can be traced for this movie through some statistical figures with its premiere. Of course, statistics aren't what determines your judgement of this film. Still, do give this a movie a try especially if you're a fan of the Raildex franchise.This movie itself establishes the line when both science and magic worlds clashes. When that line is crossed, you'd expect struggle and conflict.

""Ouch.""Despite its immense popularity in Japan and abroad, the Index series in general has always been wishy-washy (my honest opinion). Sure, there\'s a running plot with a somewhat interesting ensemble of main characters, but it has plenty of flaws too - too many convoluted terms that are unexplained or mentioned once and quickly forgotten about, an utter lack of character development, and so on.This movie - Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki - continues to extrapolate these same exact flaws, and in addition to that, adds some serious inconsistent plot elements that are both glaring and ridiculous.Let\'s start...off with the positives for once. Compared to the original Index series (which, I would recommend watching first before watching the movie, just to get a sense of what is going on), the artwork has vastly improved. The artwork and animation is crisp, fresh, and light. You can just tell from the first few frames that a lot of effort was put into this movie, and for that I am thankful. But there is just plenty of inconsistencies that utterly destroys J.C.Staff\'s (& co) hard work and washes everything down the drain.First off, the plot inconsistencies. Despite having a clear goal in mind, the Endymion movie takes more of a meandering path to get to its destination. In doing so, it introduces many new plot elements that were not present in the original series and does so in a terrible fashion. I would recommend watching the Endymion special if you get the chance - even J.C.Staff points out a lot of the plot points that I have a problem with (in a comedic fashion, too) - but I\'ll just briefly mention a couple: Kanzaki in space. The three midgets plus Stiyl fighting against Touma and crew. Who are these three individuals? Why are they important in the story? What is their purpose, and why did the writers feel a need to introduce them at all?I mean, seriously, what is even going on?Second, the characters. Arisa and Shutaura are clearly the stars of this movie and fortunately they get plenty of screen time. They meet the main characters, learn about them, and grow as individuals. Could their development been flushed out a little more? Yes. Could their relationship be more clearly explained  besides trying to shovel everything together in the latter half of the movie? Yes, but it is satisfactory, so I\'ll just leave it at that.The main problem I have with this movie regarding the characters is that plenty of characters appear in this movie. You have plenty of characters from the Index series showing up, and also some others from the Railgun spin-off series. But here\'s the catch: they don\'t really serve any purpose except to serve the fans and/or make the plot interesting. Of course everybody would complain if Accelerator never shows up, but his transitioning into the movie is both (1) rushed and (2) doesn\'t really serve a particular purpose except for one particular thing (I can\'t spoil everything for you, ok?). And that\'s it. Otherwise from that, if you removed him completely from the picture, the story could have just proceeded fine.One final thing that I will briefly mention and did like, however, was how the theme of ""miracles"" was decently integrated throughout the plot. It showed up throughout the movie over and over, and is well-incorporated through both symbolism and the dialogue among the characters. Hell, the entire space station structure is symbolic in itself, but you\'ll need to put a critical lens on to see just how it is related to the entire concept of ""miracles.""Overall, a lackluster story with a little bit of development and some thematic material, but it is weak as a whole. Some of the sound elements were clearly borrowed from the other two Index series. Would have gotten a 3 by my rubric if it weren\'t for those two big glaring errors.tl;drPros:- Crisp, crisp, crisp art. So crisp. Probably some of the most improved artwork I\'ve seen over a stretch of a series.- Well-incorporated theme- Plotline that was (relatively) easy to follow, even for the average viewer; but I would recommend watching the other Index series first just to make sure you don\'t get lost in everythingCons:- Many of the characters are still one-dimensional, but there is SOME development.- Many characters were rushed into the movie and don\'t hold any real significance except to please viewers off with the positives for once.

Here comes another review!One thing I always find great about movies based off of series isn't just more of what I like, but to see how the company handles it, so with J.C. Staff holding the reigns I had expectations and those expectations were surprisingly met. The production value truly shows with Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki when it came to top-notch visuals, soundtrack and even though it wasn't as good as it could be, the plot wasn't too bad itself. It seems this movie has had a better share of miracles instead of misfortune.Story:The plot is something I've always been...skeptical on when it comes to movies from more popular series like Index, Bleach, FMA, etc. I always feels it's more like a way to show off some snazy visuals with a mediocre story(Not for all movies of course) and cash-in, but Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki did manage to deliver a slightly better than average story, only slightly though. It follows the main set-up of our favorite Certain Magical Girl Puncher(I kid) Touma, Index, and a new girl Arisa whom sure enough is a mysterious girl with some sort of power that creates friction between the Science and Magic faction with Touma being the guy right in the middle of it. While seemingly standard there are twists to keep you interested enough to keep watching. The main problem after watching the movie I had though was I was left with plenty of questions and not many answers, so while the plot had its advantages in some areas, it lacked in others. That being said though, I was satisfied with what I was given, could they have gone further with it? Sure. Did it lessen my viewing pleasures? Not at all.Art:This is what I was looking out for in this movie. One thing I know these companies love to do is make spectacular visuals for movies compared to what has been made before for the series and it was spectacular. The fight scenes, scenery, animation, everything was top-notch and very appealing to the eyes. They had put a lot of time and money into the visuals and it paid off very well and it will leave you amazed.Sound:The soundtrack was another fantastic aspect of the film. I had expected some nice Background music here and there, but it looks like they went all out and even gave our main girl Arisa, a stage with plenty of songs to sing for us. The songs are done professionally, leaving me baffled as when you're watching the songs being sung by her on stage, along with the visuals, it truly felt like a concert.Character:The characters are probably the most important aspect of this movie. We see plenty of familiar faces aside from our main cast, Saten, Misaka, Accelerator, Last Order and so-on, but are introduced to plenty of new ones as well. While I enjoyed seeing so many of these characters, the problem was trying to fit so many in the time-frame the movie had. While we are familiar with our cast, the new characters are left to be desired and even a few seem to just be there to be more fan-service than anything. There was no real development with characters, just plenty of interactions and the most that did take place was between Arisa and Shutaura, while Touma of course helped them along the way. Now was this bad? No, we know our cast already of course, so it wasn't as much of a problem, but when it came down to the new characters and even antagonist, they were really shallow characters with not much of a story to go with them.Enjoyment:The movie was weak in some areas, but it succeeded in others. While I still feel a bit confused and have questions, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The jaw-dropping visuals, amazing soundtrack and all let me momentarily forget about my questions and just savor the movie. It was a real treat and probably will be for anyone else that's a fan of the series.Overall:Even though Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki had its flaws, I sure as hell was entertained. The cameo appearances from several characters, music, stunning visuals when it came to the battles, background and such, were all just superb. The only thing holding it back from being great is the un-answered questions it left and the shallow characters, but Touma, Misaka and the gang made that up as I enjoyed every second of seeing them on screen. It's not the best movie, but it is pretty good and I recommend if you're a fan of the Index or Railgun series to check it out or have misfortune befall you! skeptical on when it comes to movies from more popular series like Index, Bleach, FMA, etc. I always feels it's more like a way to show off some snazy visuals with a mediocre story(Not for all movies of course) and cash-in, but Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki did manage to deliver a slightly better than average story, only slightly though.

I want to say that I am a big fan of Raildex.  That’s why I was excited about this movie, and that’s why I feel so let down.  That perfect blend of action, comedy, and likable characters that makes Index and Railgun so popular just wasn’t present here, and even JC Staff knew that.  It becomes evident quickly, which is why they have… compensated in certain ways....Anyway, let’s get down to business.Story -  5/10I was drawn in by the story’s premise, which was the typical Raildex fare; Touma & company encounter a mysterious girl named Arisa, whose singing captivates those around her and seems to have the ability to make miracles happen.  She just wants to live a normal life, and loves singing because she has a genuine desire to please others.  Of course, there is more to this girl than meets the eye, and a battle soon erupts between the various factions of Academy City to control her miraculous singing.I keep using the word “miracle,” and the anime does as well.  In fact, the entire movie is based around them, beginning with a spaceplane crash during which all 88 passengers and crew survive.  This becomes known as the Miracle of 88, and the entire plot stems from it; the villains, opposing characters’ motivations, and Arisa’s past are all linked to this event.This premise of miracles is fine.  So where does it go wrong?JC Staff wanted to please the fans, of course.  They wanted to make sure everyone’s favorite character had some screen time.  This leads to a disjointed mess of scenes, utterly destroying the fluidity of  the plot for the convenience of uniting everyone against a common enemy (who is woefully underdeveloped, I might add).  The word “convenient” is not quite adequate for the level of plot events that occurr to string the story along.  The story climaxes with about 10 minutes of the movie remaining, and the viewer is suddenly blasted with plot points in a last ditch effort to try to tie things up.  The ending was painfully forced.It was not that JC Staff didn’t have time to tell their story.  In fact, if they had chosen to cut out some of the needless character appearances and pure-fanservice scenes, things could have been very different.  So, my score comes out to an “average” 5, with a good premise but bad execution.Animation - 6/10When I watch an anime movie, I generally have high expectations for the animation.  After all, with only about 1.5 hours of video, they should be able to make it look better than the average series, or the series it was based on.  However, that is not the case with this Index movie.  It looked no better than an average episode of the newest Railgun S episodes, and includes some terrible CG scenes.  Otherwise, expect the exact same level of animation quality you would get with an episode of a full Raildex series.I mentioned how JC Staff decided to compensate for the iffy plot points earlier.  They do this by putting an excessive level of fanservice in the movie.  You name it: panty shots, bouncing breasts, girls falling onto Touma, lengthy bath scenes, walking in on naked girls, girls wearing skin-tight body suits, girls NOT wearing skin-tight body suits, the entire Railgun cast in tiny skirts… I could go on.  And some of this comes at the expense of plot.  Thanks JC Staff, for using 10 minutes of the movie showing me a bath scene rather than giving me an ending.  I appreciate it.Sound - 7/10With the main guest character being a singer, it’s expected that there would be a number of new insert songs, and they are, in general, good.  There is always mood-matching music, the voice actors/actresses do well, and the concert scenes are nice when you aren\'t looking at the terrifying CG.Characters - 7/10Did you like the cast of Index?  How about the cast of Railgun?  Well don’t worry, absolutely every single one of them is here, whether it makes sense or not.  I ranted plenty about that earlier, so I won’t repeat myself.All the recurring characters do their normal things; Touma sees a naked girl and gets bitten by Index, Kuroko molests Misaka, Misaka gets angry and independent, Accelerator is a sarcastic dick, etc.  We get three main guests for this movie.  I can’t go into much without revealing major spoilers, but here they are: Arisa, the heroine, has a good backstory is quite likable.  She is an upcoming singer who various factions fight over for her mysterious singing power, and Touma protects her.  Shutaura Sequenzia is one of the people attempting to capture her for reasons relating to the Miracle of 88.  She has a good backstory, but it’s entirely spoilers.  What I can say is that she likes wearing latex, except when she’s naked or in her underwear.  The villain, an immortal gothic loli, could have been interesting if she was given development, but that fell by the wayside in favor of showing more characters’ skin.Two of three main guests were quite good, but the villain left something to be desired.Enjoyment - 4/10I’ve touched on it all before.  A good premise and guest cast can’t be seen through due to fanservice and a need to get every character on screen.  Its action scenes were not up to my expectations, and I was left disappointed.  It’s worth watching if you are a fan of Raildex, but don’t bother if you are expecting something revolutionary or even very good.  But hey, Touma punches a girl in the face and screams ""Such misfortune!"", so how bad can it be? Anyway, let’s get down to business.Story -  5/10I was drawn in by the story’s premise, which was the typical Raildex fare; Touma & company encounter a mysterious girl named Arisa, whose singing captivates those around her and seems to have the ability to make miracles happen.  She just wants to live a normal life, and loves singing because she has a genuine desire to please others.  Of course, there is more to this girl than meets the eye, and a battle soon erupts between the various factions of Academy City to control her miraculous singing.I keep using the word “miracle,” and the anime does as well.  In fact, the entire movie is based around them, beginning with a spaceplane crash during which all 88 passengers and crew survive.

But hey, Touma punches a girl in the face and screams ""Such misfortune!"", so how bad can it be?', '""Do you believe in miracles?""A somewhat cheesy start to the review perhaps, but appropriate to the theme of the movie nonetheless.Recently, I\'ve noticed that I seem to have developed a knack for somehow always being able to review a show by J.C Staff, despite me saying that I\'m not too fond of them. Now, honestly, I\'ve had to re-evaluate that assessment, seeing as I\'ve been somewhat unfair on them in the past - they\'ve got their fair share of fantastic shows under their belt (Honey and Clover and To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S), as well as some that are bad or lame representations...of their source material (Little Busters! and Spiral, respectively).To Aru Majutsu no Index: EnK finds itself somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, not really ending up on either good or bad. I got exactly what I expected from this movie, that is a really, really enjoyable feature which still retains quite a few of the problems that oftentimes hamper Index.At its core, Index EnK is really nothing more than your average Index filler arc in movie form, all of the right boxes are ticked: Mysterious girl with some kind of special ability? Check. Touma needs to save that girl? Check. Some kind of group wants to use said girl for nefarious purposes? Check. Said girl will fall for Touma and add herself to his ever growing harem? Check. Index biting Touma in an attempt to create a humourous scene, only for it to fall down on its face? Most definitely. Indeed, the Index movie really does hit all the clichés that you\'ve probably come to expect from the franchise.This serves as both a negative and a positive; negatively, the story is quite predictable and you\'ll be able to see quite a few of the twists coming before they happen - with that being said, there are a couple of rather unexpected twists towards the end which did surprise me, so I\'ve gotta give the movie kudos for that.Another negative with the movie is one that irked me throughout the film, that is, the need to show every character who has had some role of importance or another in the story so far into the film - including characters from Railgun. This is an incredibly double-edged sword with some rather nasty repercussions, for instance, I would have been annoyed had Accelerator not been in the movie, so I was happy to see him, but at the same time, his cameo was wasted so much it makes me wonder what the point of including him at all even was.The same thing applies to Mitsuko\'s appearance too, if she\'s only going to appear for one scene, then what\'s the point of even bothering to include her in the first place? I realise that this movie is, essentially, character fanservice - but it feels like such wasted character fanservice; the second Prince of Tennis movie did this as well, but it did it far more tastefully than the Index movie, when a character made a cameo appearance in that movie, their appearance held meaning, this just feels like they\'re including the characters because they\'re obligated to do so.Another issue with the story, aside from the wasted cameos, is the really cheesy ending; you know the kind, the one when every character has to lend a helping hand in order to assist the main character in stopping whatever calamity or disaster is about to happen - the movie is incredibly guilty of this, and the way it happens feels incredibly silly and doesn\'t sit right with when the movie is set canonically with the series (granted, it\'d still be silly even if it was right at the end of the series).Then there\'s the singing thing, don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t mind the fact that this is essentially To Aru Majutsu no Index: The musical (sadly there was no Touma and Misaka singing duet, which would have made the movie totally worth watching for that alone), but considering how cheesy everything is building up to the climax, this also felt incredibly silly and somewhat unnecessary too.On the flip-side of things, average Index arc though it may be, it\'s definitely among the best of these average Index arcs, mainly to do with the point that, for once, Touma doesn\'t end up giving an idealistic speech to the person he ends up fighting and keeps his idealism well in check - which is a saving grace to say the least.Another thing is the twists towards the end, which are actually genuinely well executed and do serve to spice up the story a little bit - even if, for the most part, they remain on the predictable side, the twist that is implemented right at the end is actually rather well done and something I was caught off guard by (albeit, only slightly).Aside from that, the story isn\'t really anything to write home about, if you didn\'t like arcs like this before then it certainly won\'t change your mind, but if you can tolerate Index filler then you\'ll probably be able to make it through this without too many problems.There is however one thing that caught me off guard completely about the movie, and it\'s not the story twists - it\'s the animation.Put simply, it is stunning.Now, don\'t get me wrong, the Raildex franchise has always been receiving the best part of J.C Staff\'s budget, but Index: EnK takes that to a whole new level; in the past, the Index TV series has always suffered from the occasional still frame or an off-model every now and then, the movie gladly doesn\'t have that problem and, when it\'s in motion or if there isn\'t much action, it looks absolutely fantastic.Magic attacks in particular, such as Stiyl\'s Innocentius, are an absolutely glorious sight to behold, and don\'t just look but feel powerful, I was left with my jaw slightly hanging open when I saw how good the movie looks. There was a fight in the movie about forty minutes or so in, when Touma is up against a random dude that he has to fight due to plot convenience, and I was honestly wondering if this was still To Aru Majutsu no Index, the animation was incredibly fluid and well done, more-so than a lot of the big fights in Index (although they\'re usually bogged down with monologuing, so maybe this is an example of what would happen if Touma didn\'t speak during his fights). There\'s even a car chase.Another thing worth mentioning about the animation is that, with the increased budget, Academy City looks far more detailed than it did in the TV series. The night sky, the lighting - for once, Academy City feels like a proper city rather than just some location that the characters happen to be in at the time, it looks like a place that people would actually live in. It\'s impressive to say the least, the little details that are usually ignored such as crowds moving in the background are actually given quite a bit of attention, I remembered that there are actually people supposed to be living in this city as opposed to it being somewhat empty.The CG for the most part looks rather impressive too, particularly the Index equivalents to Tron\'s lightcycles, which do look incredibly cool and have become another item on my list of fictional vehicles that I would love to ride one day. Sadly, the one chink in EnK\'s otherwise impenetrable animation armour is the rather ugly CG that is used whenever a character is singing, it does look incredibly out of place and, in comparison to the rest of the movie, just looks plain odd and somewhat unnecessary, what they were trying to achieve really could have been done better with conventional animation.Sound wise, the music isn\'t really worth mentioning all that much, seeing as t is, for the most part, tracks from the TV series, there may have been a couple of remixes in their too, but I sadly can\'t recall, my point being that, if you liked the music in Index, you\'ll like the Index movie\'s soundtrack, if you didn\'t, then you won\'t like it.The actual song that is performed by Meigo Arisa throughout the movie isn\'t really something necessarily special either, it\'s a nice little song, but not necessarily something that I\'d say is any better or worse than the soundtrack as a whole.As for the cast, you get exactly what you expect from them by now, Yuka Iguchi is still incredibly annoying as Index, Abe Atsushi delivers as Touma, Rina Satou gives us exactly what you\'d expect from Misaka (not at the level of To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S mind you, but this isn\'t her movie so I can\'t complain as much as I\'d like), they\'re almost all good performances apart from Index.The major additions to the voice cast, Sachika Misawa, Yoko Hikasa and Ayane Sakura, all give passing grade performances and all deliver exactly as you\'d expect them to, with sadly no surprise star performance to speak of, they do the job and that\'s that really.Other cast members, such as Nobuhiko Okamoto, are totally wasted in the few seconds of screen-time that they get, it goes back to my original point of the character cameos feeling so wasted that there\'s really no point in them appearing at all.Which brings me to my next point.Index, as a series, has a lot of characters that appear on quite a regular basis throughout, characters like Accelerator, Stiyl and Tsuchimikado, the series suffers as a result of this, having to deal with too many characters at once - and the movie suffers as a result of this as well. Nearly every character that has served some role of importance between volumes 1-7 of the Light Novels (not including villains), gets an appearance in the movie, however short their appearance may be - heck, even Aleister of all people gets an appearance in the movie. This is a serious problem, as the movie wastes cameos that should have been something that really pleases fans, I should have felt happy that Accelerator appeared in the movie at all, instead, I was left feeling rather confused as to why he was there - don\'t get me wrong, I\'m happy that he was in the movie, as he\'s by far the best character in Index (at least, by this point in the story), and I\'m pleased he had a moment, but it\'s not the kind of cameo he deserves.This waste of cameos actually also has a negative effect on the new cast members too, the movie spends so much time bringing in everyone that it hampers any serious development for Meigo Arisa and Shutaura Sequenzia (which is a ridiculous name even by Index standards), as such, they come across as rather flat and somewhat one-dimensional, this in turn also harms the twist at the end now that I think about it, seeing as the characters are rather unsympathetic, which lessens what should have been serious emotional impact.The main villain isn\'t worth talking about, motivated by a stupid reason that is really not worth going into due to its stupidity, it tried to develop her in some way I suppose, but I can\'t say I actually felt anything even remotely resembling sympathy for her, especially considering what she was going to do to achieve it.All flaws aside though, Index EnK is a very, very enjoyable movie - one that I was quietly anticipating. A common thing I\'ve noticed with Index (especially in Index II), is that, when it\'s going in all guns blazing, it\'s totally possible to ignore all the flaws and just find something really enjoyable. I wouldn\'t go so far as to say that it\'s ""turn off your brain and enjoy it"" style viewing, as there\'s method in the madness (for lack of a better idiom). I don\'t think I would have enjoyed this anywhere near as much as if it was an actual part of the TV series though - the animation is definitely one reason why I enjoyed it so much and it really is stunning to behold, but the wasted character cameos did detract from my enjoyment of the movie a bit.Don\'t go into this movie expecting some kind of revolutionary new appreciation for Index that you never thought possible, you won\'t be getting it. It\'s traditional Index filler at the end of the day, meaning that it comes with all the pros and cons that you\'ve come to expect from the franchise by now - it also comes with fantastic action scenes that should are totally worth watching the movie for.Now hurry up and announce Index III J.C staff, you\'ve kept me waiting long enough. of their source material (Little Busters! and Spiral, respectively).To Aru Majutsu no Index: EnK finds itself somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, not really ending up on either good or bad.

I had a decent level of expectations for this movie. Toaru Majutsu no Index itself was a series I enjoyed greatly. I watched it a while back and ever since the ""break"" to go forward on the Railgun side story I haven\'t seen the series since. Since no anime is perfect I could blatantly point out most flaws I found in the show and look past them but as I grew as an anime viewer these flaw became more and more of a cripple to the series. Again since I...haven\'t seen the series again ever since I finished Index II I haven\'t really had time to go back and re-watch with this new mind set even though I remember the flaws. Then this movie came a fresh start to get a little summary of what index was again and oh did I remember what Index was.Story 7/10The story had a good premise but the execution could have been better. The story based around the word miracle and what that word holds and means. The pacing of the story itself I found good but slightly rushed at times given that the movie is only 1hr 30mins. I found myself losing the story at times but maybe it was just me not paying attention. The story itself is something you would expect from The Index series a ""girl"" is in trouble and Touma with his save everything attitude come to help while another ""girl"" with a tragic past connected to the first ""girl"" is in pursuit of her and Touma has to fall on them or vice versa sometime within the movie. Putting that aside just Index\'s harem subplot at work and Index\'s subtle misogyny was not portrayed in this movie so don\'t worry KINDA SPOILER ""no girls got punched by Touma"". But all jokes aside the story was good in the premise but the execution was a little bad and pacing was a little fast at times but nothing too bad it was almost unnoticeable but that is just my personal view. Within the time of the movie screen time was given to the center characters evenly but other characters felt like they were only there to help pull the story together in the end such as ""Accelerator and Last Order"".Art 8/10The Toaru series does it\'s art very well. J.C Staff has given this show a lovely art design that looks well with its visual animation it doesn\'t feel like it ever lacks throughout the movie. The scenes where the stunning visual effects are needed portrays them very well while the less focused scenes don\'t have a lack in animation or visuals to for us to notice and complain.Sound 8/10The sound is very fitting to for the movie. The main girl in the show is a pop music start and the music fits the character well and fits in well as background music for certain scenes such as the scene with Kanzaki and the missiles. The soundtrack as a whole was good in the sense that everything fits and it fits well making action scenes thrilling and visually stunning scenes captivating.Characters 6/10The characters for the movie were not up too pare with what I expected but not a total failure. The main girl Arisa could have been better. They did not give her character much to work with in terms of her role. She felt quite generic at times given that she is the center character of the movie I would have expected her to show more of a character as a whole instead of just fitting the role as she did in the movie.The other girl Shutaura was a more interesting character and I found she would have been a better main character than Arisa. Not because she had a bad past made her a better character that fact that she showed more of a personality and less generic behavior for here role even with a stupid mental illness they gave her (Which I found kinda funny and desperate on the writers behalf just because they could think of anything better to move the story.) again just bad writing.The first time I saw Magical Index I thought Touma was a good character but as I grew I found him more and more mediocre and generic. He himself is a character that makes the statement ""Just fitting the role."" He doesn\'t do much to make himself as a character indifferent form other anime MC\'s of this genre, no unique traits, no distinct personality, no set motivation. They try to make him seem badass but in reality its just the show trying to make him seem that way. I don\'t hate his character though but again...generic.The main antagonist too was just another power hungry loli with some bent motive. And some characters where just there but the original cast as a whole played there part and did it well. From electric tsunderes, to lesbian teleporters, to annoying loli nuns to sociopathic vector controllers.Enjoyment 7/10I may have talk down on the series and movie but I am a review and sometimes I may be bias (like we all are) and other times I may be not. In this review I\'m not. I love the series and the movie may have not been the level of greatness I wanted it was far from bad it was actually pretty good.Overall 7/10I know you all may think I\'m using the word generic a lot but that is what Magical Index holds a lot of generic content with a great premise. Generic yet Unique"" is a phrase best describes Toaru Majutsu no Index and it\'s contents. This movie was no different had its flaws, bad writing and crude development thrown at you but you still enjoyed it. These problems aren\'t even on a scale for you to complain because other shows have tried like Index and failed miserably so we should applaud it for that have something great isn\'t easy to come by and this movie like Index didn\'t reach that point but it didn\'t reach too far from it. haven\'t seen the series again ever since I finished Index II I haven\'t really had time to go back and re-watch with this new mind set even though I remember the flaws. Then this movie came a fresh start to get a little summary of what index was again and oh did I remember what Index was.Story 7/10The story had a good premise but the execution could have been better. The story based around the word miracle and what that word holds and means. The pacing of the story itself I found good but slightly rushed at times given that the movie is only 1hr 30mins. I found myself losing the story at times but maybe it was just me not paying attention. The story itself is something you would expect from The Index series a ""girl"" is in trouble and Touma with his save everything attitude come to help while another ""girl"" with a tragic past connected to the first ""girl"" is in pursuit of her and Touma has to fall on them or vice versa sometime within the movie. Putting that aside just Index\'s harem subplot at work and Index\'s subtle misogyny was not portrayed in this movie so don\'t worry KINDA SPOILER ""no girls got punched by Touma"". But all jokes aside the story was good in the premise but the execution was a little bad and pacing was a little fast at times but nothing too bad it was almost unnoticeable but that is just my personal view. Within the time of the movie screen time was given to the center characters evenly but other characters felt like they were only there to help pull the story together in the end such as ""Accelerator and Last Order"".Art 8/10The Toaru series does it\'s art very well. J.C Staff has given this show a lovely art design that looks well with its visual animation it doesn\'t feel like it ever lacks throughout the movie. The scenes where the stunning visual effects are needed portrays them very well while the less focused scenes don\'t have a lack in animation or visuals to for us to notice and complain.Sound 8/10The sound is very fitting to for the movie. The main girl in the show is a pop music start and the music fits the character well and fits in well as background music for certain scenes such as the scene with Kanzaki and the missiles.

Well, I have no idea. Damn, my rotten brain. I wish I have Index\'s brain so I can remember how I found this movie.[Story]: (8/10)The story is set in Academy City. A Space Elevator named Endymion which is under construction is almost complete. One day, Touma and Index meet a Level 0 girl named Meigo Arisa. Index and Arisa have a mysterious connection in their ravenous appetites. While the three are enjoying their time after school, Stiyl along with some magicians  suddenly attacks. His target is Arisa.Why can\'t the Index series take things slow...like this movie did? In the movie, everything was explained so I knew what the hell was going on. In my opinion, the story is great but the ending sucked. I\'m not going to spoil you guys the ending. The story structure of the movie is very similar to Railgun and also somewhat similar to Index.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation] (10/10)Just by looking at the trailer or just watching the first 5 minutes of the movie, you already know that this movie has a great animation. The background characters are detailed, the environments are colourful and character designs look more gorgeous.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (9/10)The soundtrack is similar to Index and Railgun with some new soundtracks added. I loved the soundtrack from both series so I also love it here. The new soundtracks are ok. The song that\'s being sung by Arisa called ""telepath"" is wonderful. I heard both versions and japanese version is obviously better. I didn\'t listen to the credits song so I don\'t know the song.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Character]: (9/10)Most of the characters from both Index and Railgun made an appearance in the movie. Especially Saten, thank god. For people who loves to see Accelerator, he only appeared for a few seconds along with Last Order. The character\'s actions and personality is still the same especially Touma and Index. Some new characters are also introduced. Arisa, a LV. 0 esper and the main character of the movie. Her dream is singing and her dreams seems to be coming true. Shutaura, a girl who despises songs and does not believe in luck. She plays a major role later on in the movie---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (9/10)I absolutely enjoyed the movie because it\'s not like the Index TV series where everything is rushed. The movie is not rushed and it\'s nice to see all the characters from Railgun and Index making an appearance.  It was worth 1 h and 30 mins of my life and  I wouldn\'t mind watching this movie again.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[OVERALL]: (9/10)Overall, the movie is great with some few flaws. The movie has a great story, great animation, great soundtrack and they put all my favorite characters from Index and Railgun in this movie. If you\'re a fan of both series then you don\'t want to skip this one.Next, I want them to make a Railgun movie and I\'ll definitely buy the Blu-Ray and watch the movie.Pros:+Great story+Perfect Animation+Great soundtrack+Plot is well explained this time+Characters from both Index and Railgun makes an appearanceCons:-Disappointing ending-Accelerator didn\'t get a lot of screentime like this movie did?

I tried very hard not to. Or for getting your hopes up and then crushing them because it does not live up to my description.Miracles? This movie certainly is one. Think of every single anime movie you've seen. Majority of them all have common cliches. Three bad guys, who are impossible to beat but some how are killed in the end, and one leader who is either overpowered, or just a coward. And of course, the main characters all struggling for what is obviously good.This movie has none of that.3 years ago, a space...plane called Orion by a company called Orbital while re-entering the earth's atmosphere, miraculously all 88 passengers survived. Meet Arisa, a street performer and upcoming idol. She meets Touma and Index while performing on a street one day, completely by chance. However, chance and luck do not exist around her, only miracles. Except, she doesn't know it. According to Stiyl and his three new apprentices, this girl has the ability to start an all out war between Magic and Science, though she is among neither. The Science side, Orbital is back, and wants to use Arisa as the opening attraction for the grand unveiling of Endymion, a Space Elevator, which according to the Magic side is the reincarnation of the Tower of Babel.What makes this movie so great is that it throws away common place ideas such as good and evil, and focuses on everyone: characters from the original series like Accelerator and Touma, as well as new characters such as Shatuara and Arisa. Everyone fights for their beliefs and ideals, rather than for 'the greater good'. It perfectly combines genres of Magic, action, Idols, Action, Sci-fi, Mecha, and up beat Comedy throughout its duration. It truly is a Kiseki. plane called Orion by a company called Orbital while re-entering the earth's atmosphere, miraculously all 88 passengers survived.

It was said by Index to Touma in the very first episode when they met in Touma\'s apartment.After this encounter, Kamijou Touma\'s life would never be the same again. He didn\'t know back then but he was about to discover a world with dangers beyond his imagination and had yet to realize how important he would become.The Toaru Index/Railgun franchise stands out due to its great character design and art, exciting battle scenes and an interesting story about the fight between the scientific and...the religious factions. It is fast paced and finish with deconstructive villain vs. hero action.This kind of plot is based in the well-used formula of action anime that always happen to be successful in a way or another. There is this major scheme going on and our protagonists are randomly catch in the middle of it, while they are completely unaware of what is going on.One could say it\'s an old and repetitive storyline, but wouldn\'t deny it proves to still be effective anytime a new project appears with this setting. This movie is no exception. It could\'ve been better developed but was sure joyful to watch.With just these few lines I could review the entire story. That\'s exactly why my score to its story wasn\'t that high. However, there\'s way more to analyze. For the breakdown, if you might, read below.My first thoughts on this were ""I\'ve seen enough Index to know where this is going"". Endymion story develops just the same as a special/OVA would go and takes place after the end of the TV series, although, no prior knowledge is necessary in order to understand it.Again, Academy City, the place where science has no limits and students are often endangered by experiments conduced without good sense by both religious/scientific factions, will be the stage for another conflict.Have you ever wondered what makes a ""miracle"" possible? The Miracle of Endymion, as some like to refer about an incident that happened long ago and is about to take the stage again. However, this miracle might not be so perfect, and there are some who would swear to death it was never such a thing.Just like the tv series, this movie contains a lot of symbolism and references to holy scriptures and ancient story as well. Being this one of the most important pillars of the entire franchise it was pleasant to see that they did it very well with this movie.J.C.Staff, nowadays, stands as one of the greatest studios when you talk about anime. So, as expected the artwork was a joy to watch. There were some nice scenarios and the character expressions were perfectly drawn. You can easily notice someone cared about the details not only on the most important scenes but during the entire move. It sure impressed me the high quality of the CGI that was also meticulous coordinated.Usually movies have a larger budget then TV series, more sponsors and more time to produce less material. This way, movies tend to have better results, just like the post-production, the animation and the planing of these 90 minutes were superb.Being it an action-driven story, it\'s acceptable that the focus isn\'t in developing characters, even though, one thing is leaving characters with low priority and another is completely leaving them aside. In my point of view, there\'s just a lack of effort in making them deeper.Index fans will be depressed to know that she isn\'t the spotlight this time neither. Her screen time in this movie was also minimal. Index Librorum Prohibitorum stopped being the main focus of this franchise long ago.Endymion presented lots of supportive chars -as if there wasn\'t already tons characters in this series- but just a couple of them are developed and actually have some kind of background story. Those who read the novels might be a little more comfortable with this, since some of these characters were introduced along the volumes, but for those who didn\'t, it just feels like these chars are jumping in and out of the screen.There are a few cameo appearances from the TV series for the joy of some fans, but they would only show up some minutes and didn\'t played a important role on the story.All of this just contributes to blurry the glow of this movie. It becomes hard to follow and be excited by the story when you can\'t attach to the characters.As for sound and OST. We got a lot of insert songs, very pretty ones. One of the main characters, and center of the plot, loves to sing and make a living out of it, so as expected, there are some moments during the movie when you can just sit back and enjoy her cute voice.In the end, a predicable story with a pretty predicable ending. It felt like I was watching an OVA.Endymion didn\'t reach my expectations, I wasn\'t amused as I thought I would be. But still it was a very pleasant movie to watch and a great story to pass the time.Considering it has been a while since the TV series aired, it was nice to relive those moments.As for a final consideration: Yes, we got (a bit of) fanservice! Some interesting camera angles and odd ""where are your clothes?"" scenes.J.C.Staff sure knows how to please their fans without tagging this as a ecchi. the religious factions.

I thought that the first season was mildly entertaining with the ideas it presented but when season 2 came out I felt like it just fell on its face. So, did Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki do any justice for the Index anime?........nope.Story: (3/10)The story of Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki begins with a plane crashing but when the plane crashes all the people that were involved in the...crash all miraculously survived. Later, it cuts to Touma and Index walking around Academic City and meet a level 0 girl named Arisa who is able to sing very beautifully but there is actually much more to her singing than it seems. There were many flaws that I found within the story of this movie. One thing that I found very odd with the story was how Stiyl and these 3 magician girls all attack Touma and company with murderous intent which makes it seem like this movie took place between the first and second season of Toaru Majutsu no Index. The pacing of the movie can also seem very off at moments and I know movies don't have as much time to be able to explain things thoroughly but I think it could have been handled much better. There was another odd moment in the later half of the story with  Kanzaki. Kanzaki comes out of a space shuttle in space without a space suit and somehow survives being out in space and after she is done protecting the space shuttle she then floats down back to earth. The story never shows how she was able to survive falling back down to earth after the whole incident was over. My final problem with the story is that I thought that the way the movie ended was bad.Art and Animation: (7/10)The art and animation in Toaru Majutsu no Index series has always been pretty good. The backgrounds in this look phenomenal, the character designs all stay consistent, and the different super power effects all look good. My only problems with the art is how it used CGI vehicles that were in the first fight of the movie and how it used a 3D model of Arisa during the scenes when she was singing kind of like those videos were it shows a 3D model of Hatsune Miku singing but it is used sparingly so it is fine. The animation is as equally as good as the art with always being pretty fluent.Sound: (6/10)The soundtrack in this movie is pretty good with having many good tracks and my favorite being Ashita, Hareru Kana by Misawa Sachika. The music also helps the scenes in being more atmospheric. The voice actors all did a good job and the sound effects are fine.Characters: (4/10)I have always found problems with all the characters in Toaru Majutsu no Index series and it doesn't get any better in this movie. There were many characters that were either just pushed in to make an appearance or having barely any development at all. An example of characters barely getting any development would be the 3 magician girls that are were Stiyl's helpers. The only screen time they ever got was during the battles that involved Stiyl which hardly added anything to their characters. An example of the characters pushed in would definitely be Accelerator because of how they just thrown him in at the last minute in the later half of the movie. Touma is still the guy that is able to defeat anybody with his magic negating hand even though the villains can use their own strength or physical weapons to defeat him. Index is still the girl that barely contributes to anything in the story even though the anime is named after her and how she is mostly used to bite Touma on the head when Touma accidentally does something perverted in front of her. Luckily, Arisa and Shutaura get a fair amount of development but I found the romance between Arisa and Touma was not well done.Enjoyment: (4/10)The art/animation and sound was definitely something I enjoyed in the movie.Overall: (4/10)Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki had its high points with the art/animation it presented but the plot inconsistencies and the characters hold it back from being a good movie. crash all miraculously survived.

The story is interesting and the universe is so huge that I just want to read up everything about it. Although that being said, I felt that Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki was a pretty huge disappointment for me, and it pains me to give it only a 7/10. It lacked the charm of both the Railgun and Index series. Why? Just read...on to find out.Story (7/10):The story for the movie is pretty weak. That is because the pacing of the movie was horrendous, emphasizing too much on the non-important parts (introduction) and rushed through the important plot points. Unless you have not read the summary, the story is about a mysterious Level 0 girl, Meigo Arisa, who seems to have the voice of miracles (kiseki), and she would tear up the balance between the magic and science sides. This concept is well done, since in every episode of Index’s ending, Touma always says, “When science and magic cross paths”. Yes, finally we see something that will truly affect this balance, and the consequences that follow because of that. The battles with the science and magic sides were truly extraordinary, however, the antagonist’s plan to use Meigo Arisa for her own needs were not well developed enough. Apparently the antagonist was the one who caused the Orion plane’s crash, which fuels the other character’s rage (I shall not mention the name to avoid spoilers) but yet no explanation was made as to why she caused the plane crash. The viewers do not actually feel threatened at all since the antagonist’s plans were not well explained and not justified. It was hard to completely understand what the antagonist was exactly going with her plan. Worst of all, in the last part of the movie, the directors seem to just randomly throw in characters from the Toaru universe; Accelerator, Last Order, MISAKA Clones for no rhyme or reason, as if the only purpose was for fanservice (Though I was pleased, ha.). In addition, the parts where accelerator appeared were just so anticlimactic. Lastly, the ending was like just, wat. Trust me, you’ll have the same reaction. In other words, the story was filled with plot holes that were left unexplained.Characters (7/10):The characters from the Toaru universe return, and they remain more or less the same. We have Mikoto and her gang, as well as Touma and Index. Their personalities are the same and their actions believable, and as fans you will not be disappointed. Otherwise, the points for characters will be so much lower.The development of the new characters, mainly Meigo Arisa, Shutaura Sequenzia and the antagonist (I shall not name her to avoid spoilers) is not as well done.Personally, I felt that out of the new characters, Meigo’s character development was the best, as we can truly see her personality, her motives and how she changes through the movie, with the help of Touma and Index.Shutaura however, was badly developed. Her motives were not clear and her actions were not as justifiable as the directors make it to be. Moreover, she claims that she can't hear music, and even that wasn't well explained.And lastly, the antagonist. Her development was the absolute worst, all we got were at most 2 seconds of development. The directors were making her character such that we would be sympathetic of her, however, with little backstory given for her character, her actions were hard to be justified and thus there was almost little threat posed by her.Art (10/10):This being the movie, I have to say that the art looks absolutely gorgeous. Everything from the endymion, Meigo’s concert to Mikoto’s electricity, looks crisp, beautiful and detailed.Sound (10/10):Every action scene is accompanied with awesome soundtrack as well as fitting sound effects that sound epic. In addition, the songs performed with Sachika Misawa as Meigo Arisa were all very catchy and I think its something that I will add to my collection. They really seemed to be miraculous songs.Enjoyment (9/10):Though the story and character development was not that well done, I am a Toaru fan and hence I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Overall (7/10) on to find out.Story (7/10):The story for the movie is pretty weak.

Here it comes my review!I had great expections knowing that Kamachi Kazuma wrote the script for this and as a great fan of the Index series (I mean, the Light Novels) I was really really looking forward for this.Did it met my expectations? Yes, It was amazing all the time. I really really enjoyed it.Why? Because this is a movie made for fans. Yes, it\'s canon but I doubt that Kamachi Kazuma will mention Meigo Arisa in NT 8 or the events of this movie, right? This was a movie made just by the enjoyment of fans, J.C Staff did...his job right this time? Yup, strangely, this time J.C Staff brings to us a really good movie.Story - 9The Story is written by Kamachi Kazuma, it has all that we can expect. Mindfucks, Touma being a TouMAN and all this, nothing new particullary in this aspect.The story takes place between the events of the novel 8 (Musujime Awaki and Kuroko\'s novel) and novel 9 & 10 (the arc of Daihaseisai), thus, it happens at the same time that Index II. This is not a sequel, keep in mind that.We see the construction of the Endymion, a platform made intending to bring people to space. But soon Kamijou Touma will be involved with Meigo Arisa, a girl that he knew while he was talking a walk with Index in the streets of Academy City, then he will find out that she\'s being chased by a group of girls who are under the orders of...guess who? Yup, our friend Stiyl (man I really missed you XD). Any further hints about the plot would be spoiler so i\'ll leave it to you to find it out.Art - 9Great, as we can expect. We are able to see al the characters again and in that aspect the design is good and follow the designs from Haimura very well, I have no complains in that aspect.Sound - 10Great! Amazing! Outstanding! The music and the songs were great (as one can expect from j.c staff, the only thing that they can do well XD) and knew to match with the events that were happening. This was, without doubt, the most outstanding thing in this great movie.Character - 10Perfect! We are able to see all the great characters from Index (the best thing of Index is the great cast of characters, IMHO). All the characters (except for Hamazura, ugh, poor Hamazura, and it\'s my favourite one! XD) had their moment to shine. It was really great in this aspect. As one would expect from Index.Enjoyment - 10This, is a movie made for fans of Raildex. Thus, as a great fan myself, I enjoyed it all the time, all the minutes were thrilling, amazing, interesting, i couldn\'t take my eyes off of the monitor while I was watching it! This movie is, we could say, fanservice, yes, not in the ""Boob-ass"" meaning but in the meaning that it\'s made for us, fans, to enjoy it. As I said earlier I don\'t think that this arc will be relevant for the history (or perhaps it\'ll be, Kamachi Kazuma is such a troll lol). I think that this is an independent arc given to us to be able to see all the great characters again. Also, it gives some hints to the no-readers of Index novels about what will happen in the next LN.Overall - 9Great, amazing, we can feel the hand of Kamachi Kazuma behind this work.Sorry for all the grammar errors, I hope you all can understand well my review.

The motivations for the different characters and factions was confusing and paper thin.It seems to me that they were attempting too hard to give all of the iconic Index/Railgun characters some screen time and a cool action sequence or two, instead of crafting a cohesive story.There were two redeeming points to this movie. The first would be the likeable and cute heroine, Arisa, who had good chemistry with Index and Touma. The second...would be the animation, art, and sound quality which were all really nice. Lots of vibrant colours, smooth and fluid animation in the action scenes so that was nice to watch, and some enjoyable songs.If you're a fan of the series you might enjoy this movie just to see your favourite characters get some more screen time, but watch at your own risk because the plot leaves a lot to be desired.If you've never watched Index or Railgun before then skip this movie, it's not a good way to get into the franchise.It's rare for a movie to make me start watching it at 1.5 speed half way through so I can finish it sooner, and unheard of for that to happen for one of my favourite franchises, and yet here we are.Pros:-likeable heroine-great animation, art and sound (the animation quality is literally the only reason I'm not scoring this lower than a 4 overall)Cons:-nonsense patch-work plot-flimsy antagonist AND protagonist motivations-so many plot holes would be the animation, art, and sound quality which were all really nice.

While it has a self-contained and compelling plot, it is geared towards celebrating the series just from the number of characters appearing. This raises the larger question of if a movie in a franchise must be made for general consumption, owing to callbacks and cameos that do not directly serve the plot. The answer may vary depending on the viewer, some seeing it as a waste of time or distraction, and others viewing it as adding to the atmosphere. But without a doubt, Endymion is distinctly an...encapsulation of Index\'s spirit. As such, it does not pretend to be just another arc for adaptation in the series and would be incomplete without some liberties taken to let most of the prominent characters appear.The most apparent feature of Endymion is how conceptually and thematically robust it is, reflecting on and reinforcing the rest of the series by extension. The exploration of miracles and how they are still, in part, created by people\'s efforts are interesting and uplifting. While the rest of the series has yet to deliver on a full-on clash between magic and science, Endymion gives insight into their confluence and where they overlap. Though miracles would be an intuitively magic side phenomenon, the movie shows us an interesting overlap with science. While they are ultimately classified as magical powers that prompt the English Puritan Church\'s involvement, it is demonstrated that miracles are born out of an overriding human will. This has immediate connections to the explanation we were given for esper powers: that their AIM fields originate in their minds\' creation of a personal reality. The relationship between miracles and esper powers gives Academy City interest in studying its source. In addition to being a succinct yet robust premise for a conflict, it supports the world of Index by showing how magic and science can converge. Simultaneously, the thematic imagery is exceedingly strong, drawing parallels between the Endymion space elevator and the Tower of Babel. While it does not really make use of the Tower\'s story, there are many poetic connections to it, like its eventual destruction in the movie\'s climax.The emphasis on music as a central part of the movie\'s theme also enhances it greatly. While it is not outstanding compared to a series focused on music or some of anime\'s biggest hits, it is excellent in the Index\'s context. The idea that music is a means to convey not just emotions, but hopes and wishes are driven home without being hamfisted. This gives the soundtrack greater importance, with the J-pop music is matched well with both action and slower scenes. The use of music to convey feelings and spur efforts that words alone cannot achieve aligns exceedingly well with their Tower of Babel motif. That despite not fully understanding one another, there is still a means of communication that can transcend any gap. Despite watching the movie without subtitles for the songs, the tone of the music conveyed the desires of Arisa, be it energetic, resolute or calming. Although this should be the goal of all soundtracks, it is so rarely emphasised in the narrative and given time to breathe for maximum impact. The only other shows that execute this, albeit much better, are anime centred around music like Hibike! Euphonium.This is some of Index at its best, being very much a show that emphasises thematic and conceptual robustness above its other qualities. It gives the movie an additional layer of depth with its allusions and themes. At times, this may veer into more ""literature mode"" territory where it is reading into things that may not be explicitly or clearly the author\'s or director\'s intent. Yet, it is rare for an anime to have these layers to peel back and the fact that a more in-depth thematic reading exists should give Endymion credit. At the same time, the movie does undermine itself with some more questionable choices. The lewd fan service is dialled up far too much for my liking and tends to undermine the more profound points it is making. Also, the introduction of Stiyl\'s apprentices/groupies are an unfortunate piece of irony, being referred to as witches despite the Puritans being notorious witch hunters. The series does explain it away, eventually, with the same logic as to how Necessarius is a part of the Anglican Church despite some of its more occult/pagan magics. While it is possible to handwave this as a lack of more specific cultural understanding owing to Index being Japanese, it is also eye-wateringly ironic to think about.The plot is for Endymion is very much the story of Arisa and Shutaura coming to terms with who they are. Being the show\'s emotional and thematic centre, it does feels mildly disjointed because of how late their narratives properly converge. Aside from that, the plot is very much straight forward with sufficient intrigue built around the endgame. The main antagonist is quite underdeveloped but ultimately has an intelligible aim. We can also comprehend the means used to achieve it based on the magic principles already explained in Index, though its specific effects are left ambiguous. On the other hand, Touma\'s involvement in the plot is something mostly left up to chance as usual, with other characters being roped in along the way. Indeed, even prominent characters like Mikasa do not have a particularly large role in the story, leaning overall more towards the magic side. However, it would also be impossible to leave her out entirely, both from a narrative and audience-centric perspective. In that sense, it is strange to fault the show for having the majority of the Index cast involved since it is very much it\'s prerogative if it wants to do that.There is some criticism to be levelled that new characters were introduced that further complicates coherence with the rest of the series. This is very much an issue that all movies of expansive franchise face when they have a more serialised standard format. It is inappropriate to adapt a core part of the storyline as a movie since it would be a shift in format. This necessitates that the movie plot either be a contained side-story or an epilogue/sequel if the series has ended. Given Index has far outpaced its anime adaptions, the latter is very much impossible. Having a movie with only established characters that does not alter the status quo or have any ramifications for their personality is extremely difficult to do well. Hence, it is justified that spinoff movies showcase established characters but have the plot and character arcs revolve around new or previously minor characters. From that, it is unfair to criticise this movie for not further developing character. It is still an understandable irritation since the Index series has relatively weak characterisation with only a few exceptions from Railgun. Even then, some characters like Accelerator and Kanzaki were challenging to bring in without completely breaking down the plot due to their sheer power levels. While Accelerator\'s cameo was fine as it was more contained, Kanzaki\'s involvement was particularly questionable, her saintly powers allowing her to survive in outer space. It does signal how strong she is, surpassing the actions of Mikasa in Silent Party where the Space Elevator had a brief appearance. Yet, it also felt incredibly campy and broke the show\'s immersion, impressive as her display was.Overall, Endymion is a movie which strengths lie in its theme and tone. It has echoes of the same atmosphere as the Silent Party arc from Railgun S. The plot and the antagonist take more of a back seat while showcasing an upbeat thematic experience with its ensemble cast coming together. While it has much of the same weaknesses as the Index series, its strengths have also been significantly heightened. If viewed from the perspective of a standard action movie, it would be accurate to say it borders mediocre. However, that was ever only a portion of Index/Railgun\'s appeal. Missing the more thematic elements is indeed missing half the point of the movie. Capturing Index and Railgun\'s spirit, Endymion is in a similar position where a 7.5 out of 10 would be a more accurate reflection of its score. Yet it clearly surpasses its parent story, pushing itself closer to an 8. encapsulation of Index\'s spirit. As such, it does not pretend to be just another arc for adaptation in the series and would be incomplete without some liberties taken to let most of the prominent characters appear.The most apparent feature of Endymion is how conceptually and thematically robust it is, reflecting on and reinforcing the rest of the series by extension.

What mostly happens to movies(in anime).Story: 7Like I\'ve said: ""The Movie"" isn\'t connected with previous To aru installments; aside from the characters from it. And of course the somewhat-confusing lore about To Aru installmens. Well, as far as the story goes. I don\'t want to spoil you, but everyone dies on a plane crash within the first five...or six minutes of the movie... NOOOOOOOOOOOT. Just kidding. I\'m not kidding about the plane crash though(more like space shuttle crash). The plot about the movie is not that hard to catch, so I won\'t tell you anymore of it. Don\'t want to spoil you. But expect some girls, I mean lots of them. Well, Touma really has a harem, so don\'t be surprised by it. And MAL\'s synopsis on it pretty well sums up its main story. Overall, I\'m just to lazy to re-tell it. x3Art: 9ALL HAIL INDEX\'s ART!! Yes, there is no doubt about ""The Movie\'s"" art. You\'ve seen in on the previous series. But, man oh man. ""The Movie\'s"" art is really incredible. Arisa\'s(One of the main stars in ""The Movie"") dance CG\'s are so damn well done. The way the action scenes were done are so clean. Reminds us how advanced art nowadays. You can expect great art from To Aru movie. I mean, you should.Sound: 8Another thing you should look out for in the movie(If you like to listen to J-songs). The songs Arisa sang were kinda good. Sound effects were fine, I mean, what\'s there to add on a normal explosion. But the background music when something major is happening is quite great.Characters: 8To Aru Universe made a lot of unique characte; from a girl who has thousands of clones, to a guy who wears stilts but has insane powers. You can look forward to seeing the old characters from previos series. And the new characters are not half bad either, in fact I really liked them. Arisa(kinda Inori/Yuno-esque look) and Shutaura(Infinite Stratos reject character, lol jk), both of them are main characters in this movie. The story revolved around them. Of course Touma and his loli sidekick will still kick lots of ass in the movie. Oh yeah, expect a lot of cameos! I really liked Styil\'s three students.Enjoyement : 7To say that I didn\'t enjoy ""The Movie"" would be lying. I really enjoyed it. The movie really lacked a lot in some areas. Questions like how, what, when, why will pop out in your mind in no time. They could\'ve put more into it. But it\'s still enjoyable. The humor, the action-packed scenes, Touma\'s unbelievable gut to punch some potential waifus. Yes, all of it were really enjoyable.Overall : 7Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki has a lot of flaws. A good short movie. It\'s not good, but it\'s definitely not bad either. It\'ll never make the top list or any kind of great achievement other movies had, but it\'s still a good watch. The ending was pretty weak; raising questions what happens to who, and what happens the that? They can easily put a part two on it, but I highly doubt it, since this didn\'t quite pan out like what happened with the previous T.V. show. I highly recommend wathcing this if you\'ve watched the T.V. shows, if not, you\'ll have waaaaay more questions in your mind. One thing i didn\'t like about the movie was its cliché-ness. I don\'t know, maybe it\'s just me. But I seriously think there\'s a fine line between cliché and encouraging words, too much sugar can make your cake yucky. If you know what I mean.

One of the stronger points of Raildex series is a huge cast of great characters, and that's precisely what is wrong with this movie. But not because it doesn't have them. It's the opposite, they just crammed all of them into this movie even if they have no relation to the plot just as a form of fanservice.This movie wastes so much time trying to weave characters into the plot, that the actual characters that do...matter suffer because of that. Also it's pretty much required to watch at least some Index and Railgun series as it is not explained at all who these characters are, what they stand for, and why they even know each other. Even worse that newly introduced characters are given the same treatment further increasing the confusion if you should even know them or maybe you missed something.For starter we have a completely new main character but it wouldn't be an Index movie if Touma-Index duo wouldn't be included. So the main character is cast to the side and we watch the majority of the movie from perspective of Touma. Who as an unreliable narrator and dense character, he fails to properly introduce. Another character that was completely ignored was the villain, which could have been a great character if they were properly introduced and explored and not summarized in literally one sentence (which makes it impossible to explain without spoiling).Next comes the story. How do you write the story where main character and main antagonist are almost nonexistent? You stretch literally everything. It seems like a scale ot everything is huge but once you start boiling it down not much really happens. A lot of scenes were added for the sole purpose to adding yet another character and then they never mention them again. And because of a push to make everything bigger and better we never have any moment to just sit back and let any drama sink in. It's all action scenes and it becomes tiresome and boring pretty fast. Entire plot could easily fit inside a single regular episode.As for the art-style I'd say it's level with the Railgun series. Maybe with some more love added to details, like when espers use their powers, but nothing out of the place. There are however some scenes with a bad CGI mostly during complex scenes in musical numbers.Which brings me to the sound side of things. And again, for the most part it's on a level expected for the later entries of the Raildex series nothing out of the ordinary. The big point of the whole movie is that it revolves (or tries to) around music, or more precisely around songs performed by main character. This can be a problem for western audience because by themselves they hold no meaning if you don't know Japanese, and not enough time is spent to give it one outside of it. What doesn't help is that those songs are often referenced by just humming or la-la-laing them.Overall I did not enjoy it. I watched it with two friends and we were hyped to see it, but two of us have almost fallen asleep and another was too confused by what was happening to understand any of it. So I think it's safe to call it a boring mess.If you are fan of the series and are waiting for another season or maybe just want to see more of the same then maybe you'll enjoy at least some parts of it.

For me, miracle is just 1 or 2 class higher than luck, coz even luckiest person can be defeated with only one miracle, what was it called? Like Daud kill Goliath 1 hit kill with just only simple sling. I cant describe what is miracle by word, so i just make example like that.Toaru Majutsu no Index Movie : Endymion no Kiseki or i simply call it by \'The miracle of Endymion\', this movie is...original story based off Toaru Majutsu no Index series by Kazuma Kamachi. Even the story wasnt canon from the original story from index or railgun, the movie timeline take part between after Remnat arc and before daihaisesai arc. Skip the timeline detail (you can find the full information of it in wikia), there is 3 or more new character in this movie. but some of them does exist in New Testament (im not sure that they acctually made apparance or just mentioned).I am dissapointed by the movie plot, there is one or more reason that make me dissapointed :1. The movie plot is predictable2. The new original character wasnt original at all and their character is predictable.Maybe there is more things that make me dissapointed but i cant write it down, coz its hard to tell by words.It look like they take the name of Endymion from a Greek mythology, a hunter or even a king who was said to rule and live at Olympia in Elis. i dont really take this mythology seriously coz there is no connection by the Movie, oh i forgot that the main antgonist was born in Greek in 1182 and cursed to live forever (immortal). But there is more information about the antagonist character, i could tell that the antagonist character is referred to the Cumaean Sibyl of ancient Greek mythology. So i take my word before that i tell  THE MOVIE IS HAS NO CONNECTION WITH GREEK MYTHOLOGY. If you want more information about the antagonist of this movie, just check it here >>> http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Ladylee_Tangleroad.To be Honest, i hardly write a review about this movie, so i forced myself to write one. The main reason why i\'m find it difficult to write is THE NEW CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE MESSED MY MOOD TO WATCH. I tell you one of the new character that messed my mood, it was Shutaura Sequenzia. This girl give me pain in the ass.The first time before i watch the movie is just like my exictement on 100%, but after see this girl background my exictement fell to 50%. She doesnt beleive in miracle because from 89 people who survive only his family doesnt survive and no one doesnt simply give a fuck about it. To me it just unfortunate, why? Because i already feel that way, but i still believe in miracle and dont blame anyone for my unfortunateFor a fans of Index or Railgun series, the apparance of railgun protagonist (misaka mikoto, shirai kuroko, saten ruiko and uiharu kazari) in this movie calm my head down from seeing Shutaura.Some Witches make their debut on Index Franchise, but i doubt they reapparance in the main story. From the magic side to add some witcheses in the story is not bad at all, but why the original author doesnt make their debut early in the main story. There is already had SISTERS, CYBORG, MAGIC GOD, ZOMBIE, CHIMERA, and many more. But he doesnt add witches in the main story yet.Endymion is name of man from Greek Mythology, but in this movie Endymion is a gigantic space elevator.FYI : According to Uiharu Kazari, there were difficulties in constructing the elevator in Japan instead of the prescribed constructing of it in the equator. Near the end of its construction, Endymion towered at least 35,000 kilometers above the earth. Meanwhile according wikipedia, our atsmosphere only 10.845 km total above the surface. so its mark that Endymion already reach the outer space.So, you do not need a rocket to go to the outer space just use this elevator, but i wonder how much time to take from the first floor to the last floor, about 10 hours 12 hours? How about the foundation? Bulding framework? Who the hell was build this bulding? Did they use plane to make this gigantic elevator?Though this is Science fiction movie after all, so dont take this question seriously. When the last part when the Endymion about to collapse, they said the ruin of the building that fell to the earth could destroy earth....  I just like \'uhhhh,\' and then \'his brain is not responding\' said misaka as misaka try to report the condition of this piece of shit. I mean, even this is a SF genre you should never think that atsmosphere cant even burn such a little building that human creation into ashes before hit the earth. Even it does, it would doesnt give a much impact or even destroy earth. LOGIC DOESN\'T WORK ON A FICTIONAL MOVIE or something like that. Even there is saying like that, i just simply imagine there is a meteorite that fell to the earth 65 million years ago that caused the destruction of life in that time come back to this series, and then Scince side and Magic side joining their forces to stop that meteorite to not hit the earth above all else, i\'ll bet they would try their best even forced to work beyond their limit, because with just a ""little"" building that the height reach the space could destroy earth.""Earth? Like i give a shit about that."" - said Accelerator.In genre section, its write : Action, Sci-Fi, Super Power, Magic.. but i feel more than it, like fantasy and music. Huh? music? Yes, there is music in this movie, at least there is more than 3 insert song in it, im not sure how many insert song in it. All i know is just there are 3 albums (not include movie original soundtrack) that comes from this movie.This the last paragraph of my review.The only miracle that came from this movie is, the box office of this movie reach over than ¥490 million... what a successful movie.

Tokyo Ravens,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16011/Tokyo_Ravens,"['Tokyo Ravens Review:Sometimes shows come around that are completely generic and average on paper, but are unusually fun to watch. Looking at my 6 score for this show, many of you may think I didn\'t think the show was good. But this couldn\'t be further from the truth. Tokyo Ravens wasn\'t groundbreaking, memorable, or brilliant. In fact, it was pretty a pretty generic fantasy action anime with romance elements which is why I withhold too high of a score. However, Tokyo Ravens is without a doubt a very enjoyable show.Story - 7.1:Where Tokyo Ravens\' story shines isn\'t through it\'s rather generic premise or predictable...plot twists, but the solid pacing and backstories of the characters and the setting. The pacing of Tokyo Ravens is nearly flawless in my opinion, giving proper amount of air time to the intro, the time at school, and the more climactic parts at the end. The background of the setting is also very well realized and had me captivated with its mechanics. The lore of the world of Tokyo Ravens is also rich and actually significant when it comes to later events in the story. Yes, the overall story of a boy who gains powers teams up with his classmates to stop the bad guys has been told many times before, but the execution and care put into it all kept me caring from start to finish. Rarely were there moments that left me shaking my head in disappointment.Art - 6.8:For the most part, the art in this show is great.... Until they decide to use CG. The character designs are good, and the non CG action scenes are well done. Everything is fluid and the varied locations display a wide array of colors and artstyles. However, when they decide to use CG for familiars in fight scenes, things break down. Sometimes CG is done well in Anime, but for the most part it feels out of place and really cuts into your immersion as a viewer. Without the use of CG, this score would have been higher because the visuals were good.Sound - 6.3:There\'s not a whole lot to say about Tokyo Ravens in terms of the sound department. The voice acting was solid all around with a large cast of diverse voices. The OST was good and fit the show well. There weren\'t really many stand out songs however so I wouldn\'t say it was too far above average. I did enjoy the openings and endings especially the first ED. Really the sound aspect of this show was definitely good but didn\'t really stand out particularly.Characters - 6.7:Now, the characters in Tokyo Ravens are interesting for me. Because for the most part, the characters were just cookie cutter stereotypes. However, I found myself much more invested in the than I usually do for such one dimensional and predictable characters. This may just have been a personal thing, but who knows. A big plus of the cast of characters was just its pure size and variety. There was a large ensemble of good guys, bad guys, and characters that were in the Grey area of their intentions. None of the characters were necessarily weak, and a few were quite intriguing. The two main leads have a very interesting history and the interactions between characters rarely failed to be entertaining.Enjoyment - 7.5:Tokyo Ravens was without a doubt, very enjoyable to watch. It had this nostalgic kind of feeling to it and exceded all my expectations going into it. The plot twists were well placed and at times shocking, and the array of humor, drama, and action was well mixed to create an all around very enjoyable show. I personally find it hard to keep watching a show on a weekly basis for months on end unless I really care about the characters and and entertained by the events in the show, and Tokyo Ravens resoundingly delivered in those departments.Overall - 6.88:While it never really shined, Tokyo Ravens was still 100% worth the time to watch it. Keep in mind that a 6 in my books means ""good"", and if a 6.88 is any indication, this show was unquestionably good in my opinion. It isn\'t a caliber of a show that I would recommend to all, but if you are looking for an enjoyable generic action fantasy anime with romantic elements, look no further.The Verdict:A well executed anime that plays it safe, but was a pleasure to watch.Pros:+ Solid job of executing its wide array of genres (action, fantasy, romance, comedy)+ Large cast of characters (all of whom are bearable)+ Lore/BackstoryCons:- CGI poorly used- Predictable story- Failure to stand outIf you liked Tokyo Ravens, watch...Fate Stay NightStrike the Blood6.88/10 - Good plot twists, but the solid pacing and backstories of the characters and the setting. The pacing of Tokyo Ravens is nearly flawless in my opinion, giving proper amount of air time to the intro, the time at school, and the more climactic parts at the end. The background of the setting is also very well realized and had me captivated with its mechanics. The lore of the world of Tokyo Ravens is also rich and actually significant when it comes to later events in the story. Yes, the overall story of a boy who gains powers teams up with his classmates to stop the bad guys has been told many times before, but the execution and care put into it all kept me caring from start to finish. Rarely were there moments that left me shaking my head in disappointment.Art - 6.8:For the most part, the art in this show is great.... Until they decide to use CG. The character designs are good, and the non CG action scenes are well done. Everything is fluid and the varied locations display a wide array of colors and artstyles. However, when they decide to use CG for familiars in fight scenes, things break down. Sometimes CG is done well in Anime, but for the most part it feels out of place and really cuts into your immersion as a viewer. Without the use of CG, this score would have been higher because the visuals were good.Sound - 6.3:There\'s not a whole lot to say about Tokyo Ravens in terms of the sound department. The voice acting was solid all around with a large cast of diverse voices. The OST was good and fit the show well. There weren\'t really many stand out songs however so I wouldn\'t say it was too far above average. I did enjoy the openings and endings especially the first ED. Really the sound aspect of this show was definitely good but didn\'t really stand out particularly.Characters - 6.7:Now, the characters in Tokyo Ravens are interesting for me. Because for the most part, the characters were just cookie cutter stereotypes. However, I found myself much more invested in the than I usually do for such one dimensional and predictable characters. This may just have been a personal thing, but who knows. A big plus of the cast of characters was just its pure size and variety. There was a large ensemble of good guys, bad guys, and characters that were in the Grey area of their intentions. None of the characters were necessarily weak, and a few were quite intriguing. The two main leads have a very interesting history and the interactions between characters rarely failed to be entertaining.Enjoyment - 7.5:Tokyo Ravens was without a doubt, very enjoyable to watch. It had this nostalgic kind of feeling to it and exceded all my expectations going into it. The plot twists were well placed and at times shocking, and the array of humor, drama, and action was well mixed to create an all around very enjoyable show. I personally find it hard to keep watching a show on a weekly basis for months on end unless I really care about the characters and and entertained by the events in the show, and Tokyo Ravens resoundingly delivered in those departments.Overall - 6.88:While it never really shined, Tokyo Ravens was still 100% worth the time to watch it.

As it started of with a meh and ended with a YEAH, this anime was surprisingly fun to watch.As I started watching this anime, I had a feeling that the main character Harutora was going to be one of those boring mains to watch in the long run, but as I kept following the story, it became more and more interesting to follow this boring main and his friends. Taking on enemy after enemy, trying to become powerful shamans (exorcists) was only a fraction of what the...story was really focusing on.Still there are parts in the story that is halfheartedly explained, leaving you with a big question mark  as to what is really going on and why. They also seemed to overcomplicate the story, making it harder to get in ""The Zone"" when it comes to characters and scenery. Still the story has plenty of upsides to it. As it is an well though story with good plot twists and a great rhythm and backstory to it, this story leaves me in nothing but awe.The art itself were also pretty good, fitting well in with the story and providing well expressed characters when it was needed. Some part were also a bit sloppy when it came to the art, but when it came to the fighting, the art were perfectly done in a way that fits perfectly with what I am looking for in a action anime. I was easily taken by the fighting scenery and style.As far as the sound goes, I have hardly much to say. The openings and the endings of the anime provides as beginnings and endings of the anime itself, making it easy for one to get right into the anime and the fighting without as great of a shock as what Ive seen other animes do. Following the story was no problem with such an intro to it. Yet I missed that little extra in the sounds, that little extra that leaves you with the impression ""Oh, shits about to go down now"" kinda sounds/music. Still it was fairly enjoyable.As for characters I feel it could have been done a little better. The amount of history put into them, doesnt add up to the amount we are shown. I feel as if I know the teacher Ootomo better than Harutora and the rest. Even though there is given alot of history to them, I still have no clue as to what really happened when Harutora was younger or when anyone was, theres simply a lack of debts to them. I mean, isnt it weird that the story is mainly focused around this Tsuchimikado Yakou guy, and we hardly know shit about him or what happened to him when he was alive. Maybe they should have freed some room for a little backstory instead of providing us with small, unnecessary fillers.Even though I said all that, this show still provided me with a lot of enjoyment and fun, and as to the ending being an ending I prefer over any other, there was no major disappointments to this show (that i noticed). So dont do as me and put it on hold after 6 episodes, make sure to watch it trough to the end straight away so it doesnt get confusing. I highly recommend this anime to all you out there who hasnt watched it, and lets all pray for a Season 2 :) story was really focusing on.Still there are parts in the story that is halfheartedly explained, leaving you with a big question mark  as to what is really going on and why.

The originality wasn't so bad like 'I've seen it a million times' sort of deal, but It was interesting enough to make me want to watch the next episode. The characters seemed overdone and over the top, opening with the feisty chick friend of the male protagonist picking on him and his...cool and calm best friend. Even if it started out quite cliche, I still kept watching it, mostly for lack of other anime to watch.It was worth it because this show had a lot more depth than meets the eye and gets better as it moves along.For people who enjoy magic fantasy action anime, you will probably like this as it has a nice mix of all of those genres with interesting plot twists.Though most characters remain stagnant throughout the anime, at least half of them have some sort of basic development, be it mind set, or physical ability. What bothered me the most about this anime's characters though is how most characters pick on the main protagonist. The anime already outlines him as 'dumb' and 'having a major lack of talent' so much so you wonder why he's even the main character . His interactions with other characters tend to end or start out with them calling him 'baka-tora', and describing how pathetic he really is. Even though he proves himself more than once to the gang, they still proceed to stick with that nick name. As usual, he is a typical shounen character that tries his best, despite his obvious lack in talent. The anime later drops these undertones though, making it A LOT more enjoyable.The music I found to be quite nice, the opening and ending were okay, not bad but not my favorite anime openings. The music during the anime is very nice, giving it a nice sorta mystic aura, adding a lot more epicness to the show. Without the music, I swear the scenes would feel a lot less intense.The story itself is a nice mix of magic and action, though it might not be the most original story ever written. Its enjoyable enough to keep watching. It may not be one of your favorite animes, but if you watched all the anime there is and happen to come across Tokyo Raven's, its pretty good, and you'll like it better towards the end so i recommend not judging it until you get at least half way.Even though I wouldn't consider it my favorite show, I did enjoy watching it. Its not one of my most memorable animes, but you definitely wont be wasting time. cool and calm best friend.

In Tokyo Ravens, this doesn’t apply as onmyouji magic is accepted by society as a form of dealing with spirits and apparitions in general. The show builds itself with the basic concepts and principles of a modern fantasy involving characters dealing with onmyouji, otherworldy beings that have been causing trouble in Japan. While most anime involving magic is forbidden, Tokyo Ravens takes the liberty to accept it as a form of art. Thus begins the adventurous tale of Harutora Tsuchimikado as he learns the truth about the world he lives in.Tokyo...Ravens is an animated series based off the light novels of the same name written by Kohei Azano. It’s easy to notice quickly that the show is colored with modern fantasy themes such as the shrines and stylistic clothes that our characters wear. There’s also no doubt that the show has potential with its concepts. But what’s more important is the execution. After all, Harutora is labeled more as babyface with little skill in onmyouji magic. He has potential and Tokyo Ravens explores it in various aspects. What Tokyo Ravens went wrong in this part is its execution that becomes blend and sometimes insufferable. But despite this, the show itself does handle its structural set up in a tolerable fashion with credibility.Take the series’s story as a modern fantasy with the magic, curses, and spells in an all-you-can-eat buffet. There’s no special appetizer because everything is conventional and expected in terms of its general set up. The first few episodes establishes the premise and delivers itself in its traditional fashion. We meet Harutora and his friends whom doesn’t seem so different from folks you see from our society. However, realize there are abnormal beings that exists in their world. There’s a lot of information to absorb in the beginning, in ways that seems to cloud the story until we meet some antagonists. It also becomes more and more clichéd with the characters involving a typical childhood friend named Natsume that comes to visit, the flashy fireworks in the sky with a misunderstanding, and mecha-like gadgets popping out as adversaries because they look flashy and demonstrates a lethal presentation of modern fantasy. While all is fine when presented in the right fashion, Tokyo Ravens introduces everything together all at once that feels rushed. More than that, there’s also predictable plot twists that at times becomes bizarre and lands nowhere with Harutora’s characterization.Speaking of characters, there’s quite the diversity. Thankfully, none of them sits in the background but instead get their spotlights, some even more so than our main protagonist. Still, that isn’t exactly a gift to accept so easily because Tokyo Ravens only develops them on a substantial level. Natsume for instance never really changes with her time on the show. She is portrayed as an innocent girl who is willing to protect others. There’s obvious affections coming from her towards Harutora despite the latter being oblivious to her some of her words and advances. To make matters worse, most of the school they attend are under the belief that she is a guy. This is where the silliness comes into play with their “yaoi relationship”. As quirky as it sounds, the series actually doesn’t hide this as they play on this trope many times with almost the entire female student body believing it as reality.Other characters in the series serves as the support for Harutora’s development but most of them are more like friends to him rather than a coach. They offer him advice, training sessions, and details to unlock his potential. Unfortunately, Harutora is presented as an irrational man when it comes to textbooks and learning. He even earned the nickname ‘Bakatora’ which is a played as a joke as baka translates to ‘idiot’ by Japanese standards. At the same time, we do witness Harutora become stronger through experiences and determination to protect others. There’s a sense of hope when he really puts effort or when the people close to him are in danger. It’s there that we see Harutora shines by moments of his selflessness. Other times though, Harutora is hard to get attached to for his abilities and dull personality.The series itself also follows sequential arc style in presenting stories and characters. Like I mentioned previously, almost every main character gets their spotlight whether you’re former delinquent (Tojo), the youngest of the Twelve Generals (Suzuka), a shikigami (Kon), or heir of a famous family (Kyoko). Speaking of the Twelve Generals, the series presents themselves as a testimony of strength. Each of them possesses their own unique abilities that makes them both fear and respected. Unfortunately, because the show itself focuses on more of the main characters, they lose focus and only gets their chance to shine when the action calls for it. The action itself also can be a mixed bag. The usage of CGI and magic at the same time is certainly an odd mix. It almost feels like the show is running on an engine with a different set of gears. However, the show does well with its mechanics in terms of explanation. Every episode contains a little bit of explaining whether it’s the backgrounds or just in general of what’s there. Various terminologies such as onmyouji, shikigami, as well as events are usually easily understandable with attention. Furthermore, the term raven is symbolic for death (foreshadowing in the beginning) and matches perfectly with its presentation of magic linked to Shamanism. It could also be something refreshing to watch as it sometimes brings that fantasy taste in a way you might not get used to.What really makes Tokyo Ravens hard to get used though might be the asinine comedy that tends to be an overused way of delivery. This includes but not limited to Harutora being an accidental pervert, Suzuka’s fake relationship with Harutora, and Kon’s obsessiveness with her master. It also uses cheesy lines with little favor that often lacks sense. Natsume’s cross-dressing makes her a subject of attraction for girls at the academy they attend. It spells out laughter in the wrong way because the misunderstandings should be so obvious. Really, does Natsume look that much like a guy with her fragile face and long hair? Some of the characters’ personalities are also hard to figure out such as Suzuka and her manipulative actions. Kon’s personality changes almost every episode according to what circumstance she is and whom she is with. Tenma, a classmate of Harutora, also seems to be in the background most of the time and plays almost no significant role. While the show doesn’t explicitly present fan service or the typical beach episode, Tokyo Ravens still reveals more skin than it should thanks to mostly Harutora’s stupidity.Artwork remains standard on most parts for Tokyo Ravens. It is noticeable that 8bit is also in charge of producing both Infinite Stratos 2 and Walkure Romanze at the same while this show is also airing. But for judging its animation, Tokyo Ravens does it well only in terms of credibility. Supernatural familiars are believable with their designs while backgrounds reflects the modern fantasy style that it should be. Unfortunately, most of the characters stands out as blend. Kon is perhaps the most noticeable character because of her animalistic features. Suzuka on the other hand has bits of fan service in her design while Natsume’s cross-dressing literally covers almost every inch of her body besides her face. The strange usage of CGI will take time to get accustomed to. At several times, I almost thought this had mecha-esque concepts.Soundtrack wise, Tokyo Ravens surprisingly works out well. While Harutora’s voice is nothing special, there’s something noticeable about its OST with the way that fuses fantasy elements with reality. Not only that but the OP song “X-encounter” by Maon Kurosaki had an intense beat with bits of foreshadowing. Most of the characters’ voices also fits well that matches each scene. In later episodes, some of the characters’ voices also convey emotions well through their dialogues that almost seems realistic despite the show having fantasy elements.Tokyo Ravens is nowhere close to a masterpiece but neither is it an abomination. I guess in most ways, it takes time to get used to for its style of fantasy. The series offers a diverse cast of characters that the audience might favor. Unfortunately, their personalities are hard to describe and their characterization are limited. The story itself also takes time to get used to with every arc that has some sort of message or morality. Whether you get that message might feel different for everyone. For me though, Tokyo Ravens is just another standard series of modern fantasy that depicts the life of young man with much to learn.

It doesn't really look like anything new, innovative, or fresh. Despite its generic appearance Tokyo Ravens still manages to do what it's supposed to: entertain.As far as story goes, there really isn't much of an intricate, deep, or immersive plot. The story is pretty sub par for a good amount of the first half, adhering to countless generic cliches like the childhood friend promise, amnesia, and what have you. Although it gets better during the second half, it's still not anything amazing. The key aspects that make the second half...take flight and become more enjoyable to watch is that there are actually Onmyo spell battles, familiar battles, the plot finally breaks out of its run-of-the-mill school life trope, and the concept of the shaman society is fleshed out a bit more. With all of that being said, it's awfully apparent that the adaption of Tokyo Ravens from the light novel to the animation is fairly bad. There are countless instances where moments, events, and key turning points in the story felt extremely underdeveloped, unexplained, rushed, or skipped over.The art and animation of Tokyo Ravens seemed pretty average, if not below average, in most cases. Most animes nowadays at least bring decent art and animation to the table, but that doesn't appear to be the case with Tokyo Ravens. The art isn't all that great and animations can feel stiff at times. Overall, the art and animation felt a bit behind the times in comparison to many of its visual contemporaries. The sound criteria was fairly average. There's nothing that stands out, but it's not bad.I think it's become pretty standard in anime for the male MC to be a fool and dense for a majority of the series. Unfortunately for the audience, Tokyo Ravens falls victim to this generalized male lead personality. Harutora, along with most of the other characters, are extremely generic and cliche. If you've watched a good handful of anime you can recognize most of the character tropes that are used here. Childhood friend blossoms into friendship(s) after many years? Preposterous. There are a few interesting characters amongst the Divine Generals, but they get far too little screen time to make much of an impact. There isn't much character development and most of the characters retain their original personalities throughout the series. Supporting characters often felt more interesting and almost as equally developed as main characters and that's saying a lot.Although there are many aspects about Tokyo Ravens that are extremely ordinary and plain, it still did a fair job of at least keeping me entertained.

Supporting characters often felt more interesting and almost as equally developed as main characters and that's saying a lot.Although there are many aspects about Tokyo Ravens that are extremely ordinary and plain, it still did a fair job of at least keeping me entertained. There are certain instances when watching average is entertaining. This is one of those times."", 'I generally try to have an open mind when it comes to anime, and when I start a new series I attempt to take as few preconceptions into it as possible. That said, when I started Tokyo Ravens I had already pretty much given up on it. The promotional artwork and brief synopsis I read, while somewhat interesting, gave me the vague impression of a mediocre anime with throwaway characters and a wasted chance at a good plot. I write this review in an attempt to dispel those misconceptions in anyone else.Tokyo Ravens, an anime with a plot initially not too unfamiliar involving magic users...in modern-day Japan, starts off rather slowly and doesn\'t promise much. However, after just a few episodes, the tempo changes rapidly and soon a well-thought-out, refreshingly unique story begins to develop. What originally seems like a straightforward plot becomes increasingly deep, with enough twists to keep you wondering from one episode to the next who\'s really the good guy. Add to that a major plot twist that completely changes the direction of the show, and you get a very satisfying, entertaining story.The art was really the only slightly detracting feature of the show for me, as it was close to being sub-par, but at times where it really mattered the animation was good enough to not take away from the drama of the moment. Both the voice acting and the soundtrack were done well, the latter having moments where it went from being sufficient to excellent, and the over-all delivery was handled very well.Now to address my favorite aspect of the show: the side characters. Something that consistently annoys me about many anime is the one-dimensional supporting characters that are often present. Whether they\'re there to simply fill the stereotypical niches, to be killed off for the sake of adding drama, or whatever role they\'re given, side characters in many anime are simply unnecessary. Their lack of presence, importance, and screen time makes them feel hollow when compared to the main character/characters. Tokyo Ravens, however, had a well-rounded cast of supporting characters that actually played important roles in the story, and had distinct personalities tempered by whatever problems they had/things they had experienced. Beyond the main character\'s ""party"", the other characters in the series felt very real in the way they were presented. Rather than trying to include a ton of other characters and explain their every facet, they were presented at face value. Many of their motivations/convictions remained unclear, which, realistically, would be the case in a conflict on the scale of the one in Tokyo Ravens. Every character in the series felt like they weren\'t written into the story to make some specific part of it move forward, but were first and foremost members of Tokyo Raven\'s universe who participated in the story on an equal level with the characters who got more screen-time. That gave the series a very realistic feel to me, something I don\'t often get in comparable anime.Overall I would say that Tokyo Ravens is a good, well-written anime that may be overlooked by many people (such as myself) that would think it\'s just another harem-ish shounen. I would recommend giving it try, and letting it prove or disprove that preconception itself. in modern-day Japan, starts off rather slowly and doesn\'t promise much.

But, there were times whereby you would feel it's rushed in some episodes. I personally feel that some instances of the show might not have been explained properly. (I looked it up the forum to see what actually happened as some people read the light novel and kindly explained it in the forum.)I personally like the art, animation of the characters and especially the...fights, pretty well-defined and impactful.The sounds for the show were pretty decent. The openings were pretty impactful and the endings simply give a soothing yet slow feel which I liked it.As for the characters, this would be one of the points where I feel it brings down the score just a tad bit. The main character, Hakutora, isn't very perceptive at the start which I would say was his flaw.Secondly, I personally feel Toji started off well in the series but I feel and would have liked if he could be given more attention to make him a stronger supporting character due to his past, having gone through a painful experience.I personally felt that Othomo gave the biggest impact to how the story transitioned and flowed and how he stuck to people who he wished to protect. Last point, There were also a few occurences whereby I felt the internal monologues or thinking processes of some charaters were not expressed properly.I enjoyed the show overall, to be honest, the fights hype things up, the story keeps me hanging on what's going to happen next. fights, pretty well-defined and impactful.The sounds for the show were pretty decent.

Tokyo Ravens is about shamanism infused in the modern world. This show is apparently average at best but it did not fail to entertain me. In the end, I really enjoyed it.Tokyo Ravens has no major problems in the story but its exposition sometimes is tedious. First half can be lacking in actual story and action but it was justified by the second half. The characters are created well but development seems rushed sometimes. Drama in Tokyo Ravens is basically the story’s weakest point. A good example of this is when Tenma was guilty in the Douman...arc, where he was blaming himself for letting Douman invade the school but after a minute or two, he was not guilty anymore. The drama is too unbalanced and too rushed to earn the emotional weight Tenma feels. The visuals and animation are fine but the CGI can be sometimes cringe-worthy. Music is nice but nothing specialOverall, Tokyo Ravens is enjoyable and entertaining but it isn’t ambitious enough to put a higher score arc, where he was blaming himself for letting Douman invade the school but after a minute or two, he was not guilty anymore. The drama is too unbalanced and too rushed to earn the emotional weight Tenma feels. The visuals and animation are fine but the CGI can be sometimes cringe-worthy. Music is nice but nothing specialOverall, Tokyo Ravens is enjoyable and entertaining but it isn’t ambitious enough to put a higher score', ""When I first heard of Tokyo Ravens from my friend, I was like OMG! I'm so going to watch it. But then, my expectations of this show died as the series progress. I was practically lost and confused as the series moved along which is something I don't like. Tokyo Ravens is not bad, but it's not good either. It is mediocre at best.Story: 5/10This show is about a teenage guy named Harutora who can't see spiritual spirits like his family. Then he met his childhood friend and the Onmyoji drama starts from there. Afterwards he moved to Tokyo and attended a school...to hone his Onmyoji skills. This where the plot started to fall apart. During the few episodes of the series, it started off with action, explosion, and magic. However, instead of continuing the action, the plot decided to throw a long laid back school life series. It's a nice touch to show their school life and how normal teenagers interact but there's too much. Most of it doesn't push the story forward. It is just there to create humor and well, meaningless dragging of the series.Then here comes the part where I want to smack my head against the wall. Tokyo Ravens has a lot of CONFUSION/PLOT HOLES. When watching this series, I keep having questions in my head. What happen to Natsume? What are phases? What's Suzu's purpose? How can you conjure up spiritual disasters? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME?! *sigh* I think the producers needs to execute this series better...However, there are good points as well. The action and fight scenes were well done. The positioning of the romance is also well done. They kept me slightly interested towards the end.And speaking of the end, the ending of Tokyo Ravens is unsatisfying. It is like they drop another big plot hole on top of the old one without fixing it.Art: 10/10Despite the mediocre and confusing plot, the art in Tokyo Ravens is AMAZING. The colors and brightness are so beautiful. Even though there are some *cough* problematic CGIs, I'm not the type of person to judge the quality of it. All CGIs to me look the same so yeah...Overall the art in Tokyo Ravens is beautiful. Period.Sound: 9/10I really like the first opening of Tokyo Ravens. It brings out the hidden darkness of the series. The song also fits with the ongoing action. The second opening is a little bland for me. It doesn't really bring out the darkness of the series anymore. Instead, it beings out well, action/adventure.Character: 6/10Oh boy. Here comes my rant.The problem with the characters that there are WAY TOO MANY! There's too many characters to keep up with. If there's too many characters, it leaves little room for the other characters to shine *cough* main character Harutora *cough*. It also left me the impression of what the hell is his or her purpose in this story. Then there's one part of the show where they introduced this side character but he didn't appear for like ten episodes but then appeared during the end, claiming that he has an important role to serve. I completely forgot his name and who he is. This shows that they should lessen the characters or give them enough screen time in order to make them more memorable.Then as for the main cast, I feel like their action in this story is minimal. Harutora has not taken action until towards the end of the story, which is kind of sad. Heck, even the side characters does more actions than him. The side characters help move the plot along until it's time for Harutora to shine. However, the other main characters serve their purpose in this story well. They played their part in the right time and place. But, there's little character development form them.Enjoyment: 7/10Despite all those negative comments I said about this series, I actually enjoyed it till the end. The humor made me laugh a couple of times and the fight scenes were spectacular. If only the series explain all those plot holes and give some spotlights to some characters, then it will be even more enjoyable.Overall: 7/10Tokyo Ravens has its ups and downs, but it is an enjoyable show. It's just that the confusion and plot holes kill the show for me. I feel like this show needs a season two to explain all those unanswered questions. But that's all in the near future. So if you're a person who is indifferent to plot holes and likes a story about magic, Onmyojis, and romance, then this is a show for you. to hone his Onmyoji skills.

If going into it with really high expectations, it can end up being way more disappointing! If you go into it with really low expectations, you might even end up enjoying it! I personally always try to watch with an open mind and try to not get hyped for a show too much so I can still enjoy it! For this particular show though, it is the exact opposite of my example earlier! This show did not end up being way worse than I had expected but the other way around! Ladies and...Gentlemen, today\'s topic shall be the Underdog of the Spring and Fall Season, Tokyo Ravens!Story:The story of Tokyo Ravens takes place in an alternate universe, that is rather similar to ours, except for the fact that there exist spirits and familiars. In this world there also exist Exorcists, who learn how to handle those spirits. They learn to summon them, exorcise them and even how to fight using them, for the sake of preventing a spiritual disaster. The main character is Tsuchimikado Harutora, a teenage boy that is part of the branch family of one of the most popular Onmiyou-Exorcist families in Japan. However, other than most others in his families, Harutora is not able to see Spiritual Power and thus can\'t become an Onmiyou-Exorcist like most others he knows. That\'s why he has lived a rather quite life up until now, simply hanging out with his friends Hokuto and Touji. That is, until he meets his old childhood friend from the main family, Tsuchimikado Natsume!The Setting for Tokyo Ravens is rather interesting and even though this kind of supernatural thing is not really uncommon anymore, I do really enjoy those kind of shows! What Tokyo Ravens does really well is taking what it is given and turning it into something good! The show is really good at world building! Almost too good I would like to say...While the world is really well explained and it\'s potential is used really well, that has a certain price attached to it! The show takes way too much time fleshing out the world, that it could have spent on it\'s characters or bringing it\'s story forward. Of course this is not necessarily a bad thing, as this makes the second half even more enjoyable due to the really well explained world, but the first half falls flat due to this! The characters are uninteresting, the pacing is all over the place while it is still enjoyable, the first half of the show is mediocre at best. However the show does pick up quite nicely around half of the show! With the first really big fight starting, the show finally shows it\'s scale and just how badass it can be! From there on it seems as if I was watching a completely different show, as basically all the pacing problems get solved, the viewer is finally able to really get attached to the characters and the plot twists have a lot more impact that they used to have! Tokyo Ravens second half was one of the most surprising things that happened to me in this winter season and it even included one of the best episodes of this entire season! It got me surprisingly emotional, something that I wouldn\'t have expected from this show as well! However there is one thing that I am not completely content with and that would be the ending! The ending for Tokyo Ravens itself was rather good and did leave a lasting impression, however it did not quite end the way I wanted it to end! The ending doesn\'t really give any sense of closure and since there is only 10 Light Novels as of now, of which 9 got adapted in this TV Anime, there probably won\'t be any more too soon! However hope dies last and maybe we will end up having a second season at some point in time...Characters:The Characters for Tokyo Ravens mostly suffer from the same problem that I mentioned in the story, the first half! The characters I would argue, while still being the best part of the first half, aren\'t really well fleshed out! While the interactions are quite well written and I have to say that the more quite Slice of Life moments of the show definitely were my favourite parts of the beginning episodes, the characters don\'t seem to develop at all! It kind of plays out like Index, just not as bad!Harutora at first is your generic Light Novel Main protagonist, that stands up for his friends and doesn\'t have much of a personality except that, but just as the story, Harutora\'s character gets a lot better halfway through the series. While I can\'t really reveal too much about that, due to spoilers, all I can say is that his character got a lot more conflicted later on. The second character to talk about is Tsuchimikado Natsume. She is the daughter of the Tsuchimikado Main family and as such has to go to the Onmiyouji-Acadamy in Tokyo, meaning she lives far away from her home. She also happens to be Harutora\'s Childhood friend and also due to the family’s tradition has to go to school pretending to be male. She is a rather quite character at first, but soon turns out to be pretty strong herself as she is really good at judging a situation and acting in the appropriate way. If I were to go over the rest of the characters in detail now, this Review would probably just take way too long, so let me just say really quick, that most of the characters are rather interesting to watch. They may neither be the most original characters of all time, nor the most well written, but the show certainly has a good enough cast to be enjoyable! The only other thing that kind of bothers me, is that while the Slice of Life character interactions seem to be really interesting at first, they get a little more generic later on. That may be caused by the show not really having that many Slice of Life moments anymore, but it still is something that bothers me. The longer you watch the Anime the easier it is to get attached to everyone. The Anime also has a huge cast of Side characters, that are all somewhat interesting and that I would love to see more about. However the Size of the cast itself prohibits the Anime from digging deeper into them. All in all the characters are flawed but likeable. It doesn\'t make the show a lot worse, but they don\'t really do a lot to make it better either.Sound:With the OST being done by Maiko Iuchi, the same person that did the Soundtrack to shows like Railgun, the OST was sure to be somewhat good. While it was not a masterpiece and nothing I would listen to outside of the show, it perfectly fit the show it was attached to. It mostly consists of quiet Piano and Violin pieces, mixed with some rather intense fighting themes. My personal favourite at this point is the track ""Dairenji Suzuka"", which plays every time Suzuka gets on screen in the early stages of the show, as the music makes her entrance really badass and fits her attitude perfectly!For the Openings, both are rather good. Same as with the OST, they are not absolutely amazing and unskippable, but they set the tone for the show quiet nicely. While most people like the first Opening better, I personally do enjoy the second one just as much and honestly couldn\'t decide which one of the two were better. However, the animation for Opening Number 1 is a lot more interesting and the Direction does look a lot better! That said, the second one by no means looks bad, the first one just looks better! For the endings it basically is the same, while I did not like the first ending as much, the second ending ended up being my favourite song of the show!Animation:Tokyo Ravens has been produced by 8bit, the same company that also did Infinite Stratos and Aquarion Evol and has been directed by Takaoki Kamasaki, the director of ""Is this a Zombie?"". The Animation for the show is average at best. It\'s not really fluent and doesn\'t really have anything eyecatching about it. It is not abysmal, but it certainly is not good! I feel like the bad animation kind of makes the show a little less badass than it should have been and it really does not do a good job at complimenting the show! Another huge fault with the Animation of this show, is the CGI. It looks really out of place and honestly is some of the worst I have seen in quite a while. It is mostly used for some of the familiars and it really is painfully obvious.Tokyo Ravens has been the Underdog of the season and by far the most surprising one to me in a while! The show has a good amount of action, likeable characters and a well paced story. In the second half that is! The show has huge problems at the beginning, but does solve them halfway through it\'s run. It may start off as a rather boring show, but the later parts are definitely worth standing through the first episodes! I would definitely recommend it to basically anyone that is into Supernatural and Fantasy Anime.

I would definitely recommend it to basically anyone that is into Supernatural and Fantasy Anime.', ""*This Review Contains Spoilers*Well then, that was a bitter sweet ending, so the anime has ended and quite frankly, I was part ecstatic but also part dissapointed as to how this 24 anime has come about, so I'm just gonna get down to the point, ORDER!!!!!Story and enjoyment: Good 7.Ok, it might be just your typical good vs evil run of the mill plot, where magic was involved. But unlike the typical run of the mill kinda thing, this has has romance that involves an incest where it was among cousins and it has a lot of suspenses as to how each climax comes about...pertaining to the spiritual disasters kind of scenario. However, the whole plot was all about Harutora and Natsume.....well, it maybe overhyped, but then again seeing Natsume's dedication towards Harutora basically makes this story plot good.......enough, to be enjoyed ORDER!!!!!Art and  character: Fair 6.Ok, at first I don't understand as to why Natsume has to dress up like a guy in school, until it was reveled as to why. But pertaining to the school uniform and the divine generals attire....well, let's discuss the school uniform, it was too fancy to say the least, but it so cool on Kyouko, the guys school uniform, eeeeh its just too late 60's retro to say the least, but it looks good on Toji. Now I gave it such rating because despite of the fanciness, it kinda looks good on some of the character's. Natsume, on the other hand, makes her hair a give away that she is a girl despite of being in s boy's uniform, however in this anime, the characters role has it to over look it, which I have to say make's it rather stupid. About the adults in this anime....well pretty typical of them to be in business attire, but I'd never understand as to why Kon has to be this chibi familiar when she could have sport an adult look, there also the divine general Reji, that at one point I could have forgiven if he stayed on as a dark protagonist, but since there is the part where he has to be the antagonist makes me wish that he should have died. Now, I gave this anime's art and character such score was because at one point one would have like them, but in another point one would also despises them as well, especially when the antagonist whom we thought where the good guys are actually the ones who wanted to revived the Yukon inside of Harutora. As to Harutora, he does play as a typical oblivious guy at one point, but then he becomes this mature guy in the end and I kinda hate to see that we won't probably see as to what is next , now that the Yukon inside of him has awaken, well probably in the manga we will see, but I'm yet to get started on it, ORDER!!!!!!!!Sound: Decent 4.No comment for this part, ORDER!!!!!!Overall: Poor 3.Because we were left with a bitter sweet ending where the so called Taizan Fukun Ritual was able to be performed by Harutora on Natsume, but it was only half successful and something sort of whatsoever happened to Harutora where I wish I know what the fuck it is, so overall what we have is a glass that it either half full and half empty kinda of thing where I went for the half empty part.

DISORDER!!!!!!!!!"", 'Ah, surprises. Don\'t we all love them? Whether good or bad, they always add something in our life - something that spices it up and moves it out of the monotone stillness we are ever so used to.Good surprises are common, and usually with very little significance attached to them. However, a slight surprise can put a smile on your face and leave you in awe of our large world.When I first started watching this series, I expected a typical shouen that would keep me entertained for a while. I really liked the magic system present in this show, along with its impeccable execution....This is why I kept watching, despite lowering my rating to 6/10 during the first half, and dismissing it as your average shouen, with no real content or anything memorable...This however, slowly changed during the second half. Things started to pick up their pace quickly and kept me watching, sitting on the edge of my seat. The second half of this show saved it, and made it worth the watch in every way possible. This show let me enjoy myself in a way I haven\'t for a long time now, and I can reassuringly say that it was one of the best ""feeling packed"" shows I\'ve ever watched.Read on to see my views on the characters, sound, animation, story and the overall ""feel"" of this show.STORY: 7/10Firstly, the story of this show is nothing spectacular. In essence, it is about a person who is supposed to be the incarnation of a military prodigy - nothing new, and it has been done before.However, the way it is executed in the show makes for a feeling packed ride that is very memorable. It\'s hard to say more without spoiling so I\'ll just end my opinion with this:""A slightly generic story turned interesting and further redeemed by avoidance of typical shouen moments.""Now that the story is out of the way, I\'m free to elaborate freely on every other aspect of the show without worrying about spoilers :)ART: 9/10The art in this show was nothing short of amazing. The character designs felt fresh and fit the characters\' personalities perfectly.Apart from this, the effect design for the various spells used by the characters were literally spot on. From the growing roots, to the raging fire and instantaneous flowing rivers, the mood and feel of the spells was completely captured and portrayed to the viewers perfectly.You would never look at the screen and say to yourself ""wow, for talking so much that sure is a weak looking spell"". Even the simple ""paper"" spells seem to be executed well, it\'s as if the ""paper"" is given command and as a living being is executing it.The use of CG might be off-turning for people, but I personally didn\'t mind it. The only use of CG was for animating Machine - like beings, which fit perfectly well. Similarly to how Berserker was incorporated in to Fate/zero, the CG doesn\'t make you feel like anything is out of place.Personally, watching traditionally animated robots is a bit weird to me, as no matter how hard you try it\'s near impossible to achieve the feeling of machinery without putting too much time in to it.One more thing I feel obliged to mention, is the backgrounds. They were absolutely BREATHTAKING and I would even compare them to kara no kyoukai. There was absolutely no scene with a dull background with a deficiency of details... My eyes always had places to look at to notice all of the details and, honestly, it was a pleasure to look at.SOUND: 10+This is largely personal preference, but the sound completely captivated me. I always felt as if the sound fit the scenes perfectly, from the abstract whistling sound when Suzuka first appeared to the catchy poprock-esque themes present in the battles.Sometimes there was pure silence, and it was appropriate for the situation.The voice actors did a great job imo, and the voices never felt out of place. This added to my immersion in the show and helped me relate to the characters in many ways. The only voice that slightly bothered me was the voice of Kyouko\'s father, but that\'s a minor ""flaw"" based purely on taste.The openings gave you a decent taste of the show, and the endings did well to close off the feeling packed rides and get you excited for the future events.As I\'m writing this, I\'m listening to various tracks from the show and I\'m enjoying them fully! ^_^CHARACTERS: 9/10This show had a fairly large cast of characters, and even if all of them weren\'t fully developed, they still had their progression and enough time to shine.To add on to this, none of the characters fit a certain stereotype and no character was annoying, irritating or just plain out badly written. In essence what I\'m trying to say is that all the characters were bearable and worked as a whole really, really well.A few honorable mentions I personally really liked were:Our main character, your typical shouen hot head (kind of) who developed so much, even before the miraculous ""power up"". Also, he had a high level of maturity which is nowhere to be seen in your usual shouen main character.The homeroom teacher, though I can\'t explain why due to spoilers.Kyouko, for being a mature friend and her adult like behaviour in the (emotionally) intense situations and times where a typical character would\'ve just cried dramatically.Natsume, for trying her hardest and her bravery. Also what I said about Kyouko.Suzuka, for her gradual development and evolution in to a normal girl...I really could mention so many here since all of them (well, with SOME exceptions) were special in their own way, kudos to the writer for coming up with these characters and designing them in a realistic way without slapping a bunch of stereotypes on to them.ENJOYMENT: 10/10I\'m not going to lie, I enjoyed this anime much, much more than I thought I would and I feel confident enough to recommend it to anyone reading this review!This anime just made me feel excited, didn\'t leave me sad or mad about certain parts of the ending, didn\'t leave a bittersweet taste in my mouth and never made me facepalm at certain events.I laughed, I felt sad for characters at times, felt happy for them at other times and was cheering and watching in awe as the show unraveled.I truly had fun watching it, and simply because of this reason I believe it to be a gem in the rough that needs to be discovered by everyone out there!OVERALL: 8/10As much as I loved this anime, it pains me to say that it had a fair share of flaws, mostly present in the first half... The critic in me (assuming I went out and pointed out every little flaw and didn\'t factory enjoyment and immersion whatsoever) would say the score of this show is hovering around 6.5/10, however factoring in the fun and enjoyment, the lovable cast, the amazing art and music.. I feel as it\'s deserving of a 9/10.Despite my mixed feelings on this, I\'ve decided it\'s a safe bet to rate the show as 8/10 which I figure most people can agree on.It\'s not a masterpiece, it\'s not a one of a kind show... but it\'s good and nobody can deny that. It\'s simply that, good and there is no other way for me to explain it.I don\'t know what to recommend to you if you liked this show, apart from maybe Kara no Kyoukai or Fate/Zero due to the similar approach to the magic systems.If you\'re a fan of the music of this show, I\'d point you towards the To Aru series.I believe no other show really manages to achieve the ""feel"" of this show, which is why I can\'t truly recommend something.FINAL VERDICT:If you don\'t watch this show, you won\'t be missing out on the masterpiece of the year. You will be, however, missing out on a lot of potential fun that might just brighten up your day.

I don\'t know why but I always dreamed of having some cool powers, being able to cast spells etc. That\'s the reason I, for instance, love Harry Potter, Avatar, I used to love Winx, and now I came across an awesome anime that is also about magic. This time, as promised, I have for you Tokyo Ravens.Plot and StorylineIn the beginning of this story we have the main character Harutora, a boy born in the prestigious Onmyoji (Magic) family Tsuchimikado. Although born in such a family he still isn\'t able to see ""spirit...energy"", meaning he is not able to use magic. Or he wasn\'t able until he met his childhood friend Natsume, who is also the heir to the main Tsuchimikado family. After the accident with one of the Twelve Divine Generals (first class Onmyoji) Harutora decides to become Natsume\'s familiar (protector).*(Just as a little add, the Twelve Divine or Heavenly Generals exist in the Japanese belief as the protectors of the Medicine Buddha).* He becomes able to see spirit energy, and shortly after that enrolls the Onmyo Prep School. In the now ""new world"" for Harutora, everybody is speaking about Natsume being the reincarnation of Yakou Tsuchimikado, a genius Onmyoji who is told to be The Father of Modern Onmyoudo. But is she really the reincarnation? Hmmm...The storyline of this anime is great. You have the slowly (yet not too slow) developing story whose peaces are placed one by one, like a puzzle, until you get the whole picture. I have to say, after the 14th episode I was scared that they will just ruin the rest with the episodes to come, but they did not. The opposite actually happened. The story became more and more interesting and it kept me on tenterhooks until the very end. A couple of plot twists also contributed to the show, leaving actually no plot holes at all.The mix of magic and action fights also did they bit in this show.And finally an anime that has a finished love story. It didn\'t left me with the stupid thoughts: ""Will they be together"", ""Will he tell her how he actually feels about her"" etc. I hate unfinished stories in anime which don\'t have a second season. Make an OVA at least, that would make me really happy.And while talking about second seasons, this anime really deserves one. It did leave some open questions and a movie or another 12 episodes would be great. I could read the finished novel, but I am too lazy to read something. School is coming after all.Anyways, Tokyo Ravens is a catchy, awesome and in some parts very emotional story that is worth every single second of watching. There are not much anime which have a great story that is not ruined in one or the other way. And even if the beginning seems a bit like there is no progress, be patient. The best is yet to come.Characters:What a crazy bunch of personalities we have here. We have the cool guy, the stupid one, some prodigies, a girly, a shy boy, an awesome teacher, a cute familiar...This anime really has awesome characters, and I could talk about them the whole day, but the main two will also do good. Ladies first...Tsuchimikado Natsume is a prodigy onmyoji and as said before the heir to the main family. Don\'t be confused, she will just pretend to be a boy in most of the show. She is a very caring person and she takes her obligations as the heir very seriously. She proves that there is no success without hard work and sacrifice.  An awesome and interesting character, Natusme-san.Just as everybody in the anime says : ""Baka-Tora"" or ""Stupid Tora"". Harutora Tushimikado is really what the world calls stupid. It takes some time before he understands some things. What I like about his personality is that he\'s not afraid to take some risks. And also he wasn\'t very confident in the beginning , but because he knew that learning magic is the only way to save the people he loves, he didn\'t give up.  A very funny and determine main character, with some flaws that actually just made him so unique as he is.AnimationWell there is no much to talk about the animation. It is good just like in other anime shows too. The characters look good, the style is awesome and the landscapes and backgrounds are also well done. The thing that needs to be commended is the animation of the spells and the powers. Even the monsters look awesome. Nice job!ConclusionAt first glance, I didn\'t think that this anime would turn out this great. The only thing I have to criticize is that there is no release date for season 2. I really hope that the makers will make one. In short, Tokyo Ravens is a great story, with no plot holes but with some awesome reviews on the past. The background stories  are not boring, I liked them actually, and the romance, shounen, action mix was just epic. MAL scored it with 7,88 but I would give it  a 9,27. Almost a masterpiece, TOKYO RAVENS. energy"", meaning he is not able to use magic. Or he wasn\'t able until he met his childhood friend Natsume, who is also the heir to the main Tsuchimikado family.

Almost a masterpiece, TOKYO RAVENS.', 'Excuse me in advance for there will be minor use of profane language; I do not intend to offend anyone or anything. However, given that the review guidelines only consider the use of ""crap"" every three words, profane, I think (...I hope) I will be all right.Crap...crap...goose!Alright. Attempted humour spree go!It was the best of anime; it was the worst of anime.Now when I say that, I mean it. This is probably the most conflicted I\'ve ever been about an anime. Half of me is like this was awesome, and half of me is like...what the hell is the other half of me talking about.All...in all, Tokyo Ravens is probably one of the most unoriginal, cliche, done to death animes this season. And frankly, I have no problem with that. Being original is nice, but you\'re always sitting on the fence because you never know how people will react. Being cliche is great because you know you already have an established fanbase for whatever overused plot line you\'re dishing out.In fact, the very reason I started it was because I read the premise of the story (much more then the premise actually, I spoiled the whole plot for myself); anyways, I got to the part where a huge secret about the main character is revealed (I\'m a sucker for these types of plots), and I figured, this is just what I was looking for! Tokyo Ravens has everything set up right, but after watching the series, I can only say that everything so magnificently flopped, rolled over, and died.The perpetrator? Poor execution.Some people have complained that the first half of the anime was too slow. On the other hand, I found that the first half was paced perfectly. Great character introductions, great background explorations, great steady buildup...to a climax which never happened and a denouement which decided to switch places with where the climax should have been, just for kicks.The second half of the anime was a complete mess. With all the buildup, you would have expected the second half to unravel all the tangles in the yarn laid out in the first half, but no. It\'s like they tossed the ball to a cat who started playing with it and ended up wrapping the whole house in yarn.Here\'s my very adolescent explanation: I remember watching the last six episodes, thinking ""SHIT\'S GONNA GO DOWN NEXT EPISODE"", only to have no shit go down. And this continued until I finished the last episode, whereupon I felt extremely disappointed and empty inside. How is this possible you ask? Every single plot device/scene I was looking forward to was rushed, butchered, or omitted entirely. Stuff just started happening all over the place at the same time with minimal explanation. It made me totally lose track of characters and their personalities, philosophies, and motives - all the things that define them.And if you\'re wondering how I still ended up rating this an 8...despite all my complaints, I found Tokyo Ravens to be very addicting and enjoyable. I thought the magic system was really cool and the few fight scenes that existed were extremely noteworthy; definitely some of the better action scenes I\'ve seen recently. On the art and sound front, I would say the series is near flawless. Even the story, I thought it was cliche, but great. My only complaint would be with the characters, who were (for the most part, few exceptions) so one-dimensional that it\'s amazing how they managed to keep the suspense going.There were just so many things in Tokyo Ravens that I thought could have been done better. But alas, as I don\'t plan to take up the director\'s seat anytime soon, these aspirations will remain unrealized. Takaomi Kansaki probably did a better job than I could ever do anyways. in all, Tokyo Ravens is probably one of the most unoriginal, cliche, done to death animes this season.

With all the buildup, you would have expected the second half to unravel all the tangles in the yarn laid out in the first half, but no. It\'s like they tossed the ball to a cat who started playing with it and ended up wrapping the whole house in yarn.Here\'s my very adolescent explanation: I remember watching the last six episodes, thinking ""SHIT\'S GONNA GO DOWN NEXT EPISODE"", only to have no shit go down. And this continued until I finished the last episode, whereupon I felt extremely disappointed and empty inside. How is this possible you ask? Every single plot device/scene I was looking forward to was rushed, butchered, or omitted entirely. Stuff just started happening all over the place at the same time with minimal explanation. It made me totally lose track of characters and their personalities, philosophies, and motives - all the things that define them.And if you\'re wondering how I still ended up rating this an 8...despite all my complaints, I found Tokyo Ravens to be very addicting and enjoyable. I thought the magic system was really cool and the few fight scenes that existed were extremely noteworthy; definitely some of the better action scenes I\'ve seen recently. On the art and sound front, I would say the series is near flawless. Even the story, I thought it was cliche, but great. My only complaint would be with the characters, who were (for the most part, few exceptions) so one-dimensional that it\'s amazing how they managed to keep the suspense going.There were just so many things in Tokyo Ravens that I thought could have been done better. But alas, as I don\'t plan to take up the director\'s seat anytime soon, these aspirations will remain unrealized. Takaomi Kansaki probably did a better job than I could ever do anyways.', ""Tokyo Ravens is often described as a prototypical high-school fantasy style anime. While the description is accurate, it is far and away better than most of the stereotypical high-school fantasy anime that are rolled off the factory line every year. Tokyo Ravens does an outstanding job creating a universe in which you feel fully connected to both the past, present and future of many of the characters and their world. Although I do not do much reading of manga or light novels, I will be pick up the Tokyo Ravens light novel where the anime left off as the anime leaves little closure.{Story} - Easily...one of the highlights of Tokyo Ravens, the story is well developed and cohesive throughout the anime. Set in an alternate universe of post-world war II filled with magic, it comes with a few surprising twists and turns. The story is filled with hits of romance, action and fantasy and they all come together to form a story that will have you craving more once it comes to an end.{Art} - As with many anime that make use of magic, Tokyo Ravens is gorgeous. Top notch visual graphics are used throughout the anime and they really come to the forefront in the final episodes.{Sound} - As with the visuals, Tokyo Ravens had an excellent audio profile. The anime made excellent use of background music in both emotional and action scenes that never distracted you from the focus point but very much created a beautiful atmosphere.{Character} - Along with the story, I consider character development to be one of the most important aspects of an anime. Tokyo Ravens did not disappoint. While the anime makes use of quite a few central characters, they're all given fleshed out identities and evolve over the anime. Each character will take turns surprising you and showing why they are as important to the anime as the next character. Unlike many anime, this anime will connect you to characters from the first episode and will leave you wanting to know their future once the anime ends.{Enjoyment} - Quite frankly, I enjoyed this anime much more than I expected. I binge-watched the entire thing in one day and I do not regret it for a moment. I was surprised when reading other reviews that people found it average and just another fantasy anime - I found it to be head and shoulders above much of the average shows that the anime machine sends out these days.{Overall} - Overall I gave this anime a 9/10. Much higher than the MAL average but fully deserving of more recognition. I believe Tokyo Ravens is extremely underrated and looked over. With an excellent story and character development along with immersive visuals and audio - this anime needs to be watched. one of the highlights of Tokyo Ravens, the story is well developed and cohesive throughout the anime.

Granted there was a lot more back story than some anime I have watched but I still felt like it was lacking a little.The ending, while it was good, ended very suddenly and was rather cliff hangery. To be honest it left a little room for a sequel but more often than not, a lot of them do and we never get one so I'm not holding any hopes just yet.I guess another dislike I had is, well it did fell like it was something I'd seen before, it lacked a little originality and while I did enjoy it, it was rather similar to other anime in the same genre.I did enjoy the anime but there were times I did consider dropping it, not so much because I didn't like it but because there were quite a few main arcs (if you can call them that) and I felt it dragged on little.Saying this, It did work well as a 24 episode anime and I do not think it would have done so well being any shorter.So this review is probably not helpful but thats not really why I write them so...

Sorry"", 'Here\'s an easy review to sum up the strengths and weaknesses of Tokyo Ravens--SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment!OVERALL--Tokyo Ravens takes about five episodes before it really finds its footing; however, once it does, this show progresses with a great pace that will keep viewers interested through all 24 episodes! The ending is slightly open to interpretation, but comes to a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the viewer ready to continue on with the characters into their next big adventure, while still bringing the current story arc to a close. Overall, a very enjoyable show and well worth the watch!MAGIC SYSTEM--A huge part of this anime is...the magic system, which presents some of the show\'s highest and lowest points. Tokyo Raven\'s magic system is never given clear cut rules or limitations, which may leave some viewers frustrated. However, this lack of definite limitations allows for some excellent fight scenes because the magic can be used is so many creative and varied ways. A highlight of the series is the magic battles, which are interesting and never repetitive; they almost never use the same trick twice!CHARACTERS--At first, the characters may seem a little cookie-cutter, with some of the typical ""anime friend group"" cliches; however, the show is not limited by this because each of the mains ends up so gosh darn likable! The mains are believable, with enough backstory to give them depth.The cast of supporting characters is wide, which allows for a lot of interesting personalities. Unfortunately, for a show with only 24 episodes, I found the cast a little TOO wide to keep track of all the characters at some points. Despite this, the wide range of characters allows the show to build up an interesting motif examining the reality and meaning of trust. As a viewer, you are never quite sure who you can trust, which mirrors the struggles of the characters. This gave the story extra intrigue as allies split into factions, friends turn into opponents, and previous enemies unite as accomplices.ART--The major flaw in the art is how starkly the CGI stands out against the traditional animation. The CGI is mainly used on the familiars in battle scenes, but I found it both jarring and distracting. Other than that, the art is fairly consistent throughout the show, with vivid colors, enjoyable character designs, and beautifully animated spell work.SOUND--The show presents a strong voice acting cast with bright sound editing and mixing, but falls short in musical composition. I didn\'t find either of the opening or ending themes memorable. Furthermore, the show did not make good use of background music, even though there were many instances where music could have provided a great boost to the emotion or energy of the scene.SUBS OR DUBS?Finally, as a lover of both subs and dubs in different situations, (and having watched Tokyo Ravens in both), I recommend the subs on this one. I found the subs to be slightly better in their explanations of plot intricacies, and the Japanese voice actors to be better suited to the characters as I understood them.PROS--+good pacing+creative magic battles+likable main characters+visually appealing spell work+strong Japanese voice castCONS---slow and slightly confusing start-lack of clear rules/limitations to magic-some distracting CGI-little to no effective background music the magic system, which presents some of the show\'s highest and lowest points.

Score five is mediocre. That means that you will still probably get some enjoyment out of it.RATING: 7.68 - Read rest of my review/rant to see my reasons why- - - - - - - - -As many others have mentioned, this anime starts off quite weak with a rather non-unique setting, but then during its second act has a very, very exciting plot development that keeps you striving for more. Although unfortunately, there isn\'t anything more, and you are left with a...hefty amount of new unanswered questions.Story & Plot - - -As I said before, the anime starts off with giving a generic shounen vibe, and you can almost find all the shounen clichés there are. For example; main character fails school but compensate for his intelligience with practical skills, there\'s the childhood friend, there is the ever so important promise from early childhood. A majority of the series takes place in high school setting. Also there is the glasses-guy, the big anime tiddies girl, the tsundere,  the friendship is magic and will rescue the day and so on and so on.So far it might not seem like  too much of a premise, but becuase of a fast introduction followed right up by action, drama and mystery, you the viewer is immediately invested in the series.Unfortunately, during its first half of the story, it is somewhat underwhelming. Events occur, but there is a lack of character developement and story progression. It is almost like the first half of the series is dedicated to introduce the viewer to this fictional universe (unfortunately, there isn\'t too much interesting, a lot of generic shounen magic-stuff with  no real explanation to why things are like they are.)It is not until at least after episode 14/15 things start to unravel itself and it starts to show some story heavy stuff.And that\'s my point really. I just finished rewatching this anime for the second time, and previously having fond memories of this show, I was shocked. Halfway through the series it was nothing more than another mediocre, shounen-seasonal like anime....Buuut then things start to happen. The plot picks up some good pace and a well thought story starts to unravel. The second half/ the last episodes make up for the previously dull arc.Art ~ ~ ~Art/style/animation is mediocre. Little attention to detail and no interesting backgrounds.  The CGI is really obnoxious, but.. sad but true, you get used to it, and it is used in moderation (except the first couple of epsiodes... Oh god my eyes).Choreography is good. Not too many moving still-shots or ""guy\'s so fast he zaps past his opponent, and seconds later opponent falls over/is cut apart because for some reason there is a delay to the blow becuase guy is faster than goddamn light"". (Like it or not, but you can\'t deny it is bad/lazy animation technique).Sound - - -Soundtrack is decent, not memorable though.  Though there is one especially nice piano melody which plays during sad/bittersweet moments. Unfortunately it gets kind of repetitive after 24 episodes.Sound design is fine, but again, not memorable.Characters ~ ~ ~At first the cast is not impressive at all. Main character follows typical shounen clichés and the rest of the cast is- you guessed it, super generic. It\'s only a bit into the series each character start to develop into something interesting.There are some interesting characters with even more interesting development, but... Okay it feels like I am repeating myself so I\'ll just finish this and then get to my point.Enjoyment and Overall rating : : :Overall, it is generic, mediocre, and at first very predictable. In this wall of text I have repeatedly said those specific words, generic,unfortunately and mediocre. There is no coming away from that. Though, during the second act it starts going into a great direction with lots of interesting twists, new revelations and lots of character developement, only to end with a bad conclusion.The ending isn\'t bad, but all suddenly there are all these new problems and you the viewer is filled with both old and new questions; Who is that? How is he their ""master""? What the hell did she do towards the last episode? What is going on, and what the hell is going to happen next?!There is no conclusion. They introduce way too many story heavy/interesting characters right in the end of the series. Real shame.No questions are answered and when it finally starts to get reeaaally good, it just kind of ends.I found it very enjoyable, or rather, the finale of the series makes up for the otherwise dull and generic shounen anime you have seen too many times.My biggest problem with this anime is that it ends with no conclusion, and it just teases you with the possibility of a sequel. Also it kind of states that ""oh no how is it going to end? You should probably read up on the maangaa!"" Goddamnit, I just wanted a finished anime.Final Verdict, Good to very good, but maybe not a priority choice of what to watch anime. hefty amount of new unanswered questions.Story & Plot - - -As I said before, the anime starts off with giving a generic shounen vibe, and you can almost find all the shounen clichés there are.

They are born as the reincarnation of a legendary magician.  The main cast consists of 6 magic students and a teacher.  There is Harutora, Natsume, Touji, Kyouko, Suzuka, Tenma, and Jin.

Even amid the wild action scenes and slice of life school backdrop, it's intention is to cause emotional reactions from its viewers.I usually avoid shows like this b/c i don't like to feel down or depressed after watching sometihing, and that is exactly how you will feel unless you are an akuma.I would say the drama is a little over the top as well, overplayed, drawn out and a little confusing.

I understand it continues in the Light Novels, but I don't read LN's.I felt the need to warn all who dare enter this with certain expectations.  It's definitely not all bad, in fact most of it is very enjoyable.  I felt the pacing was a little off, but the over dramatization really killed it for me.

I am not going to say that this is perfect in an anyway though it does have a few major flaws. I am going to cover those flaws here shortly. So sit back and read this review :)Flaw #1- Character DevelopmentCharacter development was a major flaw in this anime. I thought that they focused too much on Harutora Tsuchimikado & Natsume Tsuchimikado. They had a string of characters that to me they were just lying them to waste. For the string of characters that weren't...as important as the two main characters there wasn't any back-story for them. For instance a character that that was in the anime every episode was  Touji Ato, he was a great character but they didn't bother to go into any details about him like how he became a half ogre. All they said was that he was in a disaster and thats it. I thought that he should of been the main character to begin with they made him look so much more powerful than harutora. (plus he had common sense) They also didn't fully explain the characters from the magic agency or anything. They also didn't go into very much detail with Yakou Tsuchimikado, they kept saying that he was a super good exorcist and that he developed taboo magic.(not much thought into that character)Flaw #2- Pacing of the storyI felt that they went from a slow paced to overly rushed. It also felt like they skipped a few scenes throughout every episode, they never started off from where they left off. The ending was very sloppy and rushed, its like they were in a hurry to finish it or something. Despite that i still enjoyed it a bit.Those are the 2 major flaws of the story now i am going to get into the ratings.Story 7/10- Rated this for the reason above pacing of the story. As i said before they rushed and skipped scenes and it makes you get confused about what is going on. To me I thought that the beginning of the anime was slow paced and too annoying for me to watch, but once I toughed it out and completed more and more episodes I started to think that it was an enjoyable show. NO THE SHOW IS NOT ALL ABOUT RAVENS! (tiny spoiler) The ending royally pissed me off because of how they skipped the ritual and also how he leaves into the sunset. I didn't fully understand what was going on. To make matters worse I dont believe they are making a season 3 of Tokyo Ravens which really really makes me mad. time and time again I see myself being dissapointed at the stories begining and ending. Even though at times it felt really confusing it was easy to catch up in what was happening.Art 9/10- I thought the art looked fantastic. They went into great detail when coming to the characters, setting, the magic designs, even the dormrooms looked very detailed. Though there isn't much to say about the art all I can say is that I really enjoyed the way this anime looked.Sound 8/10- The sound was great. I know that they are starting on the dubbed version but I have not seen any episodes of it so I am rating it solely based on the subbed version so far. At times i felt that they characters rushed through enchantments and their sentences but that was okay to an extent. The music at the title screen was catchy, so catchy that I had to find the song on youtube :)Characters 8/10- As I previously mentioned about the character development they did have a string of characters that I thought to be more interesting than the main 2 characters. I was upset because they didn't give much of a back-story on any of the characters. Each character had their own unique personalities and attributes that they brought to the show to make it more enjoyable. One of my favorite characters that I thought should of been pushed more was Touji Ato. Touji Ato was an half ogre man beast lol. His personality was the best of the characters with him this anime I seemed to be amused in every episode, even though he was a bit cocky at times but it was still great to see this character in the show. They should of focused more on developing the characters to their full extent rather than half developing them.Enjoyment 8/10-  It was enjoyable at points with all of the different characters and settings. Not much to say besides that I liked this show up until the ending.Overall 8/10- Overall I enjoyed this anime, it had a unique story. For all of the reasons above i chose to give this anime an 8 instead of a 7 because the fighting scenes with the homeroom teacher made a big difference and it caught my interest.THANKS FOR READING -_-  (only a second review so it might be a bit sloppy but hope this helps on deciding if you want to watch tokyo ravens) as important as the two main characters there wasn't any back-story for them.

To make matters worse I dont believe they are making a season 3 of Tokyo Ravens which really really makes me mad. time and time again I see myself being dissapointed at the stories begining and ending. Even though at times it felt really confusing it was easy to catch up in what was happening.Art 9/10- I thought the art looked fantastic. They went into great detail when coming to the characters, setting, the magic designs, even the dormrooms looked very detailed. Though there isn't much to say about the art all I can say is that I really enjoyed the way this anime looked.Sound 8/10- The sound was great. I know that they are starting on the dubbed version but I have not seen any episodes of it so I am rating it solely based on the subbed version so far. At times i felt that they characters rushed through enchantments and their sentences but that was okay to an extent. The music at the title screen was catchy, so catchy that I had to find the song on youtube :)Characters 8/10- As I previously mentioned about the character development they did have a string of characters that I thought to be more interesting than the main 2 characters. I was upset because they didn't give much of a back-story on any of the characters. Each character had their own unique personalities and attributes that they brought to the show to make it more enjoyable. One of my favorite characters that I thought should of been pushed more was Touji Ato. Touji Ato was an half ogre man beast lol. His personality was the best of the characters with him this anime I seemed to be amused in every episode, even though he was a bit cocky at times but it was still great to see this character in the show. They should of focused more on developing the characters to their full extent rather than half developing them.Enjoyment 8/10-  It was enjoyable at points with all of the different characters and settings. Not much to say besides that I liked this show up until the ending.Overall 8/10- Overall I enjoyed this anime, it had a unique story. For all of the reasons above i chose to give this anime an 8 instead of a 7 because the fighting scenes with the homeroom teacher made a big difference and it caught my interest.THANKS FOR READING -_-  (only a second review so it might be a bit sloppy but hope this helps on deciding if you want to watch tokyo ravens)"", ""Tokyo Ravens attempts to create its own spin on spiritualists within anime as they are incorporated into a modern era setting with Harutora learning more of his family roots as he is trained in being a spiritualist alongside cousin Natsume and finds himself caught up in hostilities between the Onmyo Agency tasked with keeping spiritual disturbances to a minimum and the cult-like Twin Horn Syndicate trying to stir up disturbances that will lead to the revival of their worshiped leader, Yakou.Saying that things are a mixed bag with this series is quite an understatement. On the one hand, it does rather well for the most...part at creating a unique world for spiritualists within Tokyo Ravens as the series has laws established in the modern era for spiritualists to continue honing their craft, while have a law enforcement body in the form of the Onmyo Agency tasked with keeping their activities in check to prevent instigators like the Twin Horn Syndicate from wrecking havoc on human society. The Twin Horn Syndicate create much of the conflict within the series as they are responsible for stirring up a series of events throughout the series to try reviving Yakou, a powerful spiritualist whose reception among those in the world of spiritualists is a mixed one due to an infamous event he was a major influence in from the past. This eventually leads Natsume and Harutora to get caught up in the conflict toward the second half of the series, as they are direct descendants of Yakou from being in the same family line. The spiritualist elements also contribute to the show's engaging action scenes as shikigami and magic of various forms are used by spiritualists against one another throughout the show, leading to some great fight choreography in spite of the conspicuous CG animation that is used for rendering many of the powers used by the spiritualists throughout the show.In spite of its unique premise though, Tokyo Ravens does have a number of shortcomings that cripple its quality to a good extent. The first half suffers from a number of episodes that are typical of high school comedy anime titles with the character archetypes and situations played up and the show making some failed attempts at trying to milk humor off Natsume's need to cross-dress as a boy while a student at the Onmyo Academy with Harutora. The large cast of characters and conflicts that build up throughout the show can usually make it hard to follow what is going on at points if this is your first time going through the show, especially in its second half when events escalate with the Twin Horn Syndicate. The final episodes also suffer a bit in some rather convenient plot and character developments with how Harutora and Natsume's situations are resolved, mainly coming from some shocking developments that take place regarding the upbringings of our two lead characters and their fates.Overall, I suppose your mileage may vary with how well you warm up to Tokyo Ravens. While offering decent world-building and plot developments with its spiritualist premise, the series peaks in its second half as you have to struggle through mediocre points in its first half and deal with final episodes that offer too convenient a climax for how Harutora and Natsume resolve their situations. I would say rent or stream this series first before you decide on committing to a purchase of it. part at creating a unique world for spiritualists within Tokyo Ravens as the series has laws established in the modern era for spiritualists to continue honing their craft, while have a law enforcement body in the form of the Onmyo Agency tasked with keeping their activities in check to prevent instigators like the Twin Horn Syndicate from wrecking havoc on human society.

Don't get me wrong this anime was very enjoyable and i hope they have enough money to make a second season because i liked it that much, but i think overall they should have had at least two more episodes so they could have finished the romance between Natsume and Harutora. This anime was one that i highly loved even if it did show a little genericness...i would highly recommend because it's story was really good. i would highly recommend because it's story was really good."", 'Tokyo Ravens is a supernatural story focused primarily on Onmyodo magic a traditional japanese divination of cosmology with a mix of natural science and occultism or known as ""The way of Yin and Yang"" along with a mix of the daily lives of the two main characters Harutora and Natsume.Story: 8The idea and overall story follows the theme of the anime and provides decent insight on some of the history of Onmyoujis which helps to support the theme of the story. The story\'s pacing of the anime was well done it provided a slow start for the viewers to understand what happened prior to the...start of the story and as it progressed it started to learn more towards the story\'s main plot.

It throughly enjoyed it. The story was pretty interesting and even if you can guess some plot twists, a couple of them take you by surprise. The characters are very well done, even those that got very little screen time were interesting and I wish we could learn more about them. I was a bit annoyed by baka-tora because he can be obtuse to his surroundings hence his nickname. This anime was missing that wow factor to push it over the edge. However, I was entertained by the story which flowed pretty well and at a decent pace....Even the filler episodes were enjoyable.

After that, the show felt empty since it focuses so much on the love between the male and female mc, but suddenly one of the most important parts of the show (romance) is basically gone. I, however, kept watching because I expected everything to be cleared up in the ending, but the ending left me extremely dissatisfied, so dissatisfied that I had to write down my thought, which I have never done before (this is my first review ever)I could understand the ending if there was a second season, but as it...is now, I'm left feeling empty and I barely get what happened.

The combo of mantras plus talismans plus magic ability was nifty and for the action spread throughout the show I give the anime in general a 7/10.  I do think the anime peaked a little after the mid point (episode 16-18) because the fight scenes there were really good but...beyond that no particular character or single plot event stood out to me.

( Note : I wrote this using my phone so there may be countless of grammatical errors )First of all, I\'d like to say that I have started this anime solely to write a review for it. 6 years ago, Tokyo Ravens was a big hit at my school - especially my class. My classmates and friends always had a discussion about it. And surprisingly, even my ex-girlfriend who I never knew watched anime knew about it. Tokyo Ravens was a huge discussion back then....Unfortunately, I had only watched fewer anime at that time and they do not include Tokyo Ravens so I was unable to talk with my friends and my ex. Well, despite that, I still decided not to watch the show because I was more into games than anime at that time.6 years had passed since then. I still remembered the ""little guilt"" I got in the past. Well, I might\'ve forgotten about it at some point but I recently remembered it clearly when I was adding a bunch of anime into my PTW. Anyways. Because of the little guilt that kept irritating my brain. I decided to watch the show once and for all to see if it\'s actually as good as what my friends, classmates and my ex said. This review will contain my opinion about Tokyo Ravens, its pros, its cons and my final thoughts. ( Precautions for minor spoilers - I may accidentally slip some in unconsciously )Tokyo Ravens is a romance, supernatural, magic, comedy, school show. Surprisingly not categorized as harem due to the little harem it has and surprisingly not categorized as action due to the little actions it has(?). The story resolves around a group of students consisting of an MC that is underpowered but later on gets a slight upgrade but is still underpowered. His harem, a tsundere, a reverse trap and one girl that did not get enough character development so I forgot. As well as some other dudes that are pretty much supporting characters although one of the dude is actually a main character but he acts like a supporting character. So basically, events were jumbled into the story and causes the group of students to do this and that and later on ended up at that in which was this. Doesn\'t matter if you didn\'t understand what I just said. I don\'t even understand it myself. That\'s how confusing the story of Tokyo Ravens is. Okay, listen. I understand the point it\'s trying to tell. But adding random events into the story? Doesn\'t that seem kind of clich- oh, yes. I can\'t criticize I suppose because this anime is a Shounen action. Oh wait. It\'s not.. Wait what?!Anyways. Aside from the story that gives me cancer. The ending sucks. Really, really bad. I did not expect such a bad ending at all from an anime that was actually doing pretty good with its story development that is catalyzed by beautiful actions, lowkey harem and backstories that aren\'t clear but aren\'t so bad. I continued watching this anime in hope of a completion, not a cliffhanger! Judging by the fact that there\'s been no signs of season 2 ever since 2013. I, Giorno Giovanna, am proud to say that this anime ended up like one of those anime that are left as cliffhanger for eternity despite the fact that the anime itself is actually pretty good. Boooo.Regardless of the confusing story and the terrible ending. The confusing story didn\'t really bother me much and instead gave me a slight nostalgic feeling of what watching an anime like this feels like. That feeling brings back memories and I\'m glad that I was able to feel it again. The feeling that is not too impactive; I don\'t get depression or depression from getting happy. The balance of the feeling. No ups and downs. Now this is the feeling of satisfactory that I have long forgotten. With just that, I guess I would let the confusing story slide. But the ending? No. Fuck off.The art of Tokyo Ravens is okay. Aside from CGs being CGs. The fight scenes are actually pretty thrilling because of the quality and art style of the anime. I haven\'t seen something like this for a very long time now, so it does really bring back memories. No more comments for the art.The OP sucks. The second OP sucks. The ED sucks. Don\'t even know if there\'s a second ED. Other than that, the voice acting is actually pretty good. A good voice acting and a well-developed story alone can make me waver. Sadly, this anime doesn\'t really have the two of them so all it did was nearly made me cry to a certain extent. That is all. Also, the choice of music for scenes are also mediocre. If they were a little better then I might\'ve probably cried despite of the fact that the story kinda sucks.The best thing about this show are the characters. They are likable, and if the cliches are overlooked then the character development is actually pretty good. Only for certain characters ( like the MC\'s relationship with that girl ). The bad thing about the characters is the fact that the anime just decides to add a bunch of people in and doesn\'t really care much about them and solely use them in order to make the ""actions"" better. Mhmm.. But I guess I could overlook that as well because I feel nostalgic.Tokyo Ravens overall was very fun. I guess my classmates, friends and my ex didn\'t lie at all. I bet $1000 US dollars that that one day when they stopped talking about Tokyo Ravens is the day when the ending was released. Pwahahahaha! Okay, anyways. This anime had many pros and cons, but at the end of the day. It\'s just one of those anime that resembles a good McDonald\'s fries.10/10-1 point because I dislike these genres-1 point because of the ending-1 point because of the confusing story+1 point because of the nostalgic feelingA solid 8/10 for me.

What I mean with functional is that it offers many potential elements that make an anime of this caliber interesting, but in the end how it runs with them falls a little short. I'm not saying it's bad in any stretch of the imagination, but I am saying there are aspects that could've been handled better. There are many things I'd like to mention about the plot, but since I can't spoil anything I have to be as roundabout as possible.The story is in its foundation generic, but...also enjoyable. The world is just about what you expect: teens, magic, battles and school. What actually got me interested was the plot. I found myself invested on how things were going to develop as the show managed to throw several twists I did not expect. This held up my interest enough that I could marathon the show in two sessions. On the other hand some twists were there for the story's convenience and some even were left largely unexplained. At least you can figure out some of them, but some are just left out there. I liked the romantic foundation in the story, but the development was suddenly procrastinated. At one episode it had relevance, but the next episodes just tossed it aside and brought it back a lot later. Very confusing.Overall they made the story work for the most part. The bigger issue was how the story used some of its characters.For the most part I liked the characters. The main cast was interesting and also well used in the overall story. Their motivations, backgrounds and personalities were well fleshed out and their usage in the story worked to its advantage. There were, however, many characters or characteristics that fell flat in their execution. I found it strange how the show held back on the potential of some protagonists for too long until it was convenient for the plot or developed them traits that the story wouldn't use in any meaningful way. Say, a harem development without the harem for example. Some characters who seemed relevant were also introduced early on , but didn't really play any major role in the end. I liked some of the antagonists, but many of them also had unclear motivations the we never got any light on.I'm not an expert on art and sound, but I would say the animation wasn't too special or detailed. What excelled though were the animation of the magic as it seemed like the studio had fun making it as flashy as possible and in the end it was enjoyable to watch. It was an admirable effort to throw in CGI, but the stuttering animation threw me off to an extent. It was probably easier and cheaper to use it, but I would've enjoyed more something that blended in better.The music wasn't particularly memorable, but it did keep the atmosphere of the show about right. Sound effects were fitting for the show, but I did notice that I've heard many of them before in different places, so they weren't original to say the least.Overall the show is enjoyable. For a good portion it handles itself well and keeps you attached enough that you won't get bored. I personally would've liked to know more about certain details and loose ends, but generally that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. For a magical battle anime, I'd recommend putting it fairly high on the priority list.This has been my first review on the site, so excuse me if it's unpolished. also enjoyable.

For a good portion it handles itself well and keeps you attached enough that you won't get bored. I personally would've liked to know more about certain details and loose ends, but generally that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. For a magical battle anime, I'd recommend putting it fairly high on the priority list.This has been my first review on the site, so excuse me if it's unpolished."", ""Tokyo ravens may seem to be an ordinary anime but its far from.At first glance this anime has several cliches both in relation to plot and characters but it's more complex than that. Even though there will be several occasions where you will think typical the anime as a whole is very good.The story is very interesting and the bits and parts that remind you of a filler just exist to discover the more playful nature of the characters. Yes there could have been more focus on the central plot but that would not have been so much fun.The art is pretty great, though I...admit that certain techniques utilized could have been improved, and by techniques I mean the actual skills utilized by the characters.Sound, though not bad, is not something great. If you are looking for an awesome soundtrack you need to look elsewhere. Here you will find something more like nice music but after 10 mins you will not remember a thing.The characters are very good. Even the secondary characters seem to have a fascinating story behind them ( regrettably you will not know that story from this anime). In general the character structure is pretty solid. Uniquest background stories are well presented or hinted throughout the anime and you pretty much get hooked. I could elaborate further but not point ruining the anime.Overall enjoyment of the series is exceptionally high. Though it may seem just another cliched series the overall result will leave you very happy and wanting for more.I would recommend this series for anyone wanting to spend a couple of hours just chilling and having fun whilst watching a very good series without too many complexities and obscure stories. admit that certain techniques utilized could have been improved, and by techniques I mean the actual skills utilized by the characters.Sound, though not bad, is not something great.

It would have made the overall show fairly boring, but boy, could have made life easier.Tokyo Ravens has an interesting story line. Unique, but somewhat predictable. Some parts reminded me a lot of Fullmetal Alchemist, except in this case that that taboo worked--but its still not fully clear if it was or not. The story has peaks and troughs, action and a lull.

It hit a lot of different areas such as magic, action, romance and surprisingly quite a bit of comedy. This is the first show I have seen a human become someone’s familiar which I though was pretty interesting. I have to say that one of my favorite characters has to be Kon, Harutora‘s familiar. She is so adorable and I found her  delightful and funny. All characters had great developments throughout the show. I did wish there had been a little more action throughout the show. I really liked how the show played out and...I hope there is another season. The ending did wrap up pretty well but still left it a little open ended for another season if it continues.

There\'s a range of cool looking familiars and spirits also which are never a sore sight to behold I even enjoyed the whole...episode on Kon it didn\'t feel like it was filler either.Overall the story has a great idea and executes it very well, there are some twists and turns which you won\'t expect and keep you binge watching until the end like I did.If you are simply looking for action you may not enjoy it as some of the other magic series out there but if enjoy your shows with a mixed genre then you should stick around for this Romance, Comedy, Supernatural piece of artwork!(Dubbed) You may even find yourself saying along with the others ""Stupid Tora"" haha enjoy this great anime~ episode on Kon it didn\'t feel like it was filler either.Overall the story has a great idea and executes it very well, there are some twists and turns which you won\'t expect and keep you binge watching until the end like I did.If you are simply looking for action you may not enjoy it as some of the other magic series out there but if enjoy your shows with a mixed genre then you should stick around for this Romance, Comedy, Supernatural piece of artwork!(Dubbed) You may even find yourself saying along with the others ""Stupid Tora"" haha enjoy this great anime~', 'As the story says the anime is so freaking supranatural. However it\'s not just filled with supranatural only. You\'ll also find other genres mingle in it such as action, romance, and school life which is clear the school based on magic thingy. For me myself, I can\'t decide whether it\'s shounen or shoujo anime, to put it only shounen it won\'t be good because there is still shoujo flavour added (I mean the romance), while claim this one only romance is impossible too because of the damn good shounen spice here.The story centers of our main hero named Tsuchimikado Harutora who...has a bloodline of Tsuchimikado branch family (as an Onmyouji--specialist—practitioner of magic). Despite of the family blood flows through his veins, he doesn\'t have much supranatural skills to use and by that fact he doesn\'t have enough confident also encouragement to be a Shaman. It\'s opposite with the daughter of Tsuchimikado main family, Tsuchimikado Natsume. She is so skillful like the blessed onmyouji from the family and the only successor.These two were childhood friend, separated because of Natsume\'s moving. And in this present they meet again, along with few circumstances, Harutora decided to be a Shaman, moves to Natsume\'s school to train and mastering his skill after become Natsume\'s shikigami. By the decision Harutora made and moving to this school, one by one issues disclosed and be a scourge which isn\'t possible to be undone. It is so surprising so it is not just pump your blood to the head just for thinking or guessing what will happen but also we can also feel our heartbeat faster by watching the fascinating show.Whether you\'re the viewer to enjoy a show emotionally or just by the visualization, it won\'t be a matter since Tokyo Ravens plot somehow a bit drama here can stir your spirit undoubtedly and the animation of its fight using supernatural power is freaking good. The visuals, including the art, details, animation and character designs are well-defined. The colour is not too sharp or too blurry, the fighting scenes are fine with the standout effect and issues narrated nicely.I would say the brilliant ideas of story and the subtle shift of each conflicts are the central aspects which make the show and its characters fascinating. By the developed core of plot, the characters following it also be more creditable. Maybe some of you had watched it, or looked for the information of the series which has quite amount of characters. Yes indeed, but no worries, because every characters fill their role precisely and related to each others too. Each of them hold their own surprises secretly.The theme songs are good~ The steady beat for OP themes; ""X-encounter"" by Maon Kurosaki  and ""~Outgrow~"" by Gero. The 1st ED theme is sweet, so melodious and this one is my favorite, sung by Yoshino Nanjo ""Kimi ga Emu Yuugure (君が笑む夕暮れ)"". The 2nd theme song is sung by Mami Kawada ""Break a spell"" has a unique sense with electronic musical instruments.Tokyo Ravens will get its 9+ (or 10 I could say) from me.

Unfortunately, this show is part of the ""rough"".Story-4Really, this is nothing new- high school boy has some fantasy power and goes to a fantasy school and meets some superior-in-every-way girl and so on.  I found the pacing went from incredibly slow to light speed in the last episode.  Nothing in the story ever surprised me, nor did the outcome of any fights.  Nothing to shabby, just, well, mediocre.Art-6The backgrounds were all fairly done and the school felt like a unique...location.  But the character designs pissed me off.

Tokyo Ravens doesn\'t. There is no wit or intelligence to the dialogue. It\'s pretty clear the author\'s idea of conversation comes from anime and not from talking with people. This is pretty normal for anime, and I don\'t usually mind all that much (especially if the plot is great) , but something about this show really makes it hard to bear. Maybe it\'s because everything in the show feels like a re-hashing of anime clichés.The character personalities are all a one line synopsis.

All of those spells, familiar and so. Natsume vs Yakou Devotees wasn't an interesting story but The Final Arc made it a really good story. The whole thing about Raven Coat andd Othomo Jin's true identity excited me so much!Art:(8/10): I really didn't like the drawings at some times....The boys chins were too long and there was bad CGI usage like Doman's car was flying BUT after the battle of Doman and Othomo Jin I changed my mind about y drawing. The spells look honestly so cool.Sound:(7/10): None of the endings or openings caught me but the ost was pretty good  especially those whistle songs really givess you the anime's aura.Character:(7/10): Harutora, Kyouko, Natsume, Hokuto etc. are pretty cliche characters while Touji, Kon and Othomo was pretty interesting to watch.

The story is nicely paced and the plot gets thicker and more interesting in the second half mostly beacause in the second half there are actual Onmyo battles, familiar battles and magical battles as well as some betrayals and multiple plot twists.The first half of the show I found very boring, so boring that I ended up putting the series on hold for 2 months, and that was sort of a mistake.I did not like tha incantations for the spells, they...were very unappealing.Characters: 3/10There isn’t much character development and most of the characters retain their original personalities throughout the series.The MC, Harutora, is the typical shounen character, he is not talented but he tries his best. I did not like the fact that Tokyo Ravens falls victim to this generalized male lead personality where the MC is dense and a fool for the majority of the series.Part of the supporting characters, the divine generals, were actually more interesting than the leads, especially the director and professor Otomo.For the rest of the characters, they are clichéd, generic and sterotypical.  The mysterious sort of a bad-guy, Yukon, we know almost nothing about him but I liked that the backstories of the main characters were well done.Animation: 7/10Tha art and animation was good except for that atrocious CG.Sound: 4/10The sound was a letdown: unappealing OPs and endings, lack of the OST that leaves you with the impression „shit’s about to go down”, I did like the whissle music.Enjoyment: 6/10I disliked the bitter sweet ending where the revival of the female lead, Natsume, was able to be performed by Harutora, but it was only half-successful and something we won’t find out what happend to her and the Yukon inside Harutora gets sort of awakened and Harutora finally becomes mature and powerfull and we won’t see what the fuck happens next.Overall: 5.3/10The show is worth it because it has a lot more depth than meets the eye and gets better as the story progresses. were very unappealing.Characters: 3/10There isn’t much character development and most of the characters retain their original personalities throughout the series.The MC, Harutora, is the typical shounen character, he is not talented but he tries his best.

If you don't care about romance, my opinions won't matter to you.Tokyo Ravens, is not that. It starts of with a bit of netorare (Which I despise) when the love interest is forced to see a stolen first kiss.The main male protagonist, Harutora, is your generic love-blind simple minded fool, who couldn't read the atmosphere even if a hose was attached to the exhaust of a car they're sitting blissfully and ignorantly inside.Natsume was a sweet love interest, who I genuinely...rooted for, but the fact that her feelings weren't truly reciprocated until the most pathetic excuse for a climactic scene nearing the end of the anime, wore my patience greatly.The anime leaves you feeling empty and bitter at the end, a vague belief that everything turned out alright, but not really, not really one bit, especially since there is no sequel, besides reading into the light novel.P.S. The adorable fox familiar Kon was truly a saving grace, she was a loyal companion that was an actually useful plot device for the main character, if not for her, I'd probably have given this a lower score. rooted for, but the fact that her feelings weren't truly reciprocated until the most pathetic excuse for a climactic scene nearing the end of the anime, wore my patience greatly.The anime leaves you feeling empty and bitter at the end, a vague belief that everything turned out alright, but not really, not really one bit, especially since there is no sequel, besides reading into the light novel.P.S.

This was more of a loosely written romance anime than anything else. The story had so much potential. The 24 episodes could have easily be sorted down to 12.The supporting roles had the most development where you get to see how they grow in power and get stronger whereas it was poorly executed for Harutora.Im no quitter which is why I pushed through but boy I would not advise watching, just...stick it on in the background and do some homework or something! stick it on in the background and do some homework or something!"", ""In it, I see gorgeous artwork, appealing character design and rendering, and an energetic storyline with touches of emotion, sympathy, and a grasp of Japan's depths of spirituality.  No, it's not Great World Literature, but it has a pleasantly potent magic as it wields both the expected and unexpected in crafting an anime composition.  Perhaps we will be presented with a second season of TR soon.The flow of each episode is enhanced by the excellent creative sense for pacing and content. The pacing of scenes and their themes seems just right, enriched by quick insertions of funny details, such as when...spells go off-kilter, facial expressions change, and dueling wordplay is parlayed.The art and animation work impresses me.  For example, when Natsume delivers a rapid-fire verbal tirade to Harutora, the animation of her mouth, eyes, head, and hair motions all keep up with each energetically spoken word.

If you are looking for an anime that is fantasy/magical and has a bit of romance I would highly recommend you watching this. I have been binge watching a lot of anime lately and I could say this definitely is one of my favorites because it has such a strong story line, lovable characters, and emotional impact to me.The anime itself isn't dull and repetitive but instead is full of interesting plot line and lively characters that brings the anime to life. I am sure this type of anime is not for...everyone but in my opinion it is definitely different and not a generic type of anime where you would be able to predict the things that would happen next. The twist in the anime is something I didn't see coming and its ending has the perfect resolution of the story. It surely had me surprised and wanting to watch more of it . It is a one of a kind anime and I am sure you will love this anime too. everyone but in my opinion it is definitely different and not a generic type of anime where you would be able to predict the things that would happen next.

It has no right to be so good in some places and such a wreck in others.Animation / Art / General Visuals - 8/10-----------------------------------------------Nothing to really complain about. Pretty solid quality across the board. Use of some 3D elements was kinda weird and not exactly appealing, but not too terrible either.Magic and effects are pretty good, and the final episodes definitely look pretty fancy....Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 8/10------------------------------------------Again, pretty solid across the board. Couldn\'t really care much for OP\'s or ED\'s, a few decent tracks in the show itself. Voice acting was okay. Magic incantations were rather unbearably cringe though. But I\'ve seen worse.Story - 6/10-------------Please save me from the suffering of this woefully underexplored universe with a story where the first half is barely worth scraping off the bottom of your shoe, and the second half tries to condense all of ""Bleach"" into 12 episodes.They should have taken cue from Sousei no Onmyouji and aimed for 50 episodes. Or at least not wasted the first half on an excessive dose of Slice of Life.Simply put, Tokyo Ravens tries to build a big fascinating world of magic, familiars, demons, grand conspiracies and whatnot. But what we get is a world that makes effectively zero sense because nothing is really explained. For a show that relies so much on the utilization of magic and familiars, we as viewers are taught effectively nothing about how any of it works. We see stuff happen but there\'s no apparent logic to any of it.Which is honestly messed up, because the show spends most of its runtime introducing us to characters who are supposed to be novices and going to magic school. Yet we see them learn exactly jack shit. Instead we get a bunch of random slice of life, and 6 month time skips to buff up the characters to be slightly less useless.It\'s painful.And to cap it all off, the story of the anime doesn\'t even have any sort of a satisfying conclusion. So you start the show in pain, and you end it in pain.Characters - 5/10---------------------Just end me already. Please save me from yet another MC that\'s dumber than a bag of bricks and about as competent as a bucket of sawdust at putting out a house fire.I can\'t understand the fascination that anime writers have with making MC\'s so insufferably dumb and incompetent. It\'s physically painful to watch. The MC is a literal F-student in every subject, and possesses zero skills of any sort. Like an actual fucking potato.And yet he gets to be the MC because of the least surprising plot twist of the century, and the usual power of ""love and friendship"".God help me.We have a slightly competent friend character who\'s perceptive, yet is somehow content at not doing anything with it. We have the romance interest who seems to prefer creating a toy robot to go hold hands with his love interest instead of actually going and doing it herself. We\'re reaching levels of teenage cringe that shouldn\'t even be possible.We have a couple of loli sidekicks, a damn love square between every woman of note and the MC, which really tries to test the limits of common sense, because I am not kidding when I say the MC is dumber than dirt and would struggle to tie his own shoelaces. Surely not every woman in anime falls for the dumbass? Jesus...There are a few characters who save he show. A mysterious kick-ass teacher who\'s actually S tier competent is a refreshing presence in the show. As is one of the early villains. Everyone else may as well be eating glue for breakfast every morning because they\'re all dumb.A bunch of characters are completely underexplored respite in theory being IMMENSELY important to every aspect of the story. Such as the MC\'s and his love interest\'s parents. An absolutely unbelievable hole that makes no sense, no matter how you look at storytelling and characters.The entire magic school the main characters happen to study at for a whole year, apparently has no other humans than the MC, his childhood best friend, childhood romance interest, and 3 more people. That\'s it.For some reason in episode 5 we got like on random character who got 2 minutes of screentime only to disappear from the entire show afterwards, along with every other student. What a lifeless world.---Total - 7/10---Tokyo Ravens is carried hard by its second half, and more by it\'s solid action scenes and somewhat interesting catharsis with the final stages of the conspiracy involved.

The characters designs are very good, but some characters look like long froggy limbs and stuff... The names are the things that have been messing with my brain. But overall, I recommend watching this anime because it has wonderful 3D arts that actually blended in very well with the 2D arts. But still, I'm hoping for season 2 to come out and solve the cliffhanging in late 2019 or mid-2020.

And that is all you need to know of how Tokyo Ravens treats its story...I never thought I would ever be driven to leave a review but this show was  something else. The first few episodes were so good, but then it got worse, and worse and worse still.The biggest issue with this show is it tries too hard to surprise viewers. Character motivations switch out of nowhere, random nonsense happens that adds nothing to the story. When characters in the show ask ""what is going on?"" and the response...is constantly along the line of ""because reasons"" or simply ""forget about it"" or ""I\'ll tell you later"". Simply omitting important information isn\'t how you build suspense, it doesn\'t make you a smart show. It is just infuriatingAnother issue, the tone changes so drastically it\'ll give you whiplash. I enjoyed the comedic undertones of certain scenes but when the characters don\'t react in a believable way it becomes silly.Oh you just got done randomly sending your spirit outside your body for the first time, copying complicated spells you\'ve seen done once by 3 of the 12 strongest people in your world?

It ambitions was its own downfall. If the series was focused on a smaller scale story with a tighter story beats this show could've been a classic. This kind of show breaks my heart more than plain awful shows.

I found while watching this anime that this statement was either true or completely opposite, and that fluctuation between good and bad is what's going to make it super difficult to write this review. Leaving aside the animation that could be decently done at times (like during certain battles) or bad at others and the sound design, which was bizarre to say the least (songs either fit or really, really didn't), the story and the characters are the two hot topics for me with this anime.I won't lie: I...got super bored way too often watching Tokyo Ravens. Not because there wasn't action or emotional intensity--actually, Tokyo Ravens was chalk full of action--but because a lot of the episodes felt really busy. Battles followed by exposition followed by plot twists and so on. Now, had this been the first Shounen I ever watched, I might have been taken with the complexity of it all, but Tokyo Ravens felt both like a fully built-out world and an overly complicated one. That feeling changed depending on where I was in the story (sometimes I thought the world building was great and other times I thought it was too much). It was enough to make me feel like the episodes were blending into one another and like they were more difficult to get through than they should've been.That being said, I actually really enjoyed the story being told through all of the fluctuations. Another comment I've seen about Tokyo Ravens is that it balances its genres well, and for the most part, I agree. Granted, some of the more comedic moments often felt slightly shoe-horned in, but generally, the romance balanced well against the action and drama and humor. I won't get too into where these characters end up at the end of the anime (especially because this is only the tip of their overall story from the LN), but the last few episodes really solidified my impression that I quite like the plot as well as the characters themselves. There are a few characters that I didn't feel needed to be there for the story to end up where it did, but nonetheless, Tokyo Ravens convinced me to enjoy and root for these characters, and not only that, but to be invested in their relationships with one another.Did Tokyo Ravens perfect any of the elements I just talked about? No. But it really is enjoyable enough to watch (at least it is when the main characters get screen time because those were moments I really enjoyed). It didn't fail to be an entertaining anime, it's just not as polished as other Shounen. Not for lack of trying, though, because it's got lore galore and a pretty rich world that surrounds these interesting characters. The bottom line is: the execution was sloppy, but the elements were great. got super bored way too often watching Tokyo Ravens.

I have to say it's not that impressive, and my expectation wasn't even high, the premise is very cool with the idea of eastern religious practices with magic combat though the series is centered around that, it doesn't even do a good job giving a superficial explanation, it could be the adaptation skipping on minor parts from the source material that would've fleshed out how the magics of this series worked, but I'm forced to sit...back and accept that there's some hidden rock, paper, scissor mechanic going on.The plot itself is left wanting as you're introduced to a set of characters that imply there's more to their appearance, but when their chance to shine as a character and develop comes it does not leave any satisfaction at all, except the main character probably. Character relationships are left to logical inferences, and power dynamics aren't elaborated.

It’s a pretty predictable plot so don’t expect something completely new, with this mindset I watched and I enjoyed most of the episodes and it was an effective way to past time.The art was alright, I’d say the design was not bad but not the greatest eitherThe story was okay, it might be because I wasn’t expecting much so I’m fine with what they threw but it was kind of predictable but it was the worst.The characters weren’t bad and I do think the anime ended up...a lot funnier because of that, episode 10 was a complete the episode I remember the most. Suzuka Dairenji was hilarious with her acts.Overall: a 6/10 a lot funnier because of that, episode 10 was a complete the episode I remember the most.

The story is well-paced, and really divided its main focus throughout, allowing for the world it creates to feel more open and alive. Following the characters and their paths, while also unraveling the deep stories hidden within was surprisingly fun. However, because of this, this anime ends up shooting itself in the foot. The story...becomes so overcomplicated at times that I stopped watching this for a day or two just to wrap my head around it. This anime does a half-ass job when it comes to explaining it all. The story overall is still very good, but it does take some time to fully grasp what is going on.The characters are all surprisingly well done. They all can stand well on their own, and they all feel as though they each fulfill their purpose. However, they also have a bit too much background added to them (some more than others), and in some cases, it doesn't add up. Even though they have deep backgrounds, there is a considerable lack of depth to these characters. In the end, a good cast of characters, some stronger than others. Kon/Hishamaru is my personal favorite.The animation is pretty good for an anime like this. The environments felt well done, and the characters are all expressive. The fighting scenes are also well done, and do a great job at portraying the intensities of the fights. There were times where the art was questionable, but those times are slim to none.Overall, a very fun and entertaining anime, with lots of good things to back it up. At the beginning of watching this, I didn't find it interesting, but as I continued, it picked up the pace and ended with a bang. A season two would be nice, if possible.

Highly recommend this anime to anyone and everyone. becomes so overcomplicated at times that I stopped watching this for a day or two just to wrap my head around it.

I can't really say anything more without spoilers, but to me an ending can make or break a show and this ending broke it. I liked some of the characters and their interactions, and I liked some of the action as well. The magic system didnt really make sense at all though. It kind of felt like they tried to do too much with whatever the system was but that just ended up making it confusing. "", 'Overview:On the surface, ""Tokyo Ravens"" seems to be your typical, run-of-the-mill urban fantasy battle anime we\'ve all seen a hundred times before, but that actually couldn\'t be further from the truth. While it is certainly true that it contains a lot of story beats that will sound familiar to any anime fan, it\'s how these story beats are executed that keeps ""Tokyo Ravens"" more than a few steps above many of its peers. Sure, it does still have plenty of flaws, some of them pretty major and aggravating, but almost none of these flaws have anything to do with the actual premise, and ultimately none...of them were enough to break the series for me.Story & World (7.5/10):The series is set in a alternate version of modern-day Japan populated by Onmyo mages (that\'s mages that specialise in spiritual magic, for those who don\'t know your Japanese mythology). Harutora Tsuchimikado is a lazy, ambitionless young man who lives in the countryside and spends his days hanging out with his friends Touji Ato and Hokuto, and just happens to be a member of a branch family of the Tsuchimikados, one of the most powerful Onmyo mage families in the country. Despite this, Harutora has no interest in becoming an Onmyo mage himself, despite frequent pestering from Hokuto, as he believes he doesn\'t have the talent for it due to having no notable spiritual power. This all changes, however, when his childhood friend and distant cousin, Natsume, comes unexpectedly back into his life. Soon after, he gets attacked by a criminal mage and Hokuto ends up sacrificing herself to save him, which pushes him to become Natsume\'s familiar, thereby fulfilling a promise they made when they were children, finally gaining spiritual power in the process. Unbeknownst to Harutora, however, Natsume and Hokuto are in fact the same person, with the latter being a familiar created by the former to remain close to Harutora during their years apart. After defeating the mage, Harutora moves with Natsume to Tokyo to attend the Onmyo Prep School, accompanied by Touji, who enrolls in the school for reasons of his own, after which various trials await the trio, as well as multiple others they befriend along the way. Finally, there is a rumour that Yakou Tsuchimikado, Harutora and Natume\'s ancestor who was responsible for the revolution of Onmyo magic via a failed ritual several decades ago, has reincarnated as the future head of the family, who is meant to be Natsume, which forms the B-plot of the series.Some of you may find it pretty groan-worthy that the series switches from a countryside setting in the first few episodes to a magic high school in Tokyo, especially since the latter is a setting that we\'ve pretty much all seen before. Fortunately, any fears you may have are quickly put to rest since the school setting is mostly just a background for events than anything else, and we do get to see plenty of the show\'s setting outside of it, with there being many events and even entire episodes that take place outside the school. It doesn\'t handle the setting quite as well as, say, ""Harry Potter"", but it does do a pretty good job at it nonetheless, with the school being treated as just another part of the setting rather than the setting of the series itself. Besides that, the series also has very good pacing, with the majority of episodes serving to develop the story, setting or characters in any small way, shape or form, and there are some pretty surprising plot twists with decent foreshadowing beforehand, though some are easier to see coming than others. The story also deconstructs the role of magic in society and its lack of domestic benefits, with its only use being combat and exorcising spiritual disasters caused by Yakou\'s failed ritual and spiritual terrorism. As such, there are plenty of people fighting over power, which makes for a pretty dark world, which is usually the case when just about every named character is some kind of badass.Unfortunately, the series\' good pacing works just as much against the series as it does for it. That may sound weird to a lot of you, but let me explain. Any plot points that are established early on do get resolved within the anime itself. Unfortunately, from these resolutions, there comes a whole bunch of other plot points that the series ultimately doesn\'t have enough time to follow up or elaborate on. It certainly doesn\'t help that the series adapts only the first major arc of the light novels the show is based off of, meaning there is a huge amount of content that ultimately doesn\'t get adapted. This wouldn\'t be so bad if the arc actually wrapped things up with a good conclusion, but as a result of all the new plot points, the series instead ends on a pretty big cliffhanger, so the show feels unfinished in every sense of the word. Sadly, due to the fact that the anime first aired nearly a decade ago, the chances of ever getting any kind of continuation are increasingly slim.Art & Animation (8.5/10):From start to finish, ""Tokyo Ravens"" is a very good-looking series. The art style won\'t blow you away, but the characters and environments are both very well-drawn and the animation is smooth and fluid. Sure, there are a few special effect failures, such as some moments when CG imagery becomes blatantly obvious, but these are few and far between, and there are plenty of great special effects in the series too, with the look of Natsume\'s dragon familiar being one of the standout examples.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):""Tokyo Ravens"" has a fairly decent soundtrack for the most part. The music that plays during the episodes is fairly forgettable, with few exceptions, but the two opening themes, ""X-encounter"" and ""Outgrow"" are both very good and well worth listening to, even if it is a bit annoying that the latter reuses a lot of the same imagery as the former. The ending themes ""Kimi ga Emu Yūgure"" and ""Break a spell"" are good as well, and it certainly helps that they were sung by Yoshino Nanjo and Mami Kawada, respectively. The voice acting is great; Clifford Chapin, Caitlin Glass and Ian Sinclair do great jobs as Harutora, Natsume and Touji, and the series has a strong cast in general, including semi-veterans such as Jad Saxton, Leah Clark and Josh Grelle as well as some really big names like Christopher Sabat, Todd Haberkorn and Monica Rial, though the former two are pretty underutilized in the series.Characters (7.5/10):At first glance, there doesn\'t seem to be anything particularly special about Harutora, being a seemingly ordinary teenager who gains supernatural powers after a tragedy. Fortunately, this archetype is executed very well in his case, as even after becoming Natume\'s familiar, he isn\'t particularly powerful or smart, even being called ""Stupid Tora"" frequently. However, this is actually more of an affectionate nickname than an insult, since the two people to call him that the most are his two best friends Natsume and Touji, who are the only ones he allows to get away with it. While he doesn\'t have any real skill at first, having to rely on a lot of help from his friends and allies, he improves immensely as the series goes on, which really shows in the final third of the series, becoming not only much stronger, but a lot smarter as well, particularly with some pretty huge revelations regarding his background. As a whole, Harutora\'s story is the journey of a young man who finally finds a true direction in his life, but ends up getting a lot more than he bargained for, and this struggle is a compelling one.That being said, as much as I liked Harutora, I would definitely that I liked Natsume even more. At first, she appears to be an aloof girl who has no interest in making friends, but it quickly becomes clear that this is just a front for how lonely she is, which certainly isn\'t helped by the fact that she has to hide who she really is at school. Specifically, she is forced to pose as a boy due to a family tradition, with only Harutora, Touji and a couple others knowing her true gender. This is also why she was so adamant about Harutora becoming an Onmyo mage- if she\'s going to follow in the footsteps of her family, she at least wants to have someone who truly knows her by her side. While she is sometimes harsh to Harutora, she\'s nice to him significantly more often, and is probably the kindest out of the main cast (at the very least, she\'s the kindest girl). She\'s also very shy and modest, which makes for a lot of very sweet, cute moments, and, to top it all, a total badass. After all, if you\'re able to command a flying horse and friggin\' dragon with ease, you\'re automatically awesome in my book. I pretty much guessed that she would be my favourite character when I wasn\'t even halfway through the series, and she only solidified that status as time went on, as I found myself liking her more and more with every passing episode. What\'s more is that the romance between her and Harutora actually ends up going somewhere instead of their feelings being left ambiguous, though I can\'t say anymore without spoiling something.Next up is Touji Ato, Harutora\'s best friend of several years and a former delinquent, who was a victim of a phenomenon known as the Spiritual Disaster two years prior to the story and has had spiritual powers ever since, meaning he\'s had them for a lot longer than Harutora. As such, he knows the truth regarding Natsume and Hokuto, though he keeps it a secret between himself and her. It\'s quickly revealed that he is part-oni and enrolled in the academy to purify his oni blood, though he soon learns to gain control of it instead. Like Harutora, he falls into a pretty common archetype (the badass, manly best friend), but also like Harutora, he executes the archetype very well and proves himself to be a great final member of the main trio. Besides these three, we also have multiple people they meet during their stay at the academy. Chief among these is Kyoko Kurahashi, the director\'s granddaughter who comes from an aristocratic background. It shows too, since she\'s quite cold towards anyone she doesn\'t trust or have a high opinion of, which includes Harutora in the beginning. She warms up to him soon enough, however, and ultimately proves to be a kind person deep down and loyal friend, though her initial cold self does creep back in again from time to time. There\'s also Suzuka Dairenji, the initial villain of the series who kicks off the plot and later comes to the school as a student. Even after joining the heroes, however, she\'s initially a huge brat, bullying and harassing Harutora and Natsume based on what she knows about the latter (since she saw her in female clothes, she knows Natsume\'s true identity). In short, she\'s even more insufferable than Kyoko is in her first few appearances, though like her, she\'s a good person at heart and has plenty of sympathetic moments.Rounding up the main cast is Tenma Momoe, who unfortunately can\'t compare to whoever\'s been mentioned already. While he does have a clear, defined personality (kind and somewhat cowardly, but brave when the situation calls for it), he\'s easily the least developed out of his friends, which is partially because he\'s the only one with no real focus in the story, with even Kyoko and Suzuka having at least a couple of episodes dedicated to them, and is the only one with no notable backstory. The rest of the cast is plentiful, but my feelings for many of them proved to be very mixed. This is partially because I just didn\'t know what to make of many of them, with it being very ambiguous as to whether they were good, bad or just neutral, though this is probably made less ambiguous in later novels that the anime didn\'t adapt, meaning a lot of them never get any kind of even temporary closure.Enjoyment (7.5/10):""Tokyo Ravens"" may do things a lot differently from its peers, but this comes at the cost of it being a lot darker. While things start off light-hearted enough, with a good amount of comedy and sweet moments, things gradually get darker overtime as we learn more and more about the state of the world and the stakes start to get a lot higher. The last few episodes in particular are really dark and downright sad, topping off with an ending that\'s the very definition of \'bittersweet\' and will make you long all the more for a second season that, as I mentioned above, is unlikely to ever come.Overall:""Tokyo Ravens"" succeeds in taking old, outdated ideas and executing them in ways that makes them feel new and fresh again, complete with good world-building, creative fight scenes, likeable, well-developed characters and great visuals. It\'s a real shame, then, that Eight Bit have expressed no interest in continuing the series, since even towards the end, the story feels like it\'s only just begun and will make you really want to know where it will go next. Unfortunately, unless you\'re a light novel reader (which I\'m not), then this is all you\'ll get for the foreseeable future, which I suppose isn\'t too bad as it\'s still very good even on its own.Score:7.5+8.5+8.5+7.5+7.5=39.5/50=7.9/10 of them were enough to break the series for me.Story & World (7.5/10):The series is set in a alternate version of modern-day Japan populated by Onmyo mages (that\'s mages that specialise in spiritual magic, for those who don\'t know your Japanese mythology).

Sometimes, they're allowed to be 'Tokyo Ravens'; competent, enjoyable, unremarkable, but ultimately worthwhile entertainment."", ""Tokyo Ravens is a loved anime that not a lot of people have seen. I'll get to it below, but the fact of not many people seeing the anime is part of the negatives in my review. I don't use any spoilers in the text below but just discuss some concepts and techniques they were going for with this show.Story: 6/10The story is quite interesting and keeps you entertained the entire way with nothing that would resemble filler. It uses a variety of plot twists to keep you on your toes and wonder where the story is really going to end up, though as it...gets really deep, some foreshadowing gives you a pretty clear idea of what is going to go down and how it might get solved. It might be a bit unfair that I give the story a 6, but this is skewed downward because there is not a second season and there never will be a second season. Without saying anything about the ending, it leaves you the littlest bit confused and personally was feeling unfulfilled. It really set itself up for more content that you can go and find in the manga, but the ending was quite unsatisfying. Big fights that you really expect to go down and felt like were being built up to end up not going down the way you expect or not at all. The ending all in all is the negatives of the story.Art: 8/10I thought the artwork for the characters and settings were really well done. I also liked the animation style that was used in Tokyo Ravens. It was always nice to look at and easy on the eyes.Sound: 8/10Good music selection. People spoke loud and clear, personally enjoyed character voice.Character: 8/10I've watched a lot of Actions, Rom-Coms, and Harem anime and I was pleasantly surprised at how great the main characters were developed (mostly surprised to see such great characters from a Harem). As far as characters getting introduced to you, Tokyo Ravens throws them at you at a reasonable pace and lets you know whats necessary about them when it matters. As I stated just a bit ago, they also develop really well. I enjoyed each characters background and story progression as they were all meaningful from their introduction until the end of the season.Enjoyment: 7/10I enjoyed watching Tokyo Ravens quite a bit. I was entertained all the way through with its characters and story progression. As stated earlier, I was a bit irritated over the lack of a fulfilling ending, but still enjoyed it the rest of the ride. I think the manga/LN might end up being a lot better, but I'm not sure. I heard from others sources that some material is rushed through and that we only have about half the material since it was expected orginally to get a second season. Due to the lack of people watching it around release even until today, it didn't really create any significant monetary gains, so it will not see a second season of an anime.Overall: 8/10I am willing to rate it pretty highly even with my disappointment with there not being a second season. I hope people watch this anyways if not just read the manga/LN.This was my first even review on MAL, but I hope it was helpful. Thanks. gets really deep, some foreshadowing gives you a pretty clear idea of what is going to go down and how it might get solved.

The ending's in both shows were really bad, early on both of them show that there not scared to kill off characters. But my main issue is that I feel...characters deaths didn't feel sad as they had no time to develop like Hokuto she died in Episode two that's about 25 minutes she has to develop of course your not going to care to much, so then you think well she will probably be brought back in the last episode maybe because at this point she served about no purpose besides being a meat shield so you end up watching through the anime and its not unbearable but the characters don't get developed a whole lot but it is only 24 episodes so it can't be pushed to hard on that front but when you get to the ending its just a big fuck you, you think no they would either not bring her back and leave it like that or bring her back but instead of taking the normal option (where you know that you can revive the dead as its stated) no instead of that lets just take incest. characters deaths didn't feel sad as they had no time to develop like Hokuto she died in Episode two that's about 25 minutes she has to develop of course your not going to care to much, so then you think well she will probably be brought back in the last episode maybe because at this point she served about no purpose besides being a meat shield so you end up watching through the anime and its not unbearable but the characters don't get developed a whole lot but it is only 24 episodes so it can't be pushed to hard on that front but when you get to the ending its just a big fuck you, you think no they would either not bring her back and leave it like that or bring her back but instead of taking the normal option (where you know that you can revive the dead as its stated) no instead of that lets just take incest."", ""I've heard and seen small clips of Tokyo Ravens throughout the years and finally watched it recently. While I spent a lot of time thinking at first that it was simply going to be an average magic anime, I quickly found it to be 30% focused on relationships between the characters and 70% of just sh*t going down constantly, which entertained me well enough. I found myself really enjoying certain character developments but also finding things a bit stale when it came to friendship and romance.Each character plays their own part, and their overall interactions feel natural. I really enjoyed this watch, but I...must warn you that this anime would require a second season to cover the entire story, which I would doubt is happening. I'm not a LN reader, so I just have to imagine the complete story I suppose. If a season 2 or any other chance to finish the complete story does come up though, I would definitely jump on it.Tokyo Ravens - 7.5 for animation, 9 for enjoyment (which matters most to me) must warn you that this anime would require a second season to cover the entire story, which I would doubt is happening.

Nothing really stunning or amazing. If there was anything in this anime that I truly had to say was good, was the voice actors and the designs for the more complex familiars. Overall this anime was quite generic with a predictable plot.Story: 6This anime had possibly a great story and a great plot, but unfortunately with what good plot they had, they just gave basic tripe that really doesn\'t stand out. They were more focused on making the main character have a love connection then really make sense to the plot. With 24 episodes, it felt like I...legitimately went no where. I actually had to skip through most parts of this anime because it was either boring or was just pointless filler, almost like they threw the characters in just to remind you they are there, or to give the VA something to say so they get a paycheck. I\'m not sure if it was because I skipped seconds here and there, but I did get slightly confused with who was on what side since they made it so intricate, that unless you really paid attention, you couldn\'t figure out who is fighting on what side and why they were fighting.Art: 8Like I said before, the art was pretty good. Nothing really stellar about it, but some of the familiars that the main characters had were quite intricate and cool looking.Sound: 7Like someone else said, they had no real stellar songs that made that moment memorable. The fight scenes felt bland without them. Usually the music motivates you and you feel the energy and emotion the character is feeling, but this anime lacks that. The VA\'s were well picked and quite a large cast. Nothing sounded funky or weird with the VA\'s or the sound effects.Characters: 5Ahh the characters. They had so much potential with the characters, but it fell quite short of stupendous or even good. Again, like I said before, they really focused on trying to give our main character a love interest, and unfortunately that meant 3 different females. Thankfully the most they ever really get into the relationship is the females having slight amorous fantasies (off screen, but very evident they are having). As for the other ""main"" characters that weren\'t Natsume or Haruto, they got little to no character development. Even the main characters got little development past, we grew up and now I kinda like you. I learned little to nothing about any of the characters other than Touji having a notable secret and a bad boy past. That\'s it. They had such good characters, Touji being special, and the divine guardians or whatever they\'re called, but you learn nothing about them. I felt like the 12 guardians (if that\'s even what they were called), was more like the Pirates of the Carribeans, 9 pieces of 8 BS (don\'t ask why). You only see a whole 5 of them, you don\'t understand how they are ranked or how they even get that position. They are just there because and they are supposedly super strong, but as seen throughout the anime, apparently that is only when it pertains to the plot. If not they are about as strong as the average character. That\'s the other thing, the strengths of the characters felt like they were at a stand still. With how much they study and learn, they got no stronger than they were at the beginning of the anime or whenever they first gained their powers. I felt like I was at a complete standstill.Overall: 6I personally only remained watching this because of Touji due to him kinda being cute, and the fact he was being voiced by Ian Sinclair. Overall I felt like the anime developed little in plot and in story. The characters felt like bricks that gained little to no growth. This anime did not take me on an adventure like others did. This one took me on a long long ride that felt like I went no where and gained little out of it, other than some solace that in the end everyone is alright. Not my cup of tea, but that is for you to judge. I definitely say give it a go. It doesn\'t really pick up until around episode 3 or 4 if I remember correctly. legitimately went no where.

The plot itself might have been okay but the story telling was so bad that the characters would sometimes just have to explain why things were happening because it wouldn\'t make sense otherwise.  Not only that, the script was so bad it felt like i was having the raw authors notes read to me by the voice actors.For example, when that Saotome girl...appeared out of nowhere and wanted to be their friend.  And then with no development whatsoever she grew attached enough to the main characters to go quote on quote berserk when Natsume dies.  And then the writer had her lackey tell us it was because she genuinely wanted friends since she was lonely.  I genuinely laughed out loud at this point.  It felt like the writer was saying to me, ""you know that trope right? ok good we\'ve all seen it before so I\'m not going to explain it in detail.""Let\'s move on to characters.  For simply following character tropes I don\'t understand how this went so wrong.  The most annoying character, the tsundere, got more development and interaction with the main character than anyone else.  The main character trope is supposed to be someone who is hopeless but steps up to bat when it matters, except he never does he just stands there with his mouth gaping whenever things are happening.  The half ogre wingman guy had so much potential but after that one episode about his past he just continued to exist like a non-player who just stood on the sidelines and supported.  Everyone else is just a 2 dimensional trope ok we\'ve been through this, but at least give Natsume some development if she\'s going to be a main, like does she have a favourite food or a habit, anything.That brings us to main seems to have no romantic interest in the main girl whatsoever. He had a little bit with Hokuto but then she disappeared he was fine with it as long as she was alive somewhere and he could potentially meet her again.  Then with Natsume, he was so content with just being friends he ran the possibility that she is Hokuto despite the facts staring him in the face.  Even after having it shoved in his face he seems to have menial interest in her, seeming more concerned about it than excited.  What was even the point of adding romantic elements in this?  Like who is this for? Even young boys who fantasize over having every girl like them would at least want the girls to be someone they like back right?Ok rant over.  Trash will be trash and I will still give it a 6 because there is worse trash out there. appeared out of nowhere and wanted to be their friend.

However, the world is still really interesting and leaves the want to learn more. In terms of character development, it does so over time.

The OVA doesn\'t put an end to the anime\'s ending (considering the manga wasn\'t finished right after this event) and just acts as something cool which was added to give me more screen time to the characters (in an ovbiously funny and soft way). So basically you will get to see every major characters +...every minor characters (except a few) put all together in a canon story.It should be seen after you watched the 12 episodes, so you can understand every aspect; without that, it might be a mess. There is no addition to the original plot but it remains very funny to watch, with a cool song at the end. I consider it as a ""good bye"" to the viewers, but not something radical (unlike Kill la Kill\'s OVA, which acted as a ""no more screen time for the anime, thank you for watching and understanding""). To me, it would have been a decent transition between season one and two, to make people being patient... but there is no season 2 and there won\'t be any - 99.99% sure -. So yeah, I really think it should be taken as a friendly last screen time for the whole anime.Don\'t be sad though, the manga - even finished nowadays - adds a ton lots of stuff.

I presume when the second part came out it was during the school festival as more of a .5 to whatever episode that was.The reason it is so odd is that the OVA pair is a two-part show. It is odd to see the first half then watch a fair amount of the show then to see the second part. In that...regard, I am glad to have watched this in 2020 to see the main show then the OVA.For a two-part OVA being just under an hour in total, it was very much like a short film. It doesn't independently really introduce anyone that greatly and you are expected to know the characters. This would be odd if you watched the first part when it came out. Unless you read the source material.Nevermind that because it is actually a really great OVA. Fun, romantic at times and really well done.I really did enjoy the usual suspects in their roles. Nao for me is still the best girl. It was however really nice to see Asuka being herself. Would love to know more about her. Also seeing Rika and her no underwear thing was pretty funny.This had some hard bits because firstly the 3 guys who are the bad ones from before I just can never accept as decent. Also, the 3 bullies from the main show are also no matter what awful characters since they made no way of trying to apologise and just suddenly changed.Other than that the OVA is really well done and very much great to have watched.

It doesn't independently really introduce anyone that greatly and you are expected to know the characters. This would be odd if you watched the first part when it came out. Unless you read the source material.Nevermind that because it is actually a really great OVA. Fun, romantic at times and really well done.I really did enjoy the usual suspects in their roles. Nao for me is still the best girl. It was however really nice to see Asuka being herself. Would love to know more about her. Also seeing Rika and her no underwear thing was pretty funny.This had some hard bits because firstly the 3 guys who are the bad ones from before I just can never accept as decent.

Urusei Yatsura (2022),https://myanimelist.net/anime/50710/Urusei_Yatsura_2022,"['Since this will be my first time writing a preliminary review, it will be quite brief and will make changes once completed.I watched episode 1 out of whim and gave me massive Doraemon vibes (though it\'s vastly different from that), so I kept on watching it and so far, it\'s pretty good.Story:The charm is in how stupid it is. This is about a lot of idiots and hilarious concepts mixed together, and I think it works just great. I don\'t really expect or even hope for this to be anything more than what it sets out to be, so if the story ever gets better,...I think it\'ll be a fantastic anime.Characters:Again, goofballs. Stereotypical goofballs. Ataru is just Nobita (same analogy with their parents), except he\'s not 10 or 11, Lum is just Doraemon if Doraemon happens to be an alien Pikachu waifu (I know, that\'s weird analogy), Shinobu is just Shizuka with less brain and more dramatic, Mendou is just ""Dekisugi X Suniyo"", and I know I\'m just making assumptions but that\'s the best I can describe them.Comedy:Humor is always and will always be subjective. As with dad jokes, not everyone will find ""Joe mama"" jokes amusing. Whether you laugh or not, all depends on you.The humor\xa0follows the traditional formula of anime comedy: EXAGGERATION and Perversion. The art style frequently deviates from its regular motifs for comedic effect, creating unexpected or absurd circumstances for the characters to find themselves in (often sexual ones), and having voice actors scream their hearts out at every line.If that\'s your style of humor, try it out. Otherwise, omit it. From what I\'ve seen of the first four episodes, it doesn\'t seem like the anime will be anything more than that.Art Style and Animation:The character designs are gleaming, the animators have taken care to make sure everyone looks good, and even our scoundrel protagonist doesn\'t seem too awful. Although occasionally it just seems like cardboard-like pictures are walking and hopping about with a slow framerate, making it a bit unnatural, the\xa0animation is rarely a turnoff. Although the first episode made great use of vibrant color\xa0schemes and lighting effects, I haven\'t noticed much of that in subsequent episodes. The majority of the backgrounds remain static, which is what most strongly reminds me of Doraemon from the 2000s.Voice acting and Music:Voice acting is obviously exaggerated. Since I occasionally genuinely wish to punch Ataru, I believe the VAs are working just fine. There shouldn\'t be any unhappiness in that area because popular voice actors from the industry are used in the development... I believe. The opening scene is visually spectacular, the background\xa0music is fine, and the accompanied song is sufficiently appealing. I didn\'t like the ending song so much though.Who should watch this?It\'s Ecchi High-school Comedy with loads of goofballs, exaggerated comedy, and good production values. And it\'s doing pretty well at what it\'s trying to do. Though I say it reminds me of Doraemon, the comedy is similar to that of \'Grand Blue\', if that helps.There will be the same argument between older people who don\'t like the reboot alterations and younger people who are dissatisfied that the adaption doesn\'t live up to the original\'s standing as a classic. It would be impolite to declare ""it doesn\'t matter,"" but try not to let those things interfere with your enjoyment. Many\xa0old anime series are getting reboots, which is wonderful since it allows younger generations to view a classic in a new light.Let\'s just take the ride for the time being. I think it\'ll be a fantastic anime.Characters:Again, goofballs. Stereotypical goofballs.

The famed female mangaka that has brought us classics like Maison Ikkoku, Ranma ½ and Inuyasha to name a few, because they all got their anime adaptations to add to their name. But there is one series that stands above all: the very first work that would help elevate Takahashi to her ""Hall of Fame"" status that we know of today, and that is Urusei Yatsura.A little story about this incredibly well-known series: In 1977, Rumiko Takahashi created the short story ""Those Selfish Aliens"", that would serve...as the basis for creating Urusei Yatsura, which was first published a year later when Takahashi was 21 years old, with the series being her first major work, having previously only published short stories and is a combination of romantic comedy, science fiction, suburban life, and Japanese folktales. The title of the series is an untranslatable pun on the word urusai (うるさい), meaning ""noisy"" or ""obnoxious"", but written with the Chinese character for ""planet""; the title can be translated roughly into English as ""Those Obnoxious Aliens"". This was due to the fact that she had been dreaming about the overall universe of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young, mentioning that the series ""really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because then I could write any way I wanted to"". To go to great lengths, she wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next manga panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader and would create new characters when she ran out of ideas.And when it came time to the 1st anime adaptation of her major hit series, it started 41 years to the very day that the modern reboot was also released: October 14, on the very same TV network that it first aired: Fuji TV. This was definitely a long time coming for fans wanting to experience Urusei Yatsura in its modern heyday, but without actually having to view the old-school filter, which don\'t get me wrong, the 1981 TV series has a charm on its own right. Where the 2022 version separated it from its original 41-year old counterpart, it was announced that within a 2 x 2-cour, 46-episode series, it\'ll show the best that Rumiko Takahashi\'s 34 volume long manga series has to offer, essentially defining the 2022 TV series as the ""All Stars"" treatment of the manga in random, shuffling order. The TL;DR is this: without having to watch the 1981 anime series, the 2022 series is about as close as good as it gets for a modern reboot and refresh, which obviously save for the fact that it\'s an incomplete, but the adaptation of the best-of-the-best that Urusei Yatsura has to offer.It\'s pretty safe to say that Rumiko Takahashi also set the record straight for the waifu culture that we have today, all thanks to Urusei Yatsura. It all starts with a simple objective of the Earth\'s invasion from supernatural aliens, and all that it requires is a game of tag a.k.a the game of the Oni to determine whether Earth gets invaded or not. The challengers: the goofball womanizer Ataru Moroboshi vs. the daughter of the invader aliens, Lum. Immediately, a human and an alien, it\'s apparent of the winning side being the aliens, but because that Ataru is a selfless womanizer looking for love like the goofball he is to get constant rejections, save for his legit girlfriend in the form of childhood friend-cum-classmate Shinobu Miyake, ultimately won in the end, but at a cost: grabbing the horns of an alien and declaring a win over her, misinterpreting it means a marriage proposal, and this is the story that ensues between Lum, Ataru and the other characters to be seen around the series.The characters are the beating heart of Urusei Yatsura, especially the girls, of which Lum would have the distinction of being the very first waifu character. With her flying capability and electric shocks for more than just controlling Ataru down when he\'s out and about trying to flirt with any girl or woman he sees, Lum is the series\' beloved character who\'ll come to degy Urusei Yatsura as a whole. With Shinobu, she\'s the unequivocal girlfriend material, if not for Lum who would steal her place as Ataru\'s wedded. Character names often carry extra meanings used to describe a character\'s personality or other traits. For example, the name Ataru Moroboshi refers to being hit by a star, a reference to the aliens and other people who gather around him. The name Shinobu suggests a patient character; however, this in contrast to the character\'s actual personality. The others from tycoon man Shutaro Mendo and young alien baby Ten, they are all charming in their own right, especially Mendo, who has to live with Ataru\'s idiosyncrasies on the pursuit of becoming the ladies\' man. All of them are iconic characters that have a part of their personality learnt and duplicated with so many series overtime, you\'ll have Rumiko Takahashi to thank of her genius minds at the time when anything goes for a manga.Being a modern reboot, I was definitely interested to hear which studio would be the choice pick, and lo and behold, it\'s the veteran studio David Production. Being a studio of venerable quaity that\'s proven with the Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure series, it pretty much is a straight 1-to-1 adaptation of the beloved hit manga series that it\'s based upon, so no problems since it\'s just trying to tell some of its greatest unlinked episodes with mini arcs in-between. Colourful, vibrant and impeccable production is what I will give to this show for being consistent all the way through.For the music, it\'s all a string of artist collaborations through and through. MAISONdes has a hand on all of the OST that is produced for this 4-cour long series, and at the very least for now, I find that the 1st Cour\'s OST is a lot better than the 2nd Cour\'s selections. ""AIUE"" (feat. Minami and SAKURAmoti) and my absolute favourite song of the lot that is ""Tokyo Shandy Rendevous"" (feat. KAF, Tsumiki) are two catchy banging respective OP and ED songs respectively that kick off the show into high gear, espeically with their accompanying visuals that are a great start to the series, from the manga panels of years gone by to the whimsical ED that\'s a throwback. The 2nd Cour\'s ""Aiwanamchū"" (feat. asmi, Surii) and ""Aitarinai"" (feat. yama, Nito) are still good songs, but the visuals are disappointing to say the least, or rather, somewhere along the line, the producers got lazy with the OST portion.At the end of the day, a reboot is a reboot, and don\'t go thinking that Urusei Yatsura will have the attention of something like Fruits Basket, where the reboot will elevate the source material to more greatness. To me, Urusei Yatsura in its own ""All Stars"" treatment is as good as it comes, packed together with its slapstick comedy moments that the famed mangaka has sucker-punched us time and time again with flawless execution. It\'s a little bit on the underdone side, but hey, since we\'re going to have Round 2 of this in the future, why not? The jokes are of more hits and less misses, the atmospheric vibes are there, and this is how I think that this show truly wants to be like.Don\'t just take the word that we don\'t need reboots like these to ultimately waste the time and effort that the production staff team have been wanting to spearhead this for the longest time, I highly, HIGHLY recommend giving Urusei Yatsura a go if you don\'t want to dabble on the 1981 OG TV series.Thank you, Rumiko Takahashi, Urusei Yatsura is an experience to be behold. as the basis for creating Urusei Yatsura, which was first published a year later when Takahashi was 21 years old, with the series being her first major work, having previously only published short stories and is a combination of romantic comedy, science fiction, suburban life, and Japanese folktales.

It doesn't have some overarching plot or goal but more of a continuation of the MCs life after each comedic situation. It reminds me a lot of American cartoons where you have a given amount of characters and you put them into different situations each ep. I do not think this show is for everybody some people might find the show quite dated in its comedy or the characters can be seen as extremely cliché. However to me the...show is quite self aware and keeps it light hearted and fun. Its great to watch something not having to think deep and just laugh at some jokes which is all I ever need in a comedy anime. Also the art style is pretty cool. show is quite self aware and keeps it light hearted and fun.

I believe David Production did an awesome job revitalising a classic and making it accessible for a new generation while still keeping the same charm that made it so popular.As a massive fan of all of Takahashi Rumiko’s works I was really excited to hear we’d be getting more Urusei Yatsura. This series was revolutionary when it first came out and is recognised by many as the origin of many common tropes that we see every season in anime, most notably Lum as the...first tsundere. I enjoyed the episodic slice of life/monster of the week style of storytelling and found the show to be an excellent way to wind down towards the end of the week. There’s not much of an overarching story going on, but over the course of the season we’re introduced to new characters who pretty much all personify some sort of archetype. While the show leans HEAVY into a lot of what are now considered common tropes, it’s important to remember that at the time these were innovative and new. I found the playful nature of every episode and the antics to be fun. It can be a bit repetitive at times, and Akaru is an idiot as an MC, but it just works for me and I love the characters.It’s important to note that this is not a 1:1 remake of the original either, so it should be a fun watch for fans of the original and newcomers. It’s still got the same general storyline, but they’ve changed some things up and tried to make a new experience.David Production used an art style that feels true to the original while also fitting in perfectly with modern anime. I love the shiny colours, the eyes, just designs in general were really good in this. The animation itself isn’t anything crazy since it’s a gimmick slice of life series, but quality remained top notch and consistent throughout. The OST, OP and ED for both cours were great too with wonderful performances from my favourite singer Minami.Urusei Yatsura is a solid modern interpretation of a classic series that really influenced all modern romance anime. It may not be perfect, but it’s a very enjoyable ride that offers loveable characters, some solid comedy and beautiful art. No complaints from me and I can’t wait to see what the next season brings.Urusei Yatsura remake gets 9 out of 10. first tsundere.

Mainstream shows such as Bleach got the continuation treatment while old school franchises like Bastard!! Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy got a new adaptation. What if I told you that Urusei Yatsura gets another chance in the modern age too? Just saying that almost sounds unbelievable.Remaking an anime always carries its risks. Fans expects a remake to match or even outperform the original. This is easily applied to the case for Urusei Yatsura, in which the manga series has gained an international audience. Expectations are high and when we got the announcement of...the remake, it's obvious that fans wanted to get the most out of this show. After all, it did also influence other anime in the past and still continues to influence in the present. Mind you, Urusei Yatsura does something that should easily be accepted by viewers: to entertain.The Urusei Remake largely adapts the same premise as the original. I have not seen the original series but as a new viewer, the first few episodes accomplishes the series' intention to bring together two vastly different characters. Meet the ordinary Ataru Moroboshi and the not so normal, bubbly alien Lum. Almost like a fate-like scenario , the two are tied together by perhaps the biggest misunderstanding I've seen in recent anime. The word 'marriage' should be treated as an understatement because Ataru's life changes forever. In the meantime, Lum herself finds attracted to Ataru despite his high libido. And at that point, you have to ask yourself how these two can be together.Trust me, it's not that hard to see how a big misunderstanding managed to create such an unorthodox couple. The anime tosses common sense out of the window with Lum's childishness. Always seeking to impress Ataru, Lum becomes a testament of childness, like a kid  trying to get their parents attention. It also doesn't help that Ataru is always trying to get Shinobu, his ex-girlfriend back to him. On most cases, it can take some time to tolerate the main cast. Characters such as Ataru, Lum, and Shinobu has a tendency to throw tandrums, and this occurs almost on a daily basis. The show also connects the three into a love polygon when we meet Shutaro Mendou, a young man who finds himself attracted to Lum. As you imagine, this sparks feelings of jealousy from Ataru and the rest is history. Really though, this anime tests characters' emotions at every chance it gets. Often times, these goes to extreme lengths with cases such as Lum and Ataru. The gag humor theme tag is appropriate for this show as the anime often doesn't take itself seriously. Even during moments that does, those moments pass quickly and we feel the cartoony gag humor as shown in every episode. Narratively speaking, the anime follows a sit-com format that connects the overarching themes together. However, many episodes consists of standalones that doesn't focus too much on plot depth or character development. If you're looking for a deeply engaging anime about character study and realistic romance, this is not the place.If you watch Urusei Yastura without a specific goal in mind, then it's probably for the best because this anime does its best when treated as entertainment. The idea of having a romance angle connecting two very incompatible characters draws in nothing less than daily shenanigans and drama. Whether it's at home, on the street, or at school, you can bet that Ataru's life is never the same again. With a colorful supporting cast such as Ran, Rei, Sakura, Ryuunosuke, and among others, the remake seems to never ran out of steam. Keep in mind that this just the first two-cours that consists of 23 episodes. We're only half way to go before this remake is fully over so brace yourself for another season of Urusei Yatsura entertainment.I have to applaud David Production for an outstanding job at bringing this remake to a modern audience. The promotional material lived up to its hype and manage to adapt this anime to the highest quality possible, while also maintaining an old school feel. The character designs looks vibrant that displays the alluring looks of Lum and butt monkey expressions of Ataru. It amplifies the humor gag by having characters react in overexaggerated ways that often pushes the boundaries of humor. Trust me, you'll be laughing a lot out of this show. And of course, you'll be bedazzled by the voice acting. I can say with supreme confidence that not only do the catchy theme songs live up to modern standards but the voice acting too. There's not one episode that I felt the characters felt out of place. On all accounts, the director, studio, and staff created this show for what it lives up to.We're fortunate to be living in an age where any anime can be resurrected and remade to gain a new audience. Urusei Yatsura is such an example that is so much more than just an anime. It's cultural sensation that has influenced other franchises and ultimately, one that deserved this remake. And with another 23 episodes awaiting on the horizon, it's time to get entertained. the remake, it's obvious that fans wanted to get the most out of this show.

The show also connects the three into a love polygon when we meet Shutaro Mendou, a young man who finds himself attracted to Lum. As you imagine, this sparks feelings of jealousy from Ataru and the rest is history. Really though, this anime tests characters' emotions at every chance it gets. Often times, these goes to extreme lengths with cases such as Lum and Ataru. The gag humor theme tag is appropriate for this show as the anime often doesn't take itself seriously. Even during moments that does, those moments pass quickly and we feel the cartoony gag humor as shown in every episode. Narratively speaking, the anime follows a sit-com format that connects the overarching themes together. However, many episodes consists of standalones that doesn't focus too much on plot depth or character development. If you're looking for a deeply engaging anime about character study and realistic romance, this is not the place.If you watch Urusei Yastura without a specific goal in mind, then it's probably for the best because this anime does its best when treated as entertainment. The idea of having a romance angle connecting two very incompatible characters draws in nothing less than daily shenanigans and drama. Whether it's at home, on the street, or at school, you can bet that Ataru's life is never the same again. With a colorful supporting cast such as Ran, Rei, Sakura, Ryuunosuke, and among others, the remake seems to never ran out of steam. Keep in mind that this just the first two-cours that consists of 23 episodes. We're only half way to go before this remake is fully over so brace yourself for another season of Urusei Yatsura entertainment.I have to applaud David Production for an outstanding job at bringing this remake to a modern audience. The promotional material lived up to its hype and manage to adapt this anime to the highest quality possible, while also maintaining an old school feel. The character designs looks vibrant that displays the alluring looks of Lum and butt monkey expressions of Ataru. It amplifies the humor gag by having characters react in overexaggerated ways that often pushes the boundaries of humor. Trust me, you'll be laughing a lot out of this show. And of course, you'll be bedazzled by the voice acting. I can say with supreme confidence that not only do the catchy theme songs live up to modern standards but the voice acting too. There's not one episode that I felt the characters felt out of place. On all accounts, the director, studio, and staff created this show for what it lives up to.We're fortunate to be living in an age where any anime can be resurrected and remade to gain a new audience. Urusei Yatsura is such an example that is so much more than just an anime. It's cultural sensation that has influenced other franchises and ultimately, one that deserved this remake. And with another 23 episodes awaiting on the horizon, it's time to get entertained."", ""‟One day, 40 years ago, Rumiko Takashi made a manga, waifu was born and the rest is history”Urusei Yatsura is a classic, a reference and a pioneer in the romcom genre, having this historic piece of japanese animation being remade in the beautiful craftsmanship of today's visuals, seiyuu and musics is a great honour for this anime, the idea of remaking a classic but way nicer is a nice way to make the new generation of anime fan enjoy grandpa anime peak, but does Urusei Yatsura (2022) fulfil this task and makes it an enjoyable watch ? Maybe, it's pretty complicated. It's sad to say,...it had everything to be good, everything except this caveat, this thing that stuck with me the most during this watching, IT. IS. NOT. FUNNY. Before arguing, let me explain in the following paragraphs.It is VERY important to note that comedy and what you find funny is SUBJECTIVE, everyone has their own taste in comedy, and a certain person can find something extremely hilarous while their neighbour would have a straight and apathetic face, AND THAT'S OK. If you've found Urusei Yatsura funny, it's understandable, it's made to be funny and it's filled with silly jokes. But as for myself, this was the least funniest anime that I've seen yet. I haven't been able to enjoy more than 75% of the episodes because except thinking hmm ok and maybe a smile once or twice per episode, most random comedic story is very plain and 1D. I really feel like it's because the jokes are too old, most of them are simply unfunny and sometimes just wrong or malicious (it could work in a more enjoyable anime where something somewhat offensive could be used as something to bounce of and make something good out of it, but not there). It just keeps repeating itself and never tries to make it another way, it's just the same bland thing over and over that I cannot find to enjoy, which is a bummer compared to the rest.What's the rest ? Something quite qualitative I would say, and the reason why it's generally pretty acclaimed as something neat. Compared to the original anime adaptation that's still pretty old, it's not a question to ask if it's better now, because it obviously is, it's really like a ULTRA HD 4K HDR version of it (even though I could say that after a while the outsourcing kinda shows and that's unfortunate that David Production wasn't able to deliver fully for all 23 episodes of something that wasn't that hard to achieve) and graphics are one of the main way you can hook a random anime watcher to a certain anime, or else they will just say it looks shit/old and won't watch it, it's the most important part that they made in order for the new era of anime watchers to see this. Something that they definitively didn't cheap on are the seiyuu that they used for the characters. There is a plethora of them, and there is a pretty high likelihood and if you know a certain seiyuu, it will be featured in this anime, which is always epic to see and excite yourself about. The final thing I wanna mention that's so great about this anime are it's Openings and Ending, MAISONdes outdid themselves and literally made the best opening of 2022, it's an absolute banger and I'm very impressed by it, it's of course always secondary to the content and execution, but a very neat part of it. So yeah generally this anime is very polished and a lot of effort was put into it, which is a sign of quality.In a way, it's hard to determine if it's a good watch or not, outside of the peak that's episode 10 (won't say anything about it to avoid spoiling), I did not find it enjoyable, but that's only on a very subjective part of the anime, so I can't really say it's bad in any way, especially how strong the other parts of this anime is. I would probably say that the comedy is hit or miss, so it'll probably be up to you to determine if after 2-3 episodes you find it comedic or not, if you do, you'll most likely have a blast, if you find it unfunny, please  stop, it's the exact same mistake being repeated over and over again, and I will have told you that it's not that funny. To conclude, the reboot of Urusei Yatsura is a cool idea, having already a season 2 announced might just make a best of everything the original manga and anime has to offer, in a way that anyone can enjoy, but I won't be watching that as for myself. it had everything to be good, everything except this caveat, this thing that stuck with me the most during this watching, IT.

This is a remake of an older series we never asked for, but in the end, I’m glad this remake exists, as it’s a way for the newer generation of anime fans to watch a show with an older style of dialogue and humour, with more modernized animation. Admittedly, I’ve only skimmed through some of the original 1981 version, but I could tell that the remake is an extremely truncated version of the original. That said, as I’m someone who only watched the remake, I can still say that I more or less enjoyed...what was presented.This show is just simple, dumb comedy, that sometimes works really well, and sometimes flops on its face, and that’s because comedy is subjective, a phrase I’m sure many of you will have heard when comedy is discussed in a more analytical mindset. It’s inevitable that some jokes land, and some don’t, but when they land, they are genuinely quite hilarious. It embraces how stupid it is, it never really escapes its stupidity, and that’s fine. Don’t expect any semblance of a plot, or much progression in romance, it’s more of an episodic comedy than anything else, though some episodes build upon previous ones.The characters are just a big cast of idiots. Ataru is someone you want to just punch. He’s basically unlikable in every way, and the show realizes that, so they double down on making him as scummy as possible. He flirts with every girl he meets, and no one around him has a good time.As for Lum, she’s often called as “the first waifu”. She embodies most of the qualities that waifus have nowadays, but that’s about it. She gets jealous, and she zaps people.The side characters have their moments, and each have their gimmicks. I suppose that’s a problem of the show, with the characters being so gimmicky and one-note, but in a gag comedy like this, it doesn’t really matter.The modernized animation will definitely bring more viewers into this series, and make this show more accessible, which is always a welcome thing. However, I would venture a guess that the old style also worked well in its own way.I would also like to highlight that both openings and endings were absolute bangers, and I enjoyed listening to them all. Shout out to MAISONdes and their featured artists for their performances.Overall, this show was a decent watch, once I learned to not take it remotely seriously. It’s simply a dumb comedy, and it might work for you, it might not work for you. One thing is for sure though, I’ll definitely be checking out the original in a bit more detail, as there’s probably some more meaningful storytelling to be found there. what was presented.This show is just simple, dumb comedy, that sometimes works really well, and sometimes flops on its face, and that’s because comedy is subjective, a phrase I’m sure many of you will have heard when comedy is discussed in a more analytical mindset.

He really brought down this show for me, and from the sounds of it he is the reason all the others exist by setting the prescient. He is the always horny, flirting with every girl in sight, peeping on them, but the moment they give consent he suddenly loses all interest. It got real old fast honestly he brought down my enjoyment alot. It almost seems like he doesn't want to do sexy things unless the other person doesn't want it cause lum is head over heals, and he avoids her the whole...show like a plague. Well not at first but the moment she shows interest. I liked the other characters and the animation and art looked great, but I don't know man just can't stand him even with my enjoyment of the other parts. show like a plague. Well not at first but the moment she shows interest. I liked the other characters and the animation and art looked great, but I don't know man just can't stand him even with my enjoyment of the other parts."", 'As a remake of an old classic, Urusei Yatsura is a show I really wanted to like. To my understanding it\'s one of those early cases of the harem genre, or a precursor to it at least, so I wanted to see what it was all about and what people saw in it that was so great. However, as the episodes went on I found myself wanting to skip more and more of the episode and finding myself able to tolerate the character\'s antics less and less. It\'s not like there were no funny moments, but the vast majority of the comedy only managed to...bore me. Part of this is likely just that the show\'s sense of humor doesn\'t resonate with mine very well, but I think there are two much bigger problems at heart here, both which put together I would describe as ""the show is too one-sided"".The first problem is the characters. For one thing they seem to be perpetually metaphorically if not literally talking past each other. They all have their own consistent goals, motivations and personality, but it becomes clear that its actually kind of rare for two characters to engage in dialogue without dismissing what the other is saying in one form or another, such as by anger, but putting on a farce and looking down on the other, by literally ignoring them, or only responding in quips for a banter or a joke. The plot doesn\'t seem to so much progress by the logical interactions of what characters are saying or doing but because each character is acting of their own accord and happens to ram into what another character or characters are doing. The one exception is some jealousy-based plot where someone is actively attempting to sabotage another or otherwise be antagonistic to them.Then there\'s how so many of the characters seem to continually act in a really mean way. It\'s not like they (or some of them, anyway) don\'t have a reason to be the way they are (Shinobu\'s treatment of Ataru is kind of understandable considering his general behavior, for instance), but only Ataru and Lum seem to do anything genuinely kind for another - and even then Ataru is difficult to put up with due to his sheer inability to have an ounce of self control, and Lum may be an incredibly devoted wife and kind person but still acts like it\'s strange that Ataru who spend the whole first episode being motivated by his love for Shinobu (and declaring as much to the world) wouldn\'t just accept her one-sided declaration to be his wife.Ataru\'s occasional kindness is what leads me to the second problem: The show only seems to understand half of the concept of karma. The show is really good at punishing people for their misdeeds - and Lord knows there\'s plenty of them - but the other way around is hardly ever the case, at least not the in short term. In fact, when a character does display some kind of kindness or integrity they seem to be punished for it anyways. As an occasional joke this can work very well, and the fact it occurs right at the start of the show is kind of justifiable as a set up to the premise and because in the long run the show clearly wants us to believe Lum is the right fit for Ataru and his efforts, but as with the other issue, it\'s all the time. This is especially bad considering Ataru is supposed to be the protagonist, so the fact that when he does try to act better he gets punished for it and stars will align to make sure nothing goes right for him and his good deeds are not appreciated, leaves nothing but a sour taste in my mouth.All of this put together makes the humor and situations in the show just come off as really mean-spirited. Comedy is supposed to lift your spirits, not crush them. And that tone only makes the worst aspects of the characters stand out more, especially of the side characters who are often just plain horrible people and get automatically shown more appreciation for their mere existence. The characters the audience knows best are treated awfully, and though yes they do have pretty bad traits and actions themselves, they do at least seem to have some redeeming qualities which many of those side characters seems to entirely lack.I know there are plenty that enjoyed the original and honestly I doubt it\'s that different, so there are people who will enjoy this. I don\'t think it\'s a bad show - it\'s tone and sense of humor is just worlds apart from what I and people like me would enjoy. If you can enjoy a never ending parade of very flawed characters getting into terrible situations either by the stupidity of surrounding characters or of their own making, it\'s a show for you to watch. If on the other hand, the positive side of karma or a break from things being awful all the time are things you don\'t think you can go without then it might be best to look elsewhere for your comedy.As for the romance... It\'s kind of the same thing. There is a pretty clear plot train and you can kind of see a gradual progression, but it almost feels like Ataru growing feelings because he is just getting used to his predicament because Lum just does not (to the point where I watched anyway) seem to really even try to grapple with the fact that their supposed engagement was entirely one-sided on her part. bore me.

Its like a perfect mix of new and old. Also there is no real noticeable bad CGI in this anime which is quite refreshing.It has one of my favorite openings due to the song that is being played being quite catchy and the animation looking very good with its neon buildings and all that. The ending is also very catchy.The characters are fun to watch due to all of them being very egotistical and objectively...bad people in their own ways, which makes their interactions fun to watch. Despite them all being bad and somewhat annoying people they are all still likeable.The absurdist humor is usually very funny in my opinion, however this is very subjective.I find the setting very fun and interesting with Japanese mythological creatures being various aliens who live on different planets in the solar system.Despite being labeled as a romance I would not consider it that, due to it not really being romantic at all.Overall I really enjoyed the show so far and would recommend it to anyone who cares about slightly nostalgic feeling comedies. bad people in their own ways, which makes their interactions fun to watch.

(There\'s also some limited character development unlike the former).One of the harshest complains I\'ve seen for this show is that it\'s not adapting all of Urusei Yatsura. However, I find the limited amount of adaptation acceptable considering the number of episodes that...would need to be produced for the remake would be in the hundreds.I do want to disclaim I haven\'t seen (much) of the original show.

To give you a general idea, a lot of the humor is slapstick or situational, kind of like a Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry cartoon, both of which I\'m quite fond of. This may be my favorite RomCom anime, dethroning even Kaguya-Sama (which is honestly more of a romance drama with some comedy sprinkled in towards the later seasons), because it\'s significantly more funny than Kaguya and leans more into the comedy than the romance, which I prefer in RomComs.Final score 9/10It\'s not a ""perfect"" show because the jokes don\'t have a 100 percent hit rate. However, it is pretty close to 100 and with that and a little more plot progression it would definitely be a 10.

Created by the legendary Takahashi Rumiko, this series introduced many tropes that would become standard in the now over-produced genre; romantic comedy. The story follows the misadventures of high school student Ataru Moroboshi, who finds himself betrothed to the beautiful alien Lum after a series of accidents and misunderstandings.The art style of ""Urusei Yatsura"" is classic and unique. The character designs are distinctive, with exaggerated features that add to the comedic tone. Compared to today\'s standard of bodacious beauties in the rom-com genre, Takahashi Rumiko\'s...characters tend to have a more natural style. Several exceptions do exist, but generally, the body types of some of the characters are unusually realistic. The animation is fluid and well done, considering David Production is the one who produced this new adaptation.Another point that is quite a substantial factor is its cast of characters. From the luckless Ataru to the sweet Lum, every character is memorable. The side casts also add their own unique flavor to the show. The supporting characters are also well-developed, with quirks and personalities that make them stand out.The humor in ""Urusei Yatsura"" is mostly witty slapstick, with jokes that range from simple sight gags to comical wordplay. Most scenes have comedic elements with some dramatic moments, creating a well-rounded and engaging story.The OSTs of the show are also noteworthy, with catchy and memorable themes that perfectly complement the tone of this series. The first cour\'s opening and ending themes are particularly outstanding, as many people are already doing covers of either ""アイウエ"" or ""トウキョウ・シャンディ・ランデヴ"" these sure is going to get stuck in many people\'s head long after the show is over.While ""Urusei Yatsura"" may not be as well-known to newer anime fans, this new adaptation hopefully makes this classic show worth checking out.

To answer the biggest question that was burning in my mind. Yes Ataru does love Lum, its just taking him a REALLLLLY long time to convince himself that he actually loves her. He proved himself in the last few episodes that he would do anything to protect Lum. He would even give up being a Sleezebag, but I think Lum’s life would need to be ON THE LINE for him to do that but he would. I really hated Ataru from the 2nd episode...to about the 17th episode. It pissed me off how bad he would treat Lum. But I had a thought,  Lum is the only girl that he doesn’t simp for, the only girl he doesn’t say I love you to. I feel like he flirts with girls and acts like a sleezbag to hide his true feelings from Lum. to about the 17th episode. It pissed me off how bad he would treat Lum.

If this keeps up this could turn into a great condensed version of the anime, cherry picking the best episode to retell.The biggest criticism I have for the remake is that I wished some of the more series episodes that focused on Ataru and Lum's relationship were drawn out more.

I\'m definitely not qualified to write a review when it comes to a more comparative one or otherwise on this particular series. Which is exactly why I\'m writing this.A problem with this series is that it\'s unneeded. The original, from what I\'ve seen, was fine. What\'s the point in remaking a series, only to do so little new with it? They both begin in similar fashion, but quickly diverge into different episodic content. It\'s not a 1:1 remake,...thank God (a limit to this sentence is the possibility that the reboot is not much different, but the order was reshuffled from Takahashi\'s manga), but everything about the formula is the same, just tailored to a newer audience. It might have been interesting to go in a dark horse direction, as Oshii did with the Beautiful Dreamer film—or a more post-modern spin on the proper series. If the original anime were unfinished or low-budget and a poor adaptation, I can see that being a good reason for a new adaptation, but that\'s not the case. I understand there are people who will never watch the original series because it\'s old, and they want something new; but I\'m not talking about this from a marketing standpoint—just an artistic one.When it comes to the way characters are introduced, the original was consistently far more polished. They toss Sakura into episode 2 of the reboot at random and she does her bit with the bare minimum of an introduction, and she doesn\'t even get the whole episode. This leaves the bite-sized segments feeling scattershot and off-key. Whereas both Ten and Rei were properly introduced and got a solid amount of content for each of them in the original before moving on, just as they did with Mendo in episode 3 of the reboot.Love him or hate him, Mamoru Oshii has a distinct directorial style, and if you\'re a fan of him, you can see his hand all over the original with ease. Can I say the same about the THREE directors of the reboot? I can\'t even remember their names—maybe they were Moe, Larry, and Curly? The reboot doesn\'t scream ""auteur,"" as gaggy of a word as that is, but to me it resonates as workmanlike seasonal anime with big helpings of hyper-zaniness in the hopes of holding a candle to a classic. Make Lum a super-colorful moelita and dump most of the budget onto her for the animation, bright candy-like colors and strobes everywhere in general, have everyone get loud and obnoxious, lots of those sparkly I wuvs u UwU shoujo schlock bits and INTENSE OMG scaling pattern backdrops during the exaggerated comedy, and Lum shocking everyone like a kid who just got one of those handshake shock toys—seriously, almost the entire first episode is Ataru being subjected to sadistic shock therapy, when he\'s not getting clobbered by phone poles!I\'m not the biggest fan of comedy in anime. There are plenty of good ones, but so often the humor tends to be painful in its exaggeration, or it has this forced feeling and desperation to where you imagine a struggling artist in a hamster wheel trying to meet a quota and getting burnt out and unable to deliver. I\'m feeling that here. Even most of the funnier parts—and I can count the laughs on one hand, and they\'re mostly in episode 3—are relying on staples and anime tropes, and most everything else falls flat. Or it\'s just physical humor—largely consisting of Ataru getting the tar beat out of him for being a womanizer—and there\'s not enough charisma to be found in the animation or the characters\' expressions for it to work too well or leave a lasting impression. Don\'t get me wrong: the animation is never noticeably bad. It\'s even good—yeah, there are some animation saving techniques as always, and they rarely splurge on any one piece of animation, but that\'s to be expected... the problem is, there\'s just not much ""soul"" to it. The technical aspects are proficient, but it lacks a certain spark.On the other hand, it didn\'t matter if I was laughing during the original so much, for the storyboarding and the amount of care they put into the composition was phenomenal. It looked like they had a really, really huge bag of money to sink into various distinct and talented animators, and they let them be as creative as possible. Before I had ever watched a single episode, I had seen many animation clips from the original and was very impressed. It\'s actually worth watching for the amount of talent that was poured into it alone. The kind of transitions and angles on display in relation to the animation are also remarkable.The comedic timing and scripting per episode were also better in the original, to the point that it was much easier to laugh often, if not at least smile or feel amused; as opposed to the boredom I so often experienced during long stretches of the reboot. The characters had a much wider range of expressions and more dynamically animated caricature and physical comedy that better suited the situation, and there is nothing that covers up for that lack of repertoire in the reboot. You know, if I were doing a remake and utilizing the same scenes, as the reboot did with the first episode when Lum and Ataru were competing against each other, I\'d try my hardest to outdo the original. Maybe there\'s a certain charm in the old production values that can\'t be met, but at the very least you can choose to do something more exciting in terms of the content. The games in the original were creative. Ataru tried his best with many inventive gambits, and even with goofy gadgets like the plunger gun... there\'s absolutely nothing creative about what the reboot does. It tries so hard to be flashy, but It\'s ultimately so bland, I can\'t even picture it. Instead of outdoing the scene, it\'s like they didn\'t even try!I\'m convinced part of the problem is the way they chose to cut the early episodes I\'ve sampled, as with the example of Sakura being poorly utilized. Yet I also wonder if they\'ll ever mix current events and concerns into the scripts in the way the original did: the gas/oil siphoning was hilarious and actually played into fears of overconsumption or complete deprivation, while the part where Ten feeds the birds with such calamitous results also evokes ecological fears. This left the original feeling more grounded and not so... off in space. By contrast, the reboot feels as detached as a daydream, just nodding along without a care in the world.Overall, David Production do a fair enough job, and in many ways, it\'s above the average seasonal anime. There\'s nothing all that bad about it when you compare it to seasonal content and not the original. It\'s more briskly directed, glossier looking, and better animated than the average. The OP/ED are actually pretty good and well-produced. I think the original OP/ED do a better job of pulling off that kind of weird romcom vibe, but I find these more listenable, and the OP visuals are certainly flashier and more engaging; most of the music choices fit the fast-pacing the staff are comfortable working with. The problem is that the episodic comedy is very niche and felt stale and oh-so-anime before they committed it to TV, and nothing about the production itself is fantastic enough to weather the storm if you don\'t find this to be laugh-out-loud funny. thank God (a limit to this sentence is the possibility that the reboot is not much different, but the order was reshuffled from Takahashi\'s manga), but everything about the formula is the same, just tailored to a newer audience. It might have been interesting to go in a dark horse direction, as Oshii did with the Beautiful Dreamer film—or a more post-modern spin on the proper series. If the original anime were unfinished or low-budget and a poor adaptation, I can see that being a good reason for a new adaptation, but that\'s not the case. I understand there are people who will never watch the original series because it\'s old, and they want something new; but I\'m not talking about this from a marketing standpoint—just an artistic one.When it comes to the way characters are introduced, the original was consistently far more polished. They toss Sakura into episode 2 of the reboot at random and she does her bit with the bare minimum of an introduction, and she doesn\'t even get the whole episode. This leaves the bite-sized segments feeling scattershot and off-key.

WWW.Working!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33094/WWWWorking,"['Disclaimer: I’ve never exposed myself to the Working!!! franchise in any shape or form prior to watching WWW.Working!!! I picked this up when this started airing on a trusted friend’s “recommendation,” who’s somewhat of a fan of the original series. I was told by this friend that it is completely possible to watch this without any experience with the original series, and after watching all 13 episodes I can confidently confirm that statement.WWW.Working!!! is a gag anime and nothing more, so it’d seem a bit disingenuous if I graded it in any other area other than its humor. I don’t think it’s fair for people...to grade gag anime with “story” or “character” as a metric as so many reviewers are privy to doing. A gag anime/manga should be judged simply by one thing alone (plus or minus a few complimentary factors), and that is how funny it is.WWW.Working!!! is not funny.The reason for this is easy to point out, and it’s really the trap that dooms so many of these gag anime into failures. While the initial presentation of the jokes in the show are funny (Adachi being poisoned by Muranushi’s smile, Saiki being unable to speak Japanese, etc), as the show progresses through its 13 episodes, the same jokes end up being recycled over and over again with little variation in the premise and the punchline. While it’s endearing and charming at first, listening to the same joke gets tiring no matter how funny or cute it is to begin with. The worst abuser of this is the chocolate gag between Higashida and Miyakoshi. Not only is the initial presentation not very funny (the joke uses the tired “poisonous cooking” trope that you can find in various comedy anime like Nisekoi and pretty much any romcom) but you are forced to sit through the same variation of this joke for what feels like more than half the show. While this gag is the worst victim of this instance, almost all jokes in the series follow this main flaw to varying degrees.Part of the reason why the jokes are repeated so often in the same manner generally have to do with how inflexible they are to begin with. Each of the premises are so specific it’s honestly not surprising that the jokes couldn’t push themselves farther from their initial mold. Too often the punchline ends with the premise more than it highlights the process. Lots of comedy anime like Handa-kun tend to share a similar fate of driving a joke to the ground dude to how specific the set-up is (though some manga/anime tend to pull it off brilliantly like Kaguya). The jokes do eventually branch out in new directions, but not until the last few episodes of the series where the jokes and character are given actual development; the episodes in between are still devoid of any creativity.That’s not to say that the problem couldn’t have at least been mitigated, but unfortunately WWW.Working!!! Did not use all the tools it had in its disposal.  For example, WWW.Working!!! Boasts a wide cast of interesting and quirky characters, but instead of letting them expand their repertoire and utility, each character is inflexibly paired with another to set-up each joke. Very rarely do any of these pairs mix and exchange with each other, ruining the possibility of any creative comedy and chemistry that could otherwise have been formed. In other words, much of WWW.Working’s inflexibility I would argue comes from not diversifying itself when it had many opportunities to do so.Some jokes simply aren’t performed well either. Saiki’s inability to speak Japanese is an extremely creative and hilarious premise that could be utilized in many ways. However, the VA for Saiki can barely speak English himself, and it ruins the immersion and novelty of the joke. I will admit that I don’t know much about Japan’s VA industry, but I do know that positions for VA’s are often influenced by the status and renown of the VA (i.e. the influence of the studio that owns the VA) just as much as how much they fit the position. Now, I don’t know about the relative abundance of dual-speaking VAs, but I watched an anime that aired recently (Koutetsujou no Kabaneri) that had an English-speaking VA by the name of Maxwell Powers, so at the very least I know it’s possible to obtain such an actor to some degree. If it was possible to have an experienced dual-speaking VA hired, then the onus is on the staff for not doing their best to find the most suitable VAs for the job.In conclusion, I have to say I was disappointed with WWW.Working!!! While it had a very charming and entertaining initial presentation, it suffered from lack of creativity and variance to really be worth your time. It simply isn’t consistently funny. I’d like to check out future seasons though to see what they can improve upon, since the quality of the original Working!!! from what I’ve heard suggests that a funny and effective season of WWW.Working!!! can be done. to grade gag anime with “story” or “character” as a metric as so many reviewers are privy to doing.

An sequel of sorts that can be classified as a spin-off of the original ""Working"" franchise, the setting maybe in the same location (A different Wagnaria) the characters maybe new, quirky and funny. So, really, it was a spin-off since there were some parts that were the same, but there were some that were a reversal of the original. So:Storywise, I\'ve rate is a mediocre 5, since the genre was still the same and the gags and plot doesn\'t differ from the original, in fact the only thing they did was use the same stuff it has with the original and reverse it...a little bit one example was how the main character got to work in Wagnaria, were we see Takanashi who was recruited to work in the said place cu\'z Popura beg him, here Higashi is the one who applied for the job, cu\'z of financial difficulties.Art, I gave it a decent 4, since we don\'t get to see any ecchi here, except of course the usual Waganaria Uniforms that the staffs wore, no quintessential Zettai Ryouki to be seen around here. Though, Kyouko\'s counter part Kisaki should be wearing a more professional look instead of sporting the same attire as that of her younger co workers,  it kinda makes her a cosplayer  than one of the waitresses of the restaurant. Basically I really wonder as to what the fuck is going on in the mind of this anime planner Iwakami, Atsuhiro for making Kisaki spot such attire given that she a single mom, in her 30\'s (I think) really doesn\'t fit in the setting of the anime.Sound, I gave it a Poor 3, cu\'z the seiyuus who did most of the characters here don\'t fit in anymore, given that they sounded more mature than the younger characters, like Tomasu Haruka, who didn\'t have that youthful tone anymore to play Miyakoshi, Nakamura Yuichi who voices Higashi sounded as old as the character\'s daddy. Also Hikasa Yoko who voices Sayuri, her tone was simply very much of that of Rias Gremory.Character, I could say that they\'re the usual, but let\'s not forget that on a personality and role level the characters themselves were an alternate reversal of the the characters from the original, let\'s go over some of them:Daisuke "" Higashi"" Higashida- Here, he replaces  Souta Takanashi, but unlike Takanashi, he is a tsundere here, who sometimes does some  tsun tsun on Miyakoshi.Miyakoshi Hana - Who replaces Inami Mahiru, is a complete polar opposite of the latter, who has a bad case of Androphobia and would not hesitate to do some violent tsun tsun on Takanashi. Here, she the aggressive dere dere to Higashi, she also happens to be the office (Wagnaria) bimbo, given that she doesn\'t do well with her studies.Kamakura, Shiho- Is Todoroki, Yachiyo\'s replacement, given that she is the scary one here who happens to have a murderous Yandere intent on Shindou, Yuuta.Shindou, Yuuta- can be consider as a replacement for Yamada Kirio, but only in a personality level, not on a role level, same thing with Nagata, Rui who can be considered as a replacement for Popura Taneshima, Yanagiba, Miri who can be considered as a Aoi Yamada replacement, but with some differences,  since Yamada is lazy, annoying and clumsy, now Yanagiba , can also be considered as lazy, and clumsy, but she also sickly who just like Aoi would prefer to loiter around than do any work or go to school.Now, Muranushi, Sayuri has something in common with Taknashi\'s sister, Takanashi, Izumi from the original Working, whom,  were both odd and mysterious in a personality level but not in a role level since Izumi was a writer while Sayuri is a college student and one of the part-timers at Wagnaria, also Izumi has a some level of brocon with her little brother Souta, Sayuri on the other hand is in a relationship with Adachi, Masahiro who replaces Sato Jun on a role level , but on a personalty level he is a complete opposite of Jun. same can also be said about Adachi\'s fellow chef, Kouno, Takuya who replaces  Souma, Hiroomi whose personality was cheesy unlike Kouno who is really a joker who can deliver.Saiki, Kouki, unlike the rest is Matsumoto, Maya\'s replacement only on the gender level, since both of their roles weren\'t that different at all.Kenichirou Sakaki whom also unlike the rest , replaces  Otoo, Hyougo, both their roles and personality were pretty much the same, the difference, are their age, one is younger while the other is older.Also, Kondou, Kisaki, in terms of personality, replaces Shirafuji, Kyouko, but on the role level , Kisaki is one of the part-timers while Kyouko is the manager.Now all that was said, I\'m giving this category a fair 6, since as alternate replacements, they can be consider as a band of their own, but only in a slight way.Enjoyment, I\'d say it\'s a good 7, thought , it\'s good, I\'m starting to already get tired of the same comedy and slice of life being use here.So overall, I\'m also giving it a good 7, since this spin-off does have some character development when it come to the romance. So I hope Studio A-1 Pictures doesn\'t come up with another season of this spin-off (if we can call it that way) cu\'z such sequel would violate the development that has already occurred with the characters.Happy New Year to all. a little bit one example was how the main character got to work in Wagnaria, were we see Takanashi who was recruited to work in the said place cu\'z Popura beg him, here Higashi is the one who applied for the job, cu\'z of financial difficulties.Art, I gave it a decent 4, since we don\'t get to see any ecchi here, except of course the usual Waganaria Uniforms that the staffs wore, no quintessential Zettai Ryouki to be seen around here.

It's strongly advised to watch that beforehand.It cannot be helped that this will be compared to it's predecessor. I've just marathoned the franchise the other time so I'm still fresh about it. I think I'll list the strength and weakness over it's predecessor.One of my gripe about the latest installment is that the character are mutually exclusive to each other rather than the more dynamic old cast. In here they are to grouped with their respective partner and didn't interact much with other. Couple with their romantic interest and friend with each other. They are rarely...interact with one another unlike in old series which is more rounded like Yachiyo with Kyoko, Yachiyo with Satou, Satou with Popura, Satou with Souma, Souma with Aoi, Aoi with Souta, Souta with Popura, Souta with Inami. There are more than one relationship chart either friendship one or romantic ones.Other thing is that I feel several character are wasted here because they lack any partner. I think Kouno got it the hardest if I'm reflecting on old series. Because the dynamic between Satou and Souma is so great I think just being a boke on a part of manzai duo is severely lacking as character. Because his only partner is Adachi when Adachi is not on the picture or is together with Muranishi he is being left out. Even if there is some build up at the beginning with Yanagiba that also is swept under the rug when Yanagiba is more often seen with Nagata. There is also Kisaki which I feel overshadowed by Daichi a character that are introduced at later point in the story.On the bright side this series still retain the spirit of the old series. The weird quirk of character and the dysfunctional workplace romance along with the gag is still can held it's own. Another thing is the progress of character relationship is fast here. Though at time it can also feel too fast it's still not on the point of being annoying.Overall even with it's downside compared to the original series WWW.Working!! can still held it's own as a series. While you can watch this without watching the original it's still advised that you are watching the original first so that you can capture the series charm properly.I'm giving this 7.6 overall and rounding it to 8 on MAL scoring standard. interact with one another unlike in old series which is more rounded like Yachiyo with Kyoko, Yachiyo with Satou, Satou with Popura, Satou with Souma, Souma with Aoi, Aoi with Souta, Souta with Popura, Souta with Inami.

Even if there is some build up at the beginning with Yanagiba that also is swept under the rug when Yanagiba is more often seen with Nagata. There is also Kisaki which I feel overshadowed by Daichi a character that are introduced at later point in the story.On the bright side this series still retain the spirit of the old series. The weird quirk of character and the dysfunctional workplace romance along with the gag is still can held it's own. Another thing is the progress of character relationship is fast here. Though at time it can also feel too fast it's still not on the point of being annoying.Overall even with it's downside compared to the original series WWW.Working!! can still held it's own as a series. While you can watch this without watching the original it's still advised that you are watching the original first so that you can capture the series charm properly.I'm giving this 7.6 overall and rounding it to 8 on MAL scoring standard."", ""The restaurant comedy series of Working ran three seasons strong with an hour long special to wrap up its story.  Combined with its still running 4-koma source material, it's safe to say that this series is still running quite strong despite its age.  So, what can you do when your series ends but the iron's still hot for more content?  Why, a spin-off of course.Story: WWW.Working!! is the Working series with a new coat of paint.  Higashida Daisuke is forced to get a part-time job on account of his terrible family being terrible, and ends up getting a job...at Wagnaria, the family restaurant filled with a whole new plethora of misfits in what can only be described as a comedic phenomenon ripe for the picking.To put it bluntly, this spin-off is literally the Working series with new characters.  The series still relies heavily on character relationships and interactions combined with retorts, romantic subplots, and other situational comedy with character specific gags like that of its parent series.  In short, if you watched the Working series, expect to see the same kind of stuff here.  The only thing I found different between the two is the fact that this spin-off really likes the trope of hurting men.  Each of the three main relationships in this series focuses a lot on torturing the guy in each relationship in some way, shape, or form, which, while the original series did do some of, never utilized that trope to this extreme.Another problem that this spin-off suffers from is pacing.  The original series had 3 cours to fully tell their stories while this one only had 1 cour to do roughly the same amount of storytelling, so a lot of the loose end tying that happens in the end of the series feels rushed and a bit sloppy.But really, that's all I can really say about the story.  In essence, it's the same show.  It's even the same restaurant, so I suppose there's not really much you can do with that setting if you're trying to do a spin-off.Overview:+/-  Literally the exact same kind of plot.  Just with different characters.Characters:  Similar to its parent, WWW.Working!! hosts a band of strange misfit characters with a greater majority of them falling into romantic relationships that end up as dysfunctional as you would probably expect them to be.First we have the duo of Higashida and Miyakoshi, the highschooler who has to make his own pay due to his family's incompetence, and the idiot who can turn chocolate into a lethal weapon.  Despite being the 'main couple' of the series, these two characters are arguably what I consider to be most lackluster of the bunch.  Their characters feel forced together, and even with all of the visits to St. Valentine and indifference these two go through, nothing really clicks together in the end.  Maybe that's due to the fact that the spin-off was rushed so much towards the end, but personally, I don't really find much solid ground to base their relationship around, even though it was entertaining.Then we have the next duo of Adachi and Muranashi, the poor soul and the kuudere with a mean streak who refuses to believe that she can see the occult.  Similarly to the first couple, these two don't really make all that much sense, but they have more of a base than the other one.  Mostly revolving around Adachi being a wimp and unsure of what his future may hold, as well as Muranashi's somewhat sociopathic tendencies when it comes to her significant other, the comedic routine with these two revolves mostly around Adachi trying to run away from something while Muranashi grabs onto him and tries to get him to man up.  You know, normal couple stuff.And finally, we have arguably the most complete couple of the bunch, Shindou and Shiho, the loser who has to pay his father's debt, and the rich girl whose daddy is the creditor of that debt.  Thankfully, this one is simpler and a lot less difficult to explain.  Sadistic girl who tortures the guy she likes while the guy grovels to try and pay off what he (sadly) owes before the climax of the series happens with sweet, sweet role reversal as the crux.  Admittedly, I found this couple to be the most entertaining and fulfilling of romantic relationships, especially when compared to the other two.The rest of the cast falls into the realm of quirky nobodies that honestly don't have much of a role in the series, and are only really there to add in a touch of weirdness to this already strange family restaurant.  There's Kouno, the idiot, Saiki, the foreigner who struggles to speak Japanese, Kisaki, a smoker who brings her baby to work, and the dyslexic manager.  (There're more, but this section has gone on long enough.)  They add comedy to the series, but not really much in the way of plot progression.Overview:+ One good romantic storypoint+/- Comedic sidecharacters (who don't participate in much)-  Most of the romantic stories felt rushed or unnaturalArt: Produced by A-1, like the rest of the Working series, the art comes as no surprise as the bright, clean, simple artstyle that the Working series has.  It's on-par with the company's production quality, so there's not really much to say.  Comedic faces, usage of chibis in certain situations, and doom and gloom backdrops when something comedically drastic is happening, all the same stuff.Sound:  The sound really isn't all that exciting if I may be honest.  It's bright, it's cheery, it's kinda memorable, but I wouldn't really much thought into it.Personal Enjoyment:  Working is one of those series that I would say is a reliable source of entertainment for me.  With character interactions and romantic relationships as the brunt source of content, I never really get tired of this show even though it's more or less the exact same thing.  Which is why watching this, I knew exactly what I was getting into.  And surprise surprise, I got exactly what I thought I was going to get.  Which is actually pretty good, if I may be honest.Did I like this series?I mean, it's Working.  I like Working.  Yes, I liked it.  But really, if I were to really point out something, it would be the relationship between Shindou and Shiho.  Especially during the climax point.  Like hands down, that is probably my favorite part in this entire series.What didn't I like about this series?I wasn't a fan of the rushing.  Though to be fair, I don't think that was avoidable due to the fact that they had to make 3 separate storylines come together in 12 episodes, so I suppose they did the best they could.Would I recommend this series?If you watched and liked Working, watch this.

Its a nice romcom, nice development, didn't found anything that feel forced or annoying. The jokes is not dry, it can make you grin or giggle for a little but absolutely not like when you watch pure comedy anime like...Gintama. Its kinda laid back. Its nice short story about member of Wagnaria.Art (9/10)I want to give 8 point, but nice animation at three last episode makes it deserve more. They did a good job at animation.The character design is likeable, not over-moefication that become annoying. Its nice simple anime design.Sound (8/10)Nice OP, Nice ED, Nice BGM. Nothing to say here. Still skip-able OP/ED so I give it 8.Character (8/10)The character is nice too, but somehow at half end of the show some character seems weaker. idk exactly, but its a little annoying.Enjoyment (9/10)Its a nice short romance comedy anime with many development between the character.

Nothing epic happen thou (can't give 10 point because of that)."", ""I was so excited when I heard the news that they would be making another anime that was similar to Working! and I must say it's just as enjoyable to watch. It is almost quite literally the exact same show, they're in the same location (A different Wagnaria) but with new quirky and funny characters. It's like I'm re-watching one of my favorite shows all over, and I love it.Early on you can see the potential love interests, a bunch of character specific interactions and many other funny side events taking place that will be running gags throughout the show. The art and music is...on par with its spin-off counterpart, with it's catchy OP and ED.But with that said the show doesn't come without it's flaws (which actually get a fair bit better as the show goes on, but I'll get into that later), the biggest one being they seem to be relying on some of the gags too much. Stuff like during one of the episodes they have a big time skip (1 year) so they could re-use Hana's deadly chocolate gag on valentines day, I mean.. what's the point of that? The show seems to be very hit or miss and its gags are kinda split up being on opposite sides of the spectrum, on one side you have a few awesome characters, the hilarious gags that come with them and some great development between them but on the other side you have kind of dull characters and just annoying gags that the show seems to be repeating, like the one I stated earlier. Now as I previously said, as the show progressed some of these flaws start to fade away, they stop re-using the same boring jokes and some of the lesser like-able characters actually ended up being quite the opposite by the end, after you learn more about them they start changing the way they think and act and are overall just much better then what they started off as.The show also had it's character/story progression a lot faster then the original did with 3 couples dating by the end of the show. Early on I was skeptical on whether or not the show was going to have a nice ending similar to the original Working! with the show pretty much guaranteed to be one season only, but thankfully it actually has a really sweet ending making the viewer feel very fulfilled. Now while we don't get to see every little side story get resolved like the original, all the important ones get tied off nicely as we see most of the characters grow up and move on with their lives.Overall with the show having it's ups and downs (most of which are in the first half of the show) I still don't think it's quite as good as its predecessor but it's certainly still worth checking out. on par with its spin-off counterpart, with it's catchy OP and ED.But with that said the show doesn't come without it's flaws (which actually get a fair bit better as the show goes on, but I'll get into that later), the biggest one being they seem to be relying on some of the gags too much.

Working!! ended on a beautiful and conclusive note but it wasn\'t enough for me. I wanted more so I prayed for more and I guess the Gods of Anime must have heard my prayers by giving us this ""spin-off"". You know what I have to say about this new series? It lived up to my expectations.[Story]WWW.Working!! is technically the first in the franchise. This was adapted from a web manga called ""Working!! Web-ban"" which came first before the beloved ""Working"" which we all know and love. Basically, it was like...the author\'s first draft before she (or he?) got serious and started writing Working!!. For the sake of this review (and the sake of simplicity) though, I\'m going to call this series a ""spin-off"" and the previous Working!! as the original even though it\'s the other way around. Why am I providing you this info? Because I\'m a nice guy and to also inform you why this series is the way it is (i.e, this spin-off is more crazier than the original, rushed romance and etc.).WWW.Working takes place in the same old ""Wagnaria"" restaurant but the characters are entirely different. The MC is now about a serious first year student (who is also not a lolic- I mean, loli-loving) Daisuke who decided to get a part-time job after his father\'s company goes bankrupt.Some fans of the original Working series might crucify me for saying this but WWW.Working\'s comedic aspect is a lot better than the first two seasons of Working. However, the 3rd Season\'s comedy is on par with this spin-off. The gags didn\'t consistently made me laugh per say but it definitely made me laugh more than the first two seasons of the original Working!!Why is that? It\'s because the character dynamics in this show is perfectWhen both of the characters\' personalities clash together in this show, it leads to a whole wide array of funny moments. To top it off, the character\'s quirks are more crazier here than the original Working. It\'s like their quirkiness level is turned up to 11 out of 10.The gags did get a little bit repetitive like the whole chocolate joke thing (They even skipped a whole year just to repeat the gag) but for the most part, they were creative enough to make the jokes interesting and funny almost every time.One last aspect that I want to talk about is the romance. The original Working\'s romance was simply heartwarming and beautiful. It moved at a slow pace and nothing felt wrong when they got together because they spent enough time to justify them being a couple. In this series, that wasn\'t the case. The romantic progression was very rushed. You\'d think they\'d produce another season for this series just like they did with the original to spend time on the relationship development but nope..All of the characters got together with someone in this season.While I thought the romance aspect of WWW.Working was ehh, this wasn\'t really a big issue for me. Since this was like a first draft for the author, you can tell that she didn\'t take this work seriously. All of the romance in this series was played in a comedic kind of way. Hence, the reason why this show isn\'t really tagged as ""Romance"". So if you\'re expecting a more serious romance like the 3rd Season of Working brought to us then you\'re not going to get it.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (7/10)The art and visuals looks slightly worse than the 3rd Season of Working!! and that season was released at least a year ago so I don\'t know what the hell happened here. Reduced budget? Different staff? It doesn\'t really matter that much because it wasn\'t that painful to watch and it took a very short time to get used to WWW.Working\'s art style and its visuals.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (8.5/10)Just like the previous Working, the soundtracks are ok. Nothing really stood out, it was just ok. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""Eyecatch! Too much!"" by Haruka Tomatsu, Yoko Hikasa, and Sora Amamiya. Ahh, Working..Back at it again with the over-the-top, hilarious and somehow very catchy OPs. I pretty much love this OP just as much as the previous OPs. It sounds very catchy because of its very fast melody.The ED theme song is ""Muchuuryoku Fever"" by Yuuichi Nakamura, Kouki Uchyama, and Kensho Ono. Hmm, I see that A-1 Pictures is still following the trend where the male characters sings the ED and the female characters sings the OP. Well, I love that trend so I\'m glad it\'s still the same thing for this show. The ED sounds really good and I\'m glad the voices are light and aren\'t so over the top like those rock songs. It perfectly fits my taste.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (8/10)It\'s quite disappointing that none of the characters here came close to living up to the greatness of the characters from the original Working!!, like Yamada (best girl) or Popura but the characters here in WWW.Working are still a bunch of good characters nonetheless. One of the main reasons why I liked the characters here are their personalities. I love their personalities and they were extremely hilarious. That\'s the reason why I thought this show was more hilarious than the first two seasons of the original Working!!The character dynamics is what this show nailed though...perfectly. For example, one of the character dynamics that I really enjoyed watching was between Shiho and Yuuta. They both have quite a bit of history together and that\'s the reason why our ""tsundere/sadist"" here tortures (not physically) our poor Yuuta. Their dynamics just kills me. I ended up laughing whenever I see Shiho torture Yuuta in so many ways possible and the more hilarious part is she enjoys it, hence the reason why she\'s a sadist. Also, Shiho just became my best girl of WWW.Working because I like girls that are a mix of tsundere and sadism.Of course, I also love the other character dynamics like the interaction between Higashida and Miyakoshi or between Muranashi and Adachi and many more but Shiho and Yuta\'s dynamic is the one that I enjoyed the most.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)Aaaand here goes another seasonal anime that I\'m going to miss and another symptom of ""Anime Withdrawal Symptoms"" that I need to deal with. I\'m really going to miss this anime because this was one of my weekly dosage of comedy and I really enjoyed this show so much. At least, there\'s KonoSuba S2 next season so I don\'t have to worry about my weekly dosage of comedy running out ;).______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Working!! is much better than this series but that doesn\'t mean I hate this series. In fact, I love this series just as much as I loved the original Working!! While the romance aspect of the show was ehh compared to the original series, the great comedy makes up for it. WWW.Working!! made me laugh just as much as the 3rd season of Working!! did and it was definitely better than the first 2 seasons in terms of the comedic aspect. The reason for that are the characters and their dynamics. If you\'re a fan of Working!! or shows that has great comedy then this is definitely recommended. Just don\'t expect it to live up to the greatness of Working!![OVERALL]: (8.4/10)Pros:+Even though I\'m a big fan of Working!!, I still enjoyed watching this series+Great Comedy+Catchy OP and ED theme songs, as always+Fun cast of characters with enjoyable and hilarious personalities+Great Character DynamicsCons:-Romance is the weakest aspect of this show-Gags can get a bit repetitive-Art and Visuals looks cheap compared to the 3rd Season of Working!! the author\'s first draft before she (or he?) got serious and started writing Working!!. For the sake of this review (and the sake of simplicity) though, I\'m going to call this series a ""spin-off"" and the previous Working!! as the original even though it\'s the other way around.

I\'m really going to miss this anime because this was one of my weekly dosage of comedy and I really enjoyed this show so much. At least, there\'s KonoSuba S2 next season so I don\'t have to worry about my weekly dosage of comedy running out ;).______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Working!! is much better than this series but that doesn\'t mean I hate this series. In fact, I love this series just as much as I loved the original Working!! While the romance aspect of the show was ehh compared to the original series, the great comedy makes up for it. WWW.Working!! made me laugh just as much as the 3rd season of Working!! did and it was definitely better than the first 2 seasons in terms of the comedic aspect. The reason for that are the characters and their dynamics. If you\'re a fan of Working!! or shows that has great comedy then this is definitely recommended. Just don\'t expect it to live up to the greatness of Working!![OVERALL]: (8.4/10)Pros:+Even though I\'m a big fan of Working!!, I still enjoyed watching this series+Great Comedy+Catchy OP and ED theme songs, as always+Fun cast of characters with enjoyable and hilarious personalities+Great Character DynamicsCons:-Romance is the weakest aspect of this show-Gags can get a bit repetitive-Art and Visuals looks cheap compared to the 3rd Season of Working!!', ""Being a fan of the franchise I really wanted to like this season. But I do know that I have to set my expectations lower since it's a whole different cast (cat group) and the web-ban is not as popular as the manga version (dog group). But boy I was still disappointed.Working's comedy always have its ups and downs. The worst being the insane leaps of logic and flat humor the writer tries to force onto the show. And apparently that's all that this anime is about. The circumstances and situations are characters are in are so incredibly forced and unbelievable, it's painful to carry...on.The characters are also incredibly one-dimensional. Every character can simple be summed by one or two traits, and sometimes that trait exists solely for a gag for another character. Let me give it a shot:Miyakoshi- Energetic. Absolute idiot.Higashida- Exists for Tsukkomi, mostly for Miyakoshi's idiocy.Muranushi- Can see ghosts. Scary smile. (Why? Because story says so, that's why)Adachi- Solely exist to be scared of Muranushi's smile.Shindou- Bullied by Kamakura because he's poor.Kamakura- Bully Shindou because she's rich.Kondou- Teenage single mom. Doesn't work.Kouno- Who?Saiki- Speaks english (Yes that's his entire character)Sakaki- Useless pushover managerNagata- Being mortified by everythingYanagiba- Being weirdI'm not saying that the original cast (dog group) doesn't suffer from one-dimension characters and jokes, but WWW.Working is all about it.

Franchise.I was sceptical at first as it contains a whole new cast compared to the original series however, this was quickly overturned the moment i got through the first episode.Despite a new cast and new location, it has the warmth and same feeling as the original series. The new characters are each unique and likeable, throughout the series you also see how each of them interact with one another and the changes in their personalities.This anime is a great relaxation anime with romance and comedy, perfect to relax and binge on a few episodes or watching the entire season...in one sitting. in one sitting.', 'So, here\'s something embarrassing...I\'ve never actually watched the original Working!! anime. After I heard the remix with the Working!! them and the beastie boys, I had to just check it out. After typing into Google; ""Working!! episode 1"", I was instead greeted to WWW.Working. (Yes I pirate my anime, keep outta my business will ya?) Me being an arrogant little prick, I (Instead of looking up why there\'s three W\'s in the name and why the name is different than the one on MyAnimeList, my beautiful mind decided to watch this one first. Now, as I said, I don\'t know how good the original Working!!...anime is, but I gotta say, I had a blast watching this one!First of all, it\'s beautiful, it\'s my favourite style of anime. I\'ve always loved A-1 for their animes, and this one\'s no exception! It\'s a mix of new and old nostalgic anime, at least how I see it. The characters are all interesting and have their own unique charm. They\'re all weird in their own special way, and it\'s hilarious. The OP isn\'t the same as the Working!! OP, but I\'ve never seen the original so I don\'t have much to compare to, regardless, it wasn\'t a shit OP, it wasn\'t amazing like Love Hina or Hagani, it was meh. The plot is nothing much either, it\'s more of The Simpsons-esque type of plot, where there\'s a template, and random episodes leading up. It\'s still awesome though, it\'s interesting and fun to watch. I\'ve never run through a series so fast in my life. I watched them all in two sittings. For the enjoyment, it\'s a solid 10 from me. I never once got bored of watching and never decided to turn in off, I only split my view time in half as it was late and I had school the next day.Other than all that, I loved it, it\'s funny, interesting and has romance to make you feel not so lonely in life for a bit. And even with the ending being not much, I felt emotions, for once...I 100% recommend this anime, it get\'s Brax\'s seal of approval (The guy in my profile pic, or maybe he\'s not in my pic and I\'ve changed it. In that case it gets the approval of whoever is in it now...)That\'s pretty much it, yeet. anime is, but I gotta say, I had a blast watching this one!First of all, it\'s beautiful, it\'s my favourite style of anime.

I felt like those people were just fans and were over-exaggerating but Goddamn. They were right. By a small margin though. In case you don\'t know, I still love the Working!! series a lot.It\'ll be very difficult to review the show without comparing it to the original series and so if you haven\'t watched the original series, worry not, even though I will be comparing the two, you don\'t have to watch the original series to understand this, unless...if you missed that reference in the beginning of the first episode ;)A slice of life which gave us quite a bit of plot thrown in towards the end, WWW.Working had a few interesting bits such as St. Valentine, a hilarious gag which went on till the end of the show. It although didn\'t move too forward in it\'s plot, it was a brilliant job in terms of making a base for a slice of life anime to continue. Read on to find out what makes this series better than the other! And why this show is definitely worth a try!!!WWW.Working kicks off into action immediately. Giving me my favorite MC in a career role and a much better support cast, no, the supporting cast was much better than the other series and apart from that it was one of the best casts I\'ve seen in a long time. The way development was given to every single character in just 13 episodes shocked me because not even Working!! could manage that in 2 seasons (I have yet to watch S3 since I got tired of it). What sets itself apart from the original is a pretty long list. This new series is better in almost every way. Higashida like I mentioned before isn\'t a dense idiot as most of the anime MCs in high school anime tend to be, this guy was dead inside, in a hilarious way, and he wasn\'t dense at all, a huge refresher. If that wasn\'t enough to entice you into watching this beauty, take a much more entertaining substitute for Poplar in the form of Hana. She was an idiotic airhead I know, but the way the show handled her idiocy was hilarious. I\'m hugely impressed by the way they portrayed her and Higashida\'s interactions and to be honest it felt much better than the unfortunately poor pair of the original Working!! couple.Another thing I found better was the soundtrack, now Working also did a very good job of pulling you in with the soundtrack but I felt the little jingles and fun OST made me laugh at not only the comic situations but the added music as well. The characters as well were amazing. In particular the supporting cast. Or actually everyone for that matter. I really enjoyed the way Muranushi and Adachi\'s relationship was portrayed and to be honest they were just favorite pair in the show. The embarrassing and sometimes cute situations were so funny I couldn\'t stop laughing at them. That\'s to say nothing of the other characters, Shiho and Yuuta had their funny moments although I found them really enjoyable only in the last few episodes since that\'s when the show actually progressed forward for them, a huge shout-out to my man Saiki as well for his amazing attempt at learning and mastering (?) Japanese all thanks to the also amazing Kisaki-san. They both were really hilarious both together and independently as well, while Yanagiba and Nagata were also cute. I commend the author for making so many characters fit in so perfectly and I felt deeply attached to each and every one of these characters.As for the Staff, I can\'t say I wasn\'t impressed by the way they performed their roles. I am already very much familiar with Haruka Tomatsu so it wasn\'t much of a surprise seeing her nail the role. As for the other staff, Yuuichi Nakamura played Higashida and seeing how he did amazing roles such as Tomoya from Clannad I think you all can judge how he would do here. The other cast was amazing as well and I\'d give a special shout-out to Yoko Hikasa (Sayuri Muranushi) and Momo Asakura (Yanagiba) since they both were soooo cute to watch!!!Animated by A-1 Pictures, it wasn\'t much of a surprise to see such a cutely and nicely made anime. The character designs they did were also adorable and they captured the attractive and slightly moe aspect of WWW.Working excellently. It wasn\'t just fun but it felt like eye candy. Props for the vibrant OP and ED as well, just like Working!!, It was a joy to watch.Do I like WWW.Working? Or more accurately do I prefer it to the original series? Yes to both. I was quite skeptical of the show since I thought it wouldn\'t best Working!! which I still love but I was quite surprised to know and realise that WWW. didn\'t just equal the original which had 3 seasons, but it surpassed it in just a measly 13 episodes. I found myself really attached to the characters and the show itself. Everyone\'s interactions were so heartwarming and left a lasting impression on myself. I started with a smile, and ended with a smile. Not a single second went by with me criticising the show, much the opposite, not a second went by with me praising and laughing at the antics of everyone. Really, if a season 2 comes out I doubt it\'ll fail to disappoint. Now that came at a cost, since WWW.Working had an ending which gave quite a bit of closure unlike Working!! which gave openings for sequels to continue so I doubt we\'ll see a season 2 but nonetheless, the show\'s definitely worth a try. I mean, A-1 Pictures did an excellent job animating it and I\'m a huge fan of their animations and adaptations as well for that matter. So, why not try it?

Characters are annoying, sound is agitating/irritating and since the series was never really about a plot but more about comedy/slice of life, it frustrated me too that this anime has no funny parts at all. They didn't even get a smirk or chuckle out of me.One of the worst anime I gave try. Wouldn't have watched it past 3 minutes of 1st episode if I hadn't watched and totally...loved the original. loved the original."", ""At first, I was a bit hesitant.I was a bit sad when I saw none of the original characters, who I'm really fond of, would make an appearance in the series, but after my Working rewatch, I felt like I should give it a chance.I'm really happy I gave it a chance, I liked it quite much. It took me a few episodes to get used to the new characters, but once I got into it, I watched the complete series.It felt new, but also very familiar. I liked seeing this welcoming restaurant with its odd characters again.I liked the fact that it’s, just...like the original, very cute and heartwarming. It really helps taking your mind of the daily dose of stress.

I think I've tried watching the real Working!! but I think i dropped it because I was busy and completely forgot about the anime which is why I felt like i've seen an anime with a familiar name.Story------The story is mainly just slice of life but it has comedy so you just know that the main characters or stars will have unrealistic personalities. But what I did not expect in this anime was the romance. I feel like romance is a big genre in...this anime since I think all of them are related to romance but its the kind of romance where it isn't really serious stuff so there isn't any drama in it. The story is great you know, a high schooler that works at a part time job and bla-bla-bla. Real cliche. But it's comedy so what can I say right? Since the main genres are Slice of Life and Comedy, than I would say that the slice of life was just fine. And so was the comedy. I enjoyed my time watching this anime and I don't really feel like it needs more work or could have been better. I mean it could have been much better but hey, in the end it made me laugh and that it what matters to me. There is romance which makes it a whole lot better in my opinion.9/10Art------So it's your generic 2015+ anime art and I can't really comment much about it. Easily said, the art style is good enough. The characters don't have hairstyles that are too weird but still, good enough. I mean, orange hair. That isn't really realistic but who cares right? It's a damn anime.So in conclusion the art doesn't bother me too much and I can't really compliment much about it.7/10Sound------Okay, so the opening has a fine song, though it is not the kind of song that I would download and listen to a lot because it is kind of annoying honetsly but the song isn't like the kind I would hate a lot. But the MV is nice. It's ute I guess? The ED is technically just the same imo. But the last episode ED was much better though. I mean it is the same song but it went more smoothly lmao. Voice acting is nice though there isn't much that stands out. But still fun to listen to. The english made me cringe a little lol.7/10Character------The characters are just great in my opinion. Higashida has the personality that I love the most for a Male MC. The kind of type that doesn't have emotion and isn't that much of a damn wimp. (or just mature). Hana is just terrible at cooking but how her affection changes towards Higashida in the end is really cute and enjoyable. Sayuri has that deadly smile because it is just too unexpected and cute from a girl who barely shows emotion. Shiho is just a sadist and Yuuta is the victim. Though they got out of it in the end. Not really into Adachi's personality but its fine. Hime is the most cute though.9/10Enjoyment / Overall------Pretty sad to see these characters on their last episode. I mean I feel that way on every anime. We won't be able to see them again so i'd have to find anoter anime. BUt personally I enjoyed this naime a lot becuase I had nothing else to do. with a good story and good characters ( I mean they aren't bad enough so) I can't really give myself a reason to not like this anime. I really love the thank you at the end of the anime. It is so fun to see the producers thanking their audience (even though I'm watching on a pirated site lol). It's nice to see an ending that I could be happy with and an ending that shows it is the end of the anime. No damn cliffhangers.I rate anime based on how much I enjoy them and how much it made me feel so if I felt like something could've been better i'd put it a little down but this did not let me down and I think it's a good anime.8/10 this anime since I think all of them are related to romance but its the kind of romance where it isn't really serious stuff so there isn't any drama in it.

A-1 decides to adapt its spin off series which is WWW.Working!! I’m glad to see they retain some of the staff of the original working series and the studio in charge. There’s a lot of similarities between the origin and the spin off series, with the exception of the restaurants of course, nevertheless character wise and chemistry among them are almost similar to that original series.I have a good feeling that this...series would be on par with the original series, but only for the first few episodes. It started off really well, with the introduction of most of the characters from main to supporting, and they all really have funny characteristics, I mean the gag to make people laugh out loud while watching. However starting with the episode that has love contents on all that, I don’t like how the characters were being dense and confused on what the others were talking about.  Not saying I hate romance, I love romcom in fact. I just hate how characters become so confused only to realize it later. Well, this is just my opinion. Everyone has its own subjective opinion’s. Nevertheless, I still enjoy the spin off providing the love confusion but managed to resolve it at the end.Arts and animations, are on par with the original series, so I have no comment on that. Albeit, with slight alternations in eye designs.What interest me is the selection of the seiyuus for each of the characters. There’s nothing wrong with the seiyuus but I like how the seiyuu’s voice fits to the character behavior in that series, for example Higashida who is voiced by Nakamura Yuuichi who also voice acted on Oreki Houtarou, both of which characters have dull and self-focus minded expressions. Pretty much all the VA’S were performing well, at least there aint any hiccups around. Sound tracks like the Opening and Ending songs are catchy to listen, and the OST aren’t bad either.With that, it leaves me with the scoring of the series, I wanted to give a 6 due to its lack of vibe and its characters being so confused especially when it comes to relationships. However I decided to give a score of 7 being with the series has a similar plot to the original series and it’s animation works and of course the seiyuus. That pretty much didn’t bore me to death when watching it, glad I didn’t drop this series. So with that my final score is 7 for the series. Not too shabby, not too bad, just an enjoyable series to laugh off and releasing stress.I would recommend you guys to watch this, if you already completed the original series, however if you really miss the original series, I suggest re-watch the original series. Those who wants to look for a funny series after watching a sad anime series, this is a right recipe for you to watch to whack out those Post-Anime depressions, providing that you can withstand the problems especially when the characters are dealing with relationships. series would be on par with the original series, but only for the first few episodes.

Those who wants to look for a funny series after watching a sad anime series, this is a right recipe for you to watch to whack out those Post-Anime depressions, providing that you can withstand the problems especially when the characters are dealing with relationships.', ""A Masterpiece!If I compare this anime to the mess the previous anime was, It's at least 733.5% better. We have characters who actually have great/uncommon personalities and character development, A well paced plot which isn't dragged through 3 stupid Series. Comedy was also on point (This foreign dude killed me).The previous series had boring characters, romantic relationships that needed 3 seasons (THREE goddamn SEASONS, MEANING CA 30 EPISODES) to bloom and lame ass jokes. It was tiringAlso all those girls are waifus in www. While the ones in Working had personalities as flat as the earth is to creationists.Well done "", 'WWW.Working!!, new characters, new antics, same old WAGNARIA.Let\'s get right to it with it\'s characters.The characters really felt like the original series character just with differing quirks and because of the very near similarities..BULLETPOINTS TIME!!!!!*Daisuke Higashida & Hana Miyakoshi (Yuuichi Makamura & Haruka Tomatsu) - Are effectively the same as the main characters from the original Working! of Souta Takanashi and Mahiru Inami, just replace being afraid of men and lots of punching and trying to cure that with trying to make GOOD chocolate, the ""pain"" with how horrible Hana\'s cooking is and trying to cure that.*Shiho Kamakura & Yuuta Shindou (Sora Amamiya & Kensho...Ono) - Shiho is essentially Hiroomi Souma from the original just change ""blackmailing his co-workers"" with ""money bribing"" mainly towards Yuuta as Yuuta is his childhood friend and he owes debt to her thus causing the rift between them, but Shiho\'s antics is more brutal compared to Hiroomi\'s antics.*Sayuri Muranushi & Masahiro Adachi (Yoko Hisaka & Kouki Uchiyama) - Feels like Jun Satou and Yachiyo Todoroki especially in the ""will they, won\'t they"", just replace Jun\'s utter shyness to Yachiyo to Masahiro being utterly terrified by Sayuri\'s change in personality from her ghostly default and as a parallel, Sayuri carries knives similar to Yachiyo\'s katana wearing.*Kisaki Kondou & Kenichirou Sakaki (Nana Mizuki & Kousuke Toriumi) - Is Kyouko Shirafuji and Hyougo Otoo, as Kisaki and Kyouko both effectively don\'t do any work (Kisaki through MANY excuses, Kyouko because she\'s the manager), they are also the deadpan honest as hell character telling the obvious to the rest of the cast, Hyougo and Kenichirou are the effectively the heads of their respective restaurants who can\'t control the rest of the core cast members and have no power even though they have the highest rank.*Takuya Kouno (Hiro Shimono) - Feels like a mesh of both Hiroomi Souma in vocal personality but have the appearance similar to Jun Satou, it gets even similar as he\'s a chef just like the original characters, he\'s ""inspired by"", but his true comedic value comes from his misunderstandings of the various things that occur in WAGNARIA, making him a rather deadringer for Popura Taneshima in the original in terms of comedic advice.*Miri Yanagiba (Momo Asakura) - Is Aoi Yamada but slightly less like her, they are both truants in most cases and likes to jab at thier main male characters*Rui Nagata (Ari Ozawa) - Feels like she\'s the closest character that comes close to Popura Taneshima, they are both love interests to the main male characters and occasionally misunderstands things especially concerning their love interests.The two new characters that seem entirely new are Kouki Saiki voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya, a 20 year old college student who was born and raised in a different country, thus he can\'t speak Japanese. If LA had to say, he\'s a bit like Kirio Yamada from the original, just merely for the fact that some of their actions causes some unpredictability with their random quirks.Now since we\'re done with similarities...LA\'s favourite character?...Sayuri...just Sayuri, she has the best comedic skits (along with her comedic timing with her ""change of appearance"" running gag that almost never got old) and her mysteriousness along with her voice actor Yoko Hisaka just made her LA\'s favourite character from EPISODE ONE.For the most part, there are three main comedy skits within WWW.Working!!, Miyakoshi and Higashida\'s chocolate transporting into ""Valentine World"" (effectively nearly dying and getting advice from St. Valentine chibi), Sayuri and Adachi\'s romantic relationship with Sayuri surprising smiles and Adachi general obliviousness and finally Yuuta and Shiho\'s debt owing and bribing. For LA and that comedy is being subjective and all, LA thought that Sayuri and Adachi\'s comedy was pretty diverse by using the their relationship and their actions as driving points to both both their relationship and bring out their comedy at the same time. LA thought that Yuuta and Shiho got stale by the halfway point and what with Shiho\'s sadism towards Yuuta was slightly too harsh for the sake of ""comedy"" but thankfully it got better later on. Finally we have Miyakoshi and Higashida\'s comedy in which LA thought it was the average one out of the three, it wasn\'t too bad but it fell into being stale as to how repetitive they took it, Miyakoshi\'s obliviousness and personality and Higashida\'s non-changing expressions and deadpan snark was probably what kept this comedy skit from being overdone.From the major comedy skits, LA will quite easily say that the rest of the characters are more or less catalyst to restart the same comedic skits for the major players, it becomes somewhat worse as the minor characters hardly have impact towards these characters unless the major comedic skits intertwine with one another to start another catalyst. Higashida\'s parents, to Takuya Houno to Kisaki Kondou and Kenichirou Sakaki very quickly loses any kind of screentime besides being for character jabbing but nothing for impact towards the comedic skits, LA knows it\'s not entirely important to focus on these characters, but it just felt like wasted potential to interact these characters with one another more instead of just ""being the catalyst"".In terms of animation, once again done by A1-Pictures, the animation in the character designs goes two ways, due to it having chibi designs for the comedic punchlines to just some moments of it just being chibi just because, but LA can give these chibi designs some slack as it really is a slice of life comedy anime. The more detailed character designs are pretty well done and compensated for the chibi designs as well. Nonetheless the animation is ""ok"" at best for a slice of life comedy anime and not much to talk about other than that.In terms of voice acting, LA will say this, as much as Miyakoshi\'s genkiness and obliviousness was close to an annoying feature but an odd charm to Haruka Tomatsu and really LA would have to give Haruka Tomatsu LA\'s favouirte voice actor from WWW.Working!!, Shiho and Sayuri (Sora Amamiya and Yoko Hisaka respectively) gave a typecasted performance and all the rest of the voice cast did pretty well with what they were given...again not much to talk about besides Haruka Tomatsu really.The comedic skits resolution also have some widening scale of satisfying to anti-climax during the final episode, mainly the satisfying resolutions going to Sayuri & Adachi along with Yuuta and Shiho\'s were pretty much worth it, the only one that felt anti-climaxed and forced was Miyakoshi and Higashida\'s..but this is merely LA\'s perspective so it\'ll probably be different for others nonetheless.WWW.Working felt like it fell into the same pitfalls and strengths the original series went through to the point LA could say nothing but it just felt like WWW.Working had new characters, new skits but same old WAGNARIA, it has it\'s flaws and strengths and it balanced out that WWW.Working didn\'t succeed or fail to it\'s original series, it\'s essentially the same thing under differing characters and their crazy repetitive antics. If you liked the original series, then have WWW.Working a try to see the same thing really.

We look forward to your next visit.""Story: 6WWW.Working !! has a rapid narrative and temporal progression. Each episode takes place one or two months apart from each other, which prevents a deeper development and specification of the characters, but results in a sense of agility, differentiating it from other Slice of life animes.The story is developed around two simple situations, which causes a repetition of jokes and wears out comedy, making it tiring in some parts. Since there is not much time to work each relationship in depth, the plot sometimes forces some situations to move the narrative and the development of the...characters. However, even if it becomes tiring after a few episodes, the development of the relationship between the three couples occurs in a very satisfactory way.A bad point is that several dramas and previously created situations were completely ignored during the course of the anime. Most of them have been completely neglected to make way for a fast and sometimes effective development of the relationship between the characters.Art: 5The art of WWW.Working, very similar to the original series, does not have many unique elements and relation to the story, as it happens in other animes. The animation is relatively average, with no flowing moments or very well animated, but maintaining a consistency.Sound: 6The soundtrack and the dubbing of the anime do not stand out, but they are not bad. The opening is very good, it manages to convey well the atmosphere of the anime and joins a pleasant song with elements of the story.Characters:7The characters are what makes the anime quite enjoyable to watch, the dynamic between them is very interesting and it is often what makes situations and misunderstandings funny. However the development of the personality of the characters is small, mainly because they have little screen time.None of them stand out individually or have a great background story, but all contribute in one way or another to create the pleasant climate of Wagnaria.If I were to highlight a couple, it would be Shiho and Shindou. Their story, even though it was a little exaggerated, was the one that surprised me the most and had a deeper understanding than the others.Enjoyment:7This was an anime in which I had a great time, not only because of the comedy itself, but also because of the relationship between the restaurant staff. However, it is necessary to emphasize that there are some holes in the script and leave many loose ends in the anime, even with it having a closed end. This has somewhat diminished the quality of my anime experience.Overall:7WWW.Working was, overall, a good anime. It has its entertainment mainly based on the relationship between the characters and not necessarily on their development. Initially, it seemed to be more focused on comedy, but went on to highlight the romance in its second half. For those looking for a nice Slice of Life anime and romance, this is going to be a good choice. characters.

I try not to give away spoilers but.... ok fu*k it.*Spoiler*There ok, the main heroine who is ended up with the main protagonist has a phobia to men its called androphobic. This is one of many inside joke that Working season...one use but there is still a whole lot of inside jokes, not have many drama and I don't saw many sadness in the anime too so they quite focus on the comedy and romance part.I don't want to give away the ending but I just said at the end everyone is happy, but it took 3 seasons to make that ending. That's why when I watch that last episode of the 3rd season I'm glad because its over I was just really satisfied to know that the ending its not sad nor disappointing.Ok that's enough for the original Working now let's talk about this newest series of Working. In this one all of them, ALL of them is new characters not even one of them show up in the older series of Working, nor the older character of Working show up in this new spin-off.Just like I said in the beginning is not really that bad, because to be honest I'm glad they don't stick with the old jokes, they made new one. every girl in this anime have some sort of uniqe weakness(?) one of the girl is really rich but still working as a waiter, one of of girl can talk and see ghost, and one of the girl is really bad at cooking.And all this girls have a uniqe inside jokes with their partner just like in the original Working but with new joke and new characters.All the working series have almost a same type of OP. The OP its always happy and just like fun times happening. you can say that this is uniqe for this anime.The characters its suited perfect with the story and the animation is really good too.Well the anime is not bad but not that good either. It is really entertaining but I thought they could do more.And this is just an opinion of me but I think they will not make another season from this new spin-off. You could totally understand if you watch the last episode of WWW.Working.And just FYI, you don't have to watch the entire seasons of Working!! just to watch this anime because this anime have nothing to do with the older ones.I hope this will help, I always enjoy laugh myself out.

I will be reviewing this anime separately from the original series, but there will be comparisons. Overall, this anime is extremely laid back and attempts to pull inspiration from the popular aspects of the original series. But because of these attempts, I personally feel as though this anime cut through potential plot emphasis and butchered character development. Nonetheless, I still found this anime to be entertaining overall.*Story Rating: 7There isn't anything specifically unique or amazing about this anime's plot. Personally, I found side character stories to have been far more entertaining than...the main one. The focus on romance in this spin-off was incredibly generous in comparison to the original series. This focus can be both a good and bad thing. It's good because Working fans are given more emphasis on the ships that they've been waiting for that were so appealing in the original series. It's bad because it places too much emphasis on the relationships to the point where the series feels incredibly rushed. Still the comedy genre is the main strong point that makes this anime worth watching.*Art and Sound Ratings: 7.5I found both the art and sound of this anime to be incredibly average. But I do enjoy the simplistic art style of it all. For some characters, watchers can see a combination of the original cast mixed into one.*Character Ratings: 7I personally felt like the character development of this anime was butchered heavily. All but for the exception of one of the female characters really changed throughout the series, whereas the rest were fairly stuck in their ways. I found that several of these characters, like their character art designs, are combinations of past characters. Again, I feel as though this is the creators' attempt to maintain a story that is familiar but still different as it contains the popular aspects of the original series. Nonetheless, characters were entertaining overall.*Overall Rating: 7I personally give this anime an overall rating of 7.

All of a sudden, they\'ll go like, ""So as you guys see, we are now dating"". I was like, ""Where is the...build-up moments before they having a romance relationship?"". A simple ""I love you"" isn\'t exactly a build-up moment. Like how Yachiyo and Sato develop a romance after 3 seasons of Working now that is the best. In the first place in this series that is, I was like I know that these two will going out and that actually ruins the enjoyment. But still, that I don\'t mind, this anime might be better if they didn\'t make the story progressing to fast as in they bring this anime like how they do with the Working series.Art :Since this is pretty much the same of Working yes an 8 I gave it. Not that I have much to say though.Sound :The opening is pretty catchy to be honest. I end up listening to it in every opening because it\'s just great. Voice actor are doing quite a good job for their own characters.Character :Now this is the only category where it might be not just me but mostly people who watch this anime will write long. Now here it is:Higashida Daisuke - Higashida is yes indeed a reversal of Takanashi. Anything that I can think of is pretty much reverse of Takanashi so there\'s no need for me to say it longer.Miyakoshi Hana - Ah yes, the reversal of Inami Mahiru. Where this time Hana works as the floor chief but still Hana is way more boy-like character in this series.Kamakura Shiho - As we can see, this is the reversal of Todoroki Yachiyo. Where Shiho is more sadist girl than Yachiyo. But the only thing that\'s different is first, the sword. Yachiyo already have it with her in the beginning but Shiho bought it later on. But still, Shiho is the reversal of Yachiyo.Muranushi Sayuri - To be honest, it might be just me but I still think that Sayuri is actually a new character in this series. A ghost girl but claims that she\'s not. Talking like her smile is actually a weapon and yes indeed she took my heart with that haha.Kondou Kisaki - I\'m actually prefer that this character is the manager but she\'s not. Yet again her baby daughter actually replacing that cute kid in the original series.Adachi Masahiro - A reversal of Sato, but to be honest I was still lost whether the one who cooks in the kitchen is it Adachi or Kouno? But I digress.I can say a lot more but yeah that\'s what I thought when it comes to characters that is.Enjoyment :I didn\'t really enjoy this to be frankly speaking because of the story is progressing way too fast. But as another spin-off I guess I\'ll take it and enjoy as a normal comedy, slice of life anime.Overall this anime can be better if the story didn\'t progressing too fast. I was hoping that this series is way much better than the original but I still vouch for the original series. This anime isn\'t exactly bad if it was taken as a normal comedy, slice of life anime. If this anime is first watch before the original, maybe I will have a different opinion on this.

It's far from the weirdest out there, but at least the scene change whenever they're meeting St. Valentine reminded me of stuff like Yuri Kuma Arashi. The characters are caricatures of their own idiosyncrasies more than anything. And those idiosyncrasies just seem more natural and at the same time more over the top than in the original Working.Obviously, it lends itself to hardcore shipping,...and even the weaker characters evolve more sympathetic later on.Art style, sound and the other hygiene factors aren't extraordinary compared to your average 2016 anime, but they also don't lose out against much.All in all an enjoyable anime. It obviously lacks the brilliance of greats like Nichijou, but solid nonetheless.

However, people who do not enjoy slice of life would find this dreary as there is no real story ongoing.Although in the same (?) location, there is a different set of characters working here (as compared to the first season), and a possible failing of the show was perhaps that it made me miss the original more than love this one.As usual, humour is dependent on your own preference, so perhaps check a couple of episodes out first before deciding if you would like to commit to...the series.

Would\'ve given it a 3 if it hadn\'t been because of the character development plot)ROFL meter: 7/10 (Comedy here and there but it\'s more of like a slap stick kind with all that violence)Ending: 9/10 (Kawaii Ending)Art: 9/10 (I\'m just the movement specific type. It\'s almost the same style as the original one.)...I think the producers on this anime were probably forced to make another one since fans had requested this heavily then. But this was probably stuck on the ""No idea, resort to this"" type of production. Seriously, It wasn\'t half bad, but it felt like there could have been more. Kind of like, has a potential yet not brought out in the best way.But overall, I wasn\'t disappointed. I\'m just not the type to compare anime afterall. I believe this anime is quite unique in its own way. It focused more on the development of the character\'s relationship than basic comedy. I wouldn\'t say it\'s not ""Working!!"" type at all, but it\'s still conceivable to have improved more.

Now that I've watched it, it's proper that I write a review on it.Story: WWW follows the basic Working formula that's been in use throughout the 3 seasons of Working. You have your season, your events, and then you make some zany, but still realistic situations. The story in itself is like everything you've already watched from the original Working. But in my opinion, that formula wasn't used to the fullest. It's like the regular Working series, but the story isn't as developed.Art: Standard art for...any Working series; just read my Working S3 review for any further explanation.Sound: Voice acting is still good, like the regular series.Character: This version of Wagnaria has an entirely new cast of characters, but personalities from the regular cast seem to be in every character, and a mix of them are in one. For instance, the main character does act like Takanashi in a way, but he also is the rational one in the restaurant, so he's also a bit like Satou. One other thing that works is the fact that the characters actually develop. For instance, Shihou. She goes from a psychotic sadist to an incompetent lovestruck girl by the end of the series, but this works due to the backstories from her and Yuuta.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this like I did the regular series, although with some more enjoyment in some areas and general frustration in others. Story was something that I didn't like as much here, but I liked Characters to a certain extent a bit more (maybe certain characters).Overall: Wrapping things up, I did find this show to be a great addition to the Working series, but I felt as if it could have been done a bit better. any Working series; just read my Working S3 review for any further explanation.Sound: Voice acting is still good, like the regular series.Character: This version of Wagnaria has an entirely new cast of characters, but personalities from the regular cast seem to be in every character, and a mix of them are in one.

The...restaurants name is Wagnaria like in the first anime. The story follows the daily lives of the staff that work within the restaurant as they encounter common and sometimes perplexing situations, make friends and in some cases finding surprising things about your co workers and also get a chance to find romance. Workings overall storyline is pretty light but emphases on character development and the relationship and bonds forged between the characters. The story is simple and often funny and hillarious and is a great way to cheer you up after a long day.The main story follows the character of Daisuke Higashida a high school freshman that takes up a part time job at the Wagaria restaurant to pay for his living costs and in the process encountering the rather unique cast of characters that work there.Higashida is the main character of the show and is portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuuichi Nakamura of Owari no seraph and the irregular at magic high school fame. A high school freshman that is forced to take up a part time job to pay for personal and living costs due to a strangely comical family circumstance. Higashida is a dependable and kind person that gets on well with the cast at the restaurant. However Higashida can also be surprisingly cynical in some situations which is not that surprising actually.Higashida also gets annoyed quite easily usually because of his co worker Hana. Despite this Higashida can be forgiving at times and indeed as his friendship with Hana and the rest of the staff grow this happens quite often. In a way Higashida was forced to take up a job at the restaurant and though he initially saw the staff there as strange Higashida eventually see's the merits of this. A major plot element of Higa's is that along with Hana he is one of the two people that can after ingesting disgusting enough or revolting enough food can go to a alternate dimension where Old man Valantine the god of love resides. Higashida's reactions at seeing Valentine is pretty funny and get me every time. All in all i think Yuuichi Nakamura did a great job portraying Higashida.Hana portrayed by veteran seiyuu Haruka Tomatsu of Sword art online fame and one of my favorite seiyuu's is one of the main characters of the show and is the staff member that was charged by the manager of the restaurant to oversee Higashida's training. Like Higashida Hana is a high school student but her grades are far worst. Despite appearing rough and unattractive on the outside she can change this to welcome and thank customers by looking friendlier. Like the rest of the staff Hana is unfazed at the somewhat strange antics that the staff at the restaurant get into as long as they do their jobs right.Hana's main trait is that despite enjoying making chocolate her cooking skills are visually non existent and indeed is hazardous to those that eat it. One of the running gags of the show is that Hana will constantly give chocolate to Hihashida that is so horrible that it almost kills him and sends him to see Valentine. This i found to rather comical and funny. Personality wise Hana is a kind hearted, determined and somewhat aggressive person that nonetheless is great at her job. Her relationship with Higashida that forms one of the main plot lines for the series i felt was quite sweet and interesting as it stems from both's desire to improve her cooking skills. Haruka Tomatsu who voiced her i felt did a great job portraying the aggressive and serious Hana that was also clueless in love related matters.Shiho played by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Plastic memories fame and also my 3rd favorite seiyuu is one of the main characters of the show. A rich girl due to her fathers wealth Shiho is typical rich girl in that she is spoiled, arrogant and materialistic. One of the most comical things about her is that she often tries to bribe customers with money.Shiho and Shindou are childhood friends and have a rather interesting relationship that is different from that troupe in that Shindou has a debt to Shiho's father which necessitates that he works to to repay it. At the same time Shiho has taken it upon herself to also work in the same place so as to torment and abuse him. When they were little Shiho was rejected by Shindou due to a rather complicated family situation that ultimately resulted in his current predicament. Despite this Shiho's abuse is usually just harmless abuse and torment as she is still very much in love with him and is waiting for him to realize this. Over the course of the series Shiho actually develops two different personalities that reflect on the events so far.In her first incarnation Shiho is somewhat sadistic and abusive towards Shindou while at the same time she's a positive and cheerful person that does the best at her jobs. Her second personality however is a far cry from the first one and was a result of both Shindou's confession and her admittance of love for him. In this one Shiho is kind, caring and eager to learn and at the same time nice to Shindou acting like the classic girl in love troupe. This personality of hers i actually liked the most and i was glad that the two were able to mend their differences and become an item.As a character that has to be nice and kind but at the same time sadistic and though admittedly humorously abusive Shiho was a tough role to play but i believe that Sora Amamiya did a fantastic job in portraying her character and her portrayal of Shiho as she changed from sadistic taskmaster to a Tsundere and finally to love struck maiden was excellent and one of her best performances to date.Shindou portrayed by veteran voice actor Kensho Ono of Aldnoah Zero and Bungo stray dogs fame is one of the main characters of the show. A fellow staff member of Higashida and Hana Shindou is perhaps the very image of being as he as a result of his fathers gambling incurred a massive debt from Shiho's father which necessitates that he take several jobs in an effort to pay his living costs. Personality wise Shindou despite being in debt is a positive and dependable person that can appear gloomy at times due to Shiho's constant abuse. Shindou has a rather interesting relationship with Shiho in that they were childhood friends that were fond of each other but due to family circumstance Shindou was forced to change an answer that he gave to Shiho's confession forever changing matters. As a result Shindou has to live with the fact that Shiho is working in the same place as he is and constantly treating him poorly because of that decision. Shindou's arc within the show is one of the main plot lines for the series and is one that i actually enjoyed seeing as it allowed him to see what caused his current predicament and allowed him to undo the one mistake that he made in his life and roll back everything so that everything between him and Shiho are perfect.Sayuri voiced by veteran seiyuu Yoko Hikasa of Code Geass and High school DXD fame is one of the main characters of the show. Sayuri like Higashida and Hana is a member of the Wagaria's staff. A quiet and hardworking girl thats also adapt at threatening people with her actions Sayuri is also kind and friendly towards fellow staff members and always willing to give advice that at the same time can be questionable. One of Sayuri's most prominent traits is that she seems to be associated with spirits and ghosts as she seems able to see them which is exampled with the fact that every now and then a invisible customer that only Sayuri seems to be able to see enters the store and requests her to serve him. Another prominent trait of Sayuri is that she rarely ever shows any kind of expression and that when she smiles it instead has the opposite effect with its effects varying in levels of damage it can do. Yoko Hikasa i felt did a great job voicing Sayuri.Adachi voiced by veteran voice actor Kouki Uchiyama of Charlotte fame is one of the main characters of the show. Adachi is a fellow staff member of Higashida and Hana and works in the kitchen as one of the cooks. Positive, good natured and helpful Adachi performs his job with all the diligence expected of him. Adachi has an interesting relationship with Sayuri in that after seeing him smile at him once he suffered from a fast heart rate and believed that it was a curse. Afterwards he tried to stay away from Sayuri which made him look even more suspicious to the staff. However despite that he learned that his increase in heart rate may be due to his liking of Sayuri instead which sets the stage for the romance between the two. Another trait of Adachi's is that he is very honest with his feelings as in the case when he confessed to Sayuri about the feelings that he has been having regarding her. I liked the romance between between Adachi and Sayuri in that it was very unlikely that the two will be together and yet that is exactly what happened. Seeing Adachi take the first move and seeing Sayuri's surprised at the confession was also cute.Saiki is a support character of the show that works at the Wagaria restaurant with Higashida and Hana. A foreigner that only joined the restaurant due to a ill timed job application that was submitted by his friends Saiki did not initially want the job but was pressed into service due to the staff shortage. Saiki's character is more for comic relief than anything and in his attempt to learn Japanese the phrases that he speaks can be quite funny.Nagata voiced by veteran seiyuu and Ari Ozawa of Asterisk wars and Classroom crisis fame and one of my favorite seiyuu's is a classmate of Higashida and a close friend of his. Nagata is a kind, compassionate and thoughtful person that cares a great deal about Higashida and has obvious feelings for him. Throughout the series Nagata faces the decision of whether to admit her feelings for him or let the next girl be the one instead. Nagata often gets dragged into problems facing Higashida such as the case with Miri that Higashida introduced her too.However while Nagata certainly did find Miri to be somewhat strange Nagata did eventually develop a good friendship with her and at the same time find a confident to discuss her problems with. Despite being a quiet girl Nagata can get angry especially when Higashida risks his life for something which is actually quite surprising for her character due to her quiet personality. I felt that Ari Ozawa did a great job portraying Nagata.Kisaki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nana Mizuki who is my favorite singer and seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series. A university student and a mother with child Kisaki is one of the oldest characters in the restaurant. Smart, lazy but at the same time educated Kisaki though a member of staff actually does very little work preferring instead to behave like a rebel. When challenged to do work by Higashida and the others she will instead give you a trivia question which are usually quite simple but not for the staff at the restaurant. In fact Higashida is the only one who is able to surprise her by answering it correctly and thus gaining her respect. Kisaki's daughter Hime is often with her and like her mother she too is pretty smart with regards to making money.Miri voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Momo Asakura of Charlotte fame is a support character of the show. A fellow classmate of Higashida and Nagata that neither see's because of her illness that keeps her at home. Miri is the granddaughter of Sayuri's ghost customer that due to her illness was not able to make it to school prompting Higashida to determine what was wrong with her to which he dragged in Nagata to help. Miri after some awkward first introductions by both Higashida and Nagata eventually becomes a good friend to both Higashida and Nagata and her antics though minor compared to the others is still pretty amusing. Miri is a carefree person that is nonetheless quite perceptive in that she is able to deduce that Nagata is in love with Higashida and is usually the one that confronts her with this and tries to push it along. Despite being a support character I quite liked Miri as a character and i felt that Momo Asakura did a great job portraying her.Arts and animationThe art for the series i felt was well done with the character designs being especially good and detailed.

This show was a reminder of how much I loved this series. It might be in fact better than its sister show.There really is no story. The show is a slice of life comedy show and the mini stories all revolve around the characters who work at Wagnaria. This time they took a much more direct line on everything which I appreciated. They let the show drag on a bit before in the previous show and It was nice to have things end the way they did this time around.Each of the relationship building mini...stories are interesting, though shallow. They are more like vehicles for the comedy.The art is decent, nothing to write home about. The soundtrack wasn't as catchy but it was fitting.The characters are what will make or break this show for people. There are about 10 people who are working at Wagnaria, and each of them have some sort of odd ball personality that makes working there strange. It would take to long to list the characters here but I will say they all were fairly interesting, similar in a few ways but fresh and fun to watch. However there wasn't nearly the same amount of character development, and many of the interpersonal relationship issues were somewhat strange or could have done with a bit more effort written into them. While I was watching the show I was laughing and enjoying the story, but looking back on it the show might have done well with a second season or even a handful more episodes.Like I mentioned above this show was a enjoyable. I laughed a lot and even had a hard time putting it down so I could sleep. I like how they didn't play around as much this time, but it also felt a bit lacking when the end hits. The characters were as enjoyable or even more so than the original cast and the relationship dynamics were fun to watch. If you have watched the previous working seasons then you should definitely give this one a watch. If you haven't seen working before then you can jump in here and enjoy yourself and think about the other series you'll have in store when you wind up liking it.TLDR: If your a fan of slice of life comedy with some romance elements then give this show a shot. Enjoyable, though perhaps a tad shallow. stories are interesting, though shallow. They are more like vehicles for the comedy.The art is decent, nothing to write home about. The soundtrack wasn't as catchy but it was fitting.The characters are what will make or break this show for people. There are about 10 people who are working at Wagnaria, and each of them have some sort of odd ball personality that makes working there strange. It would take to long to list the characters here but I will say they all were fairly interesting, similar in a few ways but fresh and fun to watch. However there wasn't nearly the same amount of character development, and many of the interpersonal relationship issues were somewhat strange or could have done with a bit more effort written into them. While I was watching the show I was laughing and enjoying the story, but looking back on it the show might have done well with a second season or even a handful more episodes.Like I mentioned above this show was a enjoyable. I laughed a lot and even had a hard time putting it down so I could sleep. I like how they didn't play around as much this time, but it also felt a bit lacking when the end hits. The characters were as enjoyable or even more so than the original cast and the relationship dynamics were fun to watch. If you have watched the previous working seasons then you should definitely give this one a watch.

I'd like to say that I am more attached to this series than the original one. Why? Primarily because I like the main couple more. Anyway the story is SoL-Romance-Comedy. It's really fun, but it's a bit jumpy. A-1 did a good job of animating this. I really enjoyed this. The opening and ending is great as always, because the cast sings it hahaha. The characters are the focal point of this show. The development and chemistry of the characters are just gold. I enjoyed this series so much I...rewatched it in like 6 hours. rewatched it in like 6 hours."", ""***This is a spoiler free review***You do not need to have watched the first 3 seasons of Working in order to watch www.Workingwww.Working is a separate experience than Working with a whole new cast but it does borrow many of the comedic and plot driven devices that made the first one so good. This new season tries to cram in what the original series did in three seasons and honestly it might have been for the better.Story: 8.5/10The last sentence I put in my opening statement has to do with how this new season deals with the character relationships. In the original Working visible...relationships were starting to form within the cast in the first season. These relationships however take three seasons to full get realized. In www.Working however it takes only thirteen episodes to see three couples come to terms with each other. I find that the grand beauty of this new season is that everything moves at a very understandable pace with character building and at-work semantics happening together. This was the case for the first season of the original series but seasons two and three had issues presenting worthy character/relationship building.This new season absolutely nails pacing and provides so many awesome scenes between characters. Idk what the outlook is for future seasons (seeing how this one ended) but I did wish we got a couple more episodes to see things flesh out a little more.Animation: 7/10Honestly nothing to write home about. The animation gets the job done. The artstyle is in-line with what has been present in previous Working seasons which is a good thing. Character models are very pleasing to look at and the background scenes are very well done. It is a pleasant show to look at.Sound: 9/10Totally dug each character's VA. They feel so real on screen which means the voice actors nailed it 100%. Also the background music fits in very well. It is recycled a little more than I wanted to but the themes help make the scenes great.Characters: 10/10This might come off as a little blasphemous but this cast is much better than the original Working cast. This new cast has just the right balance of weird and super cute/likable characteristics. I'm looking through the character list right now and I seriously cannot find a single one that I even remotely disliked. Higashida and Miyakoshi's chemistry was 100% spot on from episode one, Shiho's transformation was so rewarding to see progress, and Sayuri's and Adachi's growing chemistry was probably the thing I enjoyed most about the show. No matter which group was on screen, it was always amazing. Even the things that didn't play out as much as I wanted (like Saiki's growing understanding of the Japanese Language and his boss/worker relationship with Kondo) was still really fun to watch when it was present.When a show never lets me lose my smile it did characters 100% right.Overall: 8.6/10This is simply a fantastic show. Regardless if you have seen the original Working you should go watch this now. It nails the comedy, the character building, and the work atmosphere antics. Probably my most favorite show of this year now no joke.Enjoyment: 9.4/10Thanks for reading my review!

Shinreigari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2596/Shinreigari,"[""I must say that Ghost Hound is the most complex and technical anime ever made. It's the kind of anime which make you go on the wiki and search for the terminology. As is expected from the staff of Serial Experiment Lain, you have to pay attention to detail or re-watch it to understand what the story is about and the relationship and explanation of it. Ghost Hound, whose idea has gone through 8 years of planning, is indeed a masterpiece. A must see for any hardcore sci-fi fan. "", ""Many anime strive for a horror element and settle for the gore.  Others try for the psychological approach and get lost in the relationships.  This, however, is a shining star among them all.Ghost Hound foregoes all the gore and heads straight for the downright creepy.  The animation style, though soft and fairly unassuming, only enhances this creepy-factor once the ball starts rolling.  Each episode title is taken straight from psychology texts, and exploits the given theme with finesse and underhanded tact.Nothing is overdone.  Everything is like a current flowing underground, or a train rumbling by only a mile away....You can't see it, but you can feel the presence.  The atmosphere is set with an amazing score which seems to taunt all those soft and unassuming characters with the terror to come.Only it isn't obvious.Many anime try to shove &quot;the horror of it all&quot; down your throat, leading to some nausea and perhaps a little surprise.  This, however, slips beteen the cracks and tugs at your primal half, makes you start to wonder whether or not you really are safe in your own head.  The imagery shifts like flashbacks from a memory only half-recalled (they address that topic, actually) and the atmospheric music only sucks you in deeper.The characters, too, are well-rounded and fascinating, from Makoto and is utterly horrifying grandma, to Masayuki and his social eccentricities, to Tarou and that FREAKY &quot;lucid dream&quot; he keeps having.  (&quot;Lucid Dream&quot; is episode 1)Overall:If you love shows and movies that just crawl inside and start to make you think really hard about things you once thought were absolutes, then this is the show to see.Perhaps one downside is the lack of dialogue, but in a horror, images and sounds carry so much more meaning, and these images and sounds are guaranteed to make tingles rund down your backbone.  The other downside--a trifle, really--is that the first episode takes a few minutes to really take off, but once it does, the anime never slows down.It is an anime for the true psychological horror fan, and Production I.G. was brilliant for making this their 20th anniversary release.Plus, those little astrally projected bodies?  Man, even if the show's creepy-factor doesn't appeal to you, those little things are just too cool for words. You can't see it, but you can feel the presence.

I am glad to tell you, that you are wrong. At first, when I saw, that GH is of 22 episodes, I was sure, that it will be verbose and / or tedious (i'm used to...13-episode psychological animes), but I'm glad I tried watching it despite that thoughts. Of course, the plot needs a half of the first episode to take off, but once it does, it doesn't stop (actually, it's going faster and faster to the climax). The anime is a specific type of an illustrated encyclopedia: trauma, mental disorders, possession, out-of-body experiences, mind, brain, afterlife and more - every one of these is shown in a few different points of view, either scientific or spiritual.

Unlike most horror series that feature plenty of shocking, gory moments and psychological dramas that show the absurd, extremes of the human psyche; Ghost Hounds goes for a more technical approach. Sadly this leads to a great series with an incredibly complex story.It is about four different kids who have suffered from different traumatic events; in their past and now have the ability to traverse this “unseen world”. That’s just the initial plot of the series and as the story begins, you will see a...bunch of stuff and have no idea what on earth is going on. Slowly but surely, little bits of this mysterious and uncanny story are revealed and during this process you’ll be force fed a lot of psychological terminology. Yet it still takes some time for the story to become somewhat interesting. Then you’ll be able to enjoy the series, as it develops into a sensational experience, whilst learning a fair bit of neurology, psychology and Japanese folklore. At the same time it is easy to consider dropping the series, for those who are unable to get into it.The animation quality of this anime was superb, having an extraordinary amount of detail put into the little-less things and with interesting, surreal surroundings when expressing the unseen world. The characters were well designed and moved fluidly but the pale colour tones did make some look unappealing. At least the rich environments and scenery made up for the short comings.It was pretty tricky to judge this anime on the quality of the sound, because there wasn’t much there. During the weird apparitions and flashbacks there was a great deal of weird SFX used, to which is perfect for setting the creepy mood. However with barely any music at all, in the end, it just sounded pretty bland.Overall this is a mildly interesting anime showing the parallels of the psychological and the supernatural however other than the technical aspects of this anime (e.g. animation), this series can be a pretty dull and lifeless experience. With so much terminology to take in, anyone can feel like dropping this at any moment and going for a much easier show to understand. But the series does become fairly interesting to watch later on, when things become clearer and the story finally start to move forward. So before watching this series you’ll have to think to yourself, “Is this the type of series I would enjoy?”^_^ bunch of stuff and have no idea what on earth is going on.

The series gave off the same kind of atmosphere that Higurashi and Shiki gave me, which shows how great it was directed. The unique camera angle amplifying the creepy tone of the series to a level where ""horror"" would be one of the appropriate genre for the series while the colorful and unique representation of the ""hidden world"" surely did its job to allow the viewers to see...the story in a more frightening way, making them more prone to the dark assumptions that viewers can\'t help but to make in a series like this.The pacing was perfect in almost every way, just enough room to maintain a balanced space, captivating the viewers with various thrilling experiences and allowing them to make assumption about what will happen next, whether its the horrifying secrets that the three main characters would find out about their past or the problems that forms around their morbid town. The show does maintain a large cast near the end of the series but all of them were thoroughly developed, what also support this is the three main characters as they were interesting to a certain point where seeing their interaction as they help each other uncover the secret to their past is one of the main focus, for both the series and its viewers.While the series does maintain a great sense of atmosphere and characters development, its ending fall short to what most viewer would have assumed for it to played out. Near the end of the series, the original plot (Solve Taro\'s past trauma, who did what and the various morbid discoveries that each character would discover as they delve deeper into the past and the ""hidden world""),  was left behind to be replaced  with two new ones, which unfortunately ruin the ending for me, as these two new plot line have almost nothing to be relevant with the original purpose of the story, sure there were some connection here and there but it was far too fragile to be in truthful relation with the original story, it just felt like the show tried to expand its storytelling limit and failed pretty bad, resulting in the undesirable answer to the whole affair about Taro\'s kidnapping incident as the viewers only received a happy and simple resolution to the the scary kidnapping that was so well presented that it should have made most viewers expecting something a little bit more shudder worthy.Overall Ghost Hound was a very well played out series from beginning... to the middle, for the way that the ending was told results in a total lost of the original plot. But don\'t get me wrong, if you\'re really into thrillers and the like, this series must be on your ""plan to watch"" or ""completed"" list because, ending aside, the series did a great job of presenting itself as a psychological thriller in many ways. the story in a more frightening way, making them more prone to the dark assumptions that viewers can\'t help but to make in a series like this.The pacing was perfect in almost every way, just enough room to maintain a balanced space, captivating the viewers with various thrilling experiences and allowing them to make assumption about what will happen next, whether its the horrifying secrets that the three main characters would find out about their past or the problems that forms around their morbid town.

It leaves the audience feeling incomplete as there are a lot of questions left unanswered, and also with a heavy sense of disappointment. When the last episode ended the first thing that came to my mind was, ""...ok...so...is that it?"". I\'d only recommend this anime to people who don\'t really want to be drawn and hooked to an anime, but those who are just wanting something to pass the time with and have absolutely nothing better to do. (I hate being this harsh, but it really wasn\'t good)Story: 4Let me just start off by saying...that the concept of the story was promising and deeply intriguing. However, despite this there was bad linkage, poor pace, and a very poorly thought out conclusion. Let me explain. The anime is about 3 boys who become friends and start to experience soul traveling through a series of events. The beginning is quite promising as the main protagonists all have interesting dark backgrounds, and the authors also utilize very dark themes such as suicide, and the occult. However, despite all these amazing ingredients they didn\'t seem to do a lot with it. Yes, they create very good and fascinating concepts, but they failed to develop it any further or add any more depth to it. All it turned out to be was a good idea and nothing else. Every time something interesting would happen, they would just drop it and leap onto another concept. Additionally, the pace of the anime was very dragged out. And each episode just created a feeling a heaviness and not excitement. If you\'re looking for a fast paced engaging psychological horror/thriller this is not it. In all, the story, just didn\'t hit the mark, but simply fell flat on it\'s face.Art: 7The art work was very good in my opinion.(but I\'m not a very ""artsy"" person so don\'t quote me on this) The drawing of the characters, and the background/scenery were all quite beautifully done.Sound: 8I really liked the sound which was utilized in the anime. I thought it was superb. The eerie like sounds they would use, and also the kind of disconnected far off sounds which were heard when the characters would be soul traveling was very interesting and set the mood. However, unfortunately, since the story within the anime was slow paced and un-engaging, the sound effects did little to increase the enjoyability of it...well it did do a little, but not all that much.Character: 5As I said before, the main characters all had dark backgrounds which made them interesting at first but then as the anime continued, the development was very poorly done. The only character which was very interesting, and whose pieces fell all together at the end was Makoto. He was the character who really pushed me into watching the anime through to the end, as he was the only one which sort of made it interesting/engaging for me.Enjoyment: 3 and Overalll Score: 3In all, I didn\'t enjoy this anime. It was dragged out, there were a lot of unanswered questions and the conclusion was just rushed. The plot failed to really go anywhere interesting, and most of the characters were not very intriguing nor had good character development.Watch it if you have nothing better to do, but honestly, I wouldn\'t recommend it. that the concept of the story was promising and deeply intriguing.

Nothing is better than Ghost H*nt.Selling point(s):Top notch sound effect, interesting facts on researches, dark and mysterious atmosphereReason(s) of liking the anime:Well to start with, I am one of those horror fans.  1st episodes already caught my attention with their top notch story pace and astonishing sound effects, which really stirs up the eery atmosphere. In my honest opinion, this anime is like a marriage of Serial experimental Lain and Ghost Hunt( if you haven watch them, go watch em!). I am also interested of their homework done on the facts and researches regarding unexplained /...truth of supernatural events. With all this combination of greatness, even though i am at only 10th episodes, it certainly my must-watch , till the end of the series.Advice(s):1) For all ages, definitely a must watch for those who likes horror , supernatural genre, not for the weak hearted. truth of supernatural events.

It doesn\'t really show, although as that was in 1987 it isn\'t so surprising. Why it took 20 years to make such a great anime is anyone\'s guess.Anyway, the story is very good. A dark and moody tale at heart, this anime mulls through the lives of its protagonists and a semi-real world of astral projection and spirits. It does so in a way immediately attributable to Nakamura Ryuutarou\'s (Serial Experiments Lain) direction. I enjoyed SEL\'s rasping static sensory deprivation, and I love it...here too. The bassy atmosphere death rattles the viewer through several inter-connected disturbing backstories, and drapes the lead characters in harsh, heavy shadows.The dark story involves the ""unseen world"" of disconnected spirits, and is played out as part mystery, part science.

A definite 10/10. It is complex without being too over-the-top (for the genre it is under, that is) and unfolds gradually, but not too slowly either. Each character, minor or protagonist, has an ever expanding role and someone you may think you will only see once or in the background often has a greater story to tell.Another wonderful aspect of this anime is that rarely is someone as they appear to be and where certain situations could have played out in a typical fashion...took a very different role instead. My favourite example of this was Taro\'s therapist/counselor, Dr. Hirata, but there are a number of others that follow.And while some of the plotlines intersect, the one\'s that do not, still believeably flow within the plot and are usually very interesting. It isn\'t often I have come across subplots that while separate,continue to be relevant and intriguing.The OP song is fun and different, not completely makign sense to the anime itself right away, but then it grows on you and feels as though it actually fits rather well. I still couldn\'t get into the ending theme song or the scratchy static noises the anime sometimes used as suspenseful ""Oh no! What will happen in the next episode!!"" sound bites or for re-capping an episode, however that is my own preference and I suspect others would disagree.The art style was also interesting to me, not just for the art itself but the direction it took. One of the best examples of this is the landscape, which is as much a character itself as it is a background. It is at times, such an important element of the plot, you forget the it is setting and not an actor, because it isn\'t just land as a setting, but it has its own history and plotline which is explored.Another example of the art talent lies in this anime\'s direction. There are some very interesting perspectives and angles the directors and artists chose to take for it, some of which pertain to the aforementioned land uses, while others are due to a particular characters perspective or to create a creepy atmosphere or tell the story better.While I wouldn\'t swear by it or recommend it to everyone I know, I would recommend it generally, because overall, I found this show to be slower, creepy and intense, but also original, subtle and engaging. The best description I have read for this anime came from the review by Cyh when \'s/he\' states: ""Nothing is overdone. Everything is like a current flowing underground, or a train rumbling by only a mile away."" Which sounds rather abstract on paper (or in this case, the screen), but after having seen the full breadth of the show makes a great deal of sense to me. Like a river it seems to meander, but unlike many anime by the end has come to a place where it has expanded fully and reached an entertaining crescendo. took a very different role instead.

We find out that it was all a damn dream from our main character. Taro Komori seems like a rather normal boring guy who lives with a family of brewers. And yet they bring up strange things about his past that seem to be bothering him. I can’t lie, even with knowing the description of the anime; this all was a bit confusing in the beginning. They jump around a lot and the only thing I really got was that Taro was...able to astro project and has dreams of the past. As the show goes on, it does get slightly better and there are times that they kept me on the edge of my seat but it is extremely logical and have a mountain of dialogue before something gets done.Masayuki seems much more like the person we should be following. He is the outsider who is gathering information on what goes on around the other two. He seems to have more of an understanding that things are happening then Taro and Makoto.  It’s that or Taro and Masayuki’s stories should switch a bit. Miyako is pretty silent but is also one that I wished we could get more info on right up front. She seems to have even more understanding as to what is going on about the spiritual world.I like how they show the outer body experience like being in water to where you can’t really hear anything around you. What I don’t like is that they seem to have only one goal throughout the whole show and that’s to find out what went on a long time ago. It just makes the characters sound like broken records at times. Now I’m not saying it’s no good. I did like it but I wish that they had more episodic ghost show with the overall plot mixed in with it.A lot of this show talks about the mind and how philology plays a big part in what happens when you have trauma at a young age. Unfortunately, it seems that they try to base it all on ghosts and astro projections. Sometimes it feels like they are just trying to make up excuses to what’s going on with the kids. At some point, they even talk about the destruction of nature though I really don’t see what it has to do with all of the supernatural ideas or the children turning into strange beings.The animation lacks just a little, making it look a little like Sayonara Zetsubo-Sensei with a little bit of CG mixed into it. Sometimes it looks a bit on the plain side, not really standing out from any other anime or even lacking from others. Still, I have to give it props for trying to be different then the others. The close ups give a very creepy look to the show. Unfortunately, some of the characters look like they have large heads even when not in a spiritual form.The music is really hunting and creepy in the opening, but set the mood well. What doesn’t set the mood is the basic clips from the show. It just seems like a lack of love was given to the opening in this aspect. The scripting is a bit odd; sometimes the characters seem to talk to someone even if they haven’t said anything at all. There are also some strange passes in the way sentences are said and sometimes the volume isn’t right. Even with the strange script, I still like how the voices are.

The execution was fair.Taro (our whiney main-main character), Makoto (rebel extraordinaire) and Masayuki (professional milf hunter) are our three almost immediate MC's for this evening.

The crush thing goes no where, so there was really no reason to have it. They also only touch on religion briefly before just going for a cult approach. Oh yeah... Character development? Nope, everyone that needed it just 180's near the end of the anime. What little dialogue we get starts to get choppy near the end.What it does well: This animu brings up a lot about different diseases and conditions with the brain. It also effectively brings up the spiritual side of the coin in a kind of speculative point of view. Miyako is probably the show's best character in terms of character development she goes from not understanding her place in the world (it's implied so you have to pay attention) to finally accepting her dad as an understanding individual.

The setting is in a small town that gives off such unsettling vibes that it sometimes gives the feeling that it could have been picked up by the silent hill franchise.  The characters are introduced well, and begin to get fleshed out with a plot that deviates completely from the classic Anime stereotypes.  In short, this Anime looks and sounds beautiful....But all of this sounds good, why the low score?  Unfortunately the Anime lacks the central drive of a plot to keep the show moving for the entire 26 episodes.  Sometime around the 17th episode mark, the plot does a COMPLETE 180, and the entire ambiance of the Anime is lost along the way.

Upon watching the first episode and nearly quitting halfway through, I dropped the series...  until three weeks ago.  I started watching it again, I decided I was going to drill my mind right through it.  So I did.  I found that the, boring, static plot was unfolding very slowly.  There were no lovable or badass characters as far as I\'m concerned, nothing interesting, nothing...thought provocative at all for the first few episodes - probably just a background setup.  But suddenly, though I dare not unveil what happens, my mind is blown.  I managed to spend the rest of the series waiting for the episode where it is revealed that all the characters were on shrooms, but it never happened.Story:  Mind blowing.  There are few known variables.  The story is where the variables emerge from.  I would definitely say there is no filler, that\'s a plus.  Some characters are digging for events of the past (lost memory, truth), some are striving for the present (trying to rid themselves of fear, or family related problems).  All in all, the story is OK, I\'d give it a 8 if it weren\'t for the pacing issues at the beginning.Art:  Art is good.  Doesn\'t really stand out, but it conveys its intended purpose just fine.

The primary character of the series is one which is concerned at first with his own fear, but he eventually shifts his concerns to everyone else.

After i finished it just recently, my first thought was: ""Man, i can´t believe it took me so long until i finally watched this!""However...this show centers around three high school boys with traumatic experiences in the past, who try to solve a mysterious puzzle in the small mountain village of Suiten.I was mentally prepared for a brainf*** since Ghost Hound was created by the same guy who did Ghost in the Shell and a few important staff members also worked on Serial Experiments Lain. Nevertheless, despite...being heavily influenced by psychoanalysis in the first half and a mix of mainly spirituality and a bit of theoretical physics in the second half, the story is actually not too hard to follow if you pay full attention.It is a really fascinating story that completely drew me in right from the start with it´s somewhat dark and spooky appearance. The at first seemingly multiple plotlines come together to form one gigantic puzzle in a smart and sometimes unexpected way. Shinreigari also uses multiple ""unpleasant"" sound effects to add to the atmosphere and to get the viewer out of his cmfort zone even more.The biggest strenght of Ghost Hound in my opinion are the many important supporting characters. Each of them are portrayed in such a way that they could possibly turn into a pro- or antagonist at any given point as it is unclear what their own interests and intentions are. The character development is simply brillant, especially that of our main girl Miyako.The show also offers a few unusual but great ""extras"" as it calls the episodes not episodes but ""focuses"" and titles every focus  after a scientific term. The preview of the next focus after the ending credits is always accompanied by a brief summary of an important moment in the history of science and/or psychoanalysis. What´s more, once you start this series you have a hard time to stop your session as Ghost Hound offers hands down some of the best cliffhangers i have ever come across.The quality of animation is crystal clear for 2007 standards and shouldn´t really upset anyone who stumbles across the show eight years later like myself. The ending song is beautiful, the jazz-like opening is very different from most anime OPs but in my opinion does not fit the show at all.Overall i, enjoyed Shinregari GHOST HOUND at lot. I marathoned it in just three sessions and i would definetly recommend marathoning this rather then watching it at a slow pace. So if you are in the mood for something darker, make sure you don´t miss this!I give it a 9 out of 10. being heavily influenced by psychoanalysis in the first half and a mix of mainly spirituality and a bit of theoretical physics in the second half, the story is actually not too hard to follow if you pay full attention.It is a really fascinating story that completely drew me in right from the start with it´s somewhat dark and spooky appearance. The at first seemingly multiple plotlines come together to form one gigantic puzzle in a smart and sometimes unexpected way. Shinreigari also uses multiple ""unpleasant"" sound effects to add to the atmosphere and to get the viewer out of his cmfort zone even more.The biggest strenght of Ghost Hound in my opinion are the many important supporting characters. Each of them are portrayed in such a way that they could possibly turn into a pro- or antagonist at any given point as it is unclear what their own interests and intentions are. The character development is simply brillant, especially that of our main girl Miyako.The show also offers a few unusual but great ""extras"" as it calls the episodes not episodes but ""focuses"" and titles every focus  after a scientific term. The preview of the next focus after the ending credits is always accompanied by a brief summary of an important moment in the history of science and/or psychoanalysis.

So here are my detailed thoughts about Shinreigari, or Ghost Hound, without spoilers of course so if you are still contemplating if you should watch this or not, you can safely look at this review:STORY: Psychological meets Spiritual, in the best way possible. The story is great in itself but the pace just adds to the awesomness that is this anime, it is perfectly...paced. Slow paced, but perfectly slow paced so that it does not end up being boring. The story pulls its characters along and the characters in turn pull the story along, it\'s the perfect balance. The storytelling is reminiscent of that of shows like Shinsekai Yori, Monster, Death Parade, etc. So when you like those you are likely guaranteed to like this too. It\'s also quite educational too about human psychology and neurology and the themes of characters overcoming their traumas is a great message too. Anything I\'d say negatively would probably just be a nitpick like ""this scene was a bit confusing at first"" which is not exactly a good argument in a mystery anime ^^ If this isn\'t a 10/10 I don\'t know what is, if I knew it\'d be this good I wouldn\'t have waited to watch after I heard about it like a year ago. One small thing I do recommend is to make sure that whenever there is on-screen-text that you read all of it as those are most of the times important to the story, even if you have to pause the episode to do so.CHARACTERS: like I said the story pulls the characters along and the characters pull the story along. Their decisions are always what I deem the best course of action for the story to take even if the decisions aren\'t always the smartest. The main characters and their relationship among each other develope naturally over the course of the story and there is not a single bad or uninteresting character even among the side characters (well there\'s one that\'s pretty unlikeable but that one is still interesting). The characters also used a very interestingly unique accent that I first thought was Kansai dialect, but a little research has shown me that it\'s actually Fukoaka-dialect, but alas, it is still a treat to hear sth different from the usual anime talk. Also 10/10ART/ANIMATION: The art and animation isn\'t anything particularly special. Art and character design is good, animation flows mostly smoothly with few errors but the visual direction/directing(I don\'t know which is the right word xD) and scene composition is outstanding, really reminds me of Lain(which is from the same director so yeah), so I\'ll go with a 9/10 here.SOUND: So this is the part that is for me almost mindblowing. The soundtrack itself (including OP and ED) isn\'t anything too noticably amazing, it just always fits the scene it\'s in and there are a lot of scenes that also have none where it fits. BUT I have never seen a better sound design than in this anime. Muffled voices, radio static, always using the sound effects to intensify the already tense scene. In some of the earlier episode when one of the characters got a panic attack I almost thought it\'s like I\'m there and also about to experience one. In that regard it\'s like Shinsekai Yori cranked up to 11. If you haven\'t seen that one you should too, storytelling is really impressive in there. The only ones that might come close to this sound design I\'ve heard would be sth like Liz and the Blue Bird, or A silent Voice, and the sound director for those I believe is the same as for Ghost Hound. And like I said before, it\'s always a treat to hear a different kind of accent in anime, and this is one sexy accent, man. 100/10ENDING/CONCLUSION: This is one thing that can turn a viewer away from a show but I personally think that this show has overall a pretty satisfying conclusion drawing a few parallels between the main characters and some others that appeared along the story. Could it have been better? Yes maybe a little. could it have been worse? Oh it absolutely could have, one just needs to look at like 50% of the animes I\'ve watched in my list, or maybe more, and just anime in general nowadays. It does leave a few questions but those are also things that don\'t neccessarily need to be answered, think of it as sth akin to a certain open ended question in Monster. 9/10ENJOYMENT / EMOTIONAL IMPACT: Well, I think I made it pretty clear in this that I absolutely loved every second of this show. It\'s actually been a good while since I\'ve watched sth THIS GOOD where I was completely into it from the start to the end with no real downward spiral or up and down in my opinion. Hell I\'m already considering just checking out the dub and rewatching it that way just because I love it so much. It didn\'t exactly give me as much of an emotional high as some big battle-shounen moments but it was just a constant steady high the entire time. Just a 10/10 too.And so after Steins Gate, the Monogatari series, Gintama, Mawaru Penguindrum, Monster and Pandora Hearts, this is the 7th anime/manga related thing that I officially grant the title of ""a true Masterpiece"". You can look into my profile to figure out what that means but I guess the name should imply enough.Well keep in mind when you watch that this is an extremely biased personal opinion, what with having it finished basically just now, and try to watch it through your own rating system and not let my thoughts influence yours.Also I think I neglected to mention that the dialect used in this anime is REALLY AMAZING. paced.

I marathoned  Ghost Hound in a single Saturday because I couldn\'t stop.  I\'m totally blown away.  It manages to be fun and profound at the same time.It touched on so many things of the I base my own spiritual philosophy on:  The Apparent World, the Unseen World(s), that we are spiritual beings first and physical beings second, that everything is part of SPIRIT and has a level of consciousness, our ""mind"" is more than our brain, that the emotions we attach to events/things mold our lives and frequently need clearing, that intense negative emotions attract even more...negative energy from this world and from beyond, the quantum concept of the matrix that is SPIRIT, and more.  They even talked about energy clearing techniques like eye movement and tapping, energy meridians, and such.And on top of all that, it was a well crafted story with simple, yet effective character designs and lush landscapes.  Its rural setting was also a welcome change from the usual urban crush.The sound track is amazing.  If at all possible, watch this one with a good sound system.  Other than the awesome opening theme, I am not talking about a lot of music, but rather sound effects, tension building asian flutes and drums, static, breathing, heart beats, and low level frequencies you don\'t hear but feel.

Now, admittedly, this show has supernatural elements (about episode 4) and it is labelled as a psychological thriller. But that's the point I don't like. I want to warn people now, if you want to go in to this show spoiler-free, STOP READING NOW.It uses PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress...Disorder, for people who don't know) as it's psychological hook. And that's the point. Even shows like Paprika and Paranoia Agent use other 'supernatural' elements other than elements of mental illnesses while Ghost Hound tries to spook or at least make the viewer uncomfortable by showing dreams that are similar to visions or dreams of PTSD sufferers. I'm sorry but if I wanted to know about PTSD, I'd ask my friend who went through a tough point in her life, or I'd research it, I WOULDN'T watch a show. I'm making it sound like more of a big deal than it is, but it's just jarring expecting a thriller from supernatural elements yet the main hook is a real mental illness that many can imagine and that's probably the problem. Supernatural thrillers, um, thrill because they seem unimaginable. PTSD IS imaginable. Disorder, for people who don't know) as it's psychological hook. And that's the point.

You decide.Though my understanding of this anime, Shinreigari: Ghost Hound, It is about a boy, named Tarou Komori, who had been kidnapped, along with his older sister, at the age of three years old. He was the only one who made it out alive.Tarou and his friends decide to investigate on this matter eleven years later.As the story builds, you start to figure out that the kidnapping was not what you thought it was; it had a greater meaning to it. (Not going...to spoil it for you, sorry)Pros:- The opening song was awesome.- The story builds over time which is a good thing for an anime of the mystery genre.- You get a new perspective on the subject of ""Out of Body Experiences"" which is a good thing.Cons:- I didn\'t really understand what Masayuki\'s father and Reika Outori\'s relationship was. (Maybe I\'m just too young to understand or something?)- Whenever someone saw a spirit  and it goes away, it was as if they were hallucinating or something because sometimes other people don\'t see what they saw. (I don\'t know, it just seems weird to me.)Overall-It was an awesome anime and I really enjoyed it.I would recommend this anime to people who like mysteries or things that are supernatural. And also I would recommend this to people who don\'t mind the mentioning of different gods. to spoil it for you, sorry)Pros:- The opening song was awesome.- The story builds over time which is a good thing for an anime of the mystery genre.- You get a new perspective on the subject of ""Out of Body Experiences"" which is a good thing.Cons:- I didn\'t really understand what Masayuki\'s father and Reika Outori\'s relationship was.

Being into MindF$#k type animes like Lain and Higurashi the plot immediately intrigued me. The eerie opening with the song Poltergeist was one of the few selective openings I didn't skip over after a few episodes(it set the mood).  Now on the topic of the story, I really enjoyed the complex  plot. The art is dark and well-done which definitely adds to the creepy element(which hardly lets off until the latter episodes). The sound in this anime is definitely  it's strong point. It could be called brilliant in terms of building up...suspense(I constantly had shivers sent down my spine throughout). In addition to that,  the ending is pretty well done. The character development is also good especially with the three main characters.  Each episode kept me wanting more which is surprising due to the slower pacing of the story. I remember finding myself at episode six wondering how are they going to fill 22 episodes. That might be just because I lack imagination. But anyways, the only obvious letdown of the story to me would be the ending. Which I felt was abrupt and left me with a few unanswered questions. In that sense, Ghost Hound left me a little empty(But hey, it could of been worse).  All in all, nothing short of an enjoyable series(enough to write a review on it). suspense(I constantly had shivers sent down my spine throughout).

All in all, nothing short of an enjoyable series(enough to write a review on it)."", ""Wow, this was a great thriller title. Ghost Hound implemented use of psychological and philosophical elements to look into the developments surrounding the central characters of the series and piecing together the mysterious occurrences within the small town of Suiten. Like Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost Hound retains a subdued, mundane mood throughout its run during the show's normal mode and bumps up its suspense during moments when the boys experience out-of-body experiences in the spirit realm and dream of memories from their tragic pasts. The series does rather well at fleshing out the tragic pasts of Taro, Masayuki and Makoto where the series gets into...the heads of the boys as they perceive and/ or try to recall the events that occurred during their earlier years. In addition, we get to see the growth of their characters as they come to terms with their past tragedies as they come to understand their situations better.In terms of plot developments, Ghost Hound takes its time in unveiling pieces to the various paranormal occurrences taking place in the town. Strange creatures have been spotted at random points within the town and hints are dropped over a string of crimes having occurred around the time that Taro's abduction took place. In addition, the series does bring up seemingly unconnected situations which involve a fanatic local cult, a biotech plant and the young daughter of a shrine priest that Taro takes interest in. But as the series presses on, these situations clash together where their linearity makes enough sense at resolving any lingering plot developments to Ghost Hound once the character developments with the three boys get resolved.The major element to Ghost Hound that will make or break one's enjoyment of the series are the frequent mentions and debates of psychological and philosophical concepts. Psychological analysis is frequent as Dr. Hirata is around at a number of points to bring up mental disorders of the brain that effect patients that he helps, in particular Taro. The philosophical element comes in the form of a number of theories brought up on spiritual and existential concepts connected to the out of body experiences that the boys have in their travels to the spirit realm. I do believe that these elements are relevant within the series to keep the audience guessing over whether the experiences with the boys are the result of either a spiritual experience or something of scientific basis coming off the mental scars they had from their pasts.The only major flaw I found within the series was its final episode where the series seemingly introduced some new concepts that it never had time to fully develop and having a bright mood which isn't consistent with Ghost Hound's earlier episodes.In terms of presentation, Ghost Hound does well enough at delivering with visuals and music to fit in well with the blurring of moods that the show presents at various points. In terms of the normal world, the show makes use of bright colors and defined details in rendering its scenery and character designs to fit with its mundane mood. The out of body experiences and flashbacks from the boys are what lead to the title's visual highlights. Various abstract settings are shown to create a seemingly unique atmosphere for the spiritual realms that the boys visit such as the nerves that make up Taro's brain, a room full of various monitors and the real world rendered in limited color. Adding to this unique experience are occasional first-person shots from the eyes of the boys as they either go in and out of consciousness or experiencing flashbacks, such as Taro trying to catch up with his sister through an alley.The soundtrack to the series is mostly low-key and minimal, with music only added in whenever necessary to enhance mood within tense scenes. The OP and ED are unique choices to help one get into Ghost Hound with the OP's quirky and upbeat tone plus the ED's subdued and gentle ballad.Overall, Ghost Hound proved to be quite the interesting mind trip for me with its implementation of psychology and mysticism in exploring the tragic pasts of Taro and his friends plus the mysterious developments occurring within the town they live in. I strongly recommend this series to anyone hoping for an anime that is outside the norm of conventional titles and will keep you guessing over what direction it will lead. the heads of the boys as they perceive and/ or try to recall the events that occurred during their earlier years.

The story as i am now at is about that kid taro witch has been in a very dramatic and shocking event in the past witch his big sister died and he try's realy hard to find out who the kiddnaper is or was. he's having nightmarres and out of body expirens......thats the story so far to be really really short about it, for people who like a bit darkish story and a deep characteres who has much to tell, but if you see episode one and two you really want to pursue the story and thats why am actualy watching it, the dark story thing is not really for me but i really want to know what happens and what not. thats the story so far to be really really short about it, for people who like a bit darkish story and a deep characteres who has much to tell, but if you see episode one and two you really want to pursue the story and thats why am actualy watching it, the dark story thing is not really for me but i really want to know what happens and what not."", ""In short, this is one of the best anime series I have seen so far.  In one word it’s profound, and it’s a must-see, regardless of the genre you prefer. The only thing that made me falter in giving it a ten was the art which I did not enjoy at all. It’s too simplistic and disproportional. But it actually manages to compensate in a way I thought it impossible.The story starts off innocently. There's a boy named Taro who has had a very traumatic experience with which he tries to deal with. However, the feel of the story is ominous from the beginning....Even though it seems normal enough, you cant's help but wait in anticipation for something bad to happen.  Soon, strange things do start to happen, and slowly we are drawn into the Unseen world, full of both beautiful and disturbing things.The story has a beautiful flow, and it really develops perfectly. Nothing is rushed or muddled, and even though it deals with ghosts and the paranormal, it’s surprisingly plausible, mostly because it questions the established notions of science (neurology, psychology, physics) and it offers an alternative view on things that we think are perfectly explained by the science. This scientific trait of the story gives it an extra eerie twist, because it questions reality explained by reason and logic. What is reality and what is the dream world? In which do we reside?Every single character has a personality not made according to your standard anime-character-mould. And this personality develops with the story, which makes this series exceptionally enjoyable. You have to stick with them in order to see who they really are. Every character seems to be more then it meets the eye.  It’s just a feel of the character, not some mysterious past tragedy, or something conventional like that. The fact that the main cast is made out of high school boys makes this anime even spookier. They are all very troubled, the way you don’t want  a fifteen-year-old to be troubled. The adults don’t offer any consolation, and although most try to understand, they are simply at a lost as to what to do in these peculiar circumstances.I saved the best for the last. The sound in Ghost Hound is the most amazing, extraordinary thing I’ve so far encountered in any anime. It plays with your brain in a way you don’t even realize until you turn off the lights and go to sleep.  After watching the first four episodes, I was not scared, however I had one of the worst nightmares ever that night, and it was all sound. The sounds that prevail in this anime are something I call night sounds. When everyone and everything is asleep, you can hear the furniture moaning, you can hear the wind stroking the walls outside your room. There’s also a lot of noise in Ghost Hound which gives it a perfect feel, and some jazz which is maybe the best genre for this anime, with its unpredictability.And I have to stress that there is no horror tricks with sudden loud sounds combined with a scary scene. It’s all atmosphere, the combination of sound, story and characters that makes this anime amazing. Ghost Hound  is eerie, disturbing, it will make you uncomfortable, but it won’t use some cheap tricks to make you jump in your seat..

After watching the first four episodes, I was not scared, however I had one of the worst nightmares ever that night, and it was all sound. The sounds that prevail in this anime are something I call night sounds. When everyone and everything is asleep, you can hear the furniture moaning, you can hear the wind stroking the walls outside your room. There’s also a lot of noise in Ghost Hound which gives it a perfect feel, and some jazz which is maybe the best genre for this anime, with its unpredictability.And I have to stress that there is no horror tricks with sudden loud sounds combined with a scary scene. It’s all atmosphere, the combination of sound, story and characters that makes this anime amazing. Ghost Hound  is eerie, disturbing, it will make you uncomfortable, but it won’t use some cheap tricks to make you jump in your seat.."", ""Before watching any anime I start to look at its score on this page, when I saw a 7.41 I thought it would be an anime that was going to be good enough to recommend it. In the end I was disappointed, the most unfortunate thing is having to watch 22 episodes to realize that the most important plot has no outcome. Don't waste your time watching this unless you have nothing to see.I liked the animation, setting, intro and outro but the script failed. I ended up disappointed, I thought I had found a gem but it was the opposite. "", 'Disclaimer: Although I don’t think I include any spoilers that would ruin the experience, I do talk about the aspects of the show that usually confuse viewers the most, by describing several of it plot points in perhaps more details than a first time watcher would want. For a short opinion, it is not the easiest watch and it has a lot of issues particularly near the end, but it is a worth watching show as long as you are in the proper mood for it.Shinreigari: Ghost Hound is one of the most ambitious anime I have watched in my life, not for being...very hard to understand or follow, it certainly isn’t, but for covering and tying multiple plot points, topics, themes and several character arcs together. That’s also what makes it one of the hardest anime to review I have come across so far.The first two things to clarify about it is that although you will see the horror and psychological tags in it, and even though it appears on every recommended horror anime list or video, it is not a scary show. It has ghosts as the title implies, and sometimes they appear out of nowhere, as well as an intense atmosphere, but if you go into it expecting the level of craziness from Mononoke, the jumpscares and creepy visuals from the first season of Yami Shibai, or the dark visuals and creepiness that sometimes anime like Boogiepop Phantom and even Serial Experiments Lain have, you won’t find them here.And also, although it is not a complicated anime to follow in its structure, theme exploration, narrative or dialogues, it is still quite complex in scope, plotlines and presentation, this is not a series you just go into casually expecting to have a good time as soon as you begin watching it, you don’t just sit and watch this show, it requires you to pay attention to all of its different elements, topics and characters, with sometimes heavy exposition of different things and terms, while it also reveals certain details and character dynamics slowly and through its visuals instead of its dialogues, it shows instead of telling crucial plot points at times. This is why some have a hard time with it or don’t like it much in the end, while they also think that several plot points were left uncovered, forgotten or without answers. That’s why I think it might have been quite the challenging watch when it was airing weekly and why it’s better to watch it now that it’s fully complete and you can dedicate all your time to watch it from beginning to end, without watching much or anything else at the same time.That is also why it stands between a niche and cult classic status for an acquired taste, it is not deep nor complicated nor thought provoking enough for the hardest to please most critical elitists, nor entertaining nor digestible nor easy enough to watch for the more casual viewers, even more so with the current era of anime, way different from the one when this title came out.Which is a shame because, at least partially, thematically it is a series that would caught more attention nowadays because it deals with mental health, something that is very relevant right now, and what makes this show stands out the most. It is a very rare topic to cover within the medium, and that is also what makes it a bit of a valuable title. But presentation wise, if Ghost Hound were to air nowadays, it would go mostly unnoticed for its slow pace and mostly serious tone. Also, since it is a show aired from 2007 to 2008, I would imagine that part of the real life information and investigations it uses might be outdated in the way it is presented.Anyways, the show follows three main characters, the polite and rather shy and quiet protagonist Tarou Komori (it’s always this type of protagonists in this type of anime for some reason), the also quiet but hot tempered and rude Makoto Oogami, a distant relative of the former, as far as I understood, and the also rude but seemingly more relaxed, extrovert and more noisy Masayuki Nakajima. These three have initially a rather weird relationship, as the first two are distant and indifferent towards each other, but the third one ends up getting them closer by annoying them by questioning them about a certain tragic and mysterious incident from eleven years before the series begins, and almost forcing them to go with him to the place directly responsible of or linked to their biggest traumas. This, is what ended up making them friends, soon after one of them threatens to kill another.The three of them had experienced a direct link with death, either as a witness and almost victim of it, or as an indirect (or direct, depending on how you look at it) responsible for it, which is what left said big traumas on them and what would be the reason why they develop out of body experiences and later on gain super powers within the Spirit Realm, an element within the show. Despite this aspect being something close to beliefs and spiritualism, the series also incorporates real experiments, treatments, studies, terms and explanations from psychology, psychiatry and neurology both within the episodes and in the post ending song teasers of the following episodes, as appendixes, despite being a television show, to explain how those incidents had a direct impact on their mental health.Heck, as the show goes on and moves more from one element to the other, and incorporates more topics and scientific fields, those appendixes even incorporate physics and physical and chemical reactions, so the series ends up expanding to more scientific branches as well.Shinreigari doesn’t stop there, as it also showcases the family drama each of the three main characters have, from having lost members, whose deaths also left more relatives traumatized, to dysfunctional familial relationships, to divorces, affairs, to labor and economical struggles, what they want to do or not in the future, even with one of them rejecting being the successor head of an influential religious cult. And it’s not that these elements are shown just to flesh out the main cast, they are all related to the main mystery of the plot, and they also end up integrating more side characters, making those more relevant and interconnected than they initially seemed to be. Choosing a rather small town as the main setting was a real good move in terms of writing, otherwise all these connections and relations would come off as a bit too convenient.Anyways all these different connections, relationships, personal drama and tragic backstories is what definitely make the main trio of characters to be memorable and fleshed out, making up for their rather simple personalities and not very strong developments and catharsis. They open up, they face their biggest fears, they gain abilities, they find out more about their tragic pasts and all the deaths in them, they grow more confident and end up confronting more people, they achieve something at the end, it’s just that it doesn’t feel very impactful for them nor properly presented in series. I will come back to this later.Other relevant characters worth mentioning include Taro’s counselor and therapist Atsushi Hirata and neurologist and part-time doctor Reika Outori, who also works at Bio-Tech with Masayuki’s father. As plot devices, they function as mouth pieces for the heaviest information, but also have objectives on their own. He initially rejects all the supernatural events happening in the show as different kinds of mental stress, but as they begin to take over and be noticeable to everyone, ends up having his own spiritual occurrences and professional and personal views challenged. She wants to find out what they are really doing at Bio-Tech, but not much else can be said about her because everything about this woman is a spoiler.Then there is Takahito Komagusu, a lecturer at an university and head of a shrine, used to be close to Makoto’s parents and knows stuff about the Spirit Realm. He also has some interesting things to say about global warming, though his views would feel outdated watching the anime now. Honestly this dude doesn’t have much to add to the show besides information, so more important than him, is his daughter Miyako, a rather serious and mature girl who has the ability to see ghosts and practices exorcisms along with her father, and is also possessed by spirits from time to time. That’s what leads other people to be afraid of her or see her as the dead people that possess her, which is why a big part of her character is she reaffirming that she is her, not anyone else. At some point she is possessed by a certain God being mentioned in classic Japanese literature, from what I gathered, so that’s another field integrated in the plot through it.There are more side characters with their own problems and objectives, but otherwise don’t have much of a character arc to offer to the show, they are plot devices more than anything else. I could talk about what they do but that would make me spoil a lot of things.But how does everything and everyone comes together within the plot? It’s hard to explain without spoiling the whole show, I’ll try my best off my memory, I apologize beforehand for any details I might remember wrongly.Several characters are behind or partially responsible for the kidnapping eleven years before the beginning of the series and the deaths, traumas and more consequences it led to. This ends up allowing a certain religious cult with important political connections to grow in influence and power under the radar, and it also leads to a dam project being cancelled. In present time, Bio-Tech is in charge of a project/program to create artificial bodies of sorts with no actual lives, but because of a sabotage and the strong spirits present in this town and the spiritual energy of its different cultists and priestesses, they do end up being alive, and their spirits, being initially rejected by natural spirits, almost cause a natural disaster by the end of the show. The dude sabotaging the project to sell the information to competitors (I think), throws the bodies to the dam, which is what contaminates the fields, and that’s why Tarou’s family struggles to produce sake. A fake writer who works for the government is investigating everything.See? Everything comes together.As for the visuals, being produced by Production I.G, initially the series looks quite good, though that there are some quality drops here and there, and the backgrounds and special effects are really good. The character designs by Mariko Oka are reminiscent of Jigoku Shoujo but not to the point of feeling rehashed, plus there is a lot of variety in body types, faces, even heights, something which ends up playing part of the plot near its end. Unfortunately, being the kind of show it is, there isn’t much to talk about the motions, and as the show goes on, everything starts to feel a bit sloppier than in the beginning, quality drops are more obvious, characters go off model, some of the spirits look quite ridiculous and not serious for the type of show this is, stuff like that. A very good example are the spiritual forms of the main characters, which look and sound like babies made of bubbles with huge heads and visible baby butts, and their evolved forms aren’t much better either. At least the directing is pretty good, using first person perspectives during the out of body experiences, or aligning the movements and sound effects during certain scenes, like a clock clicking just as someone moves a finger, or as the eyes of a character keep opening and closing, stuff like that.Speaking of that, legendary anime sound director Youta Tsuruoka is the real star from the production team behind this show, even though it’s filled with big names within the industry. Shinreigari has easily one of the best and most immersive atmospheres in the medium, and it’s thanks to its great sound effects, uses of distortion, what I can only describe as spooky ghost noises, sudden silences, among many other things. Too bad this has less presence in the final episodes, as the anime loses a bit of its creepy ambiance for a more lighthearted one. The music is also quite good but not on the same level, as it is not used much because the sound effects are, thankfully, prioritized. The opening is a pretty cool jazz song and the ending is a melancholic and beautiful ballad, sung from the perspective of Miyako, if I understood the lyrics correctly. As for the voice acting, the characters talk with a certain accent, and since I’m not Japanese I can’t tell how good or bad it is, to my ears, the voices sound fitting and the performances atypical, mature and well done, except for the voice you hear the most, and thus most important. Oh poor boy Tarou, to be voiced by a very green Kensho Ono, not once did this man deliver a single line with a convincing emotion that any scene required, unfortunately he brought everyone else down.But even though Ghost Hound does a good job in connecting so many different plot points and characters, it still isn’t a remarkable series in terms of writing for several reasons.-The pacing is slow, and I don’t mean that in the general sense, used for when something it’s unexciting and unengaging. Several episodes are dedicated to explain certain details or terms, while the plot doesn’t move much.-The main trio gains super powers that allows to literally kill their problems, and as the show goes on, said abilities even start working or not however it conveniently suits the plot and/or characters at the moment. Plus, only one of them has a clear reason for why his powers are the way they are. With the other two, you’ll have to explain them yourself based on minor hints.-There’s a ghost inside Tarou’s head helping him at crucial moments, and it’s never clearly answered nor explained who that was, at best you can make your own headcanon based on vague assumptions.-Characters give away crucial information with extreme ease to either people that more likely don’t know the beginning of what they are talking about, or to clearly suspicious others.-Besides Tarou’s dad, who’s completely absent from the plot and themes, and perhaps Miyako’s dad, every other parent just plains sucks or is poorly handled. Makoto’s dad? Quite the ambiguous character. His mom? Impossible to feel empathy towards her, she did everything wrong and even went through and back from amnesia in just one episode (ROFL), at most I felt good for the kid, but her? Just no, terrible character. Miyako’s mom? The absolute worst. Tarou’s mom? Her problem was resolved out of screen. Masayuki’s mom? Barely even a plot device, I don’t even remember hearing her voice. His dad? He never pays for everything he does or is responsible for throughout the show, the way he goes back to his family and they act like a happy family with no issues at the end was one of the most stupid things in it.-There is a project/program to create life, and only two people are in charge of it? And they are not even properly monitored? One of them even betrays the lab at some point. Just, no.-Resolutions are simple and easy, especially in the last episode, which was so unfittingly silly, happy and cheesy, on top of rushed and convenient, that it felt like the series was planned to go for a little longer but had to finish sooner than expected for some reason, thus it ended up leaving a bad taste and impression.-Related to the previous point, the antagonists in this series are some of the worst ever and you don’t even see what happens with them in the final episode.-There is supposed to be a catharsis for everyone, but it doesn’t feel that way, the way the characters reach a conclusion for what they wanted answers for or achieve their objectives just…feels incomplete, they just kind of go: “You know what? Forget it, it’s not that big of a deal”.As a whole, Shinreigari: Ghost Hound is one of the most ambitious and interesting anime I have ever watched in my life, covering many different themes, topics, ideas, scientific fields and branches, beliefs, several plot points and character arcs together in a way that felt overall well done, with overall good visuals and some of the best sound designs and atmospheres ever in anime. Unfortunately it loses steam as it goes on, and the writing, resolutions and character arcs have a very bad conclusion, leaving some very poor final impressions and after taste, which is why it doesn’t have a very strong rewatch value for me. It was still a worthy watch, almost to the end. very hard to understand or follow, it certainly isn’t, but for covering and tying multiple plot points, topics, themes and several character arcs together.

I immediately thought to turn it off because I found it boring and somewhat pointless, but what drew me to watch more was the scare factor. The sounds on the show were horrifying and they knew just the right way to get the audience attention. The plot was so scattered that its quite hard to explain what the story was about.

I really wouldn't suggest this anime to anyone, unless there real bored and wanted something odd to watch, or to waste time."", 'I was surprised by this show. I went in with admittedly high expectations, and for the most part they were met. On the other hand, it was definitely too short: the last episode left a lot of loose ends and unresolved issues that could have been explored if the anime had been just two episodes longer.Story: 7/10The story was fairly solid all the way through. My biggest problem was that it really fell apart at the end. It wasn\'t a dramatic and show-breaking failure, but it\'s unfortunate that all of the events in the show culminated in a half-hearted conclusion that left too many questions...unanswered.Art and Sound: 8/10, 9/10I absolutely loved the sound effects in the show: it actually reminded me a lot of Boogiepop Phantom, with noises that would be disturbing and jarringly out of place. The art was also pretty good, though the ""baby"" projections were more of an eyesore than they were disturbing.Character: 9/10The characters were definitely the strongest aspect of the show. To be honest, it was probably the support characters I liked more than anyone else: I didn\'t find Taro to be especially deep, and though it was repeatedly hinted Masayuki had a much more complex personality than he revealed, there was very little development in that direction, which just made him feel cliched. Of the main characters, Makato was definitely my favorite in that he demonstrated the most growth, but I was really pleased to see Michio grow from being a support character to joining the main cast. Likewise, the sub-plot (if you can call it that) with Taro\'s psychiatrist was also very interesting, and his personality was virtually the exact opposite of what I\'d expected, which was refreshing. That said, toward the end, there were a few things that felt too rushed (namely the developments concerning Taro and Masayuki\'s mothers), and also a few unexplained relationships that were hinted at but should have been better explained.Overall: 8/10I really enjoyed the show up to the finale, but I went into the last episode feeling that it would be impossible to have a satisfying conclusion, and that unfortunately proved to be the case. In light of everything they could have done with the show, I\'m grateful that most of the choices were generally good, but I can\'t help but feel the plot got lost during the character development in the middle of the series, which ultimately made it impossible to finish well.*Slight update- in retrospect, judging a show based largely on it\'s final episode is rather unfair. It\'s quite entertaining up until then, and my score hopefully reflects that better* unanswered.Art and Sound: 8/10, 9/10I absolutely loved the sound effects in the show: it actually reminded me a lot of Boogiepop Phantom, with noises that would be disturbing and jarringly out of place.

I first started watching it years ago, but never committed to finishing it for reasons unknown. Starting from episode one, I once again found myself intrigued. Cringing at frightening scenes, and enjoying the overall story. I like to keep my reviews somewhat brief, but with this piece, it will be hard on the account of the many tides it takes you through.Let\'s start with the best aspects of the series. The animation was captivating. The style and color patterns were exceptional, but the animation was...at it\'s prime during the ""scarier"" scenes. These ""scarier"" scenes are worth watching alone. They were truly unique to Ghost Hound, and I haven\'t seen anything similar to them. While the art was great, the sound had to be  the best aspect of this piece. It was consistently accurate to the situation at hand, and flowed flawlessly with the story. Speaking of, the story was great in many ways. It seemed to cover most major genres in one way or another. The concept was again, unique to the series itself, and typical cliches took a rain-check as well. I\'ll button up the positives by noting the satisfying ending, all though adding a bit more wouldn\'t have hurt.Well, time to pick out some negatives. The biggest blemish I witnessed had to fall in the execution portion. Parts and pieces of the story seemed to fall out of relevance or get scrapped all together. More could have been done throughout the story to fill these gaps without trying too hard. Also, certain characters seemed to be convenient pawns, while offering little to the story itself. I\'ll draw the curtain on this segment by again touching on the ending. More could have been done. With the last scene especially.Overall, Ghost Hound was a powerful, easy to watch series. I never really got bored, and enjoyed every episode. For whatever reason it I highly recommend watching it in Autumn, just feels like the proper time. While it did touch on every genre, I\'d fit it most under mystery/thriller, so if you have a particular niche for those, definitely give it watch!I give Ghost Hound a mighty 10/10 shrine steps at it\'s prime during the ""scarier"" scenes.

In the Unseen realm they are able to see spirits of mostly dead people...and animals. After receiving these powers strange events begin to occur in the town they live and the boys begin to look into these. The story begins rather slow with its introduction episodes and setting up but near the middle it picks up the pace and begins answering questions set in the beginning. However, the ending was not as satisying as I expected and it seemed like some of these mysteries and problems and been left unsolved.Characters (10/10):The characters are the highlight in ""Ghost Hound"". IMO all the characters have enough screen-time to be classified as interesting and relatable. From Hirata the psychologist, to Yazaki the mayor, even that one guy who never talks. All these characters have at least enough time to be able to understand their intentions. Most of the characters have some traumatic event occur to them before or during the events of the anime and the way it changes their life and attitude is very well shown. Of course, the most well developed characters are the 3 mains but how the influence of their past is shown in them is just amazing.Art (8/10)Overall the artwork looked really clean and had some moments where it even enhanced the creepiness. The spirits in the Unseen Realm have a range of design from animals that actually exist to fantasy-like designs. Another art element that surprised me was the first-person view that was shown mostly inside the Unseen Realm. Although there are some anime that fail in this aspect ""Ghost Hound"" surprised even in its CGI.Sound (8/10)The OST of ""Ghost Hound"" was a very different one. The music was very soft but very creepy at times. The OST also added a touch of classical japanese music at times which fit in very well. It was greating at setting the atmosphere and I definetely recommend watching this anime with headphones on at all times. As for the OP I actually liked the song and the video. It didn\'t add to the creepiness of the anime but it did pump me up for another episode.Enjoyment (8/10)Overall, I think ""Ghost Hound"" is a psychological horror that brings back the psychological side into it. It was really fun watching the mysteries unfold and seeing how the characters came to terms with their pastsPros--Relies on ""creepiness"" rather than jump scares-Characters are well designed and developed-OST adds to the environment-Explores real psychological termsCons--Needs a more satisfying ending and animals.

I began watching it because it was reccomended to me as a creepy supernatural anime. At the beginning, it was just that, and combined with the art style, I actually got a bit scared a few times.However, it did lose itself around the middle, making it tiresome to watch. I was genuinly bored, and just wanted this goddamn anime to finish, but I could only fathom to watch one episode per time.Around the last three episodes, it got a lot better, and I loved the ending! I thought it was gonna be crappy, as I have seen many people describe it...as such, but it was kinda cute, and it gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.the op song is tHE BOMB. as such, but it was kinda cute, and it gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.the op song is tHE BOMB.', 'so, this is my first review, so I thought I should do it on one that I liked:Story:The story of Ghost Hound was very unique; it took the psychological element further than most, and very literally, as the story deals with the human psyche quite a bit. That being said, it isn\'t shy on exploring scientific theories and religious beliefs quite heavily, so for some, it might be good to keep a dictionary handy :) Personally, I enjoyed this element a great deal, and found it interesting to no end. That aside, the story moves along at a good pace for the most part; slow,...but fast enough to keep you interested. If it weren\'t for the ending, I would give the story a 10, but I though the climax/ending felt a little forced and maybe even inappropriate; however, it still retained pleasantness. Story gets a 9Art:The art in Ghost Hound was lovely. I really enjoyed all the landscapes, and the character designs were nicely done; also, the images of the ""Unseen World"" were both intriguing and slightly creepy. So, while the art was definitely excellent, it also wasn\'t really superb, so I think I\'d give it a 9Sound:The sound was AMAZING. The sound effects were absolutely astounding; whether it was weird, eerie effects meant to make the mood more creepy, or even the fact that the voices carried noticeably differently when in a closed room or on top of a mountain, it was extremely well done. The music is a lot of cool percussion work, and some marvelously simple yet deep background music and melodies. The music and sound effects definitely carry the mood well. The opening and ending themes also were well suited, and I liked both a lot. Sound gets a 10Characters:The characters were realistic, yet interesting, and were well developed and vivid. For the most part, they were very well done, and well suited for their rolls. However, though there were a few that caught my attention, I wasn\'t particularly entranced by any, so I\'d give them a 9 (though quite close to a 10)Enjoyment:I enjoyed Ghost Hound a great deal, and have rewatched it a few times. I loved being able to finish an episode, and then look up some of the terminology they used and explore the ideas they presented. However, this kind of enjoyment isn\'t for everyone (just a warning). Even so, for me, it\'s a 10Overall:I was really impressed by Ghost Hound, and it will forever be a favorite. I loved the way it utilized creepiness more so than pure horror, with fascinating and brilliant effect. Personally, for me, this anime earns a 10, but in all fairness, my final verdict is a 9, given the mean score of the above.I hope this review was helpful, and that you get a chance to enjoy Ghost Hound. but fast enough to keep you interested.

I would say, unnerving. This anime is a horror anime done differently from most. Instead of being a violent blood feast with plenty of red, or a showcase of grotesque figures and putrid abominations, this show instead relies on leaving the audience feeling uncomfortable. Ghost Hound's main selling point is the eerie atmosphere that fogs the entire show with paranoia and the feeling that nothing seems right. But does that make this anime any good? This is what we're going to be breaking down today, this is my review, and my first-ever review in MAL, of...the Fall 2007 psychological anime Ghost Hound.STORY:The story is untraditional in its structure compared to the standard anime. Instead of set points and goals of it's beginning, rising action, climax and ending, it instead paces itself in the day by day life of each of the three main characters Tarou, Makoto, and Masayuki once they've been exposed to the supernatural. Imagine a supernatural drama mix with slice of life. In fact, there's no clear cut conflict in the story during the first few episodes, with the closest being the mystery of the spiritual world and unusual events happening in the quaint province. This is reflected in how similar to these three, we know nothing about the world or the paranormal elements of the story due to the lack of information given. We are drip-fed information throughout it runs, slowly getting a grasp on what's going on this world and the different backgrounds of the trio and the people around them. This structure actually makes the story itself incredibly interesting, since not only do we get a better understanding of the intriguing story about spirits in the anime it also plays a role in the development of each of the characters. Once we get used to the unusual, we feel a sense of reward in understanding something we had no idea about before much like the main characters. The paranormal itself is pretty unique, tackling Japanese mythos of the afterlife while connecting it to modern life in the story's main conflict. The anime event tries to explain the supernatural phenomenons with real-life science, most psychology, and neuroticism.As the story goes on, the story becomes incredibly engrossing and we become curious about exploring this new world we entered as the world-building continues. Eventually, we do have a conflict involving the main cast personal issues and the weird happenings. Even when the conflict is placed forward, the show still somehow manages to leave a sense of uncertainty which comes from the perspective of our three main youths as like us they have no idea what's going on. We get small glimpses of the truth throughout the show, but that adds to the unnerving atmosphere of the anime since we only know enough to make theories but not actual facts. I would even say, our initial ideas are very likely to be wrong. Nothing is clear and that has fear on its own. The fear of paranoia because of not knowing and understanding what's happening. This is a really unique way to set horror.Sadly by the time the anime starts to slow down in the ending, the story does lose its atmosphere. The ending is serviceable and manages to make some call-backs to many things built up in the beginning, but nonetheless it feels somewhat out of place in the narrative it was running. It's too vanilla and not that unique. If only they manage to leave even a small sense of the atmosphere that was there throughout the show. There are also some plot points that aren't built up as well, only reappearing near the end or even being completely dropped.ART:When it comes to art, Ghost Hound isn't exactly a pretty anime. Sure the anime look decent but the art style is clearly dated. Thes background looks pretty standard, and the characters don't really stand out in appearance nor the art style. It looks like a decent 2007 anime... If we're only talking about the scenes that look every day. When it comes to scenes that are for drama, or about the realm of the afterlife, the anime pops in the visuals. The angles some of the scenes are shown to heighten the mood, looking distinctively uncomfortable. Whenever we see the afterlife merging with reality, the art becomes uncanny and weird which adds more to the disturbing factor. And when we finally have scenes that take place in the afterlife, the art is in it's best the scenes looking otherworldly and captivating. Nothing looks like anything in reality, with the number of spirits designs simple yet effective in conveying something that just doesn't look right. They even take advantage of the uncanny valley in some of the events in the real world, use disproportion to feel wrong. Everything is exactly done with the art since instead of trying to look pretty, it's trying to add more to the story and atmosphere that surrounds it which is important since it's a horror anime.SOUND:Now the soundtrack here is wonderful. Much like I talked about before, the direction of this anime is all about the feeling of discomfort. Nothing seems right and we feel that our mind is slowly losing ourselves from the reality-bending events in the show. Naturally, the sound follows that direction and it's wonderful. The anime's opening and the ending may not be unnerving to listen to, but it fits since the opening feels like music that feels like the merging of modern Japanese to the Japenese mythos of the afterlife while the adding feels sorrowful yet beauty in the ending song. However, the background music and sound direction are where it becomes outstanding. They always make everything feel weird, which works to the anime's narrative. But the best thing this anime has is the use of sound effects, which I rarely see in animes like Serial Experimental Lain. It knows when to be quiet, when to use certain sound effects like a car and drowns the anime in the atmosphere. It gives the anime some feeling of art and I really enjoy how they tried to be different in the music elements.CHARACTER:Now the trio of our main cast Tarou, Masayuki, and Makoto. I really enjoyed these three. All of them felt like genuine kids dealing with certain issues. They act nervous, confuse, happy and yet immature enough to know they are still young like how Masayuki freaks out about having his hair cut or Tarou being uncertain about his romantic feelings with Miyako. It's also engaging that much like us, they are very curious about the spiritual aspect of the world when they learn about it and want to explore it more. A lot of their actions feel like things we would do if we were in their situation. That said, I do feel Tarou feels a little less developed than the other two, mostly due to not having as great pacing in his screentime. Other characters also standout like the kind-hearted yet flawed priest Takahito and his snarky yet polite daughter Miyako who I could argue are also main characters due to their heavy roles in the plot. As for the rest, they are good as well, with all of them feeling like real people instead of typical stereotypes and serving a role in the story which helps make it better, even with the smallest roles. Sure, there are definitely a few who feel undercook, but for the most part, this anime has an incredible cast due to feeling like actual people and serving to expand the plot.ENJOYMENT:Now the enjoyment of this anime will depend on what you are looking for. If you're trying to find horror involving blood and gore, this anime will not serve you at all. If you're looking for a horror that's memorable and genuinely makes you feel like your grounded into the reality of the anime, this is most certainly for you. I cannot tell you enough how much the atmosphere drips in this anime, that it does play with your emotions, that it genuinely pulls you in a world that while not comforting leaves an impact that you feel like one of the characters. You feel paranoid, trapped, confuse as your imagination comes up with ideas that will scare you more than any gory image. Fear is truly stronger when it's in the mind and not on the eyes and this anime is perfectly crafted to convey that. It's not subtle, but it knows how to manipulate the human brain to feel like something is wrong, which is true but not in the way you know it. If you want to try something that feels like horror art, something so thought-provoking yet thrilling, this is for you. That rush I have in this anime is why I can greatly enjoy it. That said, not all moments are like that when dealing with the non-spiritual aspects but those are very minor compared to the greater whole.OVERALL:If you really want a horror anime that gives you a new sense of thrill, this is for you. I can tell you now that this is most definitely going to be one of my favorite horror animes. It's so unique that I doubt you can find similar experiences at all, if ever very rarely. Ghost Hound is an anime that wants you to enter a new type of horror and is confident in doing so. Sure, this anime might be better labeled as a psychological anime, but I would say it's more appropriate to call it psychological horror. I hope this review convinces you to delve into this hidden gem among the ocean of anime. the Fall 2007 psychological anime Ghost Hound.STORY:The story is untraditional in its structure compared to the standard anime.

It's not subtle, but it knows how to manipulate the human brain to feel like something is wrong, which is true but not in the way you know it. If you want to try something that feels like horror art, something so thought-provoking yet thrilling, this is for you. That rush I have in this anime is why I can greatly enjoy it. That said, not all moments are like that when dealing with the non-spiritual aspects but those are very minor compared to the greater whole.OVERALL:If you really want a horror anime that gives you a new sense of thrill, this is for you. I can tell you now that this is most definitely going to be one of my favorite horror animes. It's so unique that I doubt you can find similar experiences at all, if ever very rarely. Ghost Hound is an anime that wants you to enter a new type of horror and is confident in doing so. Sure, this anime might be better labeled as a psychological anime, but I would say it's more appropriate to call it psychological horror.

It has a very original and interesting plot. The art looks very good in my opinion (for being a 2007 anime). You will find some beautiful and surrounding places. But against that all, I think they ruined this anime (or at least the ending of it) with the last episodes, it starts decaying from episode 14. From there, it turns boring and the main story is left aside, introducing ""out of plot"" unnecessary scenes and characters. Also the final episode...makes no sense, it seems very forced. Most of the things thast happened throughout the series keep unresolved and unexplained. This anime had a lot of potential, but they wasted it.Despite of that all, I would recommend this anime, as it is very interesting and curious, also the atmosphere is very ""terrorific"" sometimes (in a good way) which makes it look cooler, along with the ""astral travel"" thing, which also in real life is a very nice experience. I felt very identified with ths anime, as I also have experienced very similar things as the characters.In conclusion, just do not expect a good series finale, just enjoy the episodes for what they are, if you are interested in astral travel, psychological and scientific themes you will like it.Regards. makes no sense, it seems very forced.

He is keen on finding out the truth concerning what led to his sister’s death and her last whispered words. However, Makoto is busy with his efforts to solve the problem around the murder of his father, which might be linked as well to the kidnapping of Taro. Masayuki, the new pupil at the school, is the one who gives all the other students something to think about and ultimately brings them together while struggling with his own fears.Nevertheless, the plot...becomes intricate as the series advances initially incorporating supernatural then scientific elements. Although it is interesting, it is difficult to follow sometimes and it leaves out some plot lines unexplained.In terms of the characters, apart from Masayuki, no one of them is not really impressive or memorable. Taro does have a fateful past but he is also compassionate, while Makoto has something of a rebellious teenager, who does develop more later in the series. Miyako is a miko with psychic abilities, although her personality is not yet developed.The sound and animation are okay, but the occasional issues can be found. The opening and ending tracks are good in terms of making the feeling but the background music can be unpleasantly loud. The animation is good. Especially, the use of color is excellent in differentiating the ordinary and the supernatural. However, many scenes are bad that need to be improved.Overall, Ghost Hound is a show worth watching if you like slow-paced mystery stories with supernatural elements. Nonetheless, it has some drawbacks which are the too-convoluted plot and the not-well-developed characters. If you’re after a show with more content, you may not want to pick this one. becomes intricate as the series advances initially incorporating supernatural then scientific elements.

I feel this alone should give some idea of the quality of this tale.  But while there are some similarities, this is a more refined and easier to follow tale than Lain (though still densely packed with ideas and open to much interpretation.)The tale itself is a slow burn, supernatural story that has done its research.  If you are...interested in fringe science and the paranormal, this is a mature and serious take on a lot of issues that could otherwise have been given the ""woo"" treatment.  Let me put it this way - by episode 3 the anime is discussing flaws in hypnotic regression.  By episode 5 they\'re making references to John Keel.  Ultimately you\'re getting a tale that incorporates everything from Shinto animism to Gaia theory to missing time experiences to Michael Persinger and.. well, the list goes on and on.  And there\'s a dose of hard sci-fi and a secret lab thrown in for good measure, giving it a sort of ""thinking man\'s Stranger Things"" aspect.  But it\'s not just a checklist of high-strangeness topics, it\'s actually a pretty tight tale, centered around three likeable and realistic protagonists.  There are no ""oh my god why would you do that"" moments in this anime like in so much of the horror/supernatural genre.I should add this is technically considered ""horror"" but there isn\'t any gore here like a lot of other anime horror tries to shock you with.  There are spooky scenes, but this is more in the way of ""supernatural mystery"" than horror.A special shout out to the sound composition.  The sound in this anime is minimalist and *perfectly* accentuates the tone, perhaps better than I\'ve seen in any other anime.Sorry for this somewhat rushed review.

But I wanna try to understand them anyway.It's nice how the characters develop themselves, and how they grown on you. I started the anime don't liking anyone in particular, but ended up rooting for all of them.Overall, I liked it.

But it really is a great anime, and I didn't feel wasting my time with it."", ""I am not going to lie....22 episodes in and I really still can't fully tell you what this anime was about and there were questions I wanted to have answered that weren't but in the end this is probably another favorite of mine.I've not seen a lot of Psychological horror. This is not an anime with superpowers, Ninjas, Virtual Reality or anything flashy. This is an anime that gets in your head, confuses you, freaks you out a bit and captivates you from the get go and I absolutely love the mind fuck of it all.\u200bA. Plot(8 out of 10)...It's really hard to say what the plot is because there is so much going on in these 22 episodes however I believe the overall plot is about these 3 teen boys who each have experienced or witness a traumatic event in their lives and it has forever changed them. The town they live in holds a dark and devastating secret and as the anime goes on, the viewer as well as other characters begin to uncover the sick truth about the town and the sinister stuff going on.As our three main characters try to focus on their past traumas and overcoming them, they are thrown into a present situation that could very destroy them if they don't stop it.B. Characters(9 out of 10):Rarely ever do I find an anime where I can't stand any of the characters and I genuinely like all of them.. Our three mains are Taro who faced a traumatic experience at the age of 3 but it is the aftermath 11 years later that leaves him troubled, Makoto who holds so much rage in him due to an event linked to Taro that forced him to witness something he never wanted and leaving him with questions unanswered and Masayuki who is hiding a devastating secret behind his jokes and smiles.All 3 of the main characters are compelling and they have some amazing growth throughout the 22 episodes. Taro of course is your typical goody two shoes but he isn't completely predictable and Makoto is the brooding, angry, emoish type of guy who I usually love because they are the most interesting. However, Masayuki is my favorite from the get go because he is the most diverse and multi-layered of the 3 characters and there is still a lot of mystery to him.Michio and Miyako(This anime loves people with M names apparently) are also apart of the main group and they were decent. If there was a weaker aspect of the characters, it probably goes to the secondary characters. There are so many secondary characters and the plot tries to focus on our mains to the point where the secondary characters, while interesting, felt less like characters and more like devices to aid our main characters.C. Animation, Sound and Music(10 out of 10)The animation for this anime was beautiful. Not overdone but not oversimple. From the human character designs to the souls and even astral projections. I was quite impressed.Music in this anime was always very fitting. Sometimes in anime, the music can kind of distract you or even outright clash(Happy sounding music in an otherwise sad scene or extremely melodramatic music). The Opening and Ending songs are pretty enticing as well.What of course shocked me is the sounds....it is kind of creepy. At the start of each episode and the mid-way point, there is this staticy/robotic voice with a ghastly tone that place that sort of adds more to the eerie vibe of the anime. It annoyed me at first but I did greatly enjoy it as the anime went on.D. The Ending(6 out of 10)If there is one major flaw to this anime it is last few episodes, especially the final episode. It wasn't awful but it felt rushed and it left so many questions unanswered. Not questions that you can sort of leave up for interpretation....but actual question where you want to know the answer because we spent so much time talking about it and it still isn't answered.It felt rushed and the rushness sort of clashes with the animes first 19 episodes where they gradually took their time vs the last 3 episodes sort of just decided to go crazy and fast.It wasn't a bad ending but I did expect more and I felt ii weakened the anime a bit.E. Overall:\u200bI loved the anime. Aside from a weak ending and weak secondary characters, the story is compelling because there are so many things happening....you want to be apart of the mystery. You want to know what is happening next and you are rooting for these boys to face their demons and to grow.This is definitely an anime I can recommend everyone to watch because it is so good and I loved it.

"", '""Ghost Hound"" or ""Shinreigari"" follows three middle schoolers Tarou Komori, Makoto Ogami, and Masayuki Nakajima who are experiencing OBE (Out 0f Body Experience), or as they like to call it ""Soul Travelling"" which allows them to explore the \'Unseen World\'. Each member utilizes this strange phenomenon to get over their anxieties and terrible pasts while also learning all the hidden secrets of the village of Suiten.""Shinreigari"" tackles a variety of topics, including mythology, occult practices, quantum theory, psychology, and even life after death. Considering that the series was created by Masamune Shirow, the same person who created the ""Ghost in the Shell"" franchise, this shouldn\'t...come as a surprise, but that doesn\'t imply it will be a chore to watch. ""Shinreigari"" is part mystery/thriller, revealing the dark secrets of the town & its mysterious characters, part horror, the dread of something unknowable lurking around outside or sometimes even inside our characters, and part sci-fi/psychological, exploring the mental state of its many characters with a lot of (faux) science.The anime uses a variety of contrasts to illustrate its ideas, such as the above-mentioned nuanced distinction between souls and people. See how the formless bodies of the soul (above pic) contrast with the distorted depiction of man\'s senses by ""Penfield"" (below pic). There are more of these that I\'m sure I occasionally missed, but one of these contrasts that I loved was the opening song with the remaining OST. The soundtrack is odd and plodding, gradually evoking a sense of mystery and suspense in opposition to the jazzy intro song. The tone has changed, yet the mystery is still present.The Art style and Sound direction in ""Shinreigari"" are two obvious standouts. The character designs, particularly the ghosts, are distinctive enough to set the art style apart while still seeming conventional enough to be called your typical anime from the 2000s. Their designs are more unsettling, from the black distorted giants, the insect-like beings in the unseen world, to the ""snark,"" For the Snark was a Boojum, You See.And the sound is strange, as I have mentioned. It is frequently detailed and includes recognizable sounds like pendulums, breathing noises, and heartbeats. The sound starts off slowly and quietly (nearly undetectable), but as it gets louder, even the conversations get occasionally interrupted. Every episode starts off with significantly distorted dialogue from earlier episodes, mostly for ambiance.Shinreigari is a thematically rich show with a lot of scientific and occultic babble backed by a foggy atmosphere but it is narratively flawed, the show doesn\'t weave them into a tight-knitted story. The characters will converse about things like ""how a ghost possessed my girl"" and other things you wouldn\'t expect to hear two men discussing in broad daylight. Even more perplexing to me is how readily they accept one another\'s word, while talking about matters that could put them in danger. Additionally, the last episodes don\'t make sense with everything that came before. The ""Overcoming traumas"" narrative never had a satisfying conclusion. The conflicts in earlier episodes of ""What occurred in the past?"" were heavily built up, yet they were never resolved. The character\'s abrupt personality change offers a hazy resolution, or the episode simply leaves it hanging. It is a little sudden when the show finishes on a coming-of-age note because there were no signs that the theme of the initial episodes was ""Letting go of the past and/or Accepting the present and yourself.""I would usually end this section by answering ""Who should watch this?"" but there\'s something else I want to talk about.(You can skip this section and go directly to the end; this adds little to the review).Have you ever woken up one midnight all of a sudden?

I have rewatched it several times over the years and I can say that it's quite enjoyable.Story: The story starts with Komamori Taro, a boy who, at the age of 3, was kidnapped together with his sister. They were left alone strapped to some beds in an old abandoned hospital for days before they were found, at which point Taro's sister Mizuka was already dead. Through the series we see Taro trying to deal with the trauma from that period, even as the series go more into the supernatural. I think the story is...very good, though there are some problems with the pacing (but not much) and the story can be hard to follow at times. Also, I think that they could have taken a bit more time on the ending, maybe extended it by an episode.Art & Sound: The art style is great, vividly switching between grey tones, contrasts and strong colors to amplify the mood of the show. The same goes for most part for the sound as well, as the sound have been tuned so you'll feel there's something supernatural and/or creepy about the sounds and voices in the Hidden Realm.Characters: The characters are well made with their own back stories, personalities and problems to deal with.Overall: It's a good show that could have been slightly better, given longer time. It should be a good watch for most people who enjoy mystery, supernatural stuff, some drama and a bit of comedy.Enjoy very good, though there are some problems with the pacing (but not much) and the story can be hard to follow at times.

It's very atmospheric and is enjoyed best by yourself, home alone, all lights off. Its art, music, dialogue, and plot work hard to create a thrilling, creepy, visceral experience that dabbles equally in the paranormal and in science.The audio/visual experience on its own makes the show well worth watching. I could feel the anxiety, the panic, that the main characters felt as they confronted their trauma and...the dark mystery of the town. I will admit that some of the depictions of spirits are on the goofy side, but overall the art in this series (including the music/audio) is very well done in terms of portraying a mood to the viewer.I also enjoyed the overall story arch and character development. You watch the main characters grow as they work to confront their pasts and the dark mysteries pervading Suiten, the town they live in. Adding in psychological explanations for the 'soul travelling' and other experiences, in addition to the religious/spiritual explanations, is an interesting twist on what might otherwise be a typical paranormal thriller. It might leave you wondering who's right -- psychology or spirituality?The story dabbles in some big themes, largely perception of one's self and surroundings, and connections between spirituality and psychology. While I felt the ending left me wanting (just a little), the show did successfully get me to consider some deeper questions without obviously pushing those questions onto me. I highly, highly recommend to anyone who tends to enjoy more mature, thoughtfully created stories. the dark mystery of the town.

A studio with some good experience handling psychological shows like this such as Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, but then some questionable supernatural shows like Blood+. Then this was created by Masamune Shirow, the creator behind Ghost in the Shell. Plus, this was directed by Ryuutarou Nakamura, the director behind Serial Experiments Lain. At the very least, Ghost Hound should have zero issue delivering upon the psychological part of the anime, but what about the supernatural?The show takes place in a small town called Suiten focusing around...three boys who somehow gain the power of astral projection and connect with the “unseen world” or otherwise a parallel world inhabited by ghosts. Due to traumatic experiences the characters have, this allows such an ability. The story follow their cross between the two worlds, and end up involved and unravel a strange mystery connected to a small girl whom has the ability to channel spirits.Story and plot are uniquely mixed together quite well between the psychology and mystery of the show. This comes as no surprise based on the show’s creator. It really blends together with a writing of the show, but fails at being exciting from the overall execution. This is mostly due to the insane amount of detail and pace of the show by it telling literally everything and each and every detail it can think of. One example of this is an entire episode dedicated to explaining how complicated the human brain is. It does have a point to the show, and the information may be interesting to some. However, this is just one example of an instance for a show with constant information dumps filled with puzzles and the plot’s loss of focus because of it.Ghost Hound does have superb atmosphere and filled with dark and dreary colours. This keeps a somewhat gritty edge and an intriguing mystery also blends well into this fact. The plot vastly benefits from the creepy atmosphere as well as the story only revealing small bits and pieces of the mystery at a time leading to the viewer using their imagination to fill holes. This is a gripping experience. The ultimate downfall is not the main characters themselves or even the ultra-strange ghost-baby-blob forms their astral projections take on, but it is the movement of what is important to the plot. As mentioned before, the plots loss of focus.Information exposition dump aside, and whether this is interesting or not vastly depends on the viewer’s taste in that regard to hurt or benefit the show. It does take away from good pacing, plot focus, and causes the loose ends to be concluded haphazardly. At the beginning there is a kidnapping which is solved but brushed aside, which is a major plot point to the entire first half of the show. This is followed by some biology experiments, which almost seemingly questions the previous plot point, and then leads to yet another strange plot. The concepts involved such as “playing God” and psychotic behaviors are done fairly well. However, Ghost Hound tries way too hard to expand the story and the plot devices addressed fail, such as with the ending. Does the average viewer even want to make it that far, feel irritated by the experience, or is it satisfactory is a tough question to answer for this show?Ghost Hound is flawed in many ways, but does contain the mystery, contents, and concepts for a possibly intriguing watch. By far, this show would have vastly benefited more for the masses at half the length and cutting out the insane science and psychologically detailed dialogue.

If you're wanting cheap scares and gore, I suggest you watch another anime, but that doesn't stop it from being scary. (It scared me enough to not want to leave my bedroom...) It's a compelling story that really makes you think about the way you take in the world around you. Personally for me, I just couldn't stop watching it. I couldn't wait to see...what happened next. Plus, the anime teaches you some interesting neurological terminology-- just throwing that out there.Art: [9/10]A simple, yet beautiful art style. Very enjoyable to look at throughout. The spirits of the Hidden Realm were very interesting, and very eerie. Oh, and even though their original O.B.E forms were silly looking, I couldn't help but giggle at those little bums.Sound: [10/10]Now, the sound is what really gave the anime it's haunting, eerie atmosphere. It has old, traditional sounding Japanese music, and the sound effects were sometimes just downright creepy. It sent shivers down my spine. Oh, and in my opinion, I loved the Opening song. It just sounded good.Characters: [9/10]All of the main boy characters had their own compelling, tragic pasts that really kept you interested the whole time. They were all very colourful characters with great personalities. No one was boring, no one was annoying.Overall: [9/10]Ghost Hound has an amazingly creepy, haunting atmosphere, an interesting storyline, and colourful characters. It really grabs your attention, and keeps it throughout the anime. And after you're finished, you'll be left wondering about the world around you. Sometimes, it could be a little slow, but nonetheless it was a very enjoyable anime, and it will definitely be one of my favourite animes of all time. what happened next.

This anime gives a different view of the paranormal and a new way to explain how or why it happens.  At first it seemed like it would be a horror type anime but as it progressed and you learn more about the plot it is less horror and more explaining the world it is set in.  I liked this because it kept me guessing and wanting to learn more about the other world.  I think it was ended a little too soon and...had a vague conclusion.  It was almost like the writer just ran out of ideas and ended for the sake of dragging it out.  In all I did enjoy the music, story, and art. had a vague conclusion.

I love mystery and Horror anime a lot and this gave me the chilly vibe.The addition of how crimes often occured in...different areas in japan was also a nice touch especially to kidnappings and abuse due to people's mental states were also addressed. The forest reminded me of the suicide forest for some reason. Also how the past can really haunt you due to regrets and again FEAR. Human's have always been afraid and we are never perfect.

It does not rely on jump scare like your typical horror stories. Instead, with its creepy surrounding and background music, there are several scenes that manage to caught me off guard.My only complaint is that there are too many plot holes. Too many things are left unexplained. I don\'t know, maybe I\'m just stupid too catch the plot hahaha.In conclusion, this anime is not for everyone. It\'s not your typical anime.

Our protagonist Tarō is 14 and his family owns a sake business which used to be quite wealthy. Eleven years ago he and his elder sister were kidnapped for ransom during which she died, leaving Tarō traumatised and his parents profoundly changed.Now as a teenager Tarō  records his dreams and tries to practice lucid dreaming to cope with his flashbacks- one morning when he dreams he is flying over the city a young girl in the waking...world looks up and sees him.The hook is good, and the family and trauma dynamic is interesting enough to engage me. At school we explicitly see Tarō go to therapy and his therapist introduces him to EMDR a real (albeit not widely accredited) therapy for PTSD. They discuss Tarō’s symptoms and the stigma of being mentally IllWhen the secondary characters were introduced my interest started to drop. Makoto is a delinquent who everyone’s scared off, his grandmother runs a new religion(cult) and his father killed himself mysteriously after being implicated in Tarō and his sister’s abduction. I don’t mind Makoto his character is trophy but fine. If it’d had just been him Tarō and Miyako I wouldn’t mind they had to add Masayuki.Masayuki is rich and jokey. Masayuki treats Tarō’s trauma with the same respect as a mukbang true crime YouTuber. Masayuki bullied someone to suicide and we’re supposed to feel bad for him. I don’t care about Masayuki I think the anime would be better without him.All this said I was enjoying the anime when it was a ghost story about trauma and not letting go of the past the second it went fully shounen magic ghost powers with those ugly code lyoko baby spirit forms I gave up.

If you don\'t like how the first episode went, you won\'t like the rest either. It\'s rare that I write a review. I gave this show 1/10 simply because I didn\'t like anything about it. It wasn\'t out of spite, and I don\'t hate it either. The characters don\'t look interesting, they come off as ""annoying as hell"" ""pathetic"" and ""boring"" respectively.

None of them has any motivation or goal to work towards.The episodes have...about 2 minutes of plot, no eerie atmosphere will save it.

I really enjoyed Exodus, to the point it became one of my favorites, but I feel like Beyond took two steps back. Now, to be clear, I still liked it. It still has the characters, world, lore, ost, and mechs I really enjoy, but it was lacking for me compared to Exodus.Firstly, Beyond was rushed. Which is alarming considering it took 6 years since Exodus ended to finish part 4. We're thrown into the current situation without much explanation. Which is fine, but there was just a lot that was really never...developed on and comes out of left field. Why is everyone okay with sacrificing Miwa? Who is Maris? Why do we care about him? Is there a better reason why Miwa, the massive pacifist, is in one of the strongest fafner they have other than she's safest in it? Soushi 2.0 hates Kazuki the entire time, why did we not get more time for that relationship to brew? Why did Soushi 2.0 change his tune so quickly and ally with Tatsumiyajima? The list goes on, but the series really would've benefited from 24 episodes.I also wasn't a huge fan of how they handled Kazuki in this one. I understand they want to pass the torch, but he was practically a background character. He had probably the only scene that was hype in Beyond when he awoke his salvator model, but after that he did absolutely nothing. I really think they should've made Mk. Raison the end-game opponent for Kazuki and leave Altair/Malespero for Miwa/Soushi. It would've been a rematch of their fight in Exodus, and the fact Mk. Raison was just swatting Kazuki around was so disappointing.The villain trio was really underwhelming for me as well. All they tended to do was job and leave, and they were the focus of the whole thing. I genuinely think if they didn't arbitrarily give Miwa Mk. Sein, Kazuki would've solved a lot of their issues in part 1 by easily dispatching all three. Good luck copying Mk. Sein, Legato. I went into this season expecting Altair to be the enemy, and to have more Kaiju fights with Festum worse than Azazel type, but we just got two mediocre fafner pilots and Crawler? AND WHY IN GODS NAME DID THEY LET MARIS LEAVE NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE? I understand the commander doesn't want to do something to him, but did Maya not shoot at Soushi twice and threaten to kill him for attacking them with Nicht? Maya who confidently told the NUN chairwoman she'd kill Soushi if they think he'll turn? Maris, the guy who killed plenty, who killed your mother, is right there on your island. Maya, hello?And finally, while I liked Miwa as a character, she was insufferable in Mk. Sein. She didn't do anything. Why put a pacifist in your strongest unit when you're fighting a war? Is she even a better pilot than Kazuki? Can she draw out all of Mk. Sein's power or something? It's never really explained or even shown why she's a good fit for Mk. Sein. Very frustrating.Now, I did really enjoy Mimika and Reo's growth and their relationship as mentors for Soushi. In fact, I liked all of the third generation. They were probably my favorite part. I really enjoyed Maya and Miwa SoL parts too. Also, they did not need to do that to me with Chocolat at the end.I still give this a 6/10 because it still has everything I like about the series, but I feel it needed another cour. developed on and comes out of left field.

Is she even a better pilot than Kazuki? Can she draw out all of Mk. Sein's power or something? It's never really explained or even shown why she's a good fit for Mk. Sein. Very frustrating.Now, I did really enjoy Mimika and Reo's growth and their relationship as mentors for Soushi. In fact, I liked all of the third generation. They were probably my favorite part. I really enjoyed Maya and Miwa SoL parts too. Also, they did not need to do that to me with Chocolat at the end.I still give this a 6/10 because it still has everything I like about the series, but I feel it needed another cour."", ""I don't mind having The Beyond be the game changer. Instead I would be proud if Fafner's sacrificing cycles could finally be wiped out, with condition implied that they, the staffs and production team have to put a great care for the aftermath. And unfortunately all I got from this final patch was the half-assed way of dealing with the old cast, especially Kazuki here. The Beyond carried a lot of potential therfore a longer duration is required. But they messed it up themselves by chosing the 12 episodes format to deliver the most crucial ideas, which could also cause some divided opinions among long...time fans. I do not view this as a bold step up, I rather believe its production team tried to play it out safely but failed horribly since. What is the meaning of Kazuki's character anyways. And also do not just dump all the unfit things in other materials and expect to get understanding from fans. We need animating for a reason. time fans.

I've seen characters growth from first season, to second season and was very enjoyable, but now I feel back to the start with a new inmature character.I have really fond memories of first season, but this last one didn't seem felt like a right closure, if anything I feel more empty than not.I felt very melancholic on the last escenes with toomi seeing off kazuki, after all the years it was right on spot, they journey had ended and they went backt to the island I got so many memories from first season right at that point, I was very sad to see kazuki/toomi relationship not going anywhere beyond.

Shugo Chara!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2923/Shugo_Chara,"['The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children\'s programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever.I found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that we...haven’t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you’ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you’re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone’s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo.The story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season.However, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term ""filler"" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline.The cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn’t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own ""true self"" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most ""real"" anime character I’ve ever seen.There are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu\'s guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu\'s rescue when she needs it but isn’t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You’re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu.The artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show.My enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you’re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.

A nice message and some good romance. It's not just about blasting away the enemy, it's about a young girls confusion over her...&quot;true self,&quot; something that a lot of people can probably identify with. Amu also finds herself confused very often over what she's feeling over certain guys in her life. After all, good shoujo needs a nice love triangle, doesn't it?All of the characters in Shugo Chara! are also incredibly entertaining. The Guardians, Easter's two pawns Ikuto and Utau, and certainly Amu herself. Even the fillers are mildly fun to watch...if you're not looking for substance, but just fun.Overall, Shugo Chara! is a good anime to watch. It's been compared to great anime like CardCaptor Sakura, and while I wouldn't go that far, it is definitely the best Mahou Shoujo anime in a while and it does have the appeal to span multiple ages (I've encountered fans from ages 10-30). So, if you're a fan of mahou shoujo, or just shoujo in general, you really can't miss Shugo Chara!

For one thing it revolves around an elementary student, and for another it was labled under romance. (I watch a ton of High School Drama's so I'm always on the lookout for a good romance anime)I clicked on episode one and figured &quot;Eh, why not give it a try&quot;.  Within the first two seconds I almost stopped it.&quot;All kids have an egg in their soul&quot;..... You can see where im coming from?But I didn't, I stuck to it. And I am so...glad I did.This anime has me on the edge of my seat and I can't wait until the next episode comes out. For one thing It does have a great romance plot developing, (Ikuto Tsukiyomi is soooo hot *Im not a fangirl, i swear*) and, although the story is cheesy sometimes, something about it has just hooked me and I cannot stop watching it.So, basically what im trying to say is, Give this anime a try.You may love it,You may hate it,You may become obssesed with it (Which is actually quite easy to do)However you react, you have to at least give this anime a shot.Im glad I did. glad I did.This anime has me on the edge of my seat and I can't wait until the next episode comes out.

Despite the pages of praise, the only thing I found I actually liked about this were the characters. Not all of them, mind. Just five or six.The premise was cute, I'll admit, having a special place in your heart for who you want to be, and sometimes being able to meet that person. But by episode 30, I really wanted to stop watching it. By episode 35, I did, until someone told me the final arc of Doki was really good. Man, am I gullible....The sad thing is, most of the fanfiction of this utilizes this idea in a better way than the canon story.Most episodes being filler didn't help, either. They even had a formula: Amu meets n, a person who is skilled at/in love with n. At/before a really important event, n will somehow mess up/be rejected, and a member of Easter will replace n's heart's egg with an X egg. Amu wil find the egg, make the same gasping noise, character transform,l then spew some stunningly cliche trite and purify n's heart egg. n then usually proceeds to never show his or her face again. They eventually do some variations, such as the x eggs hatching (Gasp.), or the X egg is a person's chara. Expanding on that more, if someone is not a Guardian or an employee of Easter ends up with a chara, you can bet it's going to become an X Egg. Out of the 50 episodes, I recall about 30 being filler.Characters in Shugo Chara vary greatly. Amongst the main cast, there was a pleasant diversity, although there were a few obnoxious characters. I'm not talking about the reoccurring characters like Saaya, I'm thinking of Kiseki. Was he supposed to be funny? He almost annoyed me as much as Tadase. Why did I find Tadase irritating? Because a main character should be memorable, but I can barely remember anything about him other Amu's endless fawning over him.Onto aesthetics! The art in Shugo Chara is fine, but there isn't anything truly outstanding. I liked most day to day outfits for the characters, Amu's in particular, but I disliked ALL of the character transformations, though. If I had to pick the absolute worst of the transformations, I'd say Amulet Clover, Clown Drop, and Dear Baby. They missed cute by miles, and strayed far into the territories of awkwardness and stupidity. As for the music in the anime, the openings are all guaranteed starters of uncomfortable conversations. Generally, the sound track was unimpressive unless Ikuto was playing on his violin, or Utau was debuting a new song.So to sum up, Shugo Chara is an anime I might have enjoyed, however the huge portion of filler, and the general dragged out impression it gave me ruined it. For me, the show (including Doki!) was dull and altogether not worth the 102 episodes I struggled through, and certainly not deserving of the praise many of the reviews give it. The fact that so many animes I adore have run for a single season, while this one goes on for 3, with two of the seasons having double, or even quadruple times the amount of episodes as them really annoys me, especially as a simple story like this could have been done in half the episodes at double quality. I wouldn't really recommend this for a person who likes seeing characters ending up together  (due to how it has the most disappointing romance ending ever devised by man) , but if you're a magical girl fan, go nuts.

Its my all-time favourite anime and I never get tired of it and have zero complaints. I've been re-watching animes lately and it's been 5 years since I first watched. I have changed my mind about a lot of animes, but this one still gets me giddy and excited.The story is pretty typical, one main girl character, two guys and a guardian angel. But there's something so fundamentally true about this story. Everyone hides their true self more than most would like to admit, it's about being true to yourself. "", ""Giving Shugo Chara! a try is an absolute must for anyone who is a fan of shoujo or mahou shoujo: because basically, it has all the ingrediants for one. Costumes that cannot possibly be practical but are cute, enemies that are defeated by the power of good, bright colours, younger aged characters and so on. But it doesn't only have that. It has a lot more alongside it. Much more - stuff that other mahou shoujo doesn't tend to have.It's geared for younger viewers esentially, but Shugo Chara! is one of those animes that has many levels. It''s underneath its typical deminour that it shines....It's in those many levels that it has the ability to span to so many different people in so many different ways.STORY: As I've said before, it's typically beat the bad guys by cleansing the eggs, lots of sparkles and shiny moments and some romance here and there. There's also a lot of laughs and unsuspecting moments along the way, which makes watching SC! all the more worthwhile. But it has a very essential message behind it, a message that everyone can connect with. How many times have you pretended to be different to fit in? How many times have you wished you could be more like your true self in front of everyone? That's what Shugo Chara seems to ask and addresses. The focus is on the characters and the routes they take to become their true selves; it's not all about defeating good and evil.ART: To be blunt, it's adorable. It's quite bright to appeal to younger viewers, but it isn't blinding. The colours all work together to create a believable world. It's very rare for any of it to be cheaply done - it's usually very good quality animation and artwork. Overall, it really adds to the atmosphere Shugo Chara brings - and even if the story and everything else is wonderful, if the art is bad, it isn't likely you're going to be able to watch it week in week out.SOUND: Typically simple, nice sounds throughout the episodes with recurring ones for the themes of characters and the cleansing of X-Eggs, with slight changes for each transformation. But I like the sound - it adds to the atmosphere. The opening and endings also deserve a mention here - Buono! was a wonderful creation for SC!, and even if I don't have the time or should be doing something else, I always watch through the opening and endings because I like the music. It's very cutesy, which isn't typically what I'm into, but I like it. It's different.Lastly for sound, the voices are all a wonderful pick. I'd say a shout out for Kanae Ito (Amu) is in order here - it's her first role, but she does it all perfectly. She isn't overbearing or annoying or frustrating - but she's believable.CHARACTERS: This is another area where SC! shines. The characters are not so-mind-blowingly-over-powered that they're unbelievable. Each one has their own flaws, their own doubts and personal problems. Each character is loveable on varying degrees, and that's because they're so believable. For several characters, too, I didn't like them for the first few episodes they were in. But as I grew to understand them and learn why they act like they do, what they're hiding behind the mask they give to the outside world, you start to fall in love with them. Because you can relate.Amu is also a refreshing heroine for shoujo. She completely contradicts the trend of cute characters that need protecting by everyone around her - she can be cute, but not overbearingly so. Her complete attitude is a draw in which is why peope like her, even though she fines it fake. Overall, the characters will grow on you in their own way over time.ENJOYMENT: It's funny, it has romance, it's not too hard to understand and isn't at all confusing. It's simple in some respects but very effective. And it's easy to connect to, so very much easy to enjoy. It's in those many levels that it has the ability to span to so many different people in so many different ways.STORY: As I've said before, it's typically beat the bad guys by cleansing the eggs, lots of sparkles and shiny moments and some romance here and there. There's also a lot of laughs and unsuspecting moments along the way, which makes watching SC! all the more worthwhile. But it has a very essential message behind it, a message that everyone can connect with. How many times have you pretended to be different to fit in? How many times have you wished you could be more like your true self in front of everyone? That's what Shugo Chara seems to ask and addresses. The focus is on the characters and the routes they take to become their true selves; it's not all about defeating good and evil.ART: To be blunt, it's adorable. It's quite bright to appeal to younger viewers, but it isn't blinding. The colours all work together to create a believable world. It's very rare for any of it to be cheaply done - it's usually very good quality animation and artwork. Overall, it really adds to the atmosphere Shugo Chara brings - and even if the story and everything else is wonderful, if the art is bad, it isn't likely you're going to be able to watch it week in week out.SOUND: Typically simple, nice sounds throughout the episodes with recurring ones for the themes of characters and the cleansing of X-Eggs, with slight changes for each transformation. But I like the sound - it adds to the atmosphere. The opening and endings also deserve a mention here - Buono! was a wonderful creation for SC!, and even if I don't have the time or should be doing something else, I always watch through the opening and endings because I like the music.

While it appeases all aspects of mahou shoujo, girl with powers, transformations, roamance, 'cute' themes and such it also includes just that little something that stands out so much.Story:The basic theme of every episode is simple, beat the bad guys, cleanse some eggs, drabble in romance and the such. However, Shugo Chara! has an over all story which brings the main cahracter, Amu, to the brink of depression and the theme of becoming ones true self is interesting. Rather than the story being about the powers and the magic and some war that's been going...on for years, the story is about the characters themselves, finding themselves and others. This is something that stands out for me.Art:The orignal style of Peach-Pit carries over to the anime. It's a sweet style that dosn't have the cliche 'my-eyes-are-twice-the-size-of-my-face'. The proportions are nice and the characters are cute, suiting the anime perfectly!Sound:I can't particully say I love the op's and ed's however they are fun. The voices are not ear splitting nor whining, it's very refreshing.Character:Amu is a character that impresses me alot. She isn't overly ditsy or loud. Instead she is character who eveyone thinks is cool and calm but is actually shy and cute. She reminds me of Ryuuji from ToraDora (looks like a deliquint but is actually quite kind). This is so rare in a magical girl it's also quite refreshing.Another thing that amazes me is the love triangles. This developed to the point of a RPG game! While she could fall for the prince, Tadase, her relationship with the cliche boy seems so shallow and a much deeper understanding is shown between her and Ikuto. But you never know.Enjoyment and overall:I personally love this anime, it's a nice surprise and twist on the mahou shoujo genre that was much needed!

She wishes to become her would-be self and gets three shugo chara which are like guardian angels that represent your would be self. The story revolves around the guardians a soceity of people with shugo charas includingAmu and their adventures to find themselves and the ledgerndary Embryo which grants any wish.This anime has a unique storyline and is a pleasure to watch. Like any typical magical girl anime you have flashy transformation and destroying evil which takes the form of X eggs and characters...in this anime, because of this it can be a bit cliche. The story does have some interesting developments but it also contains a lo of fillers which can be quite annoying at times. It is lighthearted and comical with a tinge of drama.However, for such a long series the story still lacks depth and this could have been made up by using the filler episodes to create more developments in the story.The art was so-so. Nothing special, just your typical shuojo style characters with big eyes and varying hair styles.Nothing bad about it but nothing good either.The sound was also ok. I think the voice actors did a good job though and each character was fitted with the perfect voices(quite cute especially the shugo charas). Besides that the songs sung during the show by Utau were quite good. But other than that not much else was done to enhance the atmosphere through the songs.The characters were done up quite well partly due to the long span of the anime, most of the characters received some kind of depth and character development was visible throughoutthe show. Perhaps the fillers could have helped create even more depth for the characters. Even the villains get some depth. Very little romance is involved in this anime and is very suttle. Most of the interactions between the characters is merely friendly not intimate but there are some small occurences here and there.Overall, i think the anime was not not as good as i had anticipated because it lacked the depth for a long span of 51 episodes and the fillers were quite annoying towards the end with the anime not going anywhere. But it is an interesting anime to watch because many can identify with the theme of a would be self and there are some meaningful messages embedded in the anime. Hopefully the second series will outdo the first. in this anime, because of this it can be a bit cliche.

Hopefully the second series will outdo the first.', ""Story: 10/10. Mostly because of the message behind the whole 51 episodes. At first glance, this anime might look like the usual school life, shoujo anime. If you think about it, there's actually a strong message behind the whole thing. It's just outstanding how such a simple message developing into a whole 51 episode anime... and a couple more seasons after that. (Still didn't get the message? HINT: think about how the eggs represents your dreams) I also really like the original storyline about guardian characters, x-eggs etc. Not to forget about the comedy. I also like how the anime doesn't just focus on one...character's problems.Art: 9/10 I personally really like the art. It's detailed and the clothing/hair styles of the characters are unique.Sound: 7/10 I really like the opening and the endings. I'm also a fan of Utau's songs (well, maybe not a mega fan but...). I personally think that the voice actors have also done a great job overall.Character: 7/10 In some way, the characters are stereotypical and not properly developed. Like how the guardians were popular, how Ikuto appears to be the stereotypical tsundere etc. On the other hand, it wasn't too obvious as the storyline and surroundings 'blends it in' (if I've made any sense at all x__x) Also, no Mary Sues/Gary Stus.Enjoyment: 10/10 Personally, this is the anime I've enjoyed most so far. It's quite surprising because this isn't the genre I usually like watching. I suggest you could try watching it even if it's not really your type of anime. It's also a sweet, funny and a somehow relate-able anime, especially the message behind the whole thing.Overall: 10/10 It's alright if you disagree with me. You might not like it as much as I do. I have nothing against that. One final word to sum up: A W E S O M E!!! character's problems.Art: 9/10 I personally really like the art.

It's a childish show, and the transformation of her character is overly dramatized.  I also hate how each episode starts with a weird voice saying &quot;All kids have an egg in their soul...&quot; in English.  The story is interesting, and has some plot twists, but not very many.  If you like light, easy-going shows with not much complications, then you will like Shugo Chara!  The art is also great.  I love how much detail...is everywhere, and the different outfits the characters wear when they &quot;Chara-Change.&quot;  Sounds are alright, I haven't really noticed them so they're not overly great, and not overly annoying.  Also, the time it takes for Amu-chan to do her &quot;Chara-Change&quot; is too long.  But pretty much any anime with transformations take a long time for the characters to transform.  Overall it's a great show and I would recommend it to anyone, guy or girl, even thou it's on the 'cute' side. is everywhere, and the different outfits the characters wear when they &quot;Chara-Change.&quot;  Sounds are alright, I haven't really noticed them so they're not overly great, and not overly annoying.

I don\'t know what the producers were thinking when they made this show, but they definitely created a masterpiece.The characters... don\'t even get me started. The character...development is great!

I would like to grade it thus far.I might update this after the first season has finished airingStory : The story for Shugo Chara is your typical magical girl anime, and yet, it's not. You have the one girl who falls in love with a prince type character but cannot confess her love and nothing seems to go her way. But Amu is not the typical girl who nobody likes and doesn't fit in. No, she's the complete opposite. 'Cool and Spicy' schoolgirl, Hinamori Amu, who doesn't know exactally how to act. Born...from these feelings were three eggs, and the story follows through there. Some parts can be pretty generic, but other parts have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.Art : I have heard that some people are not fond of the artwork, but I for one adore it. It's a very average style, nothing much to rave about and yet nothing to completely complain about. I still laugh at all of Amu's expressions though, the sparkles around Tadase, and Ikuto's generic 'I don't care' glance.Sound : I love all of the voice actors for this series. Each one fits so very well. You also might recognize Ikuto Tsukiyomi's voice actor, who also played Tomoya Okazaki in Clannad. And Utau is voiced by the extremally talented singer, Nana Mizuki. All and all, the staff did an awesome job with this cast.Character : Characters. Characters. So many characters in Shugo Chara. Yet, all so unique, having some special attribute that when you hear a description word your mind automatically jumps to a specific character in Shugo Chara. I personally adore all the characters in my own way, some may have favorites and some may dislike a certain character to no end, but you'll certainly never forget them.Enjoyment : So far, I have really enjoyed Shugo Chara! It may have it's extreme ups and it can certainly have it's extreme downs, but I think many people will in fact, enjoy this series. There are rumors of a second season because of the increasing manga material and I am pretty sure I am going to watch and compare, telling you guys if you should stick around or if you should drop the series completely, but it's up to you to take the first step.

She didn\'t really know anything about herself and she felt like she made the wrong impression. As I continued watching, I saw how everything just came together perfectly. There\'s reason\'s behind everyone\'s dream, they didn\'t just say ""Ok! This character wants to be a ___ when they grow up,"" for no reason. You really got to...connect with each of them to the point where you want their wildest dreams to come true(after you\'ve watched it, it\'s pretty obvious who I\'m talking about...).It really tells anyone who watches it, ""Hey, dreams are very easily broken, but you should chase them.""Although the anime could never happen, it seems to show reality more than fantasy. You are going to have fights with your friends, you are going to get hurt and you might even cry, but you shouldn\'t just give up everything just because one little thing. If you fall, let your friends pick you up and don\'t care about what others think of you. Others might stab you in the back, but you do the same afterwords, it will be an unending war.Shugo Chara has many plot twists that you couldn\'t really see coming.

However, when I began watching it, I couldn\'t have been more wrong. The story, art, and sound were all above average, but what stuck out most was how well the characters were designed, and how much each character developed through the course of the story. However, the thing that held it down was just how much filler there was throughout the series.Shugo Chara tells the story of cool, and ""spicy"", elementary student Amu Hinamori, who actually turns out to be a shy girl who has difficulty...expressing herself. One day, she hears on TV about the guardian characters (shugo chara) that are always protecting them. The next day, she wakes up and find 4 eggs, each containing their own guardian character, and each a person that Amu wants to be. Throughout the story, she meets others with guardian characters, and X eggs, which are the guardian characters of those with no hope, which Amu has the power to purify, and the Embryo, the mysterious character egg the corporation Easter wants to get their hands on.To me, this is one of my favorite MANGA ever for a multitude of reasons. First of all, the characters and story were absolutely amazing, a romance that actually made sense, and some genuinely funny scenes. On the other hand, the art and music were only slightly above average unlike the latter. Flaws included the below average, slow, ""action"" scenes, that were honestly unneeded (you\'ll see what I mean if you watch the show).RANT*A few minor spoilers*What killed the ANIME nearly entirely were the absolutely terrible amount of useless random characters and an entire unnecessary story arc in the anime. This extends the show far more than it needed to be, and really undermines Amu\'s special abilities and the X eggs introduced in the beginning. The supposedly rare and exclusive X eggs and Amu and the rest of the Guardians\' character transformations are completely put down. Most of the episodes are the same useless thing, in which the guardians find some random kid with a troubled mindset, who gets an X egg, and the guardians come purify them. This becomes worse, and more prevalent close to the end, and every time I saw the same garbage over and over, I wanted to put a gun to my head, because it nearly ruined how great Shugo Chara is supposed to be.In my opinion the manga is honestly the better of the two, as it retains everything great about Shugo Chara, but without the things that kept down the anime. However, if you simply don\'t like reading, then feel free to watch the anime, as it is still an enjoyable anime as long as you don\'t think to much in the many filler episodes. expressing herself.

At the time, I was low on good animes and was just searching for one to watch. I really didn\'t care if it was bad or amazing. I thought the animation looked cute so I promptly typed in ""Shugo Chara! 1"" into the search bar and started watching. In that one day, I watched 12 episodes in a row.

Throughout my entire life, I\'ve found strength in being myself, but I often struggle trying to figure out who exactly that is. I didn\'t know what I was going to do with my life. This anime taught me my what I was searching for the entire time. My dream became to protect other\'s dreams. I want people to be happy, while being themselves and doing what they love. This anime encourages just that and using some of the cutest transformations I\'ve ever seen. With each character having their own story and personality, there is, not doubt, someone you can relate to.

To every girl from 5 to 25, I highly suugest that you watch this anime.', ""Shugo chara didn't caught my eyes in the first place. when i was surfing on crunchyroll.com i saw this anime being featured and it is an all time favourite.the first thing that came to my mind is &quot; it look kinda childish, the pink hair girl is a kid so this should be a kiddy anime &quot; . but later on my friend told me that shugo chara is nice and ask me to give it a try. i trusted her as she know more about anime stuffs than me, i was totally a noob. the plot found on internet is very simplified. so i...guess it won't interest you if you only base on the given storyline. the anime is so much better than i thought.the first episode makes me wanna go on to the next and suprisingly i finished 49 episodes in 3 days. i am currently waiting for episode 50 to be subbed.the storyline is quite unique, it says that every kid has their would-be self and one day they will become their would-be self. amu, (the main character of the anime) who appear to be cool with attitude to the others. but actually she is just an ordinary girl who is shy inside. she has 3 eggs heart, spade, clover who turns into her shugo charas which are good in sport, art and cooking respectively. she can do a character change to her would-be self and also tranformation which fight the x characters. her alliances are the so called guardians who act as the student council in school. they each have their own shugo chara too but they can't transform like what amu did.amu soon joined them but part of the reason is to get close to her ideal prince tadase. their main aim is to find an embryo which can grant any wishes. i really like the bond of their friendship and also the different characteristics of their shugo charas and it is really fun to see them having a character change. the one who look gentle and elegant actually turns out to be a fierce and harsh one and tadase character change is really hilarious.never mention the word prince in front of him cause the 'king' will appear.another reason that i love this anime so much is because of another character which is ikuto. go to episode 3, you will fall in love with the scene where amu and ikuto has the eye contact at the kitchen. the way ikuto teases amu is really cute. this is why many of us gone crazy over amuto moments. another character utau who is a popular singer inside act another important role too. i think she is really pretty and her transformations are cool and awesome too. that is why i think the art of shugo chara worth a 9.all the characters have their unique point and the story developed very well. one of my favourite episode is 29 because so many unexpected things happened in one episode.IT IS A 'COOL AND SPICY' ANIME !

I wish I could go back in time and watch it for the first time again.I loved it, from story-telling, fights to characters. Characters were well done and everyone had something unique to them that no one else had, which made the anime more interesting to watch!Usually, I'm the Shoujo type of person and I like how this one was a healthy relationship growing if I can say so, compared to other anime were in like 3-4 episodes, they already like each other and start dating.I remember being annoyed with the...romance growing pretty slow but it was worth it, I'd watch it again anytime. Maybe for this year, people wouldn't give it a chance, but please do, it's really cute and has an amazing story and you got almost everything you want in one anime! romance growing pretty slow but it was worth it, I'd watch it again anytime.

It speaks to everyone who wishes they could change themselves or act as they want to, but fear the social consequences. Shugo Chara's premise and mechanics involving the eggs and shugo chara is very interesting and unique from other anime of the same genre.Each character has their own unique background and personality traits, having a cast that has someone ANYONE can...relate to.I recommend Shugo Chara! to ANYONE: boy or girl. The characters are charming, the story is unique, and overall Shugo Chara makes it's mark on your heart and you'll wish you had your own shugo chara!

I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others!Shugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as &quot;Cool &amp; spicy&quot; [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, &quot;do whatever you want&quot; demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her &quot;would be self&quot; prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs in...her bed.So let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute!The romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T).My only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time!Story--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to!Art--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :pSound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice.Character--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself.Enjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime.Overall--A perfect ten.

We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these “Character Guardians” are born out of your wish or your true character.Dreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstances...and it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one’s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat “hopeless” the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian.So that’s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her “True Self”. She didn’t like her façade character and prayed to be her “Would-be self”. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or “the chosen one”, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the “lock” later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use “Character Transform” that allows her to save other people’s egg/dream.There’s one more important thing, that is the “Embryo”, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it.Story: 9/10Heartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes.Most episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids’ egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu’s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time.Art: 7.5/10Character art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it’s good.Sound: 7.5/10Joyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they’re cute and funny. Overall it’s great.Character: 8/10Diverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu’s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character’s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you’ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You’ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you’ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story.Enjoyment: 8.5/10Very enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it’s just so fun.Overall: 8.5/10I really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of “Character Guardian” (Our Would-be self) and “Egg” (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids. and it may affect your life.

In the messy world of anime and ratings to be 13+ for 17+, it was a pleasant surprise to see an anime with an EVERYONE rating and with that, I decided to watch it and I fell in love with it almost instantly. I\'ve watched the whole series 5 times and each time, I learned something new and compelling which made me love the characters even more.The story was easy...to follow. Having that said, I guess I could say that out of all of the anime I\'ve seen thus far, it was the easiest in the sense of that you remember everything that happened last episode up until you watch the next and the next. Because of the simplicity of the story, I was able to watch it many times without losing interest.The transformations were unique and colorful, even when the boys transformed. But it was to be expected from a magic-based anime that everyone would transform. The idea that their Charas was what gave them the ability to do so and if the Chara and the owner had mixed feelings then you couldn\'t transform was deep and it was a very nice touch.Also, when you fulfill your dream, your character goes back into your heart and you grow up. This aspect made the anime have a more realistic touch and in accompaniment in reading the manga, the story becomes a tear fest and you actually feel for the characters. The whole atmosphere was childish and made it feel warm and fuzzy.The only thing I didn\'t like about the anime was that some of the characters had stories that made you feel pitiful for them instead of actually being sentimental or such. Not that I don\'t like myself mysterious characters but mystery had to come out of something more developed.The amount of filler episodes was a bit annoying but they were equally as entertaining as well. Yet if you were to remove them and just focus on the main story, the anime would become significantly shorter by comparison.Another thing that I didn\'t like was the third season not having a story following the main heroine, Amu, or even any of the characters as well. It introduced live action cosplayers, a new and annoying character who had little to no development, and suddenly in the end, she and Amu become the best of friends without any substance. To get the best of the anime, you\'d only have to watch seasons one and two; the third one is optional and is just for fun if you would still like to get a bit more out of Shugo Chara but not much.All in all, if you\'re looking for something that is easy to follow, colorful, and something that you won\'t feel bad about showing a seven year old child, then Shugo Chara is a fabulous choice! You just have to be patient around the filler episodes and love each character for what they have to offer to the anime and as a character themselves. Don\'t go hating on one just because the fandom does. Also, just be prepared to sing along with all seven of the openings and endings too. They can be quite catchy. to follow.

They can be quite catchy.', 'Of all the numerous Mahou Shoujo/Magical Girls anime series, Shugo Chara! is one of the best. The majority of animes in this genre tend to be along the same plotline: a ditzy heroine gets magical powers and is given the responsibility to save the world somehow; we all know the story. Shugo Chara!, however, is a breath of fresh air amidst this crazy monotony. First off, Amu, our main character, isn\'t the stereotypical ditzy heroine (gasp!). Instead, she the ""cool and spicy"" new student. Second, Amu and Co. aren\'t just saving the world. Instead, this anime focuses on dreams, goals, wishes, and your ""would-be self""....How many times can we honestly say we\'ve seen that in a Mahou Shoujo anime? It may not be a story comparable to, say,the infamous Cardcaptor Sakura, but it ranks fairly high up there. And as a bonus, it\'s comparitavely free of filler. (That\'s just RELATIVELY, though.)The animation is great, the art is colorful, and some of the objects (e.g., Heart\'s Eggs, X Eggs, Humpty Lock, etc.) look almost computer-animeated. The art style is the standard big-eyed Shoujo style, which complements the anime\'s story and charcters pretty well.The music, too, is also great. The two openings are a lot less cutesy than the ones in the Doki!! series, which I\'m sure most of us older fans appreciate. Even some of the background music, specifically the action scene music, is catchy enough to make you want to download it. No, seriously. Not to mention Utau\'s songs.The characters are unique. Some may get annoying at times, but every series has its share of obnoxious characters. Each character has their quirks, hidden traits, likes and dislikes. Some characters do seem to be slightly stereotypical (e.g., Ran, Suu, etc.), though.If you\'re looking for a series to watch, Shugo Chara! is a good pick. The filler may become a nuisance in the Doki! season, but don\'t let that deter you from the first. How many times can we honestly say we\'ve seen that in a Mahou Shoujo anime? It may not be a story comparable to, say,the infamous Cardcaptor Sakura, but it ranks fairly high up there. And as a bonus, it\'s comparitavely free of filler. (That\'s just RELATIVELY, though.)The animation is great, the art is colorful, and some of the objects (e.g., Heart\'s Eggs, X Eggs, Humpty Lock, etc.) look almost computer-animeated. The art style is the standard big-eyed Shoujo style, which complements the anime\'s story and charcters pretty well.The music, too, is also great. The two openings are a lot less cutesy than the ones in the Doki!! series, which I\'m sure most of us older fans appreciate. Even some of the background music, specifically the action scene music, is catchy enough to make you want to download it. No, seriously. Not to mention Utau\'s songs.The characters are unique.

I\'m not saying this series is horrible, but there are so many ideologies presented in the anime that just make me infuriated. I\'m not going to really comment on the story and the pacing of this show. If I have to quickly say something about it I\'d say the pacing is mediocre and there are far too many characters introduced who go nowhere and are just one-dimensional and hollow.No, this review is going to be...special. I am a lover of character writing and world building. What do your characters...believe? What is acceptable in their world? What are their personalities and how do they clash with the other characters...ext. This anime shot my love for characters in the chest, and the saddest part has I enjoyed it at first..sort of. I think I\'m being a bit dramatic.The first few episodes had me interested and I was okay with it. I had a few characters I had one character I particularly enjoyed. Just one and that was the character by the name of Kukai. He wasn\'t the best character sure, but every moment with him made me giggle he had motivations, but I think the best part about him was the fact that he actually acted like a kid for his age would. While every other character acted like they were high schoolers.This just makes me wonder towards the mangaka...why in gods name did you write these characters in elementary school/middle school if you gave them highschooler attitudes. I really don\'t think it would\'ve affected the plot that much and the characters basically look like high schoolers so I really don\'t understand the point.As I was saying a particular episode came along that made me hate whoever was writing this story. I am a person who watches a lot of law and order svu and when I see a relationship that is creepy. I freak out. This mostly spawned from the fact that Kukai had a friend who was going to college please note that Kukai was a 6th grader while this person was a graduating high schooler probably about 18. What annoyed me was the fact that Kukai\'s friends were saying that romance would spark between him and his childhood friend! Then, Amu brought up a very good point the very large age gap between him and his friend, but they simply said ""No, love has no age!"" and she just believed it. By the end of the episode, he receives a hug from his friend and says ""maybe it just is love"" or some shit. Which is tolerable I guess I can understand why little 5th and 6th graders might think that falling in love with someone way older than you is okay as long as the older character didn\'t act on it.However, then I found out that the character of Ikuto was a senior. A senior and he were flirting with and making sexual remarks about a 11/12-year-old girl. To anyone who is saying I\'m exaggerating I\'m really not. He brings up her small breast size on multiple occasions.  Anyone who says they ship them together regardless of the age, then I wonder would any of you let your little sibling date someone who was that much older than them. I really don\'t think you would.(spoilers ahoy) The scene that made me drop the show was a scene with the lock and the key. Ikuto decides to put his key in Amu\'s lock and what follows is a really weird scene. Cue Amu blushing and there being a particular emphasis on her looking slightly frightened and both of them blushing and he puts the key in the hole. I really thought I was exaggerating, but then I remembered there have been scenes that put Amu in a really uncomfortable looking position for a girl her age. Like the scene where she is sitting on his lap and they\'re both licking the same ice cream cone or some shit. It was really creepy and I felt gross all over just watching the key and lock scene and finally she screams ""I""m scared!"" and the key is no longer able to fit.I feel really disgusted that an adult wrote these situations about a young girl. They shouldn\'t be making shows for preteens and teenage girls because she\'s shoving her beliefs in other people\'s faces and trying to make huge age gaps ""cute."". I\'m really glad I watched this show now instead of when I was younger because I don\'t know how I would\'ve turned out if I believed Ikuto and Amu\'s love was ""so pure and perfect.""Sorry if I didn\'t really write a technical review, but I really needed to get this off my mind. believe?

Wanting to change and be her real self, three Charas eggs appear, who are there to help...Amu find her would be self. Along the way she becomes a member of the Gardians as the Jocker, and find out she has to defeat X eggs. (I don't know why i put this here, seeing as many people have already done reviews similar to this) As the story progresses you get to know each character more, and go into fan mode of choosing a pairing such as Amy x Ikuto.For thoughs who have put Shugo Chara! aside, you should probably pick it back up and dust it off, and give Shugo Chara! a chance.

This anime is for kids that are age 9-12. As a kid I loved this show and I still do. This anime inspired me to draw mangas and now my goal is to be a Anime Artist. This show has lots of good features. It teaches you good things. The characters are very relatable and they are cute as well. I definitely recommend you to watch this anime whether you are 9 or 13 or any other age.Story:         8Art:...10Sound:        8Character:  9Enjoyment:10Overall:      10 10Sound:        8Character:  9Enjoyment:10Overall:      10', '(please note that this review only covers the first season)Shugo Chara is the first true magical girl series that I\'ve watched and as such, I must say that it was a very good introduction to the genre for me. I feel no small amount of shame in saying this, but I really like Shugo Chara!Story:The story of Shugo Chara seems extremely simple at first. Essentially it boils down to main character Amu Hinamori saving the hopes and dreams of her classmates using the powers that her Shugo Caras grant her. The real story is a romance involving Amu a love triangle between Amu,...Tadase, and Ikuto. The romance is very good though it is worth noting that the rather large age gap between Ikuto and Amu can make for some rather uncomfortable scenes, I was personally able to overlook it but I feel that it\'s worth mentioning as it could be a deal breaker for some people. It is also worth noting that there are many episodes of filler and even some clip shows. The filler is actually pretty good in the beginning since it helps flesh out all of the characters but at certain points, espicially near the end it can get really frustrating. As for the clip shows... They\'re about as enjoyable as you\'d expect (read not at all). The story is really secondary to Shugo Chara\'s amazing characters.Art:The art is Shugo Chara is very well done and never really disappoints. The screen is filled with all sorts of bright colors and shots such as the school at sunset or the city at night really look amazing. A lot of people will also be happy to know that the infamous magical girl transformation scenes, while still present here, are very quick and sometimes are removed entirely. All the human character designs look good both when normal and character transformed. As for the Shugo Chara\'s, they take cute Chibi art to a whole new level and looking at them for too long can give you diabetes. The diabetes is totally worth it.Sound:I\'ve only seen the Japanese version subtitled so I can\'t really speak on the English dub, but all of the Japanese voices are well cast and talented. The background music is also well done and adds a lot to some of the scenes. The sound effects while not the best are still very good. All of the Openings and Endings are great as well with the first opening serving as a real standout. All and all Shugo Chara\'s sound is very well done.Characters:Shugo Chara may have a massive cast of characters but don\'t let this deter you, since all of the characters are very well done. Amu Hinamori is one of the most complicated and most realistic characters I\'ve ever seen and I managed to relate to her almost instantly. The story effectively revolves around Amu\'s insecurity and her quest to find her true self and it\'s a story that we\'ve all been through at least once. The other characters are all very well done also, such as Tadase and his desire to be a stronger person or the truth about Nadeshiko. The Shugo Charas, while not really deep due to their nature, are very likable and often times hilarious. The only character who doesn\'t quie match up is Ikuto Tsukiyomi. It\'s not that he\'s a bad character (like another black wearing multiple blade wearing Anime guy I could name) it\'s just that he is essentially introduced as the ""Lord Byron"" of the series and stays that way the entire 51 episodes. He does play his role as a dark and mysterious character very well but it would have been cool to see some character development or some more background surrounding him. All in all though the characters are amazing and a real selling point for the show.Shugo Chara may, at first glance, look like a generic, childish block of filler designed to sell toys, but it\'s amazing characters, great art, and excellent sound definitely make it worth watching. Give it a try and you might fall for it like I have. Tadase, and Ikuto.

I don't know how to explain it, but watching Shugo Chara  reminded me how it felt to hope, how it felt to try and enjoy life.The first thing I really liked about the show was Amu herself - she's a 10 year old with sass and I really liked that. I mean...okay, when she immediately fell for Tadase I was kinda annoyed but then I remembered that she was only 10. That's a thing about this show - you forget that they're just elementary school kids. Amu is actually really mature for her age and that's why I sort of looked up to her in a sense, despite me being 7 years older than her, because of the way she tries her hardest in life, how she gets along with her friends and family, how she goes through everything.The second thing I really liked about the show was Ikuto. Tsukiyomi Ikuto was definitely my first anime crush - I shipped him and Amu from the first episode! As well as the Amuto shipping feels, however, Ikuto's character has quite a lot of depth, especially considering the fact that this is a Shojou anime aimed at a younger demographic, and it's because of him I think that I was able to enjoy this anime so much. The way he took the burden of everything on himself, the way he felt trapped by Easter... it just helped me identify with him and the way he and Amu interacted just put a smile on my face.The Chara's themselves were another thing which I really liked about the show - so it seems to be a sort of recurring Shojou theme to have little mascot-type characters but the Charas are just... I don't know how to describe it but personally I was able to identify with both Yoru and Miki in a way and I have no idea why! The fact that the Charas are born through a person's desire to change themselves is actually a rather brilliant idea, because I think it sort of shows how if you have that wanting to change and better yourself within you, you'll be able to.It's an anime which gives you hope and puts a smile on your face while telling you that you can change if you really want to, that the world has a happier side to it. That's why it's always going to be one of my favourite animes. okay, when she immediately fell for Tadase I was kinda annoyed but then I remembered that she was only 10.

Its sort of like Madoka, but Madoka has a bunch of twist. When i saw the cover i said why not give it a try. I watched 1 and i liked it , but then it began to go downhill on like episode 7 . The storyline is about the same, Easter tries to find the embryo by using schemes, Amu destroys them, and thats about it. Also i don't think they should be using romance in elementary school. I mean save it till middle school at least?The art...was good ,but i saw better. The sound i liked, but i think Amu's voice was too high pitched. I didn't enjoy it very much, and the only character i liked was Utau . Sorry for the bad score . I have to say that this anime seems too perfect, it need like a little tragedy ,like Ikuto hating her for like a week , then they make up. was good ,but i saw better.

Thank you. ovoShugo Chara is a magical girl anime, you know, girls/guys transforming into weird/cute outfits. You get the idea. At first I really liked the anime, then it sort of went down the hill.Story:I think the story was very good and creative. i never seen an anime like this before. I really liked the parts where Amu would panic. Hilarious xD Then it seems like the story repeats over again. Like an X-egg appears, Amu notices it and returns it back to normal. Now if you think about it, there are a...lot of episodes like that , and I like interesting new things in episodes.Art:The art was great. Even the art style supports the magical-girl theme. Amazing.Sound:I enjoyed the sound very much. I really thought Amu\'s voice suits her, and that the voice actor did an amazing job on the ""cool and spicy"" part. I also liked Utau\'s voice, and of course, Ikuto\'s sexy voice :DCharacters:Now this is the part that I really found a problem with. Amu acts as the ""cool and spicy"" girl, but really, she is shy. At first I didn\'t have a problem with that, but if you notice, everyone seems to like Amu, cool or not. Also I don\'t really get why the characters have only one Shugo Chara, but Amu has 4? For me I feel like Amu is a bit overly perfect.(Im sorry if you hate me for this ;v; ) I did like Utau a lot, mainly because i like those ""tsundere moe characters"". I absolutely LOVE Ikuto. His personality just makes me want to squeal every time i see him. I also liked Kukai and Nagehiko(Nadeshiko). Also I dont think you should bring romance into elementary school. My favorite couple was Kukai and Utau, and i though Tadase and Amu looked so adorable!~I completely DESPISED Amuto (Amu and Ikuto) mainly because the age difference.

I like watched the first three eps and fell in love.Story: I think the story is very good. Its about this girl, amu hinamori, who has this outside character. You know, like sometime how some people act tough when they're really nice. Anyway, thats Amu. Then one day she wishes she had courage to be herself. and she gets 3 guardian chara. Thats how the whole adventure starts. I like how there's a bit of romance and a bit of action. It has almost everything one needs.Art and Sound: The...art is really good. Most of the guys I think look totally hot, so thats something to look forward too. And i think the voices match each character perfectly.Characters: I absolutely love each character.

I have not seen the entire anime, but I\'ve lost my place in the anime and the amount of episodes I have listed on my list is inaccurate. I have definitely watched a decent amount of episodes of this Shugo Chara!This anime is obviously targeted towards a younger audience, and I was 11 when I first watched this anime. (2010) Even then, I wasn\'t amused.In context of the time this anime was created, the art was pretty standard. Nothing that really popped out. I\'ll admit, some of the character designs are really simple, yet aesthetically nice to look at....However, they are very basic. Ikuto\'s, specifically, is immensely boring and basic. In Shugo Chara!\'s defense, this is after all an anime about high school students, so there can only be so much variation in character design. I will admit that I do like the difference in the school uniform. It\'s a nice difference compared to other anime with school uniforms.Amu\'s initial ""personality"" is pretty hard to fathom, because all we really know about her is that she\'s ""spicy"" and ""cool."" She\'s clearly unsatisfied with how she is, but we hardly even know how empty her personality is to begin with. Amu, as a character, is pretty bland.The heavily implied ""romantic"" spark with two characters gives me a really uncomfortable vibe, especially considering there is a 4-6 years difference. With one of them being a preteen and the other being in their late teens. The maturity differences is what really creeps me out. (Though you could argue that they\'re both really immature, but still.)The romantic ""plot"" in Shugo Chara! is pretty irrelevant, and I find it to be distracting from the message the anime is trying to convey.The concept of this anime is truly pure, and I do appreciate the message that it\'s trying to send out. But it\'s just too painstakingly drawn out. It bored me far too easily, and I tried really hard to get invested into this anime. I really did.I suppose a large part of this anime that I didn\'t like was that it was far too cutesy and cheesy. I definitely give credit to this anime in a lot of aspects, but this just wasn\'t for me. I can see it being far more appreciated by those who love the genre, as I will admit it is pretty unique for the genre itself.

I shall review my very first anime!Keeping in mind this was the anime the started it all for me, when I was in sixth grade. Those who are fans of the Mahou Shojo genre this is a breathe of fresh air. It has adorable designs and wonderful characters that relate to its intended audience. As an older viewer it's still a wonderful series to watch (minus Shugo Chara: Party) with it's classic cringe filled moments and humor and overall adorableness.I may be biased but it's a good starter anime for the young viewer.Jewel~ "", ""While Shugo Chara isn't the best anime I've ever watched.It certainly is one of the most enjoyable.It all starts off as a normal magical girl show at first, but after the first few episodes I got immersed in it's fresh concept. Shugo Chara isn't just about a magical girl trying to save the world from the generic badguys. instead Shugo Chara has a deeper concept of showing people that it's never too late to wish for and believe in your dreams. "", ""I remember that this was in fact one of the very first anime series, that I have watched, after a friend had recommended this to me. Overall, the show was fine, but for me it was not exactly the type of anime I would watch again. Everything is found to be really ''girly'', and focusing on a typical theme of magic powers, and a group of girls that go out to save the world. In fact, a lot of previous tv shows, as well as anime have a similar concept, such as the Power Puff Girls, and Tokyo Mew Mew. Of course, I'm not saying...that the series does not have any potential, but it just wasn't exactly the series for me. If perhaps you enjoy such story lines, then go for it, but it's simply not my thing. that the series does not have any potential, but it just wasn't exactly the series for me. If perhaps you enjoy such story lines, then go for it, but it's simply not my thing."", 'Its my first time writing a review so... I will try my best. Just note that what I am writing now will be my impression of both \'Shugo chara!\' and \'shugo chara doki!\' (both seasons).I thought the anime started off really well. First of all, some people may not mind the art in anime so much, saying tings like ""Oh, art doesn\'t matter so much as long as I can differentiate between different characters"" but for me, I can\'t stand to watch an anime that does not have good art. But for this anime, that was not a problem at all. The artwork was...perfect! and most of all hinamori amu (the most important protagonist) was designed really well. I would further like to mention that her voice acting was great too! It was natural, and really did suit the character well I think. Thus in terms of art and voice, no problems what so ever.The idea of the story itself, I thought, was unique and captured my interest initially at the beginning. However, bearing in mind that this show is meant for children, it became pretty repetitive throughout with lots, and I mean lots of filler episodes (especially in season 2) . Now, my age is definitely not be categorized as \'child\' so I really don\'t have the right to complain about fillers despite how annoyed I felt during my way through the episodes. It felt as though these fillers blocked the progression of the story way too much. But if I put myself in perspective of a child watching the same anime, I\'m sure I would have gotten excited whenever Amu did a character transformation. In fact,  that would have been ALL I cared about so as a child, filler or not, as long as she made that transformation I would have enjoyed it. My point is that given my age, and yours too (i\'m sure) we don\'t have the right to complain about fillers since we, in the first place, are watching a show that was meant for kids in the first place. So for me at least, despite my hatred of these filler episodes, I came to understand their worth and managed to keep hold till the end.The first season went pretty well I thought. The story progressed well, posing questions and uncertainty, developments between character relationships etc. Its this \'development\' that we look for, and the first season managed to do just this and made it enjoyable for me to view. However the second season was different. It undoubtedly lacked the depth which was present in the first season and, as I said above, was highly concentrated with fillers. I\'m sure even with these, the story could have progressed as well as it did in the first season, but instead, I felt like there was a huge separation from the \'main plot\' to \'side plot\'. For instance, serious event takes place and causes despair but in the next episode all the seriousness is suddenly neutralized by a rather boring filler episode. I\'m sure the fillers could have been made better than that, or even, made in a different order so that it does not interrupt the tension that was built up from before. I am not complaining about the existence of these filler episodes, do not misunderstand. I am merely noting that these could have been made with a bit more care so that it does not disturb the development of the anime. Perhaps then, for older audiences, it could have been much more enjoyable.So I thought that there was a dramatic change in the level of enjoyment from  my initial sense of satisfaction in the first season to utter disappointment in the second.Now for the characters.. I really liked Hinamori Amu. She is energetic, kind, cute and straightforward. All the qualities that you would look for in a perfect protagonist in an anime like this. Not just her, but all the other characters were great too. In terms of the relationships between these characters, I really initially loved the fact that Nadeshiko and Amu were so close. After all, she was Amu\'s first friend ever and her \'best\' friend. The close friendship between them made me feel happy for Amu but I was rather disappointed later on, and the reason for that is not what you may expect. But since I don\'t want to write any spoilers, I will prohibit myself from saying it out loud. The other two main characters of the story is Ikuto and Tadase. The love triangle the goes on between the two and amu is rather obvious from the start so no spoilers there. Given that amu and tadase are elementary school students, a part of me says that heavy romance is not possible. However there indeed exists elements of romance in here and so another part of me screams that even if \'light\' romance, there should be a proper pair at least. The ending of the anime provided me with the worst pairings possible and I\'m sure 99% of mature viewers were disappointed with the outcome . But Oh well, that is my opinion only. I\'m only suggesting that if romance is what you are looking for, this anime is not really the right one to watch but i must admit, it is cute when amu blushes. Maybe that may perhaps change your thoughts, I don\'t know. Romance is not really a big part so... yeah. Anyway the character desgns, I thought, were really good. Tadase the typical princely figure with Ikuto being the character that has a much more playful attitude, especially towards the one he likes.Overall I think this show was good. It was good, but not good enough. Note that I haven\'t written anything to do with the third season, \'shugo chara party\' because it is useless to write about. There is absolutely no point in watching that. Not only is Ikuto kicked out from it, even Amu appears less and less frequently. Anyway, I thought initially shugo chara was great, but as I watched on, it became less and less enjoyable for me to watch. Eventually I dropped in during the third season. And trust me, it is not only me who feels this way. Season 3 only has under 30 episodes because of the loss of popularity. I don\'t find that strange given that they changed the whole show completely.So to finalize, I do not recommend you to put hours and hours watching this. My recommendation is for you to read the manga and enjoy the story with better development, formation of a proper pair, and most of all less time!. The manga is concise and follows the story directly! it will take you less time to  finish with more enjoyment than the manga. perfect! and most of all hinamori amu (the most important protagonist) was designed really well.

It was knocked down to a 9 because of the many fillers and the repetitive battles with the X eggs.

I read some of the manga and was, quite frankly, very disappointed with it. I didn\'t know why so many people were hyped up about it. After finally pushing myself to get over the absolute girlyness of it, I finally got an appreciation for the anime. This is coming from someone who would rather watch Black Lagoon or Mirai Nikki, by the way.Story:Okay, so it\'s a pretty average ""Monster of the Week"" kind of plot. Basically, everyone has an ""egg""...in their heart and if you awaken that egg, you get your own Guardian Character and can transform with them to get a Character Transformation. However, your egg can also become an X character if you\'re going through a lot of stress. The main characters fight the X characters and save the day. There ya go. There is a real plot that goes on, but 90% of the anime is just that.Art: I have to say, I normally hate Peach Pit (the manga duo who also created DearS and Rozen Maiden) but I found the art and animation of Shugo Chara very appealing. It was bright and colorful with very detailed lineart. The animation was well done (nothing amazing, but definitely not terrible) so it was nice to admire. The transformation scenes are especially cute and well executed. It was actually the transformations I saw on YouTube that got me wanting to watch Shugo Chara.Sound: Nothing amazing. Catchy J-Pop songs for openings and endings that are easy to sing to, but nothing spectacular. I don\'t even remember the BGM so it never stood out to me.Character: A VERY large cast of characters. Many of the characters start off as anime stereotypes but do become more developed as the story goes on (at an EXTREMELY slow pace though). The main character, Amu Hinamori, is a young girl who people think is ""cool and spicy"" when she really is shy and girly. You will most probably find her as a very annoying character. I most certainly did. She does develop as a character, but I could care less about her.  There are the school Guardians who are enjoyable too (my favorites being Kairi, Kukai, and Rima). There\'s also Ikuto who is the classic bad boy that all the fangirls fawn over (I personally never cared for him) and Utau Hoshina (who I wish was the main character, quite frankly). And there are also all of the Guardian Characters that you\'ll meet. Overall, it\'s a very wide cast and there is bound to be at least one character that you\'ll come to love. They all get developed pretty well and each of their stories are interesting to watch (except Yaya...).Enjoyment: If you can put up with the absolutely girliness and some really annoying characters, Shugo Chara is an incredibly enjoyable anime. Each time I watched a new episode, I felt happier and ready to do anything. Shugo Chara makes a bad day much better with the different morals that each episode teaches (no matter how cheesy some might be). Many of the situations the characters go through are relatable so it\'s makes the viewer more connected with the story.Overall: Not an amazing or incredibly unique anime, but very fun and light-hearted. You should definitely watch this if you\'re having a bad day and need something bright and happy to cheer your up. I give this a 7/10 because although it\'s nothing very unique, it\'s has several redeeming qualities that will make you stick through all 51 episodes and even through to the 2nd season (but don\'t bother watching the 3rd season...). in their heart and if you awaken that egg, you get your own Guardian Character and can transform with them to get a Character Transformation.

I most certainly did. She does develop as a character, but I could care less about her.  There are the school Guardians who are enjoyable too (my favorites being Kairi, Kukai, and Rima). There\'s also Ikuto who is the classic bad boy that all the fangirls fawn over (I personally never cared for him) and Utau Hoshina (who I wish was the main character, quite frankly). And there are also all of the Guardian Characters that you\'ll meet. Overall, it\'s a very wide cast and there is bound to be at least one character that you\'ll come to love. They all get developed pretty well and each of their stories are interesting to watch (except Yaya...).Enjoyment: If you can put up with the absolutely girliness and some really annoying characters, Shugo Chara is an incredibly enjoyable anime. Each time I watched a new episode, I felt happier and ready to do anything. Shugo Chara makes a bad day much better with the different morals that each episode teaches (no matter how cheesy some might be). Many of the situations the characters go through are relatable so it\'s makes the viewer more connected with the story.Overall: Not an amazing or incredibly unique anime, but very fun and light-hearted. You should definitely watch this if you\'re having a bad day and need something bright and happy to cheer your up. I give this a 7/10 because although it\'s nothing very unique, it\'s has several redeeming qualities that will make you stick through all 51 episodes and even through to the 2nd season (but don\'t bother watching the 3rd season...).', ""I hope you do agree with me that the introduction of this anime really does produce excitement. Especially the romantic meeting and moments of Amu and Ikuto.Sadly, I got bored with it after fifteen episodes or so. Of course I still look out for episodes wherein Ikuto and Amu would have some intimate moments, but that is as far as my will extends to.This is only my opinion though, but...Tadase's other character transformation, the one with the frills and ribbons, sucked. He looked so gay. This is just me though, and some of my friends. Haha. "", ""If I were my 12 year old self, I would've given his a 9, but rewatching this many years later, I realized this show is your below average magical girl anime. To start, the idea with the eggs being little charas of people you wish you were was unique and interesting, but the characters and plot kind of ruin it all.First of all, the main character Amu has no character development and your run-of-the-mill overpowered, Mary Sue (This pink hair doesn't help). The fact that she has so many charas and even has a final transformation with all her charas really shows the bias towards...her in the show- she has no rivals, no one can even compete with her. You can't even say her only flaws are her insecurities, because everyone has Insecurities and I don't really count it as a flaw since insecurities can go away, while flaws are usually a part of someones personality, or takes time to overcome.Secondly, her relationship with Ikuto is really borderline p>dophillia and it really turned me away from the whole show. Plot itself was really predictable as well, we all know Amu was going to get together with Ikuto even though she had a crush on Tadase. Parents were never around in the show, the whole climax was kind of disappointing and it seems like the creators just paired the other characters together as a couple because they are the leftovers. Like what are the possibilities that everyone in the school council-thingy are in love with each other?Utau's music in the anime was the only good thing, Nana Mizuki did a great job singing.  Art was your typical 2008 quality and wasn't that good either. Overall, I give it a 3. There are much better magical girls shows to watch than this, but you can still watch it if you are desperate. her in the show- she has no rivals, no one can even compete with her.

I feel like when there's a shoujo anime with a main male character, you always want to ship the girl with him (Tadase), but Ikuto is like something out of every teenage girl's fantasy, so I guess it works on appealing to more ages?Otherwise, the show is the typical repetitive mahou shoujo kind of show where you only need to watch a few episodes in a certain order; the rest you can just watch whenever. Also, the only character I genuinely liked in that whole show...was Su; everyone else is cringey (but you know, in an elementary school girl, negative heart lock-on open heart kind of way). was Su; everyone else is cringey (but you know, in an elementary school girl, negative heart lock-on open heart kind of way)."", 'Now This is a very old anime in my book and I don\'t really remember much honestly but if there would be a overall rating of this I would call it either 6 out of 10 or 7 out of 10!

As for the content, I found it quite interesting (being able to communicate with another version of yourself or what this anime calls a “guardian character” is actually quite interesting); Personally, I don't like shoujo (I'm a girl) so I feel like it's not suitable for me. I...still don't understand why Amu likes Tadashe and vice versa (love can be without reason), it makes me feel very uncomfortable.

So many elements of the season (nay, the series) can be seen from just these 51 episodes, and to truly break it down in a few sentences isn\'t really possible. Things are handled so drastically different that in my opinion, Shugo Chara\'s characters and plot pretty much stand on their own spectrums.To start with, Shugo Chara\'s plot is arguably its weakest element. The plot is barely held together by a monster-of-the-week format. The execution and method chosen to do this, while weak, is incredibly effective in a symbolic way; using eggs as a metaphor for childhood...innocence and character development gets points for originality if nothing else, and it\'s a good thing it holds up so well. However, it does have some incredibly unfortunate implications, such as the fact that it and the counter for its metaphor goes hand in hand with predatory behavior towards children. This is made worse by Nikaidou, who pretty much lays the entire metaphor on the table on.One of the best parts of Shugo Chara, however, is its characters. Shugo Chara\'s actual characters are broken down into a series of onion-like layers that gives them lots of depth and allows for genuine exploration of characters, since they\'re based in logic and given real behaviors. This also helps create a nice contrast between someone\'s ""outer character"" and their ""inner character"" (or ""true self""), and creates some great comedy, one of Shugo Chara\'s other elements it excels at. The comedy in Shugo Chara is pretty much the best you could want: lots of constantly changing and exaggerated faces, visual comedy, puns, subtle jokes, straight man schtick, it\'s pretty much all covered. They experiment with a TON of styles, which I respect their willingness to try at least. Thankfully, at least a few jokes are guaranteed to make you laugh. The Charas behaviors and episodes themselves based on premise alone also lend themselves heavily to comedy, and the writing delivers.A character\'s ""Guardian Character"" (referred to as their ""Chara"" for ease of writing) adds another layer to the ""inner and outer character"" symbolism I mentioned before; here, it\'s not necessarily them, but even if it\'s not, a Chara is based on who they want to be. So we can argue that at least in a philosophical sense, they represent at least an ideology of the type of person that you could become. Shugo Chara\'s characters aren\'t relegated to just jokes; lots of side characters, main characters, and even the Charas themselves all get plenty of time to grow and develop, several reoccurring. One of the most interesting elements present is that while Charas are typically invisible, some characters have the ability to see Charas despite not being children: namely, Ikuto, Utau, Saeki Nobuko, and Nikaidou, oddly enough. I\'m unsure if this is meant to be symbolic, but my best guess is that it could be interpreted as they haven\'t lost their childlike innocence, which would speak volumes to Utau\'s character arc.Personally, I found Utau\'s arc to be done the best. Despite it putting the majority of Dia\'s character development on the backburner due to the amount of time it was extended away, it works harmoniously with the way she goes through a genuine moral struggle to find herself and ultimately, the courage to make important decisions that impact the rest of her life.Overall, Shugo Chara may not be the best series ever; on the contrary, it seems pretty low quality, formulaic, repetitive, has a terrible plot, and other elements. However, these aren\'t its true strengths. Its true strength is engaging with its audience and putting them in the characters\' perspectives firsthand, getting us to feel their struggles and joys and emotions with vigor, with plenty of laughs and empathetic moments along the way. Despite its low score, this is an absolutely positive recommendation. innocence and character development gets points for originality if nothing else, and it\'s a good thing it holds up so well.

Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1651/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_2,"[""Well, as stated in my previous review, the first season of Space Battleship Yamato was excellent to me. I kinda wanted to have more of it. Luckily, the second season, the Comet Empire, appeared as I googled it. I had my doubts though, since Leiji Matsumoto could have blown the soul of the anime with a weird / not fitting sequel of what the great Quest for Iscandar was (somethig that is very common in movies /tv shows nowadays). Anyways, I decided to give it a try, so after 6 days and something of downloading (and me praying for seeders that never seemed to come!),...I managed to watch all of the 26 episodes.The story:The Comet Empire? What the... ok, I was kinda skeptical when I heard about it. But the storymakers made it good. The new enemy of planet Earth is even more cruel and powerful than Gamilus and Desler were, much more I would dare to say. Lord Desler, a character I liked a lot in the first season, reappeared here (don't whine for this spoiler, he is present from very early on anyways!), which made things interesting. His revival was also credible to some point. Earth is then in danger again, but this time, it has somewhat of a force to defend against the White Comet. The Yamato needs to travel this time, but not to visit Starsha in Iscandar, but Teresa in Teresart! Although this might sound boring to you readers, it is not! The plot is very different from the first season. Many new characters appear, new ships, Yamato abilities and so and so on. I did also really like the fact, that this season presented battles ans scenarios in a much more tactical way than the presquel did, which someone like me, who likes strategy games or MMOs like Ogame or EVE, made me very happy. Another good thing about these chapters is the lack of cheesy and cliche romance between Kodai and Yuki that you would expect after the end of last season. They asume their roles in a very professional way and don't tend to occupy a lot of the plot with tears, kisses or other romantic bla bla. Violence/guns/explosions > romance! (at least regarding this anime). The ending did disappoint me, but just a very little tiny bit. Although good enough, I wanted jussssst a bit more action from the Yamato... Well I am not going to tell what happened!So, I think story deserves a good 9.Note: I think Star Wars, movies which appeared 2+ years after this anime, could have actually taken ideas and concepts out of it. One hint, the Death Star!(Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars, i'm not critizicing any aspect of it, in any way!)Art:Although art was already very OK to me in the first season, I think the art department did really improve in this season. More vivid explosions, gun firing... Everything was better done this time. The battle scenes did also look very good to me, again, better than in Quest for Iscandar. I cannot forget about the new ships and features that were created for this season. The Andromeda looks very cool and stylish, the new enemy battleships did also improve and you can't forget a WOW at the end with the mega battleship from... Ok, no spoiler. Teresa was also well achieved, she looked pretty much as good as Starsha, so no complaints there. Well, as I said in my last review, it is a very old anime, you can't compare the artwork with today's one.Leaving that aspect aside, art deserves a 10.Sound:Yes! The original opening from Isao Sasaki is also present in this season. His song was way to epic to be replaced by another one. Although the song about Teresa in the credits is not as good as Makka na scarf, it is good enough to make the credits be bearable :). Much of the good sound effects and ambience music were also included in this season. I think they did good, since most of the sounds were good enough to be replaced in just one year. Many new effects and atmosphere music were included though, most of them very good.Can't say much more about this topic, so I'll just give it a good 9 for now.Characters:Well, without Okita, Kodai endeavours as the acting captain of the Yamato. He is much more mature than in the first season, and his decisions as a captain are also good in 95% of the cases. I have to say, he is much more likeable in this sequel. Shima also evolves in this season, I can't say why, because it would spoil the story. Sanada, intelligent as always, saves the Yamato from more than one situation, just as like last season. Definitively one of the best characters. Yuki, although a bit annoying regarding her love for Kodai, stays calm for pretty much the whole chapters. She is also a bit more mature now. One character I forgot last review was Analyzer, a robot that is also vital for the Yamato and it's crew. Hijikata, altough more tough than Okita, is as honorable as him, maybe a bit less intelligent, but his personality and actions are also cool. Well, the villains, Lord Zorder lacks the honor and intelligence that Desler had, but it suits his role. Desler, intelligent and also honorable as always, did not let me down this season. Genitz and the other guys, are also similar to other Gamilus generals. But Sabera, that stupid woman annoyed me a bit. But her foolish actions did save the Yamato a couple of times, luckily...I can say that I liked Starsha more than Teresa. Teresa comes to be annoying to a certain point (i.e Watashi wa Teresa! (My name is Teresa) was probably transmitted 20 times to the Yamato crew, argh). Well, I forgive her, for her key role in the series and the power she has. I almost forgot Saito. He is also very annoying in the beginning, but you learn to appreciate his efforts in the end.One thing I have to say is, that some crewmembers are not appearing in the third season :) (well, I think so at least, I need to watch it first). Anyways, characters, although some with tiny flaws, deserve a 10.Enjoyment:Oh my lord... I enjoyed every single second of this great sequel. The plot was so epic, the battles, the strategies, the drama,... Everything was very well achieved. I had to bite my nails in some cases, and watching only one episode at a time was not always possible ;). That Earth had somewhat of a defense made the battles more interesting (not only the poor Yamato needs to take the shots). Pew pew with the Wave Motion Gun(s!), planets been turned to dust... Things were so creative in this season, that the story planners need some kind of reward. Really. I think they do! Well, this season was without a doubt full with action and interesting scenarios. I am glad about it. Enjoyment has a 10!Overall:Who said that every sequel sucks / is worse than the first season / movie? The Comet Empire, although a rare exception, deserves to be one. I enjoyed every single aspect of it, every second. That I had to wait 6 days for its download... it was worth it! Well, the Quest for Iscandar fans might want to locate me and kill me. Chill guys, the Quest for Iscandar is still very good to me. But I think Matsumoto and his people improved with this season.I recommend this sequel to everyone who liked Quest for Iscandar. In my opinion, the Comet Empire will not let you down... Be Forever Yamato!(Btw, a 10 overall). I managed to watch all of the 26 episodes.The story:The Comet Empire?

That Earth had somewhat of a defense made the battles more interesting (not only the poor Yamato needs to take the shots). Pew pew with the Wave Motion Gun(s!), planets been turned to dust... Things were so creative in this season, that the story planners need some kind of reward. Really. I think they do! Well, this season was without a doubt full with action and interesting scenarios. I am glad about it. Enjoyment has a 10!Overall:Who said that every sequel sucks / is worse than the first season / movie? The Comet Empire, although a rare exception, deserves to be one. I enjoyed every single aspect of it, every second. That I had to wait 6 days for its download... it was worth it! Well, the Quest for Iscandar fans might want to locate me and kill me. Chill guys, the Quest for Iscandar is still very good to me. But I think Matsumoto and his people improved with this season.I recommend this sequel to everyone who liked Quest for Iscandar. In my opinion, the Comet Empire will not let you down... Be Forever Yamato!(Btw, a 10 overall)."", ""This story line was the second part of the overall story. It grew up in many ways from the first one. Better art work and direction, writing all added more to a good story. We saw Derik Wildstar (if that was his name or how it was spelled?) as a older, more mature person than in the first one. He fit into the Commanders shoes and learned wisdom.They had a terrible new enemy coming at Earth and so the Star force once again felt a need to help save others as well as earth.It had it's dumb parts as well...but what can one say about that. everything has dumbness in it as well as greatness.They met up with a old enemy from the first series who wanted revenge.The Space battles were pretty darn good, a lot better than the first series but this is to be expected as they got better as they went, all the writers and artists and every part seemed to mesh better.And Derik and Nova's love for each other really came together in this series. While it was not a love series or a soap opera they gave it just enough of a touch so it wasn't enough to screw up the series but just enough to make the expected come to pass.It was again, a very good Science Fiction series that was matured and well worth watching. but what can one say about that. everything has dumbness in it as well as greatness.They met up with a old enemy from the first series who wanted revenge.The Space battles were pretty darn good, a lot better than the first series but this is to be expected as they got better as they went, all the writers and artists and every part seemed to mesh better.And Derik and Nova's love for each other really came together in this series.

After watching the first season, I not only wanted to watch more of Matsumoto’s work, but had to watch more Yamato. The other man of note was Kenzou Koizumi whom did storyboard and chief animation director (known for story board on Lupin III, animation Galaxy Express, list goes on forever). Now did the sequel live up to the original or did it turn out much like the anime sequels of today?Earth is about to be destroyed / conquered again, but this time by an alien race called the...“Comet Empire.” Basically, they destroy everything in their path on their quest to conquer the universe... much like an alien race out of Doctor Who. Much like the original, Earth is at a technological disadvantage from the beginning, an attractive alien woman sends a mysterious message, so the Yamato treks out into space yet again. So very much like Yamato 1974. However, the anime starts out extremely slow without much of anything happening. Even the quest this time is unexciting, and missing the impending doom factor the original had.When it came to art and sound, it was almost identical to the original all the way down to the theme music. Sure the theme of the Yamato was original and cool, but something a little different would have been nice. All the characters remained from the original, and much more mature. This makes sense since the crew had endured so much together from their quest to Iscander. However, this leaves all of the characters way too one dimensional.Now, the action is intense after the slow start. The battles raged on with some tactics, but the wild tactics were not there, but actual strategy. This lead to an extremely good arc from middle to almost the end, leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat However, the slow start and the “cop-out” ending really hurt this show in the end. If you were a fan of the first one, this is a normal 26 episode show. Just get through the beginning, a couple annoying characters, and this is a fine sequel to the captivating original. “Comet Empire.” Basically, they destroy everything in their path on their quest to conquer the universe... much like an alien race out of Doctor Who.

Also beware , there are spoilers ahead , and some big ones i might add .By the way , i will compare this with the Yamato 20199 , so if you didn’t watch that i suggest that you won’t read this .First of all i have to say this season had some plot holes that could've been avoided , spoilers incoming .In the end Teresa could've just teleported Kodai near Zorder and killed him there and...she wouldn't had to die . Yamamoto could've ejected not salute Kodai like a idiot and Saito would've lived if he didn't go Guns Blazing ...For some reason i find anime this old influenced by cartoons of the same age , you will see what i am talking about if you will watch Yamato 2199 and after that this as a second season , and no , i am not talking about the animation , sound , voice acting and so on , from my point of view this lacked the anime feeling that nowadays shows have .The biggest dissapointment was character interactions , in the first season ( Yamato 2199 ) when Yuki ‘ died ‘ our protagonist was devastated in the least , he acted , if you can say that , like a normal anime character , but when Shima ‘ died ‘ in the second season he was trembling for a few seconds after that he had nothing , but why would he , it was just his best friend that just died , he was a minor character like that Arakome guy ( Rookie ) after all .And that’s not all it felt like there was some kind of distance between characters , they acted like robots or maybe that’s what I was seeing .If we get passed this point there is still something that bothered me , the plot holes that I talked about earlier . There were a lot of chances to avoid stupid battles and stupid deaths , but for some reason the author wanted some of the crew to die just to get things more emotional , I for one don’t find that a good idea , some of you might think that I watched to much Bleach where characters refuse to die , but meaningless death is retarded , even in anime .Ok , now that I said what I didn’t liked about this , let me say what I liked about this show .Lets start with the story , a generic one , like the first season they take Yamato and go to a lady that summoned them for a reason that will be told after a few episodes . Personally I don’t dislike this kind of story , even if it was used a hundred times at least , but saving the Earth from bad aliens never gets old .Animation is good if you think 30 years in the past , as some other reviewer said the animation was top notch then by those standards and I have to agree with him/her .The OST is just perfect for this anime , better said it wouldn’t fit for any other show except this . The opening song is something very catchy and I found myself listening to it almost every eps , talk about weird , the music when Yamato was in danger or when it was almost certain of victory fit like a glove . But what could’ve they done better was the sound of the engines of the ships and those lasers , damn that sounded like someone scratched the blackboard .I think I said enough of the characters , if I will add some more someone might trace my IP and wait for me at nearest corner with a bat .For some closure I will say that this could’ve been done better , but still I found this rather enjoyable .My only wish is that this season and the third one will get a remaster version .Thanks for reading . she wouldn't had to die .

And that’s what they do, with how much the story is practically a rehash of the original, it seems strange to...me that rather than seeking out the mysterious woman because she holds something that they need in order to live, they just do it because, apparently, if some voice over the space-radio tells you that it needs help, then you have to help, even if it’s light years away. Additionally, I rather liked how Gamilus, the Space Nazis from last time, needed to take Earth in order to live themselves, which gives them a little bit more depth than Gatlantis, who are just plainly evil and conquer everything because that’s just what evil people do.If we actually look at the Yamato itself, it’s got some definite peculiarities, since you’d think that the Earth Defense Force would only make sure the very best are onboard, but the opposite seems to be true, you’ve got Kodai, Shima, Yuki, and Tokugawa, but everyone else seems to be complete muppets, it is a bit peculiar that, to give one example, the only doctor they could find to board the Yamato is perpetually drunk, but that is something I can perhaps dismiss since it’s being used for comic relief, what I can’t really overlook is Saito and the Space Marines under his command, who are about as well disciplined as the Chinese army in the 1890s, in other words, as undisciplined as conceivably possible, and Saito’s the worst of the lot, he should’ve been court-martialled after about 2 episodes, maybe if it was one incident I’d not make a big deal out of it, but for basically the whole season he just dosses about and compromises the rest of the Yamato, countless times, he gets to redeem himself exactly twice, but, point is, while not everyone has to be Duke Nukem (who should be here considering the existence of the EDF), it’s strange that the majority of the Yamato’s crewmen seem to be some of the most undesirable personnel imaginable. The size of the Yamato itself is a bit strange, since it looks about as large as the real Yamato (i.e. the size of an actual battleship), but it seems to have enough spare parts knocking about to repair it getting critically damaged any number of times, not to mention, the fact that at one point they said it had 3,000 Cosmo Tiger fighters, which is quite a fucking lot, and, more importantly than that, the presence of any fighters at all means that they turned the Yamato into a hermaphrodite battleship, what happened to death before dishonour?But, that doesn’t matter, the story’s more or less the same as the last one, and there are some peculiarities, but this is also about the IJN Yamato flying out of the ocean to fight Space Nazis, so it clearly isn’t too big of a deal, the point that really determines if it’s any good or not are the moment-to=moment setpieces, how the space voyages go, and they go very well, the combat is certainly good, and in many instances the Yamato’s ways of getting out of things are a lot more intelligent than I’ve come to expect from the sci-fi genre, and plenty is shown from the perspective of Gatlantis, who’ve now got Desler on their side, and while the strategies are perfectly good from both sides, they do give a very good look at how things are going internally, with various factions developing within who attempt to discredit or usurp the other for various reasons, which just adds another layer to things. In the very beginning when the EDF are of importance there’s some interesting bits about the problems inherent in leaving war in the hands of bureaucrats, but there’s also the fact having a CiC Saito would be a disaster, it displays a conflict of ideals that can’t be resolved, and it’d have been interesting if this was a central theme, but it never really comes up again.The animation is also far better than it previously was, it’s certainly got its issues, it’s obviously not quite up to modern standards, and sometimes the lip syncing isn’t actually in sync, and some movements will look a bit off, or a few other things here and then in that manner, but on the whole, it looks consistently good, and the action, the core of the series, holds up equally well, and the visuals of the Yamato and the various computers and radar systems are quite advanced, as well, all very well done.Overall, the second season of Space Battleship Yamato is a definite improvement over the first, it (effectively) tells the same story, but with a great improvement to the visuals, characters, and writing, and on the whole, this produces a considerably better experience, while it might not be perfect, it’s not bad in the slightest. me that rather than seeking out the mysterious woman because she holds something that they need in order to live, they just do it because, apparently, if some voice over the space-radio tells you that it needs help, then you have to help, even if it’s light years away.

In Season 2, we are introduced to a lot of different concepts. Wu Geng finally joins with the hidden gods tribe, a once prosperous village of gods that rejected the corrupt way of Tian. After getting repeatedly attacked, their numbers dwindle forcing Wu Geng to fight Shi Xing - a masochistic Great god of ferocious affiliation. Wu Geng is captured by Shi Xing and is sent to prison at Ghost City, a former flourishing desert City plagued by the High...Priestess due to Shi Xing's former affection with humans. It is at Ghost City where Wu Geng reunites with his Uncle Zi Yu to fight against Shi XIng on the night of the blood tribute. After defeating Shi Xing, Wu Geng and gang head to reunite with Bai Cai and the hidden gods tribe. Bai Cai meets an unexpected guest in the afterlife who helps her soul reunite with her body after protecting Wu Geng from Zhui Ri's lightning attribute attacks. The Dark ones, a warrior race that fled into the underworld one hundred thousand years ago by ancient gods join the fight and teach Bai Cai some attack and defense abilities. The climax of the season happens as Wu Geng finishes his qi cultivation on Phantom Island, an island that fauna and flora rely on qi to survive. The High Priestess and Tian Kui make an appearance to eradicate the remnants of the hidden gods tribe which gets sabotaged when the dark ones, a reawakened phoenix-fused Shi XIng and finally Wu Geng appear.Story: 3/10The story is vast and very entertaining yet the execution is very bad. Imagine watching almost 2 hours of fighting between Shi Xing and Wu Geng (and eventually Zi Yu) only to have Shi Xing come back as a good guy. The series loves to drag on fight scenes to the point where it's just bland colorful sword auras and monochrome filters. The fight scenes are still back and forth where Wu Geng is on the edge of death but somehow is rescued but still fights again until he's on the edge of death and he's saved by his enemy only to fight again and again. The fight scenes really like to test my patience. This happens again when Zhui Ri is tasked with killing Wu Geng but somehow lets him live because his unrequited love sacrifices her life to protect him, even going as far as to give up his life essence to revive her. Doesn't make any sense.Art & Sound: 5/10- No Comment -Character: 4/10Character development was probably ok. A lot happened in terms of characters being established, developed and removed in season 2. The reawakening of the phoenix and Shi Xing was pretty good and even introducing the dark ones to the remnants of fallen gods tribe. Also seeing the social hierarchy of gods at the end, when Tian is in slumber the High Priestess takes authority but when the High Priestess is incapacitated, the elders take authority. Even going as far as mobilizing what seems to be the royal guards/law enforcement of the gods. Apart from that, everything else is just there to establish the characters.Overall: 4/10I was excited for this but was let down because of dragged out fight scenes and terribly slow plot progression.

Tamako Market,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16417/Tamako_Market,"[""There's something about anime which allows us to derive entertainment from the mundane events of an ordinary person. Coincidentally, ordinary is the best way to describe Tamako Market.Starring the young lady Tamako and a flamboyant talking bird, Tamako Market is yet another anime that attempts to cash in on the slice of life phenomenon. It is not an anime that prospers through the strength of its plot, setting, or themes, but instead subsists through the cuteness of its characters. Should we criticize an anime for not going beyond that? Maybe not. But there is certainly a problem when such a simple anime still falls...short of its potential.Tamako Market's biggest weakness is regrettably its characterization. Each characters has about the same depth as wrapping paper, as none of them even once prove to be more than their established archetype. Tamako is merely your ordinary, dense heroine (think Chitanda with pigtails) who is no more memorable than any other generic slice-of-life lead. There is little to make her stand out aside from the fact that she is cute and naive. Even when the story shows small signs of her developing as a character, it will simply fall back on her denseness in order to prevent any growth. The result is not pleasant. You cannot have a character-driven slice-of-life anime told through the perspective of a weak character. It does not work. Though one might think: if not the protagonist, the rest of the cast may be better, right?Not here, it seems. For nearly all of the side characters are a superfluous addition to an already large cast. The biggest offenders are Tamako's school friends: Midori, Kanna, and Shiori. They do not serve any purpose but to quickly provide a sense of friendship in Tamako's daily life. While there are a couple of episodes that focus on these characters and attempt to give them personality, once the next episode starts, the show will treat it as if nothing even happened. This is especially an issue in the case of Shiori, where an entire episode is spent introducing her to Tamako's group of friends— yet afterwards she is not seen for almost the entire story. What was the point? You could remove these characters from the show and nothing would change.Tamako's childhood friend, Mochizou, is yet another victim to the weak characterization. His character design at least carries some degree of promise, but the lack of screen time compounded with his unfortunate role as a plot device do not do him any favors. There are a few heartwarming scenes between him and Tamako, such as when they talk at night through a string telephone, but the overall execution of this romance is invariably poor. It is entirely composed of Mochizou woefully attempting to convey his feelings to no avail, with Tamako conveniently being blind to Mochizou's evident feelings. In many ways, their relationship is reminiscent of the cliches from harem anime. To be fair, this isn't a story that focuses on its romance. But can one forgive what could easily have been so much more?The show's mascot, Dera, will either amuse or infuriate you. Considering that he has more screentime than any other character in the story, this can potentially destroy any entertainment value that the show might otherwise hold for the viewer. There are a few witty moments here and there, but most often he is simply detracting from time that could have been better spent developing the human characters. While you may hate him, the one thing that can be said in his favor is that he creates personality within the show: he is anything but a bland character. Whether you lean towards hatred or endearment, Dera will leave some lasting impression on you by the end of the story. Hopefully a positive one.On a more positive note is Tamako's younger sister, Anko. She does not receive much screentime in comparison to Tamako or Dera, but what little she receives is written considerably well. Her two episodes focus on the innocent crush that she has towards a classmate, and the way in which the anime conveys this is surprisingly subtle. Anko does not outright state her feelings, but through her body language they are made very clear to the viewer. As well as being sickeningly adorable, Anko is surprisingly the most believable character in the show. Too bad she is treated as irrelevant in all but two episodes.Aside from the characters and romance, there are small problems within the story itself. Most notably is during the last few episodes. After an abrupt twist at the end of the 10th episode, the show immediately tries to rush in some semblance of a story at which it fails quite miserably. Not only does this undermine the slice-of-life aspect of the previous episodes, but the writing is marred by contrivances such as when the Prince somehow travels (or is it 'teleports'?) from a distant country to appear at the most convenient time possible.

I am not sure that KyoAni knew what kind of anime they wanted to make with Tamako Market.While the content of the show feels uninspired, at least there is some charm in the presentation. There's an interesting contrast between the mundane activities of the shopping district and the unique carnival aesthetic they are presented in.

The fundamentals are intact, and while there are still signs of potential waiting to be realized, this is an anime that will probably leave you with a bitter feeling of emptiness once it is over. One would think that after KyoAni's success with K-ON, they would understand what is needed to create a quality slice-of-life anime. Apparently not. Perhaps KyoAni should stick to animating existing material from this point on.Tamako Market may not be a bad anime. But it is certainly a lacking one. short of its potential.Tamako Market's biggest weakness is regrettably its characterization. Each characters has about the same depth as wrapping paper, as none of them even once prove to be more than their established archetype. Tamako is merely your ordinary, dense heroine (think Chitanda with pigtails) who is no more memorable than any other generic slice-of-life lead. There is little to make her stand out aside from the fact that she is cute and naive. Even when the story shows small signs of her developing as a character, it will simply fall back on her denseness in order to prevent any growth. The result is not pleasant. You cannot have a character-driven slice-of-life anime told through the perspective of a weak character. It does not work. Though one might think: if not the protagonist, the rest of the cast may be better, right?Not here, it seems. For nearly all of the side characters are a superfluous addition to an already large cast. The biggest offenders are Tamako's school friends: Midori, Kanna, and Shiori. They do not serve any purpose but to quickly provide a sense of friendship in Tamako's daily life. While there are a couple of episodes that focus on these characters and attempt to give them personality, once the next episode starts, the show will treat it as if nothing even happened. This is especially an issue in the case of Shiori, where an entire episode is spent introducing her to Tamako's group of friends— yet afterwards she is not seen for almost the entire story. What was the point? You could remove these characters from the show and nothing would change.Tamako's childhood friend, Mochizou, is yet another victim to the weak characterization. His character design at least carries some degree of promise, but the lack of screen time compounded with his unfortunate role as a plot device do not do him any favors. There are a few heartwarming scenes between him and Tamako, such as when they talk at night through a string telephone, but the overall execution of this romance is invariably poor. It is entirely composed of Mochizou woefully attempting to convey his feelings to no avail, with Tamako conveniently being blind to Mochizou's evident feelings. In many ways, their relationship is reminiscent of the cliches from harem anime. To be fair, this isn't a story that focuses on its romance. But can one forgive what could easily have been so much more?The show's mascot, Dera, will either amuse or infuriate you. Considering that he has more screentime than any other character in the story, this can potentially destroy any entertainment value that the show might otherwise hold for the viewer. There are a few witty moments here and there, but most often he is simply detracting from time that could have been better spent developing the human characters. While you may hate him, the one thing that can be said in his favor is that he creates personality within the show: he is anything but a bland character. Whether you lean towards hatred or endearment, Dera will leave some lasting impression on you by the end of the story. Hopefully a positive one.On a more positive note is Tamako's younger sister, Anko. She does not receive much screentime in comparison to Tamako or Dera, but what little she receives is written considerably well. Her two episodes focus on the innocent crush that she has towards a classmate, and the way in which the anime conveys this is surprisingly subtle. Anko does not outright state her feelings, but through her body language they are made very clear to the viewer. As well as being sickeningly adorable, Anko is surprisingly the most believable character in the show. Too bad she is treated as irrelevant in all but two episodes.Aside from the characters and romance, there are small problems within the story itself. Most notably is during the last few episodes. After an abrupt twist at the end of the 10th episode, the show immediately tries to rush in some semblance of a story at which it fails quite miserably. Not only does this undermine the slice-of-life aspect of the previous episodes, but the writing is marred by contrivances such as when the Prince somehow travels (or is it 'teleports'?) from a distant country to appear at the most convenient time possible.

But it is certainly a lacking one."", '(NOTE: This review is written for general anime fans and assumes no familiarity with other series. If you dislike moe, I still think this series is worth watching, for reasons I will discuss below. After episode 5, I decided to bump up the rating to an 8.)Kyoto Animation is very well known for their cute character designs and on the whole, Tamako Market seems like it was a consummate effort on their part. It\'s not new and it\'s not original, but it seems like it was created very easily and with great refinement and polish.So what is this series about? Not a lot, if...I\'m going to be honest. Tamako is the daughter of a mochi (a kind of Japanese rice cake) maker and the episodes seem to revolve around what kind of new mochi she makes for each different occasion. There\'s a certain educational appeal in this.Tamako Market also focuses on the bonds Tamako has with her friends and family. It captures the feeling of living in a small yet close-knit community. People from all walks of life populate this town and they all interact with each other in simple yet heartwarming ways. This series is a slice of life in the purest sense of the word.The most praiseworthy aspect of the anime is the cozy atmosphere it manages to create. It\'s as if nothing bad will ever happen in this town. It\'s definitely escapist - but in a different way from most anime. The world of Tamako Market is one where you want to escape to and live in because it\'s so simple and innocent. If the world was just a little bit more like the one in Tamako Market, it would be a much better place. That\'s the appeal in these sorts of shows.In addition, KyoAni seems to have crafted their ultimate cute girl in our heroine Tamako; she is nice, polite and liked by just about everyone in the series. Though she is not a particularly quirky or memorable character (besides being totally dense when it comes to romance - I pity her love interest), her traits are very balanced and she has an air of genuine sweetness that\'s impossible to dislike.I do not think Tamako Market is ""moe pandering"". That is an unfair slight against the anime. Yes, the girls are cute, but so is everyone else in the series, even the old men. One particularly charming episode focused on Tamako\'s FATHER of all people. If anything, this series is targeted for general audiences and has a family friendly feel. It is not an otaku series and it is not trying to be one. I am neither a moe fan nor a moe hater so I would prefer to look at this series through the merits of its STORYTELLING.The problem I detect with this series isn\'t so much in the content so far but in people\'s expectations of it. I believe the first episode was not a strong indicator of what the series is about. The first episode was high on energy and comedy, mostly through the slight supernatural aspect of the show. A talking bird is the main comic relief mascot of the show and this character featured prominently in the opening episode.But Tamako Market isn\'t really a screwball comedy, even if it does have a quirky sense of humour. It is really a laid-back sort of anime that takes its time to develop the various characters and let the mood sink in. While the premise of the bird character\'s subplot reappears in the second half of the series, his main role in the series is for a bit of laughs and to support the character development. The few subplots and promises of development lead to nothing in the end, and while it\'s not necessarily a bad thing to see a story that isn\'t so focused on a tight storyline, Tamako Market feels particularly light and frothy, all the more so because what plot it manages to build up is deemed irrelevant by the end.Tamako Market sets itself up to be one thing and turns out to be something else. I do consider this to be a flaw in the writing. Even slice of life fans should take note that the dialogue isn\'t particularly witty and the charm comes across as somewhat calculated. As I said before, it\'s not moe pandering, but there\'s a certain ""been there, done that"" aspect to a few of the more emotional scenes - most likely because seasoned anime fans may have already seen them done in previous KyoAni shows, or just in anime in general. That doesn\'t stop this series from being good at what it does, but there is a distinct feeling that it could have been stronger. Some episodes do drag in their pacing.Still, it\'s a nice slice of life show, very clean and perfectly harmless, even though it doesn\'t do anything new with the genre. Do give it a shot.

Do give it a shot.', ""Do you like MOE? Are you a fan of Kyoto Animation's other works? Do you enjoy watching cute girls doing cute things? Do you like a talking bird running his narcissistic mouth 24/7 about his superiority and the world around him? Well, if any of those registers a response of “yes”, then this series might be somewhat of an interest for you.Tamako Market is a new original series from Kyoto Animation. The series is directed by Naoko Yamada with the studio known for their other works such as Clannad, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, Hyouka, and K-On! The series is a standalone title with no...other adaptations from any sources of LN/Manga as of known. Now, I admit, this series is a quite something especially in the 'kawaii' department. But beyond that, I'm not sure if Tamako Market lives up to the hype and humor that I originally thought it had.Well, the series lacks a direct story but takes on a more slice of life style of things in more of the fun way. Take for example, we got that bird named Dera “Tori” Mochimazzi (if that even its real name). He claims himself as being “noble” with a sharp tongue and often talks in an aristocratic pattern. He also seems to be dense of the real world and how it functions. For instance, he takes the girls' actions of colliding into his face as a way of “declaring their devotion” towards him. In reality, this is obviously not the case but only a case of allergy. It happens quite often too and Dera being the silly bird that he is takes everything in the way his culture taught him to be.As for most of the other characters, the series presents them in the usual cute way, the Kyoto Animation way. There's Tamako Kitashirakawa who stars as the main protagonist of the series. She is a first year student in high school who is enjoying the time of her life. Despite her denseness especially to those in her life, she is very hardworking and strives to help out her family the best way she can. In fact, she is easily able to make friends at school and even at earned the affections (or maybe I should assume here to be accidental fondness) of Dera. Tamako is the main star of the series and hell, even some girls got the hots for her.Among some of her friends includes her childhood friend Midori, Kanna (a member of the Baton club), as well as the cool girl Shiori. Oh and let's not forget the guy friend, Mochizō Ōji. It is hinted throughout the series that he has a thing for Tamako but who are we kidding here, it's Tamako after all and she gives 'dense' a whole new meaning. In fact, there is even a sort of “love triangle”. Unfortunately, it is quite weak and blend that most viewers will not be able to notice it much. Even so though, the characters all have different personalities as well as what they hope to be in the future. They just seem to be too simple and not enough depth. Given the premise of the show and its genres, it's not too surprising in the case of Tamako Market.On the other hand, the adults of this show (besides Tamako's cool dad) seems to be more in the background. In this show, the kids are the stars and the adults are the ones on the other horizon.As mentioned before, this show is rather plot less and lacks any if at all, strong development. In other words, don't go into this series with some sort of strong story because the way it's being handled. However, there are some little things that are amusing to reference to if a viewer pays more careful attention. Most of Tamako's family members' names are related to mochi as well as having meanings. For example, Dela Mochimazzi hates to eat mochi. His last name reflects on the 'mochi is terrible' taste in which he dislikes the taste of mochi. Tamako is also born on New Years Eve which just happens to be the busiest time of the year so her birthday is often forgotten. Well, at least it's better than February 29.The series' episodes typically spotlights a certain event in Tamako's daily life as well as spotlighting some of the other characters (including that bird Dela). Even Tamako's little moe sister Anko gets her own episode when she demands to be called “An!” Shiori had her moments during her own spotlight as she made an impression for Tamako and her friends. Now, they are the best of friends. I won't get to that bird Dera since he tries to steal the show (like he did with the first episode) every week. I do find him quite annoying though as his mouth never seems to stop talking about his ethnics and culture.At many stances, I find this series to be cute. We have the Tin-to-Phone talk as a little theme to bring back some childhood nostologia. I mean, ask yourself, when was the last time you talked to someone with a tin can? Nowadays, we got cell phones, androids, and whatever else you watch your anime on. But going back to the old school of using old fashioned tin cans is just something so nostologic. Not only that, it is cute. Among other things, there is a sense of innocence especially with Tamako. Those headbands on her hair and the way she displays her postures in the OP song are all part of this. In fact, Tamako is one of those girls that you can't help but want to be friends with. For Anko's case, her seemingly crush on a fellow classmate turned out to be someone else that most of the cast did not see coming. It's one of those instances where innocence kicks in again and we can't help but smile for Anko; or maybe, I should call her 'An' as she wants to be called.Despite all cutesy moments and fun, the series does have some dramatic moments and even a somewhat antagonist of the series. This is reflected in the face of Kanna Makino when she has some plans of her own against Midori. Otherwise, some of the drama involving Anko and her classmates are occasionally a pleasant watch.Unfortunately, this show does not escape the typical beach episode. Although not for fan service reasons (I think?), there is a beach episode where the main characters relax and have fun in the sun. It's been done by Kyoto Animation in the past before and here we are again. Otherwise, the series' blend storyline does not make up for its other attributes. Also, that damn bird named Dela tries to steal the show every single episode. He's almost everywhere whether it's on Tamako's head, at the beach, the mochi shop, or at school. He tries to be the star of the series but more often or not, he stays as the comic relief. This is reflected in his personality and the way he behaves himself where the only attention he gets is seemingly what he least expected. He claims to be some kind of aristocratic prince but let's face reality here folks, he is just a flat bird with not even an ounce of hunting skills considering the place he is freeloading in. Talk about being worthless, just like the 'plot'.In terms of visuals, Kyoto Animation does it again. The series has very rich scenery and displays fantastic features of the characters' expressions. The luscious backgrounds along with its strong balance of artistry sets this series as a top tier in the art department. More so though, Tamako Market gives more of a realistic feeling of what is being like in the show. There's the beach, the mochi shop, the neighborhood, and school. It works out right and along with the character designs, we can clearly see that Kyoto Animation is behind this. I mean, just take a close look at Tamako's face. Aren't you CURIOUS about what mystery series' female protagonist that Kyoto Animation worked on previously from where she resembles from?For soundtrack, I would say that the ED song is quite catchy. It is playable on repeat and seems like an orchestra that is crafted with a fast rhythm and catching pace. Most of the soundtrack is composed of that lighthearted tone with some added fun choirs in between. The voice actors did an okay job to reflect their tone style although there's a certain character in the series that seems to display some gender confusion. More noticeably though, Tamako's dad displays some musical skills of his own and a few of the background music later on seems to be based off of famous works.Overall, I think this series gets a '6'. If I was judging it based on cuteness, I would score it something like a 15/10. However, the weak story and seemingly lack of character development makes it less convincing against some other titles from Kyoto Animation's works. That bird by the name of Dera (again, is this even his real name?) is quite annoying and gets repetitive to watch. I do admit though that the series is quite cute and brings a smile to my face whenever I watch it. This time around, I'm not sure if Tamako Market is really that good.

Well, it definitely is kawaii."", 'Before watching Tamako Market, I had to prepare myself. I mean cold showers, a critical state of mind stemmed by delirium, and eating a cup of ramen filled with enough hot sauce to burn my tonsils off. Distraction from the cuteness is key—because the cuteness is paramount. It springs up in all corners, in every moe smile, in every darned bit of music, in every bright color. Beneath a tactful disguise of a thousand hues of pink, a conniving truth festers. If you let your guard down you will never see it.I’m here to tell you the truth. And the truth is that Tamako Market...is any moe-lover’s dream—on the outside, at least. In case I haven’t mentioned this already, everything is cute. In fact, the cuteness is played up to such a level that all you see, all you notice, is cute. The animation is bright and bubbly and perfectly moe; it fits an anime of this caliber and deserves praise for setting the stage. The voice acting and music will not disappoint. On the outside, Tamako Market is glorious and if one is content with this then good enough for them. But for those of us who begin to question the cuteness, for those of us who find that the cuteness isn’t enough to stop critical analysis, a deeper look is in order. For the sake of this review, I will break through Tamako Market’s façade. There are few layers beneath. Actually, it’s painfully simple, even more so than some other slice of life anime out there.Despite the bubbly aura that the animation and music emanates, Tamako Market feels uninspired and, weirdly enough, even bland. This isn’t because it’s a slice of life anime. In fact, anime of this genre often have an inexplicably entertaining quality despite the commonplace happenings. Where other similar anime stand strong, fortified by character chemistry and those signature quirky events, Tamako Market can’t seem to establish itself. Everything is there to create another wonderful edition to the world of moe—right? Actually, no. The deeper parts of moe and slice of life, the parts that leave a good anime fan satisfied, are not merely looks but what’s on the inside. It’s just like the question of best girl. She may have to be cute, but there are a lot of cute girls and when it comes down to it, her heart matters more.For anime, the heart is something known as plot and characterization.Tamako Market starts off pretty well, introducing us to the cool and friendly place where Tamako lives and Dera, a pompous bird that she just happens to encounter. The story basically revolves around Tamako’s daily life with this bird, her friends, and mochi. The one thing that Tamako Market tells us consistently is that mochi is great, mochi is good, and mochi is life. Otherwise, everything is loosely about friendship, family, and some sort of plot revolving around Dera that comes in when it wants to, only to be remembered when convenient and then sloppily handled at the end. For some, the amount of moe cuteness is enough; getting absorbed in it is fine for them. But the reason why all you see is cuteness and the reason why there’s so much of it is because there isn’t anything else. The best thing that Tamako Market could do was play that up, and it definitely did that. However, those of us looking for something deeper will only be content in watching this anime (though that does not mean they won’t enjoy the ride) instead of absorbing all that it has to offer. Tamako and her friends are the only thing that would make this anime remotely interesting—and that fact doesn’t fare well for it.The dialogue is bland, the jokes are bland (and barely noticed), the crushes are bland (and very badly handled), and the characters (especially the ones with the most screen time) are bland. The latter is the reason why the former is bland. The characters that had promise on episode one bore you by episode twelve because they’re exactly the same. The archetypes that you were introduced to don’t have any deeper facts, quirky characteristics, or new emotions to show you that twelve episodes have passed. Where many slice of life anime keep you interested with facts or entertaining life stories or at least a deeper kind of characterization, Tamako Market doesn’t stretch its legs. All of them are insipidly themselves—Tamako is forever cute and naïve, Kanna is forever unusual, Midori is forever bubbly-ish. In fact, perhaps unsurprisingly, but definitely unfortunately, the most interesting and promising characters are the ones with the least amount of screen time.The reason why Tamako Market fails to inspire praise is because it doesn’t handle itself well. Though another (not implausible) reason is that perhaps it thinks it doesn’t need to, so long as there’s cuteness. Many will agree with that and many anime veterans will not.Look in each corner, my friends. In one, we have cuteness, the appealing shell. In the other, we have a gray, murky goop, the unappetizing innards. The question of which one will win can only be answered by you, the viewer. is any moe-lover’s dream—on the outside, at least. In case I haven’t mentioned this already, everything is cute. In fact, the cuteness is played up to such a level that all you see, all you notice, is cute. The animation is bright and bubbly and perfectly moe; it fits an anime of this caliber and deserves praise for setting the stage. The voice acting and music will not disappoint. On the outside, Tamako Market is glorious and if one is content with this then good enough for them. But for those of us who begin to question the cuteness, for those of us who find that the cuteness isn’t enough to stop critical analysis, a deeper look is in order. For the sake of this review, I will break through Tamako Market’s façade. There are few layers beneath. Actually, it’s painfully simple, even more so than some other slice of life anime out there.Despite the bubbly aura that the animation and music emanates, Tamako Market feels uninspired and, weirdly enough, even bland. This isn’t because it’s a slice of life anime. In fact, anime of this genre often have an inexplicably entertaining quality despite the commonplace happenings. Where other similar anime stand strong, fortified by character chemistry and those signature quirky events, Tamako Market can’t seem to establish itself. Everything is there to create another wonderful edition to the world of moe—right? Actually, no.

Before you watch Tamako Market, you should read this review.It\'s obviously that specific genres of anime are often intensely focused on a certain genders and age groups, including a female protagonist with her friends. In fact, KyoAni giving many adorable scene to made the fans adore their cuteness. There\'s one alternative different anime, had same producers like K-ON!. ( Kyo Ani. Why.)  This story is mostly apparent when one considers the slice of life and comedy category.This all seem to have several things in common - cute characters, adorable face, a funny face,...""cute"" costume changes then.. a fat bird APPEARS!

You\'ve lost your muchness.” - Alice in Wonderland.Not that I\'m a fan of that series, nor that I even know the story (please don\'t shoot me), but this perfectly describes studio Kyoto in a ball. They\'ve been famous for making various key adaptions such as Clannad and Kanon, and other series being described as far as controversial like Haruhi. But lately, they\'ve been said that the rising hill is sloping downwards now, and Tamako Market contributes to more evidence for that hill, with less and less \'muchness\'. That hill consists of weaker attention for the story, and with...more delicious amount of budget and moe to sprinkle the... fillings, not just the topping. That\'s right, it\'s the infamous ""style over substance"" type, and Tamako Market went exactly in that route. It\'d be really nice to have a good balance of substance, but that doesn\'t mean we should completely ignore the style either, and it\'s styles like in Tamako Market that are actually pretty rare.Hence why I used Alice in Wonderland for quoting.\'Tamako Market\' means a market full of Tamakos. Just kidding, but please stop laughing at my hilarious well-made joke which was carefully crafted in three whole seconds. It does take place in a market though, and a rather lively one at that. There\'s several mochi shops rivaling each other, and a high school girl named \'Tamako\' is part of the shops. She looooves mochi, and makes \'em for the market who has the happiest atmosphere going around. Also talking bird appears and strange love triangles occur, whilst the mochi shops does the most epic contests against one another, rivaling themselves out with their wild mochi-cooking skills to the point of exhaustion and hardships.Okay, I lied, there\'s no real cooking rivalry. There\'s talking birds though.As a complete, shocking surprise, it\'s about nothing, or at least for the majority of the time. However, the way it structures itself gives both an avoid alert and a treat for those for can bear the first few episodes. My initial first response to the first three episodes were that they were ""boring as a wall"", as well as ""stupid as a talking bir- oh wait"". Nothing happens, and it seems a little pretentious with a smiley face to try and keep me engaged with a talking bird hitting on girls. It\'s only after I finally picked up the series again when it was nearing its end on airing, where the episodes after three actually became a little more than entertaining. It\'s ironic because, for those of you who follow the three episode rule, you\'d be only watching the lowest of the TM episodes.The structure follows a episodic layout, and it\'s not surprising as it\'s a slice of life. They\'re purely episodic to the core though, as they each contain stories of both main and side characters, dealing with simple problems and affection towards different people and such. This kind of layout already sets you up with the characters in front of you, and since the story doesn\'t follow a linear line, not much changes or developments grow much, if it has any at all. With that said, it allows you to familiarize yourself with the happy market, and as you get more into the market\'s pace, you\'d find it gets much more enjoyable and natural with different kinds of stories later on.That said, it can go the opposite effect if you\'re not fond with the market itself. If you feel the urge to burn those flowers in the shop, that fat talking bird who didn\'t save the show, those puffy mochi-like cheeks on Tamako and those puffy mochis themselves, then feel free to get up and leave to collect your fire, as you\'re not going to like the show at all. Don\'t burn Kanna\'s hammer though, Kanna\'s the best in the show. How dare you.But I\'d be a little surprise for anyone to hate the atmosphere of the anime, particularly the market. I find the atmosphere to be a little more... magical. Which is a little bit of a surprise myself, since I don\'t tend to find this sort of lovely, bouncy atmosphere in anime often now. The show presents itself in a more musical-play fashion rather than a relaxing one. Things play out like a fantasy musical, if there\'s anything else to describe it best; the lovely, light soundtrack fleshes the musical style out quite a bit, as some scenes feel as though it\'s actually a music video. Things flow like flipping through a happy and merrily written book, sometimes ending in a fashion where a message warps up the episode as if it actually ends a good night sleep. It\'s a lovely atmosphere, and gives a tingly sensation of joy inside... though, it takes a bit of time until it really gets into you (at least after episode 3 for me).Oh, did I ever tell you there was actually a story in the show?Dera, the bird who I just called \'the bird\' for a while now, actually comes to the country for a specific reason. That background of the story stays behind the shadows for the majority of the show though, so the reasoning for him lurking in the market isn\'t because he tried to make a \'moe slice of life about nothing\' show more interesting, but for a future reason to be revealed later on. The storyline of the whole situation with Dera isn\'t so surprising though, and in fact it\'s fairly simple to get your head around without the need of developments or plot twists. It\'s ever so simple writing, with a vague climax that doesn\'t really make up for the entire series, so if you\'re expecting your wow meter to be of the chart, don\'t be.That and the fact the actual story is literally behind the shadows doesn\'t keep any sort of substance following, since it\'s pretty much hidden in the entire series. There\'s not even a sense of mystery either; the market\'s being too busy smiling so much that a fat bird that can talk is something that should be subjected upon, since even scientists can\'t find birds in the world who can freaking talk, let alone a noble perverted one. The point though is that it\'s a super simple story which doesn\'t get put on subject until the few last episodes of the show, and so the rest of the episodes is just about character stories in the market, as said earlier. There\'s no linear story to follow; only those in the market.Let\'s talk about the lovely dovely production values for now, and take a break of the main cake of the show. What do you expect from Kyoto Animation then? In comparison to ChuChu and Hyouka, the budget doesn\'t go as astounding as those two. It\'s more comparable to the likes of K-On!! though, as they are done by the same sub-team as each other. The animation is very fluent with its movement, making them extremely fun to watch and building up a good amount of gif files in your folders. The main girls are in the baton club too; what\'s more fun than looking at cute girls throwing and spinning batons around in the hall? Also, there\'s quite a blob of moe in the anime, though it\'s not focused upon as much as people state it is. If you are allergic to moe and get itchy spots down there, you can stay away from this, but I honestly don\'t see how or why it\'s a big problem for the show.The OST is ever so musically lovely. I wish the OST is already out, but it seems like it only goes as far as the character songs for download. Anyway, the soundtrack provides the magical atmosphere even further, and fits the entire show almost perfectly, as said earlier. The opening contributes to the magic musical style too, though not so much of the ED as that\'s more of a J-Pop serious song. It\'s not much of a problem, since it\'s musically very well-done, and it\'s a must-have to get the full version of. Sound effects and directing is consistently good, and the OST is used wonderfully, fitting from a cute AMV to a mini musical narration play thingymajigy, as described earlier. Voice acting is great too, and Dera\'s voice gives of the royalty feel of his being quite well. Well... mostly royalty.But umm... about Dera....Some say he\'s the life saver of the anime, whilst others state he\'s a big, fat thing wasting precious screen time for the anime. In theory, he\'s only set in the market because of plot (oh how convenient!), right? But, as said three main paragraphs ago, the actual story is bored behind the shadows, so Dera\'s not actually needed 9 tenths of the time. His personality is of a king\'s noble servant, yet he\'s not aware that all his \'charm\' are not actually capturing any of the girls\' hearts at all. Even mochi proves him as a clown, turning him bloated and heavy. He\'s in the show listed as a main character, but it\'s in fact that he only proves to be a comedic clown character who can in fact be super annoying to some and praise-worthy to others.Whether or not he saves the entire show is an entirely different question. Without him, Tamako Market would be a normal slice of life about mochis, lesbians and magical happy atmosphere floating around. It can only prove Dera as a little bit of a plot device to bring the ""plot"" to the market, but even without him the effects of being bored as a brick in the first few episodes would be the same. His existence is very polarizing in opinions because of his strange noble personality, with a sense of weird affection birds shouldn\'t even have towards girls, and sometimes he just kills moments by narrating with a somewhat cheesy voice. That said, if you really hate to see him, he\'s hardly the center of attention in the majority of the time, so be glad or be sad; either way, this talking bird isn\'t going to leave his mochi behind you\'d still have to deal with him in the show.Aside the case of the talking bird though, there\'s a whole cast of other characters too. You got the group of girls being Tamako\'s friends (Tamako being the main character, if you haven\'t noticed), who are blond Midori, glasses Shiori and the best character in the entire show, Kanna. Her ruler and hammer wins me over, and so she proves best award for Tamako Market person. The market has a ton of people living there; a flowerist whose gender is unknown, other mochi makers and shop keepers plus the families, the friendly elderly people, dancing old man, newly bird couple, little kids and so on. It\'s quite a colourful bunch, and the entire cast brings the happy and lively atmosphere in the area, so lively that it\'s a little unnatural to be in, but nevertheless fun. Several of the characters get a decent amount of screen time, but not much can be said about the developments. They\'re pretty interesting and likable in their own right, especially having the center of attention in some of the episodes (though Kanna doesn\'t weep weep...). The cast is a fun bunch, in conclusion, but even with some background and attention, development doesn\'t really grow upon nearly all of them (except Dera, funny enough).Tamako Market can be regarded as another moe creation from Kyoto, and with even more style and less substance than before. Popularity sure got them ""muchier"", but now their muchness has shrunk over the years to the point where great things wave bye-bye to their opportunities of potential (talking about that one Key VN which got rejected because Kyoto was \'too busy\'... forever cry weep weep...). That all said, Tamako Market wasn\'t as bad of a ride than I thought it\'d be, but stating that the story is extremely unique and well-written is worth face-palming.I wonder what Kyoto\'s going to do in the future then. And should I look forward to it? more delicious amount of budget and moe to sprinkle the... fillings, not just the topping. That\'s right, it\'s the infamous ""style over substance"" type, and Tamako Market went exactly in that route.

And should I look forward to it?', ""This time KyoAni surprised me with stuff and things. THINGS.There has been quite a lot of criticism about how Tamako Market is nothing but a slice of life moe silliness. I, however, spotted quite a few things which I think should come to the knowledge of others in case not everyone notices THINGS.Tamako Market has a strong position taking message about moe and cuteness in generally. It's rather simple, actually. Tamako Market is an anime about nothing. Tamako Market is cute. And thus nothing =is= cute. Self-irony much? I think this is pretty much a big deal considering that majority (read;all) KyoAni shows are...considered cute. Also moe = mochi over everything. Deep and lots of THINGS.The other thing that has been bugging so many is this series is the originality. Talking pimp bird who is secretly a video projector? Nigga whose ass looks like a peach? Has been done before? I don't thinks so. Eva didn't do it. Logh tried but failed. In my eyes it is very original, and peach-like.There sureasfuckinghell was no inbetween. The animation in this series was reversally made. Pretty sure majority has seen some crazy-ass amount of .gif's about cute girls doing cute THINGS and whatnot. Tamako Market often looks like a collection of those. The characters are jumping and teleporting all over the screen without any sense, making the series look like a .gif slide show.The voice acting, themes and bgm are all quite fitting to the series. Though, I still don't know if that one blond who likes flowers is really female because she(?) really sounds like a dude. Trapsome pick there I guess.This series made me feel kinda happy and smile and STUFF. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to see something good and amazing because this is neither, but I think anyone who wants to see something light without overwhelming amount of moe and melodrama could enjoy this STUFF. considered cute. Also moe = mochi over everything. Deep and lots of THINGS.The other thing that has been bugging so many is this series is the originality. Talking pimp bird who is secretly a video projector? Nigga whose ass looks like a peach? Has been done before? I don't thinks so. Eva didn't do it. Logh tried but failed. In my eyes it is very original, and peach-like.There sureasfuckinghell was no inbetween. The animation in this series was reversally made. Pretty sure majority has seen some crazy-ass amount of .gif's about cute girls doing cute THINGS and whatnot. Tamako Market often looks like a collection of those. The characters are jumping and teleporting all over the screen without any sense, making the series look like a .gif slide show.The voice acting, themes and bgm are all quite fitting to the series. Though, I still don't know if that one blond who likes flowers is really female because she(?) really sounds like a dude. Trapsome pick there I guess.This series made me feel kinda happy and smile and STUFF. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to see something good and amazing because this is neither, but I think anyone who wants to see something light without overwhelming amount of moe and melodrama could enjoy this STUFF."", 'Tamako Market may be derived from the same recipe as KyoAni\'s other SOL anime, but its taste is a little off.As always, my reviews are spoiler free.Kyoto Animation, the makers of the wildly successful Haruhi and K-On! series, realized something a few months after K-On! finished airing.  Cute girls doing cute things (afterwards CGDCT; call it ""moe"" if you want to, that\'s another argument entirely) really sells.  The following seasons, and to the day that this review is being written, there have been dozens of series that tried to ride the CGDCT wave all the way to the bank.  Most have tried...to stand out from the crowd by adding a unique flavor, but in the end it\'s obvious that they are just trying to scrape up a little more of K-On!\'s success.  Most have faded into obscurity, but one that is just trying to keep its head above water is Tamako Market.Chief among the culprits of these ""copies"" are KyoAni themselves; aside from K-On!! (more ! means more seasons), they released a continuous string of SOL/CGDCT (or CBoysDCT in Free!\'s case) with Kyoukai no Kanata being the only break in sight.  Among these was Tamako Market, the subject of review today.Story - 4/10To begin, here is the short and simple premise:  Tamako is a high school girl whose family runs a mochi shop.  One day she meets a talking bird from a faraway island who is in search of a bride for his prince.Let\'s put the premise aside for a moment though.SOL anime are very difficult to approach in the story category.  Rather than a near-objectively good story (such as Steins;Gate) or near-objectively poor story (such as Skelter Heaven), a SOL story has a ""feel"" to it.  A personal favorite of mine is the Aria series, giving an overarching sense of serenity as the characters go about their lives in a beautiful setting.  Even when restricted to high school life, as so many SOLs are, one can find much better ""feelings,"" such as Azumanga Daioh or Hyouka.  Each has their own unique charm or interesting characters that draw the viewer in.  The problem with Tamako Market is that it doesn\'t have charm or interesting characters.The charm that it tried to present was a combination of the talking bird, Dera, and some manor of suppressed romantic subplot around Tamako.  Neither one is anywhere close to interesting enough to save the biggest problem in the series: the characters.Animation - 7/10KyoAni is not one to slack on the animation budget.  All of their recent works are above average in the animation and art department, especially Hyouka.  However, compared with each recently animated series, Tamako Market gives off a ""good enough"" feeling.  Those backgrounds are ""good enough.""  Those side character designs were ""good enough.""  That fluidity was ""good enough.""  It\'s hard to fool a KyoAni fan when they see what the studio is capable of with releases such as Disappearance and Hyouka.  Even the previous season\'s Chuunibyou was leagues ahead.Overall, the series is below average effort from a far above average studio, but it looks as good or better than most comparable series.Sound - 7/10The backing tracks were good and upbeat. The OP was catchy and fun.  However, the real thing I want to mention here are the voice actors and actresses.  This series used many brand new seiyuu, and they did a great job.  They need to get more roles.This was well above the standard of most similar series, but still not up to the bar of K-On! or Hyouka.Character - 3/10This is where things really went wrong.  Let\'s do a roll call...The main cast:-Tamako, the world\'s densest girl who is always smiling and optimistic to a near-creepy degree.  She loves nothing in the world more than mochi, which is probably why she can never notice the obvious advances of her friends Mochizou and Midori.  She has no other features at all.-Kanna, who is as poker-faced as Tamako is smiley.  She does not appear to have emotions or react to many stimuli.  She is just a token friend.-Midori, the closet lesbian.  She shows obvious romantic interest throughout the series that Tamako never notices.  Other than being token friend #2, she tries to ""protect"" Tamako from the romantic advances of others, as if she needs more protection than her denseness.-Dera, the stuck up bird comic relief.  He will be very polarizing, with some viewers loving his aloof humor and others hoping Dera hunting season will soon open in Japan.  He also has a video-phone feature.-Choi, the bride hunting brown girl.  She arrives in Japan from a small island kingdom, coming after Dera.  She is often harsh for no reason, especially to Dera, as she is his handler.  She can use him in some sort of divination ritual.  She believes Tamako may the bride for her island\'s prince.-Mochizou, who likes Tamako too.  He is from the mochi shop right across the street (capitalism ho!).  He constantly tries to confess to Tamako, but it is like trying to explain your love to a rock.The supporting cast consists of many characters who are mainly family members or store owners.  They all serve their sole purpose to populate the world or fill a space in the story.If you think I am summarizing character personalities, I\'m not.  I have written full biographies for each of them.  They are incredibly boring.Enjoyment - 3/10I did not enjoy Tamako Market because of the boring setting and the ""feeling"" I talked about earlier.  I\'ve seen hundreds of similar shows, and Tamako Market falls right into the ""average"" category.  The only reason it hasn\'t been forgotten like other K-On! chasers like A-Channel is that it was made by the same studio.Other ThoughtsKyoAni is one of my favorite studios, but I think they really dropped the ball on this one.There are many, many better CGDCT/SOL shows that you could watch.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.  Take a look at K-ON!, Aria, Hyouka, Chuunibyou, Tamayura, Haruhi, Yuru Yuri, Azumanga Daioh or any other of the dozens of better series of this nature. to stand out from the crowd by adding a unique flavor, but in the end it\'s obvious that they are just trying to scrape up a little more of K-On!\'s success.

Needless to say I wasn\'t going to be able to stay away from a Kyoto Animation produced show from many of the people who brought us the last of those forever. K-On! was a fun, lovable, funny, sweet anime with a set of characters who could be described in equal terms. I expected similar things from Tamako Market and to an extent that is what I received, though the packaging was quite a bit different that I was expecting.Most...of the shows I name dropped above had a certain formula. They focus on four-five high school students, mostly girls, trading elliptical comic dialogs, doing cute things and engaging in some manner of mischief or silliness. It\'s a working formula; one that allows a show to easily entertain while keeping the focus tight so the characters can be developed. Tamako market has a set of four cute and somewhat quirky high school girls, but they\'re not actually where the focus is at all. The focus quite fittingly enough is on one girl, Tamako, and the market where she lives and works. Oh, and some weird talking bird too.This is kind of an odd approach. It takes away from the humor potential some. It gives the show a lot of work to do, more than it can possibly hope to do or even try to do with twelve episodes. It\'s unusual, especially if the goal was to repeat the success of K-On!. I can\'t actually see this show doing that as a result. However, for what it is, Tamako Market just oozes a lot of charm. It\'s an easy series to like.Part of that is that KyoAni have made another great looking anime. It doesn\'t have as much great visual flourish as they brought to Nichijou, mind you, but this show doesn\'t really need all that. It\'s a fairly understated series, and the animators do a good job of setting just the right tone. Character designs are distinctive and attractive yet generally believable. On the sound end, most of the actors do a pretty good job and music is well utilized at points. The OP and ED are both rather charming and cute, though a little less memorable than KyoAni\'s best themes.Most of the plot to Tamako Market is tied to its characters, and they are an interesting cast. The main character, Tamako herself, is an odd main character. She\'s rather ordinary. Somewhat dense and excitable, but put her next to someone like Yui from K-On and she\'s downright understated. She\'s a hardworking, cheerful, bright-eyed girl and that\'s really all there is to her. I could see this same character being a well-liked minor supporting character in practically any other anime. I think that\'s likely the point though; she\'s universal, she\'s believable and she\'s easy to like, both by the viewer and the characters. She doesn\'t develop noticeably as a character all too much through the show, but it\'s clear she touches the other characters in certain ways.Tamako has two romantic interests, not that she seems very aware of either of their advances. One is Mochizou, the son of the shop which is rival to her family\'s shop. The other is Midori, Tamako\'s best friend from childhood who is beginning to realize her feelings for Tamako are deeper than normal friendship. It\'s an interesting setup, but nothing ever really come of it. Mochizou isn\'t developed much beyond just being a likable and good natured everyman. Midori\'s feelings are conveyed effectively and believably without dwelling on them excessively, but are never really confronted directly. More could have been done with these two, but as it is any potential dramatic tension there is ignored.Rounding out the school girl set with Tamako and Midori are Kanna and Shiori. Kanna is the one of the bunch who probably could actually fit in a more K-On! type show; she\'s hilarious and a bit of an oddball and is delightful whenever she\'s around. Shiori is the shy one who at first seems cold; while cute and having a good design, she gets a bit lost in the shuffle after her episode and ends up being a character without much place in the story.Then there\'s Tamako\'s family and the shopping district. The family is pretty well done. Tamako\'s younger sister is a very believable child character with her own little arc. Tamako\'s father also ends up being a very well developed and likable character, who seems to grow through the story more than a lot of characters. The other shop keepers in the market don\'t get much time individually to be developed, but the designs are good and the warm, familiar way they\'re constantly being portrayed makes them quite likable as well.Then there\'s the bird. I\'m not entirely sure what to make of Dera. He\'s an odd character, and one that steals the focus a lot. He\'s perhaps supposed to be the source of most of the comedy in the series, and in that capacity he does have his moments, particularly when he and Kanna interact. He is a character who it\'s easy to get too much of though, and at times it does seem like the show would be better if he was shoved away somewhere for a while. Of course he\'s also the instigator of the overarching ""plot"" of Tamako Market for what it is, but not much comes of that save another fairly fun and cute character, Choi, being brought to the show for the second half.The cast is very likable on a whole and there are spots of good character development. The show just seems unable to get to everything it should, and for that it suffers some. However, while KyoAni doesn\'t have another masterpiece on their hands, they do have what I\'d still call a very good anime. It has a few flaws and could have just generally used more episodes to do more with its setup and characters, but Tamako Market remains a quite enjoyable offering all the same. of the shows I name dropped above had a certain formula.

The shallow story never really allowed me to feel a connection with any of the characters, but was sure to tell us that mochi is, in fact, quite delicious, and something about the power of friendship and family. Special attention to Japanese culture is also given, through the introduction of foreigners who, despite having perfect (and never explained) Japanese language ability, are completely oblivious to aspects of life in Japan.Character design is by Yukiko Horiguchi of Lucky Star and K-On! fame -- in fact, the characters look almost...identical to those from K-On!, with the main character Tamako appearing deceptively like K-On's Mio with twin tails. And indeed, this is yet another installment of cute girls doing cute things. However, unlike K-On!, Tamako Market lacks any of the charm of similar shows, and is only memorable for a handful of things: an obnoxious talking bird who apparently is trying to be the second coming of Casanova, a beautiful florist voiced by Daisuke Ono, and -- oh yes, not least of all -- mochi and more mochi. It's mildly amusing, but don't expect too much.Most of the character voices are bland, with a few exceptions, and the opening theme is utterly forgettable or even slightly annoying. In contrast to the dull sound, however, the artwork is beautiful -- one of the few redeeming aspects of this series.I can't say I hated Tamako Market. It's pretty, occasionally funny, and depicts idealised life in a small shopping district with a bit of surrealism thrown in. But it felt like a lot of time to spend watching something that never managed to rise above mediocre. identical to those from K-On!, with the main character Tamako appearing deceptively like K-On's Mio with twin tails.

I don\'t exactly remember what made me start this, but I loved it near instantly. I\'m actually really disappointed that this wonderful anime is over, and I very much would love a second season. Yes, TM\'s cute. Does it have no story? Is it pointless? To answer those questions it\'d be a heck no! It has it\'s both sad and heartwarming scenes, and more.TM\'s story is simple; a girl, Tamako, works at a mochi shop with her father, sister, and grandfather. Across the street is a rival mochi shop and home of a boy, Mochizou, who\'s interested...in the oblivious Tamako. The story is of Tamako\'s life in both the shop, a bit of her school life, along with her two good friends. In the midst of all this, a strange talking bird appears to Tamako, and tells her he is here to find a bride for his prince. There\'s a decent amount of humor included. Another fact is that my younger cousins who are definitely NOT into moe, who play FPS and strategy games all the time, ENJOY this anime. TM is a simple, but heartwarming and sweet one story. If you\'re like me, it\'s able to give you feels. Happy emotions, bittersweet emotions, sad ones... this anime is able to pack many feelings into one.The art of this show is of course by KyoAni, so it should seem familiar. The animation is fluid, the colors are bright, warm, and cold; it\'s high quality. However, anatomy-wise, it might be a little bit less accurate than K-ON!, especially with all of the characters\' legs, and this applies to 99% of everyone. The female characters\' hands are really small and inconsistent, and at times are either too small, other times, they\'re actually correctly drawn. It\'s not too big of an issue, though. Expressions are well-done, and lively. All in all, the animation is pretty great.Both the opening and ending for Tamako Market are amazing. The colorful, upbeat op is a lively tune. The song matched the op sequence very well. The ending, stunning, and very catchy to boot. I find it stuck in my head, often... the seiyu for Tamako sings both of these, and she is a pretty good vocalist! The voice acting for TM is great- the cast\'s voices match very well. Even the bgm\'s great- matching, quirky, catchy songs. Love the music for TM.Characters of this show, I find unique and lovable. Tamako is just darling and it\'s hard to not love her. Her friends are also unique, and have nice quirks to them. I adore both Tamako and Kanna, her brown-haired, measurement enthusiast friend. The shopping district residents are colorful, and they\'re all depicted very, very warmly, and are all individuals of their own right. We can\'t forget Dera, the characteristic bird who comes to visit. Also a lovable ""character"" indeed.I thoroughly enjoy Tamako Market, even when I thought I wouldn\'t. It\'s one of the most promising series for this season for me, so you can imagine how much I like it. Every time a new episode arrives, I get really excited and smiles appear on my face no matter how down I feel. A great anime to go to if you\'re not feeling very happy, or you\'re down in the dumps.Overall, you should watch this anime if you don\'t mind lightheartedness and slice of life. This anime is the one I very eagerly wait to see every week this entire season. It\'s a warm and sweet story, so please enjoy! in the oblivious Tamako.

It\'s a warm and sweet story, so please enjoy!', ""It’s shit.★☆☆☆I began this show back in November 2014—and I’m still trying to finish it… even though it’s only 12 episodes. I’m in the middle of episode 12, but I can’t bring myself to finish it. I don’t care anymore. I don’t care about you, Tamako, or your friends or whatever mundane crap you’re doing. And that’s the problem, isn’t it? There’s nothing to care about.Tamako Market is about a cute girl (Tamako) that works in a mochi shop. She has cute friends, she has a cute sister, and she lives in a quaint neighborhood market. She goes to school, she talks with a guy...that has a crush on her, and she has a talking bird.By the way, the talking bird has more screen time than any of those little dipshits in the show. He’s flamboyant and has some passion. His dialogue is decently interesting. He’s probably the best character because everybody else is bland moeblob.Slice-of-life is not a bad genre. No genre is unless you’re doing “Magical Girl Sports Military Harem Fighting Furry Adventures.” I’m gonna throw out this original, patented thought and say King of the Hill is one of the best animate slice-of-lives out there. I’ll even put in those Nickelodeon cartoons like Hey Arnold!.Why? Because every episode gives you something to care about. It has plot and character development. The most basic definition of SOL is anything episodic without a main story, but it still needs to follow the rules of good writing. Every season of King of the Hill is Hank selling propane (and propane accessories), Peggy being a bitch, and Bobby being a little shit. Hey Arnold! is Arnold solving everybody’s problems whether they want him to or not. In Tamako Market, there are no conflicts for me to care about. Nothing. That's why Tamako Market is so boring, and took me 6 months to get through.So does this garbage have any redeeming value? Well, it looks fantastic as do all KyoAni shows. The animation is colorful and bubbly. The characters are cute. It always puts me in the mood for mochi.But what went wrong? It’s the sheer lack of anything to care about. The characters are actually decent. It’s just that without any conflict there’s nothing about them to root for. The closest thing that resembled a conflict was one of Tamako’s friends couldn’t come up with a dance routine for school and she spent the episode hiding it.

Another painfully boring slice-of-life."", ""Everyone knows what to expect from Tamako Market even before it aired. Kyoto Animation's on a roll and churning out the cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime ever since K-ON became a smashing success and that their moéblobs literally oozes money. Plus, Tamako Market is an original; meaning they had free reign to stuff moé into the show in any way and every way possible.So is it a cheap strategy that banks on a recycled stereotype? Shockingly, not at all. The gargantuan budget allowed superb production quality and a fair amount of creativity as well; the moéblob of the season, Tamako, proved that there still could be something new...for this archetype. She's bubbly, but not clumsy. She's energetic, but not loud. She's mellow, but not air-headed. She's friendly, but not insensitive. She could have carried the whole show by herself.Not that she has to. There's also the ridiculous obese talking bird of royal heritage, which is half of what made the show so funny. There's also the friendliness and homeliness of the shopping arcade, Tamako's quirky friends, the childhood friend that has a crush on her, and the tsundere dad. I ended most episodes knowing that nothing important has actually happened, but those factors made sure I never had a boring time.And while endings has always been a weakness of these plot-less titles, Tamako Market has managed to end things on a surprisingly enjoyable high note. If I had to complain about something, it would be that their pinafore-styled uniform made then look like elementary students. Maybe that's actually the intention?Once again, KyoAni delivered. Damn it, man. They're setting the bar too high for me to enjoy the other stuff. Giving something like this a full score makes me look stupid, man, but even if I try, I can't see it deserves any lower. for this archetype. She's bubbly, but not clumsy.

"", ""The winter 2013 anime season brought to us many good anime series, a great starter for the year and as always KyoAni has delivered something that I really enjoyed. Nothing special, just something that helps delivers one’s moods to spring. (I will try not to spoil too much)Tamako market is a simple slice-of-life story about a Tamako Kitashirakawa, a high school girl in a small town, who’s the daughter of a mocchi (Japanese rice cake) maker in a shopping district. The show allows us to have a view of her and people in the community, their personality and lifestyle, with a small twist...  the...Talking Bird, Dera Mocchimazui; who enters the community accidentally while searching for a bride for his prince, in a tropical kingdom far away.The whole series seems to represent the ideal small town life in Japan, with an extremely close knit community that could be considered one big family and the simple happiness of their seemingly bland, mundane life.  From New Years to summer festivals, it shows us to how they handle their lives and new situations and problems, mainly with the introduction of Dera.The series has little plot, but staying true to real slice-of-life, I think that this is befitting of the series. The series is mostly a series of short stories about the things that happen in the community surrounding Tamako’s family and friends, from school to trips to different events that takes places. While there is a underlying plot involving Dera’s original mission, I personally think that this was just used in order to be used to bring the series to a more conclusive ending, though I think that it didn’t make it any more conclusive then it can be.The thing that made is series for me is the atmosphere that the characters and community produced. They’re personality and mood makes you feel warm and happy as they live on their simple lives in a small neighbourhood. Individually the characters are somewhat stereotypical and not well developed, but as a whole they produced a welcoming and lovely atmosphere for the viewers.The characters also come with a wide variety, allowing them to have a more vibrant feel. From the various shop owners in the area to Tamako’s friends, to the newcomers in the block, Dera and later his boss, Choi, each of them have their own quirks and personality that helps to build the feel of the story. The main character, Tamako; is a first-year high school girl who is described by Dera as “head with nothing but hair and mocchi” is the sweetheart of the district and is loved by her friends and family. She loves the shopping district and said that she will never leave and her carefree and loving attitudes made her a joy to watch as she felt natural, for me anyway as she lives out her life in the community, having fun and feeding Dera mocchi.The most interesting character in the show is by far Dera, who was added as a supernatural element to the show and also as a comedic mascot. A flamboyant talking bird’s whose name is like a taboo in the Kitashirakawa household as Mocchimazui means “mochi is bad”, despite becoming a stuffed bird due to mochi, so stuffed in fact that he couldn’t continue on with his journey and decided to stay in the area. Dera acted as a sort of catalyst that allows us to explore the lives of the community as he follows Tamako around engages with people in the community. His personality is a bit obnoxious and narcissistic but acts as a comedic joke to lighten the mood.There is also Tamako’s family, whose members added little stories to the series, from her father, who was found to have written a song for Tamako’s deceased mother to confess to her while he was young, a song which from the beginning of the series Tamako was trying to find. Then there is her sister, “An”ko; who had her own little section where she dealt with her crush and came to term with her own feelings.Her friend’s also had a lot of time on screen, from Kanna, daughter of a carpenter who was the series’ joker, always having weird lines in a monotonous voice, to Shiori, a shy girl who as the series progressed made friends with Tamako. Then there is Mocchizou and Midori, the former being Tamako’s childhood friend from across the street who has a deep crush (despite the fact that their fathers are competitors) on her but always fell short of confessing, even so that he took advice from Dera…..The latter is one of Tamako’s closest friends who seem to be very protective of her from others, especially Mocchizou, who she considers as somewhat of a rival.There are also various members of the shopping district, each of them vibrant and sweet in their own way. They all love district and is often seen as Tamako and Dera often goes shopping and helps around in the area.There were also a few melodramatic moments in the series, but these serve as nothing more than a simple representation of those bad moments in your lives, where you have friends and family to support you, even if the problem is not that big and you may have made it too hard on yourself.The music of the series also helped to contribute to the wonderful atmosphere; it made the whole show more lively and natural to me, especially the OP and for some reason the whole thing made me feel like the show was set in the 70s or 80s.Overall, the series is a simple and sweet show, and if you want a conclusive storyline then I don’t think that this is for you as it’s just supposed to be a view into the somewhat normal life of a certain group of people and that's what I love about it, being simple and being yourself. As Dera described the town: “Even in days that seem to chill you to the bone, but despite that, you always feel warm right here”. I would describe this series as sitting in the cool spring wind with a cup of tea and eating sweets(maybe mocchi, but I’m not Japanese), nothing extraordinary, nothing great, but just simple warm joy that satisfies your soul.Thanks for listening to my rants, I don’t like to give number scores but if I had to, u can see it above ,No?Btw, can somebody pls explain to me wat moe is, till today I can’t understand it???

I had just come off of watching, and loving both Hyouka and Clannad, and was expecting another spectacular series in a similar vein to those two. Of course, that's not at all what I got.Being directed by Naoko Yamada, written by Reiko Yoshida, and character designs provided by Yukiko Horiguchi (all of who worked in the same positions on K-ON!) this series has quite a lot of similarity with said series. However, I was unaware of this fact before I started the show, so maybe my expectations were...slightly unreasonable.However, there's a lot to talk about in Tamako Market, so let's get on to the review.Story (7/10): Tamako Market doesn't really have much of a story. The series is almost a textbook example of a slice-of-life series. The show follows the main character Tamako who is a carefree, bouncy energetic girl who absolutely loves mochi. She has a friend named Mochizuo who, like Tamako, is the child of a mochi making family. She also has a few friends from school who pop into the story, but I'll explain about them in the characters section. In essence, one day a talking bird name Dela Mochimazzi wreaks havoc when he jumps into the shopping market, saying he's looking for a bride for his prince, and the story follows their daily, mostly episodic lives.The story doesn't really have much weight, but the individual episodes range from enjoyable to boring. I was really put off by the first episode when the bird came off as more annoying than funny, but I'd say the writers of the show got better at using him as the show went on. The series bills itself as a comedy, and in that regard, its a hit and miss. While the slice of life stories were somewhat enjoyable, I would have preferred an actual story. Which was why I was surprised when in the second half of the show, it did try to give us an actual story. When the series decided to go down this route, I was really excited, hoping for a very interesting finale.Instead, I got a very lackluster ending with a forced, and very anti-climatic resolution. Sad as it is, the ending almost ruined the show for me, as this was the part of the series I was looking forward to the most. None of the character drama was really resolved, and I felt the ending just could have been done SO much better. Overall though, I found the story fun to watch, and I was really waiting during the second half to see how the ending would play out.Art (9/10): Easily the best part of the series. While the character designs are simple enough, and are all too familiar to K-ON!, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The animation is of very high quality, and really helps to sweep the viewer away into this simple, yet relaxing world the vast amount of colorful characters in the shopping district live in. The backgrounds are simple, yet really help to bring out the best in the character design and animation brought to the series.Sound (7/10): The music definitely isn't spectacular, but it does fit the show. The opening theme is really catchy, while the ending theme is very forgettable. The BGM fits very well in the series, and the shining moments for the music is truly when they played with the comedic timing. I know, a rather skimpy entry, but that's all there really is to say about the music. Fitting, yet mostly forgettable. The voice acting is really well done though, and I found especially fitting of the characters, especially the bird's voice (which always cracked me up.)Character (8/10): If there is one thing Tamako Market is not, its being a character driven series. Most of the characters are given broad character types, and don't show much depth. I was annoyed by this through most of the series, but eventually came to realize that the characters are still very fun in their own right. In addition, they did start to flirt with character depth in the second half of the series, with Tamako having a partial emotional breakdown, Dela actually showing himself as more than just a bossy bird, and even the dad shows some depth. Regardless, none of this is fleshed out, and as someone who absolutely loved the characters in Hyouka and Clannad, this disappointed me.However, that doesn't mean the characters aren't a lot of fun. Tamako is bouncy, a bit of an airhead, yet as with the other girls in this show, really cute, and reminds me of Chitanda from Hyouka in a good way. Her friend Midori was an interesting concept, and I was really hoping they'd give some resolution to her possible feelings for Tamako. Dela started out as EXTREMELY annoying, but actually became a really funny character as the show went on. Tamako's friend Kanna gets some laughs to, even if she doesn't have much character, and so does Tamako and Mochizuo's fathers, who are both really funny characters as soon as they first appear. Mochizuo himself is a rather large stereotype with zero depth, but still has his own charm as being the childhood potential love interest.One character is a surprise character who doesn't appear until the second half of the show, so I won't spoil it for you, but this character easily became one of my favorites. Overall, I thought this diverse cast of characters may lack much depth, but were still a lot of fun to watch on screen.Enjoyment (7/10): Because of the mass disappointment of the ending, I had to drop this down to a 7. Regardless, I did find a lot to enjoy in the series. The atmosphere is so calm and peaceful, you fall in love with it almost immediately. The characters are a little wacky, but that's partially where they get their charm from. Everything in this series is peaceful, and rather mundane, even when considering the second half of the series, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. I just would have preferred more deep characters, and a story with more weight.While my favorite part of the series was definitely just staring at the gorgeous artwork, it wasn't just the art itself that ended up giving the series a boost, but it really did bring the characters and the setting to life. All of the designs are simplistic, yet gorgeous, and its almost exactly how you'd envision such a setting in your imagination. However, with all its bells and whistles, the series' ending was still disappointing, and I definitely would have liked more character development and an actual story.The comedy, meanwhile, like I said earlier, is hit and miss. Some of the jokes were really funny, while others were irritating and a bit annoying. However, I did feel the comedy helped bring out the characters, and the jokes were funny enough to give the series a breath of fresh air in order to get me through some really boring episodes.Overall (7.5/10): If you could give .5s on this website, that's definitely what I'd give this series. While the ending was very disappointing, the characters didn't have much depth, and the art was a bit simplistic, the characters were still hilarious, and very fun to watch, the artwork and animation was gorgeous, and the comedy aspect of the series was really funny when it hit a stride.While I definitely wouldn't recommend this series to those who only enjoy a series if it has a deep story, riveting characters and or lots of action, for those who are willing to get swept away in this calm, peaceful, sometimes hilarious story with its simple setting, and quirky, funny characters, this series is probably worth a watch, even if its just to relax from watching said heavy action,plot, character development series. slightly unreasonable.However, there's a lot to talk about in Tamako Market, so let's get on to the review.Story (7/10): Tamako Market doesn't really have much of a story.

Which Tamako Love Story serves as a sequel, I may be late by 6 years ;-; and by hearing the news of the Arson Fire. But I'd like to spread my opinion for old times sake. And sorry for a quantity of mistakes.ARTWhat did you expect from KyoAni's art? KyoAni mainly focuses on Character Design and this was made in 2013, still shocked. The eyes were spot on and the hair's were really good. The color combination...of the characters were really well done. I couldn't really suggest anything besides being really good.STORYThe story is more about the comedy than romance, though sometimes Dera was really annoying to me. It was really unique, and it wasn't based on anything which is really well done. Naoko Yamada you bish deserve more fame. This is really a shojo-lover's dream. Giggles and entertainment I love it.SOUNDThe opening was really lively and cute, when he high fived Mochizou it was freakin CUTTTEEEE.

Tamako Market gives us a pretty accurate answer, all within a year of foreign visitors coming to ""bride-search"" for a new princess, keeping up friendships at school and boosting the spirits (and sales!) of the local market. Although the story seems quite simple (since it is catered towards a younger audience) and the protagonist is a little towards the shallow edge, I still enjoyed Tamako Market because of the impact of its simplicity and the light-hearted feeling of watching the daily lives of the...characters play out. It\'s one of those series that literally lets you step into the local life and see the characters for who they are whilst maintaining the positive vibe of the overall anime.We enter the world of Tamako Market when a royal bird named Dera, who is looking for a bride for his foreign prince, gets stuck in Tamako\'s house by mistakenly believing that Tamako was in love with him (actually he just wants to stay for the mochi haha). The ensuing story is fairly simple in that it explores different situations involving Tamako, her friends and her family (and the rest of the local market) within the backdrop of Dera ""trying"" (he really doesn\'t try at all, it\'s just an excuse to stay) to find a bride for his prince. In terms of storyline, it is a pretty standard slice-of-life style anime with episodes about making friends, falling in love, hosting a haunted house and dancing at a cultural festival. But these episodes are still unique in the way they explore the characters, it\'s a lot more about the characters than the content of the episode.In terms of characters, the story revolves around Tamako, who is a charismatic, but slightly dense, young girl who absolutely loves mochi. Surprisingly Tamako\'s character can become a little exhausting from an overload of positivity coupled with naivety, but since this series is admittedly geared towards younger girls, the slightly over-optimistic personality can be forgiven. What kept me interested was not just Tamako, but the rest of the characters and their individual troubles: how Anko (her sister) has a secret crush on her friend, how Mochizu (her neighbour) is trying so hard to confess to Tamako, how Tamako\'s father consolidates his feelings about the past and how Tamako\'s school friends (who are very different from Tamako) fit together as a group. Then there\'s the overarching interactions with the local community - I found it heartwarming to see the solidarity of the people in the markets and their support for Tamako and her family. All these character issues might sound childish due to their simplicity, but even where the character stories are simple, it actually makes it easier to appreciate the theme underlying the episode.This art is very fitting for that ""kawaii"" kind of feel and there\'s no denying that the opening theme is one of my favourites: the song, Tamako jumping down from the sky and the dancing markets make me so happy!To wrap up, Tamako Market is a sweet anime (literally because of the mochi overload), and I would recommend watching it if you\'re looking for something simple, but still meaningful and enjoyable. characters play out.

I dont know what to do with my life.Story: 7/10as many people say almost nothing happens in tamako market, but i don't really see it as a problem. The story still manages to being interesting and you get involved in the characters' quotidian life, it makes you wish you could live in their world and when episode 12 comes you feel empty and dead inside because you want to watch more. Fortunally there's gonna be a movie. Anyway the best thing in this anime is that it lifts your mood and at the same time it's capable...of dealing with deeper emotions, to be honest i shed a tear at the end. The pacing it's great and it's never boring, there are some freaking funny scenes and there's also a bit of romance which it's not treated in a cliché way. basically the story it's good but it's not great because it doesnt really have an ending and honestly, it should never end. i wanna watch it forever. the only flaw was the blushing i guess, wayyyy to muchArt: 9/10The art was the cutest i've ever seen in my whole life. The colors were pretty, the character designs were pretty, the bgs were pretty and it was animated really well, It all fits with the light style of the anime. kyoani did not disappoint this timeSound: 8/10The op/ed were pretty good, really catchy and they captured the soul of the anime. Most of the soundtrack was ok but what was really great were the songs played in the scenes at the bar, those were spectacular and it felt vintage.Characters: 10/10wow this review sucks cause im only praising the anime but it's not my fault tamako market's so good. It's the characters fault. Because this is one of the best casts of the last years. None of they main characters is flat, they all go throught some sort of developement, especially the main girl really surprised me near the end because she truly showed her personality. The best is without a doubt Dera the fat bird which is ridicolously funny. You get attached to everyone and you feel what they're going through. Really wonderful.Enjoyment: 10/10Obviously. I started watching this after two of the biggest disappointments(chuu2 and kyoukai) so i was expecting it to be shit but it isnt. It really isnt. I laught, i cried, im missing it already. So it's obviously a ten.Overall: 9/10I declare this the most underrated anime of the year GO WATCH IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOINGIf you don't like moe, this really shouldn't bother you because it has substance. of dealing with deeper emotions, to be honest i shed a tear at the end.

If you like cute girls doing cute things, you can\'t miss this show.I think this show gained a poor reputation on release for being a show about nothing, and to be frank, it\'s not wrong. If you\'re not a fan of CGDCT or slice of life, this one won\'t do anything for you. And for animation buffs, it doesn\'t have the long sakuga sequences of some of their other shows, and some may find the fluidity overall lacking compared to other KyoAni titles. But what makes this show great is exactly why those...issues don\'t matter. It\'s a work that\'s laser focused on one thing: being sweet.Being the only original series that KyoAni has done other than Free!, it really feels like they were allowed to be fresh and creative as they wanted to be, and they definitely delivered. The main cast all have a charming set of quirks that bounce off each other nicely.But what surprised me are the side characters. Being a show centered around a shopping district, the shop-owners have a lot of personality that you wouldn\'t usually see in side characters; my favorites are the androgynous florist (who is lovely nonetheless) and the jazz cafe owner who always has the right record for the situation.  While the backstories of these side characters are never expanded on, they really do their part in making this feel like a real world despite all of its exaggeration.And speaking of exaggeration, I have to talk about the colors. Tamako market is COLORFUL. Gone are the trio of blue-white-green-pink that a lot of slice of life anime employ. The background artists pop in colors from every end of the spectrum to make the shopping district come alive, and add all sorts of life detail in the background to sneak in bright accents. The backgrounds in this anime not only feel lived-in like most Kyo-Ani environments, but also feel alive.All of that visual goodness supports a story that is equally sweet, while having a lot of heart. ""Let\'s make a story where we don\'t depict any dark side,"" was what director Naoko Yamada was quoted as saying when beginning work on this series. All the drama (if it can even be called that) is resolved in the most wholesome way possible. Yes, the characters are simple, but they all have an earnestness that somehow grounds them, a kind of ""purified essence of the good we all strive for."" Even if I couldn\'t exactly relate to the characters, I was rooting for them the whole way through.As a result, there was a big, goofy smile plastered to my face the whole time I was watching the series. This is a show that sets out to do a very specific thing and succeeds magnificently at it. Frankly, I think the only people who wouldn\'t enjoy this show are those who don\'t know what they\'re getting into. If you\'re looking for something relaxing to get your spirits up again, put on some Tamako Market.p.s. I didn\'t hate the bird. I think he had a lot of character (supported by some lively animation) and added a whimsical element that supported the show\'s happy-go-luckiness. issues don\'t matter.

But I think this is one of the most underrated anime just going by the rating. Sure, it doesn’t aim to do much, and what little overarching plot development it had just fizzles out by the end. But that doesn’t make each episode less enjoyable.The plot is rather insubstantial in here, but that’s probably intentional. Other than the characters, each episode is not very connected to the next, and the only thing that carries across from episodes is Dera and his island friends. But even then it’s later revealed that it was all...a mistake, and the flowers from the flower shop only reminded Choi of the prince. However, within each episode there is always an entertaining mini story that is told, oftentimes focusing on a specific characteror event. Over all the plot doesn’t really take anything away from the rating, as this anime is not meant to be an epic saga, but rather your standard slice of life. It’s especially impressive how the show is able to take a concept so ordinary as an average girl’s life into a relatively entertaining experience.The characters, however, are great. Granted, most of the characters are relatively one-dimensional and by the end they reflect little development, but that doesn’t take away from the originality from them. Dera was by far my favorite, just because of how funny and over the top he was. Every other character has their own little quirks too, which is impressive considering the number of people involved. The only critique would be that some characters have the start of something greater, but are never fully resolved, such as Midori and Mochizo. Even Tamako’s dad I felt could use a little more back story with the mom.The art is definitely one of the selling points. All of the characters are drawn to be cute, and it works. The music sometimes stands out a little in some of the scenes, but overall I liked the sound of it.The enjoyment is where this show shines. Honestly, I wouldn’t recommend it to people who can’t get past the first few episodes, as it doesn’t really change that much from the beginning.

While looking at it from a more basic perspective, Tamako Market, too, belongs under the same theme but quite thankfully offers more to look towards that allow it to stand out from the rest. Though, even considering what it does offer, the real question arises.. Is it enough ?===Story===The story starts out basic enough and is quite easy to digest which works as a plus point for most situations....Now what stems from this is that the show remains easy to pickup, there\'s no intertwining plot or any such material which would considerably need one to wrap his/her head around. Not to mention that most of the start is pretty episodic thus strengthening the fact that it\'s easy to pick up at any given time. While it all sounds dandy, this also serves as a disadvantage as there\'s not really any major plot to consider, which might turn off some viewers. Though there are some story elements which eventually develop into something bigger, it still isn\'t exactly anything worthy of consideration as it ends up feeling like just another small scenario within a larger collection.===Art and Animation===Tamako Market delivers fairly well in this regard. The art style is very good, with a bright but soothing color pallet that fits with the theme very nicely. There\'s also some good attention to detail at points such as characters even showing stray hairs, just to name one such example. Movements are also very well animated which makes the characters look more expressive and puts more life into them. Thankfully, Kyoto Animation does always manage to deliver when it comes to visuals, and Tamako Market was no exception.===Sound===Taking into account, the soundtrack first, its a very fitting collection of different tunes. The soundtrack does well to compliment the nature of the show and fits well into the different scenarios that are presented to us. It\'s nothing I would call exceptional but is indeed a good match for the Anime in question.Now, if were to look towards the voice acting, I\'d say a very good job was done indeed. The characters would not have felt as lively as they did without the efforts of the voice actors, especially towards the main character, I could not help but feel that half of the reason for her cute and innocent flare was due to the voice acting. While I won\'t say that it was \'Realistic\', It was indeed very charming.===Characters===The characters introduced to us in the show are thankfully not the common stereotypes you\'d see in most shows, but they\'re not anything I\'d call \'Unique\' either. They are however, charming and cute in a more natural way than shown in most other shows within the same genre. While they did come out as charming and did well to provide an enjoyable experience, they were very much lacking in development. For almost the entirety of the show, we almost never really see any of the characters grow in any way, and while there were hints of some deeper backgrounds to some characters, they were never given enough time or the chance to be explored further.===Presentation===Even with its issues, the show does indeed provide an enjoyable experience. It has a nice atmosphere to it and does soothe you with its fun scenarios during times when you really don\'t feel like doing much. The execution and presentation of these scenarios is done well and did manage to get a chuckle or a smile out of me a few times. And even though the plot might seem linear, there are some moments which were somewhat heartwarming and sent out a feel of familiarity during cases some viewers might empathize with. The only bad point I would point out in this aspect is that most scenarios felt discarded due to the show\'s episodic nature and there were some story elements which needed more explanation but were never given that. Leaving viewers feeling somewhat void by the end.===Conclusion and Verdict===I will go by saying that this show isn\'t for everyone. It either requires people with certain tastes or a good amount of boredom to truly like this show. Even with that said, I would not call it a bad one as it does work as a good show to watch for a change of pace or during times you need something lighthearted and easy to pickup. Because of this, Tamako Market has managed to find a place for itself within the community despite being a pretty mediocre title altogether.

Shoutengai is essentially a region comprised of lines of shops selling daily necessities and other items to those living in the neighborhood. Every ethnic group in the world has had similar places emerge naturally, and not surprisingly, these have often served as centers for cultural activities. The anime is about Tamako, the eldest...daughter of a wagashi-ya (a shop selling traditional confectionaries), named Tamaya. We get to see the livelihoods of people living in the shoutengai, who are brought together by the charm and earnestness of Tamako. Of course, the story is focalized onto Tamako, her friends, and a talking bird - with whom, Tamako ends up meeting in the first episode and who also serves as an eloquent narrator cum observer in this anime.What does the anime have in store for you?Tamako Market is a slice of life anime and quite appropriately, it engages the viewer in various narratives that make the viewer feel a part of the livelihoods of people living in Usagiyama. Tamako, in particular, is a girl of a lovable and charming demeanor, that fits in well with her inherent simplicity. This makes her a natural sponge for love, for both the characters in the anime and the lucky viewer. Thus Tamako Market promises you a nice serving of ordinary happiness - neither too sweet nor laced with complications of romance - only whiffs of the same, here and there. Being a KyoAni production, pretty much each episode is a technical masterpiece! WATCH OUT for insanely realistic body movements and detailed facial expressions! Hats off to Yamada Naoko and Horiguchi Yukiko!Of course there's much more!Who is this not for?If you are looking for shoujo-esque romance. this is not for you. However, if you like romance a lot and also dig slice of life (you liked stuff like Hanasaku Iroha/Shirobako/Sakura Quest/Minami-ke/Sangatsu...) then do try watching it, after all, there's a follow-up movie - Tamako Love Story, which is a must-watch! If you consider yourself to be a viewer who is looking for plot developments in every episode, I'm not sure if you should watch this. With Tamako Market, you've got to be able to appreciate CHARACTER development and not PLOT development.I hope this helps you decide if you want to watch Tamako Market or not. Have a nice day! daughter of a wagashi-ya (a shop selling traditional confectionaries), named Tamaya.

If you consider yourself to be a viewer who is looking for plot developments in every episode, I'm not sure if you should watch this. With Tamako Market, you've got to be able to appreciate CHARACTER development and not PLOT development.I hope this helps you decide if you want to watch Tamako Market or not. Have a nice day!"", ""Tamako market was a pretty average slice of life series and not really an interesting one, I'll give credit that it's one of the few modern anime shows that isn't filled with tons of ecchi and can be watched by every age group with its' lighthearted quirks, but overall it was an underwhelming anime where the supporting characters don't have much screen-time and development and the ending was pretty weak. The talking bird was also rather annoying.The only reason I watched this anime is because it's awesome...animation and cute character designs. This anime reminds me of Hyouka (the main character's personalities and appearance are very similar).The character design is the same as Hyouka because it's being made by Kyoto Animation but I don't mind that at all.The music throughout the episodes are mostly really simple songs, that fit the situation. Except for in the coffeeshop, where the guy plays records and these always seem to help out the situation.The sounds and music are befitting for Tamako marketOverall Tamako Market is a light, easy-to-watch series.i recommen for you to watch it if you like to watch moeblob anime. animation and cute character designs.

I still need to check out some older KyoAni stuff, because their animation is fucking fantastic… but moving on; Tamako Market is kind of slice-of-life, kind of fantasy with a little wtf sprinkled on top (talking birds that can become projectors, what?). It follows the life of a mochi-maker’s daughter (Tamako) who is obsessed with mochi (if you don’t know what mochi is, it’s a pastry made from rice flour that has a gelatinous consistency and is often filled with different flavored pastes, red bean being one of the more popular flavors- I feel that...many western viewers may take “rice cake” to mean those crunchy things that people eat when they’re on diets and it’s totally different).As with all of the other KyoAni shows I’ve watched recently (Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai!, Hyouka) there is a romance, but no real… er, summation, I guess? Basically, you know one character really likes another character, but they’re too awkward to ever say anything about it out right. And it’s cute, but it’s also really tough on my heart! Still, I can’t get enough of it.The opening theme is super cute, “ドラマチックマーケットライド” (Dramatic Market Ride) by Aya Suzaki (Tamako’s voice actress).

In fact, it was considered as the KyoAni\'s worst flop since Munto, and haters of KyoAni were very active in dissing the series, which was actually among the most popular ones in a generally poor season.Unexpectedly, Director Yamada (K-On! series director) and her team made a truly successful comeback with Tamako Love Story movie in 2014, achieving satisfactory sales and receiving an art award. Seen from hindsight, as a combined franchise, Tamako...Market & Love Story is a very enjoyable watch. Tamako Love Story is a serious masterpiece and the highest reach of Japanimation of the 2010s as much as Shaft\'s Madoka Rebellion is. Tamako Market can be viewed as an etude or a prelude to the best work that KyoAni ever produced; there are advance hints and references here and there which adds great depth to the movie.I admit that Tamako Market was not very straightforward in telling a story and at times the KyoAni staffs were not very good at materializing ideas. The handling of the sub-story of finding the bride for the prince was too rushed with an abrupt ending while time was wasted in a mediocre haunted house episode which was irrelevant and out of place. Partly I blame this on some scriptwriters in certain episodes (particularly the one who screwed up also at writing a script for Red Data Girl of PA Works). It\'s a pity, as Yoshida Reiko was good as always and Hanada-sensei also showed his craftiness in handling slice-of-life.There were some memorable Episodes in the series, such as Midori (the blond girl) having difficulty with her own complex emotions towards Tamako in Episode 2, and Shiori (the badminton girl with glasses) overcoming her social anxiety disorder and befriending with Tamako in Episode 3. Kanna (the carpenter\'s daughter) was always the most eccentric but also perceptive throughout the series; she\'s my favorite supporting character who really shined in the later Tamako Love Story movie. Anko (Tamako\'s little sister) is one of the cutest girls ever drawn by KyoAni, and her love story in Episode 4 and 9 intertwined with the story of their deceased mother were the most successful in the TV series. Actually, the climax Episode 9 is one of the greatest episodes KyoAni has ever made, a true ""Kami-kai (God\'s Episode)"" (in Japanese slang), which laid solid foundation to the Love Story movie. In Episode 9 we see glimpse of how much impact the loss of mother must have had on Tamako and her family (although we see no painful scenes), and how much love and tenderness is hidden behind the usually stubborn Mamedai (Tamako\'s father). Mochizou (Tamako\'s friend living across the street) here is a guy with a heart of gold and assists Anko\'s love; he is rewarded in return by Tamako giving him a birthday cake (with Anko\'s reminder to her about his birthday).I believe the main shortcoming of the TV series was the lack of straightforward  catharsis. The death of mother, adoration of motherhood, love of the family and caring neighborhood is one of the penetrating themes but it\'s not shown straightforwardly. Showing the actual tragedy must have been deliberately avoided, but it could have given us a more deeper understanding of the character of Tamako (compare this with Episode 6 of Tari Tari produced by PA Works which did a great job in making the series memorable and heroine\'s character likable by revealing the heartbreaking story of the mother\'s death). The viewers were left until Tamako Love Story to fully understand the makings of Tamako\'s character. With Tamako Love Story, we get to see the bitter side of youth and ""look at life from both sides now"".Another shortcoming was the lack of good conclusion to the romance of Mochizou and Tamako and Midori (as well as Choi and the Prince), which left the viewers with the feeling that the series was somehow aborted and left incomplete. Haters hated it, and fans thought it needed to be finished off with a second series or an OVA. Practically no one expected that we\'ll be given instead a full new movie and that a love story between Mochizou and Tamako; practically no one expected it to become a modern classic ... but that\'s another story.

Now, Tamako Market is simple, but also effective. It's about the daily lives of the residents of a shopping district, focusing on Tamako, the daughter of a mochi shop owner.There's not much of an over-arcing storyline in the first half, but the latter part tells a good story with a few episodes. The more episodic episodes aren't bad, though, setting up for the end part where the story gets good.There's more emotion in Tamako Market than other anime in its genre, and this becomes more apparent in the aforementioned latter part of the story.The art is KyoAni, so...it's obviously fantastic. The character designs are very nice as well, and they are done by the same person as the designs in K-On! and Kokoro Connect. Not much else to say here.The OP is good fun to listen to at the start of every episode, and the ED is catchy and relaxing. The rest of the soundtrack is nice, with special mention going to the insert song of sorts, Koi no Uta. Seriously, the way it's used in the series is just perfect.Every character in Tamako Market is likeable - some are better than others (Kanna is best girl), but none are 'bad'. Everyone has a role in the series, and a vast majority of the more central cast get some great development. And there's even a woman who's voiced by a man (leading some people to believe they're a transvestite).I loved watching Tamako Market. It's a slice-of-life done right, and some of Kyoto Animation's best work. While there may be a lot of reviews that call it average, I believe that this anime is a 9/10. And if it doesn't appeal to you, well, that's that.Just remember: Everybody loves somebody. This will become important if you watch the movie, Tamako Love Story. it's obviously fantastic.

Depending if you enjoy watching cute girls do cute things, such as girls making a band buy spending 10 out of the 12 episodes eating cake and drinking tea then you will enjoy this anime alot.... you poor, poor soul you.Story: (3)Finding...an actual story in a show like this is pretty rare these days as anime that has the ever so popular ""moe"" aspect in them, basically kicks Story to the curb, I mean who needs a show with a story right. Tamako is a young girl who loves to make mocchi and meets a talking bird calls dera who is on a mission to find the bride of his prince from his country. Kinda cool concept when you think about it, meeting different girls and trying to find which one is the perfect girl for your friend but thats barely looked into until like the last 2-3 episodes. The episodes prior to the last 2-3 episodes are basically slice of life moments of seeing tamako and her friends work around a market making mocchi and doing all sorts of things ranging from a mocchi making contest and making valentine mocchi. Stuff of pure legend right here.Art (8)When talking about Kyoto animation and there art its really really hard not to have high expectations due to there previous works always having to rely on their art work to make their money (think im joking just look at Little Busters... oh you don\'t know little busters well thats my point since they didn\'t produce that anime which was done by J.C. staff; but you would think that if key visuals anime were sooooo good then it wouldn\'t matter if the animation was a little off at times.)Tamako Market animation is really nice and fluffy but thats about it they look like they rehashed alot of the character designs from hyouka and K-on to make this anime as well so if you watched those two anime before you will notice that alot of the characters look alike.Sound (8)Another field where Kyoto Animation works hard to excel as they basically live off the motto ""if the story don\'t move them to tears, these soundtracks sure as hell will,"" and it must be said that they do have a plethora of music that wouldn\'t be recognized by the common audience so i applaud Kyo-ani for that.Voice acting is done pretty well and im not gonna lie i really did like Kanna\'s voice which was done by a relatively new VA so whoop whoop to that.Also another person note worthy of being mentioned is Mister Takumi Yamazi AKA Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi (Fate/Zero)  thats right folks the big man actually plays as Dera-chan and he does an epic job at sounding super pretentious all the time. love this guyCharacter(5)I put a 5 because really the characters aren\'t to great i know that this show is a moe slice of life half comedy type thing but after watching hyouka and chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai (which i would recommend more than this show) Its really no excuse to have such bland characters when they had relatively good ones in those two shows named. Tamako is happy go lucky alllllllllll the time and every other character is bascially a different type of ""cute"" with a different name, examples: Kanna (irregular cute), Midori (energetic cute), shiori (shy cute), Anko (rebellious lil sister cute)Really all the girls in this show are cute in one way or another and i know its supposed to be that way but its hard to define these girls without using the word cute and a word describing there niche such as being shy or energetic.Enjoyment (6)My enjoyment fluctuated between episodes as some episodes were just flat out boring especially when it focused more on Tamako (i mean really its her show but nearly all the support and side characters are more interesting and fun to watch.) I genuilly hoped that the plot moved faster and that it kinda became a love showdown and become a classic game of who gets the girl but alas Kyo-Ani doesn\'t seem to want to instill romance in an anime for no more than once a year (guess there saving there romance points for fall season :p)Overall (6)Okay anime, not going to be remembered for anything for years to come as it will most likely be labeled as another moe anime but your free to try it if your into watching girls sit around making mocchi and eating moochi. an actual story in a show like this is pretty rare these days as anime that has the ever so popular ""moe"" aspect in them, basically kicks Story to the curb, I mean who needs a show with a story right.

Yes it got a lot of cute characters and ridiculous day to day situations and it\'s mainly a topnotch comedy with lot\'s of funny moments (That damn fat bird was just too much)On the other hand it got subtle hints whither it\'s words, glances or simple gestures that actually make you think about more than just that. (It doesn\'t smack you in the face with it) at least that\'s what it did to meStill the...comedy it self was really great and really enjoyable and makes the show well worth the time.The movie got less of the ridiculousness and focuses more on the romance aspect (well it\'s called ""Love Story"" duh)Characters (8/10):The show offers a lovable and down to earth collection of characters (except for the that fat arrogant bird :D). It was a blast to watch how characters interacted with each otherIt was somehow low on character development but it did offer some (this is also something you will get through subtle hints and gestures)The movie will offer a little bit more character development but only to what serves the ending.Art and Animation (10/10):This is a Kyoto Animation anime so you will be having a lot of colorful and beautiful environments and top notch designs and the characters will look beautiful and cute (The eyes are as sparkle as ever)Animations look sharp and detailed and there is a lot of attention to simple movements and gesturesMusic & VA (8/10):The OP and ED were what you would expect of this kind of show but the soundtrack featured some special tracks in some points of the show that helped set the general mode.The voice acting was quite good as wellEffectiveness (8/10):It was a really enjoyable show and even though the plot was somehow episodic it was still satisfying and it offered some great comedy that (as i said) just by it self will make the show worth the watch supported by it\'s nice collection of characters.

Prepare for the cute girls doing cute things, this time with a bird and a black girl!Was that too much?You might like this anime if:-You like anything moe-You are looking for a show to watch in one sitting-You like funny shows-You want to watch something relaxingYou might dislike this anime if:...-You hate everything moe-You are looking for anything special. You will not find it here-You are looking for a show with a complex story. This is not here eitherStory: 7Nothing special here. It's as simple as a story can get, with a few cool aspects here and there. It does enough to provide an overall story, so that the show can end on a somewhat satisfying note, but it still could have done more, as the setup was actually quite unique for this type of shows. What I got to give this show, is that the movie, that serves as a sequel to this anime, has a nice story, and this served as a great setup for it. Not everything was explained in there, but in the end you don't watch moe shows for story anyway, do you? The comedy is pretty good, I bursted out laughing more than enough times to state that.Also, yes, it is cute.Art and Animation: 9While you could say that it's just another typical looking moe show, I would disagree. It looks much cleaner than most shows and most importantly it's color pallet is incredible. This show uses a wide variety of colors, and knows what to do with them. You will see the very bright and cheerful shopping district become dark and gloomy at night, or some great character design here and there. To put it in words, the cuteness is dripping from every possible angle. The animation is extremely fluid too. I could not spot a single graphical mistake, during the entire show. Honestly this show's artstyle and animation is some top notch stuff!Sound: 7I know that you may be sick of this word already, but yes, it's cute. Nothing too special, but it has some good tracks and it fits nicely. You should not expect K-On's OST level of greatness, but it does it's job and a little bit more.Characters: 8The show has some pretty good characters, with actual backstory and development. Not all of them, unfortunately, but it has some at least. Tamako is a really good MC, she has some decent development and an interesting backstory for her love of mochi. Tamako's family, the son of a rival mochi shop owner Mochizou and Tamako's friends get some pretty good development as well! Except for the one girl, who just likes to measure and build stuff. The other residents of the shopping district also get little love, which is a shame, because they seemed to have something interesting in them. But let's not forget Dera, who is a talking bird. Yes, a talking bird. He serves as the comedic relief, and a reason for the show to have an overall story. He is absolutely hilarious and can sometimes carry the anime to some new comedic heights! Some lows too, but that's rare. Overall this show has a great cast of characters, at least better than I ever expected.And yes, the characters were amazingly cute.Enjoyment: 9I honestly didn't expect to like this show so much, but with it having an actual story, a great set of characters and a fantastic movie sequel, I just can't help but to love it. Watching this show as like a brain therapy. The ammount of cuteness is immeasurable. I could not ask of anything more of this show, it was already quite a surprise. While it could deliver more, it was definitely a fun ride!Overall: 8This show will not blow your mind, it will just gently pat you on the head the whole way through. I would even say, that it's worth the watch just so you can watch the movie. I had a lot of fun watching this, and so should you!Please remember, that this is purely my opinion, and I reccomend you to develop your own. -You hate everything moe-You are looking for anything special.

And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.Now this anime is what I would call, simple and different. But to summarize altogether on what this show would be, is that it\'s ordinary.No spoilers as always from yours truly.Overall:Honest to say guys, I like it. It\'s one of my favorites. But that\'s just me. The story goes by somewhat fast when your laughing. I do like the fact that...it\'s ordinary. Sure there might be some romance then and their, but it\'s pretty much what it is. A Slice-of-life. Though most viewers might focus more on romance. I\'d suggest giving Tamako Market a chance for it\'s ordinary-ness. Because it\'s pretty funny. I also heard that there will be a second season. So there might be more to it then what it already is.Summary(shorter):Tamako Kitashirakawa, the eldest daughter of a family who runs a mochi shop in the Usagiyama Shopping District. One day Tamako encounters a talking bird named Dera Mochimazzwi(Which sounds similar to mochi mazui(bad tasting mochi))who comes from a distant land looking for a bride for his prince.

Her birthday is usually forgotten because it\'s on New Year\'s Eve, which is the busiest time of the year. She\'s very slow on catching up on things, particularly it regards with peoples feelings. She feeds Dera on regular basis, which makes him bloated and harder for him to fly properly.Dera Mochimazzwi, a noble attendant for the royal court, and a freeloader at Tamako\'s Mochi shop. During his journey to find a bride for his prince, he got fat in the process and has to postpone his journey. He can only manage to fly short distances before he runs out of breath. He is though rather knowledgeable in love and sometimes gives advice to Mochizo and Midori. He\'s always full of himself and that leads him to misunderstandings.

She later comes to terms that she has a feeling for ""someone""Kanna Makino, same year as her friends, also a member of there club. She is a daughter of a carpenter who works in the same district as Tamako. She\'s a very relaxed laid back girl, and does not care what anyone else thinks.

Pretty much as I typed earlier ""Ordinary"". A very dense heroine instead of a hero. Like any Slice-of-life out there. Nothing really stands out but the fact that she\'s just plainly clueless. Even though there are some character developments. It doesn\'t show a big outcome. Though that\'s just herself, her friends doesn\'t even have much of character development later. All they do is provide friendship in her life. As for Tamako\'s childhood friend, Mochizou. He does show some promises, but still shows some weak progression like every other character. But I would like to point out that the series doesn\'t focus on romance, so don\'t expect too much.Dera I would say is very funny. But maybe that\'s just me. He could either make you mad, or make you laugh. But he has way more screen time than any other characters in the story, which is the downside. It could\'ve been used to give other characters more progression. What I did like about him though is that he gives more personality to the show than any other character. He\'s probably the only character that\'s not bland. Dera will definitely leave you a good impression in the series.Anko doesn\'t seem to receive much either. She pops out then and there, but is usually not there with everyone else. She does get a little bit of an innocent romance in the series, which is pretty cute. Her character development is well done though, not as bland as the others. It\'s just sucks that she doesn\'t get as much screen time as the rest. it\'s ordinary.

I know Tamako Market from short advertisement in other moe-moe-whatever-anime titled Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai. Everyone watch Chuunibyou should see that advertisement in the end of last episodes. I’m certain all of you already know moe-moe anime like this has been showed since several years ago. You know, we can’t underestimate them. I mean, they gain many fans because of these kind of movies. I can see many of my friends in the certain i-net forum have revered the musical anime K-ON. They also praise the heart-touching-anime, Kokoro Connect. Besides other group of them can’t stop laughing after watched...loli-comedy-anime Chuunibyou. So it’s true that these moe kind anime have their own band of fans. Wait, I have watched the last one and I think I’m the one of Chuunibyou’s fans club since it’s a foolish funny anime. It isn’t bad at all. I’m always looking for comedy anime. I’m crazy in comedy.In the other hand according to me a story line is one of the most important things in anime. So if these kind of anime just sell about moe-moe things without considering the story, what’s for? Maybe they will say “Hey, did you already watch Kokoro Connect? And you’ll have your opinion are totally wrong”. Ok fine, it’s not always like that and I never blame the kind of anime watcher who’s just seeking for moe-moe things. But this Tamako Market isn’t counted. Here some synopsis.The story tells about slice of middle schooler’s life named Tamako. I had thought she has an egg store since the meaning of word “Tama” should be an egg in english and she holds something round in her hand. In fact I was totally wrong. Tamako is the daughter of mochi shop owner who lives in the certain shopping district. And the ball like thing in her hand which I ever saw must be mochi. She loves mochi so much and she enjoys her daily life as mochi maker. She has younger sister named Anko, gandpa, and father of couse. She is very cheerful person and never complains about a single thing in her life. She goes to school at the morning, attends some club activity in the school, does a lot of fun with her friends, and other general middle schooler activity. Loving mochi doesn’t mean just eating it. She’s also really good in making some mochi. Since she’ll continue the family business of course. Her life’s suddenly changed when she meets…wait…there’s nothing like that because this anime isn’t about shonen battle or supernatural martial arts. Just kidding. But it’s true that there’s something new in her life when she meets with a strange talking male bird named Dera. For real, Dera can speak fluently just like ordinary human. Dera has been lost from his mission to find his master’s bride. It means he’s the stray bird. Tamako sincerely helps him and invites him to stay in her house for long time without hesitate. Dera is the kind of bird who always butts in at other people business and he’s really elegant as well. He’s getting fat because Tamako always feeds him with many of mochis. Actually Dera has absurd ability. He can make some hologram message with his eyes just like projector. Even I’m still wondering what kind of animal Dera is. Better if we don’t discuss it. It’s an anime after all.The story doesn’t develop so much. I mean there’s nothing serious case as long as the running of this anime. Every episodes were spent with the story of normal daily life. Tamako’s childhood friend named Mochizou loves her so much but in the end he never be able to confess it. Last arc is about the appearance of Dera’s owner called Mochimazzi Mecha. Mecha’s servant, Mochimazzi Choi, revealed that Tamako is the bride who he’s always looking for because Tamako has a mole in her neck. That mole is convinced as the mark of Mechas’s bride. Tamako just stays cool for facing it. She never had a good mind to leave everyone in the order to become Mecha’s wife. Everyone started to worry about Tamako’s decision. They’re afraid Tamako will leave the shopping district. Everything is clear when Mecha said that he has no intention to take Tamako away. Even if Tamako is really her bride. He just wants to met his servant, Choi, and take her back to their home.  And everyone can be relaxed now.So, here some of my opinionPlus :-\tI’m afraid I can’t say it a lot. Because this anime just serves some humors without strong meaning in there. Even I love comedy I could say that it isn’t my cup of tea. It’s like a childish humor.Minus :-\tI have said it. There’s no one serious case which can make some story developing here.So, I doubt I would give a high score at this anime even I’m easy to give a score. Without underestimating moe-moe-anime series I think 6 is proper score for Tamako Market.[/ALIGN] loli-comedy-anime Chuunibyou. So it’s true that these moe kind anime have their own band of fans.

I remember trying to watch it last year, I only watched one episode and dropped it because I was a little bit thrown of by it's reviews and because I thought Dera-chan was a bit annoying but I picked it up again and really liked it, while watching it, I felt like I was friends with all the characters in the show. This show really made me happy, I can't pinpoint why, maybe it's the nostalgic feel the art gives the show or all it's adorable characters esp. Tamako, but I felt at home while watching this show, anime nowadays...feels like something you take up, enjoy then forget about and move on what with the tremendous ammounts being pumped out lately, but this is a show I will remember for quite a while feels like something you take up, enjoy then forget about and move on what with the tremendous ammounts being pumped out lately, but this is a show I will remember for quite a while"", '""Brilliantly Boring"" - Times magazineIndeed, there is not much to say. I can only do as much as to spell the word \'Boring\'. The letter ""B"" is the second letter of the alphabet, and on first glance, is fat. Thus identified as a fat letter, it is not surprising that it should form the base of the word \'Boring\'. Sitting on the couch, doing nothing, remaining inactive, such are the daily events of the letter B.Drawing parallels to our anime here, Tamako Market is the daily portrayal of such events - that is referring to those which begin with the letter \'B\' and are...followed by none other than the letters \'oring\'. followed by none other than the letters \'oring\'.', 'Honestly I see many conflicting votes, my vote will be certainly high, but I think Tamako Market deserves it. It is fun and at times really cute, the characters are very sweet. It is impossible not to take a liking to. The drawings and the soundtrack are valuable and the story truthfully really something nostalgic and romantic. To try to help the growth of the district, it makes me imagine how good it feels to help each other in a globalized world as well and dictated only by market logic. Indeed I have just this feeling of longing for the duration of the series. Anyway...I think the two genres, slice of life and comedy, are perfectly represented in Tamako Market. The episodes fly away and did not regret a single second you spend to see it. Truly a beautiful series. I think the two genres, slice of life and comedy, are perfectly represented in Tamako Market.

Any viewer can become integrated in the communal life shared by the market's shop owners. The amiable Tamako is everyone's friend, including the viewer's, and her personality is hard to hate. Tamako Market is would be a great slice of life comedy show if the story was not so bad. The story is trash. There is just no other way to say it.I have already watched Chuunibyou and K-On! and all the artwork staff is essentially the same. The character design is nothing out of the ordinary and helps create a very real setting that makes it easier to...become engaged in the show. The smooth colors and art look wonderful. An air of cuteness surrounds some characters in the right way. They do not do anything spectacular or totally original with the art, but it still looks really good.The soundtrack is nothing spectacular. It is not particularly good or bad, but I would say I enjoyed listening to it. The opening theme—not to mention the animation that comes with it—really got me excited for the episode. Tamako's personality is clearly felt through it, and it helps set the tone for the setting. The soundtrack, opening, or ending themes are not anything I would go out of my way to download, but they do their jobs and they are not half bad either.The best part of this show was the characters. Tamako is the best airhead ever and Kanna is the best character with her personality type that I have seen so far. The awkward love triangle between Midori, Mochizou, and Tamako was portrayed very subtly, but beautifully. It is hard to see if you are as dense as Tamako, but if you are paying attention, it is great! The only character I really did not like was Dera. Scrap Dera and the rest is good.That brings me to my next point: as I said earlier, the story is trash. It is a very obscure and unrealistic plot and it does not fit well with the setting. I understand what they were trying to show through the plot, but it was just a bad idea. Dera often got annoying and is not nearly as funny as he was obviously intended to be. Choi was a good addition and I wanted her to be there the whole time, but the plot killed her as well. Her role in the story shot down the potential she had; she could have been another one of Tamako's awesome friends, but the plot beat her and dragged her away. The plot was dreadfully unrealistic and there was way too much emphasis put on it in some episodes. It was not so unorganized that it was embarrassingly bad, but it was by no means good. The show was still watchable and that is why I do not rate it lower than 3.I did still enjoy this show. The characters, humor, and cute, innocent atmosphere really made up for the show's shortcomings. If this show were a standard slice of life comedy, maybe featuring Tamako and her friends' life in the market with some scenes at school, it could have been a 9/10.  It is really hard to not like these characters and the humor was still good. Eliminate the plot and you have a great show in Tamako Market.

It looks and seems like K-ON but better than that, i really liked the atmosphere and the original genuine jokes.Story: The mangaka has chose an ordinary shopping district for her/his getup- it seems pure ordinary but turning the story around with scenic events like Festivals.Culture day,Christmas,New Year and mostly rice cakes: it definitely did qualify to get a good rating. There are love triangles- friendship conflicts and just some things out of the ordinary so...you could see how this specific set of people deals with them. Fantasy elements were thrown into the anime which might surprise the audience at first- but you\'ll eventually get settled in. When you hear the word ""Market"" alas for me it reminds me of my lunch- but this anime is well suited for having either lunch and dinner. (well i watched it like that hehe)Art:It\'s simillar to K-ON- you get that cute eyes and hair- the adorable scarves and uniforms- i loved how the intro\'s were done. The art work of Choi-(who\'s supposed to be from another country) was done well since her clothes,bangles and hair was done according to a specific tropical southern style. I loved how the atmosphere was given in the anime through art and it calms you blissfully.Sound:The Openings and Endings were all good- Seiyu\'s did a great job, loved the soundtracks. Isn\'t surprised that Ono-san did Kaoru\'s role- he seems to be everywhere and does everything good.Character:Honestly animes should have more charas like Kanna- that girl is the funniest sarcastic thing ever- each chara is adorable, you just gotta love them. Tamako herself is a positive girl- which no matter how things change she can keep her attire. We see a range of genuine shopkeepers of Asia- which distributes their products for friends for free out of pure generosity. The feelings of the character\'s are represented so well- their generosity for another\'s well being is enormous it can literally bring a smile to your face. Adding character\'s of various genres and traits made this one very perfect to watch and observe. And you gotta love that enka guy from the cafe shop!Enjoyment: I wouldn\'t give this an 8 unless i didn\'t enjoy it! I loved the original jokes and the funny mischievous things that happens in this one, this one of those anime you should watch when you are depressed or tired and it will literally cheers you up guaranteed.Overall: There\'s nothing major to complain about- since this one fits the genres perfectly. I liked the positive air around this anime- totally took my boredom away. A philosophy is given where as to- you will have to meet new challenges one day and the better way to deal with them is with a strong smile.

A philosophy is given where as to- you will have to meet new challenges one day and the better way to deal with them is with a strong smile. Oh and that everything changes no matter how you want it to be.', 'Now, I’d be lying if I said this wasn’t one of KyoAni’s more creative works- since this one doesn’t mainly focus on high schoolers in a club. If anything Tamako Market defines the slice of genre, by hardly having any actual story and being about the everyday life of a cheerful high school girl and her obsession for mochi.My issues with Tamako Market’s story would lie in the fact, that there isn’t anything there for you to keep coming back for more. After the introduction of the bird, which was an entertaining first episode- the show keeps on going downhill- unable to find better ways...to keep you engaged.  The show starts of decent and fun enough, being a nice slice of life that you kick back and catch watch after a stressful day. However, by episode 5 is when I feel the show really starts going downhill.It kind of reminds me how like in Air, they tried doing something completely different half way through which just miserably failed. Same can be said about Tamako Market- with the introduction of a new character named Choi who sent Dera to Tamako’s area. From the beginning of the series, this arc happening was constantly being hinted and given some sort of importance that will in turn affect our main character and those around her.It even felt like it was going in that direction- but the execution of it was terribly handled- by the end of which it this arc happening felt completely pointless. It didn’t give the story that flare it needed- nor did provide any much needed character development for Tamako or those around her. I just felt completely pointless and when I finished the anime I was frustrated. If anything that arc established was Tamako loves her market- that too in a very messy way. Tamako Market also could have explored several side stories regarding the shop owners close to Tamako and instead focused on developing a stupid arc that felt pointless.Tamako’s best friend Mochizou who is obviously in love with her- hardly gets the importance he deserves. Yes, he gets one episode dedicated to him about that- but again that hardly changes or progresses anything. The show just didn’t explore or develop the relationship with the two- which was a damn shame and complete waste. The fact, they waited till the movie- is just sad. Yes, we didn’t necessarily need any confessions- but it would have been still better than to have Mochizou being madly in love with her and Tamako being completely dense about it.As for the characters of the series, they were pretty likeable with some being a hit and a miss. The show does a great job of fleshing out some of the characters. The give attention to characters like Shiori who wants to be friends with Tamako but is unable to speak her mind or Tamako’s little sister Anko who is that little adorable kid who thinks all mature and grown-up and has to deal with her very first crush. But, also Tamako’s father who may seem strict on the outside but is a sweetheart on the inside.The rest of the characters, however didn’t give much screen time or attention. The bird Dera was a pretty funny comic relief character and he added a lot to the show- but his Choi just felt unnecessary to the story and thanks to her involvement caused the anime to give us several bland episodes and also a very lame conclusion to the story. Tamako Market instead of introducing new characters- so would have just stuck by fleshing out the already huge cast. The supporting cast of the eccentric shop owners were all interesting- so it was sad they were reduced to nothing much more than side characters for Tamako to regularly interact with. Tamako’s friends too don’t get fleshed out well to, with Midori’s intentions and feelings not being properly explained or explored. Also, people’s acceptance of a talking bird just seemed unnatural.Another thing about Tamako Market that annoys it is its overuse of the word mocha. Like seriously, you can make a drinking game out of the number of times someone says mocha- 90% of the time it would be Tamako. If I had a dollar for every time someone said mocha I would be as rich as Bill Gates. I have never even tried mochi, but by the end of this show I was completely sick of it. That however is my own personal issue, I wonder if any of you felt the same or not.The opening theme is forgetful but the ED is catchy and adorable- honestly I looked more forward to that than any episode of the show. The animation is really nice- but the character designs aren’t anything original and the type you’d normally come to expect from KyoAni the latter of which isn’t a bad thing. Majority of Tamako Market’s character look way too similar to others. Tamako, Anko, Shiori bearing similar appearances with Mio Akiyama. Mochizou looking like Yukito and a bit of Makoto- and Kanna looking a bit like Yui. But, overall the animation is really clean and polished- despite it not being some of KyoAni’s better looking works.So overall, Tamako Market started of being a decent slice of life anime- that went downhill because it tried having some sort of a plot that felt pointless because there was no conflict and everything got solved quickly. It didn’t affect any of the characters and our leading lady Tamako remains completely unchanged from start to finish.  There were some enjoyable moments in the show, but the comedy was just lackluster for the most part and some episodes were totally skippable as they barely help the story move along and were just down right boring.I am going to give Tamako Market a 4 and that you should probably SKIP IT! I don’t hate this show because it didn’t piss me of or offend me- but I would be lying if I said I enjoyed it. It is in my opinion one of KyoAni’s disappointing shows- especially with a tonne of waste potential. If Tamako Market just explored all the characters, and focused on developing some of the relationships between the characters than I would have highly recommended it. But, since the story blows and the characters don’t have much to offer- I must say it’s better to watch something else that would be worth your time.

Tamako Market felt like a waste of time to me- which was really sad.', 'Just some of my impressions of Tamako Market (mostly the show, but I do know how the movie ends so that might factor into my commentary here) **Some spoilers!**I started Tamako Market initially because it was KyoAni and had the same character designs as K-On!, so I figured it was sure to be cute at least. And right away, something about it pulled me in. It reminded me, in a strange way, of the Soviet-era cartoons my mother showed me when I was little: a talking bird from a southern island, a plot with a prince seeking out a princess…even though everything surrounding Tamako Market,...its main setting, is completely Japanese (you could argue that the profession of making mochi is one of the most Japanese ones out there), was completely relatable to me. The warm, homey feeling of the market transmitted itself to me and made me feel at home just watching it all on a screen.This anime is a story about a community, leaving aside the princess plot, and about the new generation growing up within it. Even if a lot of it might seem like cute, simple fluff, it’s fluff with heart. All of the characters are so loveable that you just want to root them on (even comic relief Dera). I will say that I wish Choi’s story had gotten more resolution without being moved to shorts/pre-movie scenes because her romance was kinda skimmed over. But in its place came the much stronger development of an unexpectedly progressive love triangle.As a dense 14-year-old on my first watch of the show, I completely and totally mistook those scenes of Midori’s crush as her liking Mochizou (admittedly, this is because I had a massive crush on him myself at the time, and still think he’s the cutest love interest ever). But after being educated on who Midori actually liked, I realized that her romantic interest in Tamako is never depicted as a bad thing or something she comes to grow out of, but with sweetness and care and sensitivity. Her love is just as valid as Mochizou’s love for Tamako. The show revolves around “everybody loves somebody” as its mantra, and that doesn’t mean that love should fit some kind of predetermined standard or societal norm. I also thought it was refreshing that Kanna was just doing her own thing the entire time and not given any romance, but that’s a whole other thing. Even if Midori’s crush doesn’t end up progressing past that stage, it’s never knocked down or disparaged, it’s simply a one-sided love. This is the kind of love triangle (love V?) that had me rooting for both sides interested in Tamako. Also, it took a couple rewatches to realize the pun of Mochizou’s last name being Ooji, basically the same as “ouji”/prince, which means he was Tamako’s prince the entire time. Just a little nod from the writers there, I guess.I think more people can articulate better than I can why Tamako Market is an exemplary slice of life, and my review here is mostly a summary of my strongest impressions after having rewatched it a few times over the years. But that warm, welcome, accepting feeling that I get from it every time, that’s something that I don’t think this review alone can speak to. It might just be me, but Tamako Market is one of KyoAni’s stronger examples of making an extremely atmospheric and real-feeling world that, in the strangest way, coexists alongside talking birds and southern island kingdoms in the same 12 episodes. its main setting, is completely Japanese (you could argue that the profession of making mochi is one of the most Japanese ones out there), was completely relatable to me.

Everything seems to just go her way all the time, which further feeds into her already cheerful and positive disposition.Nothing particularly dramatic happens, so it's not a drama. Nothing particularly funny happens, so it's...not a comedy. It really is just a slice of moe.I didn't hate watching it, but the story really lacks any substance.

I went into this to feel at ease, to not be expectant of anything and most of all, to relax.Tamako Market very much delivered that for me.The story, honestly, I really couldn't care about. Hell, it seems like even the anime doesn't care all that much considering the only person related in any meaningful way to the plot for most of the series seems to be a talking bird. Even the ending to the main plot was quite predictable and lackluster.Dera was...not really a character I was able to give a shit about unfortunately. I initially did like his whole royal speak shtick, but that got tiring very fast. This also applies to all the other members of the whole royal family thing. They just weren't interesting enough to care about.But goddamn, I just loved watching the daily life of a girl who lives in a close knit community market. It embodies all the beautiful parts of such places very nicely, the atmosphere was fun and cheery. It made me want to be a part of such a community.That being said, however, in the interest of showing how some things don't change, the anime ended up not really evolving the characters either. Most of the relationships between the characters didn't change all that much, which saddens me, because I wanted to see how that would affect the other members of the market.Tamako as a character is charming enough to warrant watching through the series. I do wish they explored more of her personality as she remained this cheery, upbeat happy person throughout the series without any real emotional moments except towards the end.I'm not saying that I wanted to see her cry or anything, but it would have been nice to see that she too is a person with complex emotions and thoughts that don't all consist of mochi and cheeriness.The music is really nice and one specific track really made me invested to the character of Tamako's dad since he seems to show much more of his vulnerabilities that Tamako ever did.Art style of course is beautiful. I especially love the way Anko is drawn. SO CUTE!Overall, I just love the vibe of this anime man. It's heartwarming and relaxing enough for me to overlook it's flaws and just enjoy it for what it is.

It's a wholesome anime about community living, friendship and solidarity. It creates a very cozy atmosphere, one that is so simple and innocent that it makes you wish you lived there. By all metrics this is a dyed-in-the-wool moe anime with broad appeal to all audiences. It's what I would describe as a slow burn, it's very laid back and takes its sweet time developing the characters.The cast is simple but interesting. Tamako is a polite, sweet girl (although a little dense when...it comes to romance). She's the centerpiece of this anime.

With a 12 episode season, Tamako Market makes for a fairly quick snack.Story 6/10:Tamako Market follows Tamako Kitashirakawa (say that 5 times fast) through her daily life after she has a run-in with a particularly narcissistic bird named Dera Mochimazzi. Her day to day life includes her after school activities as a baton twirler, greeting and talking with every shopkeeper in the market district in which she lives, conversations with her friends and family, and helping her father run the family...mochi shop. The story doesn't go anywhere for a long time but as you're introduced to characters it becomes more clear the direction it's heading.Art 10/10:There's something to say about Kyoto Animation and their ability to make everything so sickeningly sweet. The masters of moe put more skill into the OP than a lot of 2 cour series have, and that is not an exaggeration. The characters are cute, the animation is fluid and the eyes peer into your soul and manipulate your emotions. I've noticed that every time I come back to watch something from KyoAni the first two episodes I get so dizzy and nauseous from the amount of in-betweens, the camera pans, and general flow of animation. I've come to call this moe-tion sickness.Sound 8/10:The OP is like a parade and gets you excited before the more relaxed, yet still bouncy pace of the show kicks in. The background music is often silly but emotional scores can be heard through the use of the record store when it's needed.Character 6/10:Tamako is....basically Yui Hirasawa, if not a slightly more competent Yui Hirasawa. Her interests and mindset pretty much revolve around the market district she's grown up in and that's basically her character. She's oblivious to the romantic affection of those around her due to being coddled by the entire market district and while she herself feels a great amount of affection towards everyone around her it becomes clear that this will not be a love story early on. Her father attempts to raise his two daughters will the help of their grandfather due to her mother's long since passing, and across the street lives the rival mochi shop owner with his son Ooji. The various shop owners of the district aren't given much more depth, but the few of Tamako's friends that the story introduces you to are fleshed out to a believable level.Enjoyment 8/10:Overall 7/10:You'll like Tamako Market for a unique setting and quirky characters, but it is far from a revolutionary tale or a stand out piece in slice of life. If you like Kyoto's character designs or animation it's definitely worth a watch, but there are moments where the series is just boring, where the tone shift doesn't work, and the resolution after the climax felt really weak.

Her father attempts to raise his two daughters will the help of their grandfather due to her mother's long since passing, and across the street lives the rival mochi shop owner with his son Ooji. The various shop owners of the district aren't given much more depth, but the few of Tamako's friends that the story introduces you to are fleshed out to a believable level.Enjoyment 8/10:Overall 7/10:You'll like Tamako Market for a unique setting and quirky characters, but it is far from a revolutionary tale or a stand out piece in slice of life. If you like Kyoto's character designs or animation it's definitely worth a watch, but there are moments where the series is just boring, where the tone shift doesn't work, and the resolution after the climax felt really weak. Despite this I found it to be an enjoyable experience more or less."", ""STORY - 7ART - 9SOUND - 8CHARACTER - 8ENJOYMENT - 8You know how when you see cute things, you wanna squeeze and cuddle and protect them? Well you see, this overloading of positive emotions in the brain is apparently called 'cute aggression' and yeah, Tamako Market definitely knows what it's all about.Comparing this show to a mochi is honestly not too far off. It's sweet, it's soft, and the lack of what one would call a story means Tamako Market is more like a simple slice-of-life to indulge in when you want to relax. Just like mochi! It's basically an adorable escape to a joyful...shopping district where the story, characters, and bubbly atmosphere take place in.Mochi comparison aside, however, there's one main drawback when it comes to being too simple, and it's called blandness. Certain parts throughout the show, such as the dialogues and comedy, come off quite weakly. Like a very trivial trivia. The characters also didn't change much in terms of development but for this one, I didn't think it was a bad thing at all. In fact, I felt it emphasizes this show's collective fun and lightheartedness! Which pleasantly speaking, is something I greatly adored.Look here. We have a pretty big cast of characters with each of them having their own jolly personality. There's even a talking bird who looks very much like a mochi with an attitude. Funnily enough, despite all the wisdoms he loves saying out of his beak, he always gets the shorter end of the stick, befitting himself as the main source of comedy gold. Other than that, the rest of the characters are pretty much sweethearts. They energize the atmosphere up like a festival, creating a dynamic with plenty of family and community in it. It adds more substance into a story that would've been too bland without them. And with the small romantic subplot adding one last touch on sweetness and innocence, the cuteness is definitely strong with this one.Truly the most adorable.Now I want to present to you Kyoto Animation, the moe-nized version. Because without their artistic love, Tamako Market wouldn't have become the cute and lighthearted show I enjoyed watching. The bright use of colors here sets up a cheerful tone that wonderfully fits the characters. It's a mood lavished by qualities tinged with a family aura. This show also has an animation that is full of youthful energy, giving everyone, even the adults, their own adorable sides. Ok, maybe everyone except for the bird, but he certainly knows how to pose. I can give him merits for being a pretty good entertainer, especially for an avian. Got a comedian voice too.Speaking of voice, the overall voice acting complements the characters in a way that is both fun and friendly. When they well up with positivity, it's infectious. I could easily absorb all the emotions in the air. The soundtracks in particular are very playful and sweet-sounding. They blend nicely with each scene and there are even times when you can feel some profoundness, making certain moments more special in a hearty way. One last pleasant thing from this show is the playful opening and warm ending. Both are tuned with a catchiness that really fits what this show is all about.So, in the end, Tamako Market didn't hold back in attacking me with a lot of cuteness. While the simplicity does get bland at times, it's still a show that knows how to please, like a welcoming community. And it has mochi too! Maybe it'll make you want to eat one after every episode. shopping district where the story, characters, and bubbly atmosphere take place in.Mochi comparison aside, however, there's one main drawback when it comes to being too simple, and it's called blandness.

It could have been much better with interesting characters and character quirks, and really funny or charming daily anecdotes. Great SOLs like the ""Aria"" series, ""Non Non Biyori"", or even ""Is the Order A Rabbit?"" do a great job in this. Sadly Tamako Market does not. To me, MOST of the episodes did not end in a satisfying note that good SOLs achieve.Ugh the MC is so bland. Ugh the MC\'s admirer is so...bland. Ugh Dera could have been so better without the constant babbling. Ugh The bride ""plot"" is so badly executed. A good chance is wasted. :-|GOOD THINGSSo what really kept me going? Good animation, glimpses of Anko the sister, Midori and Kanna the friends, and Tamako\'s dad, the ... dad.

But...all it does is talk and everyone in the show treats it like it's completely normal, the show taking an insane matrix dive to dodge any kind of intrigue or suspense.  Birdo has his own story line but it's very short and incredibly meaningless.Whatserface MainCharacter-chan is an unremarkable girl leading an unremarkable life.  She lives with her father and sister, she goes to school, she helps out in her community.  Maybe this show is made for people who have spectacular lives full of skydiving and jetskiing who just want to see how the common people live, but if I wanted to get a peak inside this life I'd... continue to live.I just really can't recommend this to anyone.  If you want slice-of-life moeblob cuteness go (re)watch K-ON or something.  This is a bad show, and while it is not offensive in any way, it succeeds in being boring as hell. all it does is talk and everyone in the show treats it like it's completely normal, the show taking an insane matrix dive to dodge any kind of intrigue or suspense.

The animation was some what similar to K-On.Although it was cute, it kind of lacked a proper plot. It would have been more enjoyed if there was a full, well developed plot instead of just random episodes. It kind of reminded me how OHSHC had the random little episodes then bam! Suddenly a dramatic turn of events at the last two episodes of the anime.I personally liked the anime though. The characters were all cute and enjoyable. If it had a better plot, I would have given it a high rating. ', ""Every character in this was great, but the main character was just mediocre.  One would think that would make this a bad show, but just because she was mediocre, does not make her bad.  She had ups and downs, but just didn't seem to be as animated as the rest (pun intended).  All of the characters besides the main were good (except for the flower shop owner who had a terrible dubbing by a man).  The dub for the bird was hilarious and gave a lot of personality and humor to the bird.  It opens with the terrible voice-acting of...the flower owner (who does a lot of dubs as a man, and clearly is a man, and is a bad choice.), which leads one to assume it will be awful, but the first word from the bird is great and continues as such.  Disclaimer:  I watch sub and dub equally.The story was great, as it was entertaining, and not just run of the mill.  the ending left me at a good closing point, without having to embrace an awful cliched finish.This is a fun one that will most likely keep your attention rather well, and is just a good time with a few serious moments.

Aria was one of the first anime I experienced as a child and while it contained a very slow paced plot (since it was a slice of life), it literally made my day watching it. It contained characters and music that were so in synch it made it such a unique watch. Years later we have Tamako Market which in a lot...of ways mirrors what I loved about Aria.Story: 6.5/10In a slice of life anime, it is hard to get a large amount of appeal unless they rely on moe type stuff to get a large viewer base. While Tamako Market does have some moe elements, it is the very spot on pacing and character development in which Tamako Market in my honest opinion becomes a spiritual successor to Aria. Both shows follow a small cast of characters on their daily routines while also taking place in a seemingly conflict free world in which they are free to do whatever they fancy. Both shows also bring out the question, “What do I want to do in life?” Both Aria and Tamako realize by the end of the show what and where is their true calling. Since all the show does is follow the main characters, you might think it would get boring real fast. Well you are wrong on that front because the character interactions are all funny and/or engaging. The character Dela who is a bird who talks usually steals the spotlight in the scenes he takes place in since he is usually both the starter and resolver of conflicts due to his all mighty personality. The anime does rely on some gag type comedy but nothing is overused beyond their usage. One recurring gag is when someone sneezes on Dela, he takes it as an act of courting since it is such an action in his home country. The plot does start out a little slow in the beginning but the show steadily brings in new elements to add towards the final episode. While it isn’t the most thought provoking plot, you will still hopefully enjoy the interactions between the characters.Animation: 7/10The animation is a little lacking but by no means horrible. The colors are on the plain side but in terms of the actual animation the show does a really good job of keeping a smooth frame rate especially on the scenes where there are objects in motion. Character models are nice throughout the entire season; nothing really else to add.Sound: 9.7/10So I happen to be very much into acoustic qualities and how it affects film. A lot of people do not understand how an amazing score/soundtrack can really make something shine. Visuals are important but it is the sound that makes your chest shake during an explosion or the emotions you feel when a character is crying and the voice actor is doing a great job expressing the in-film character’s emotions. In the case of Tamako Market it happens to be all of these things but the music takes the main prize. The music used in this show is light, cheerful, and used perfectly in all the scenes. The opening song is also amazing as it is catchy and has great instrumentation. The soundtrack is so good that I plan on buying the OST when it comes out.Characters: 9.5/10Slice of life shows HAVE to have a good cast or it goes to sh!%. Unless you have a show like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei that has a character for literally every possible situation, your limited size cast has to provide scenes that are pleasing to the audience. In my honestly opinion, I think that the characters of Tamako Market did an astounding job providing thirteen funny and enjoying episodes of goodness. All four high school students (plus the bird Dela) do an excellent job interacting with each other in both mundane and unique ways. The scenes where Mochizou and Tamako talk to each other from their rooms using the two cups connected by a string reminds me of my youth when that seemed like the cool thing to do. The interactions between Mochizou and Midori were interesting to watch since Midori is overprotective of Tamako and Mochizou is so fu#$ing clueless about girls. The star Dela really brought the show together with his personality and lack of knowledge. I don’t want to sound fanboyish but I am having a hard time trying to find anything wrong with the cast. I am pretty sure that anyone who watches this show will enjoy the characters.Overall: 8.2/10This show is not going to appeal to everyone. Many people including myself are getting fed up with the anime industry’s push for more and more slice of life anime with a heavy emphasis on moe. It seems as if studios are becoming more reserved on making a new amazing action adventure or thriller type anime. When Fate/Zero came out it was a breath of fresh air because it was awesome, fresh, new. I want more anime that takes risks BUT in the mists of all the moe crap going on currently, something arose from the garbage and gave me something to look forward to each week. Tamako Market is the rainy day anime of the 2000’s. With an amazing soundtrack and cast, I honestly cannot think of any reasons why someone might not like this show. Don’t go into it thinking it is going to wow you with emotions and actions; just sit back, relax, and watch some youngsters live out their life. You might even laugh along the way.Enjoyment: 8.4/10Thanks for reading my review!

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer', 'Tamako Market is one of the worst things KyoAni has ever created. I\'m sorry. There\'s no way around it. I wanted to love Tamako Market. I desperately tried my best to enjoy every episode, yet, I absolutely couldn\'t. Everything was just way too mediocre for me. I\'m a huge KyoAni fan, but I gotta call it like I see it.Let\'s start with the few good things that Tamako Market has to offer. KyoAni has pretty much never failed when it comes to animation. The winning streak continues here. Everything is full of color and life. Character designs, while simple, fit the show and what it...has to offer.Music, as per usual, is great. I love the OP soundtrack. Definitely can listen to that for days upon days. It joins the ranks of other OP\'s that I don\'t skip after the second episode. The ED is nice. Nothing too special. When it comes to the soundtrack in every episode - it works. Literally have nothing bad to say about the soundtrack at all.Tamako Market suffers greatly in the story department - more so than any other KyoAni I\'ve ever seen. Here\'s the thing. There\'s pretty much no story to speak of in Tamako Market. I mean, there\'s a ""story"", but it\'s barely there. It\'s one of those things that\'s brought up at the beginning of the first episode and then kinda slumbers for awhile. Then, before you know it, the story awakens near the end of the series. But by that point in time, it was too late and I had already suffered enough.Don\'t me wrong... I don\'t need a story when it comes to slice of life anime. In fact, some of my favorite slice of life anime have no story at all. Lucky Star, A-Channel, YuruYuri - all of these contain little to no story, but I love them anyway. The reason they work is because of the humor and characters. Sadly, the humor hear is pretty poor. Many of the jokes fall flat and don\'t have a lot of weight to them. Timing is also off when it comes to certain gags. The majority of the humor used in Tamako Market is something I like to call ""cute humor"". It\'s basically characters doing cute things, like children, in order to make the audience laugh. Some of the humor worked for me, but I wasn\'t laughing for the majority of the series.When it comes to characters, there\'s not really a whole lot to talk about. Tamako, the main character, is alright. She\'s a cute girl who who does cute things. She\'s nice. And.... well.... that\'s about it. I actually liked Tamako quite a bit, but she felt out of place. Her character would be better suited in the world of Aria. Tamako isn\'t necessarily a strong character, but it\'s hard not to like her. She\'s an angel - harmless. Tamako also has some friends, but they aren\'t memorable at all. I honestly can\'t say much about them. They\'re in every episode and they do stuff. That\'s their job - to do stuff. Tamako has a little sister as well named Anko. And guess what Anko does? She does stuff. Some cute, and some no so cute. She\'s just kinda there.There\'s a character in Tamako Market who shows up every now and then that works at a flower shop, named Kaoru Hanase. He appears to be a trans. I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen an anime that represented the trans community so fairly. I greatly appreciated the fact that he wasn\'t used as a character to be made fun of or seen as a joke. He was represented equal to everyone else. I\'m not trans, nor do I know anyone who is, but I thought that was rather sweet. KyoAni could\'ve easily gone the other route and used his character as a tool for jokes. Definitely respect KyoAni for not going that route, although I woudn\'t have been too offended if they did.And now.... the bird.....This guy really deserves his own paragraph because, in a way, he is the virus that made me suffer as much as I did while watching Tamako Market. He has a name - Dera Mochiyucky, but I\'m going to be calling him ""bird"" for this review. Why? Because he deserves no respect for the torture his character put me through. This piece of work was annoying from start to finish. Before watching Tamako Market, I assumed that the bird was only in a few episodes. I also had no idea he could talk. But boy.... I was wrong. I hated everything about him. His character design, his voice, his humor - it infuriated me to no end. At the end of every episode, he would say a few lines that were supposed to be meaningful, but they never meant a thing to me because it was HIM saying those lines. Would\'ve been better and more appropriate for Tamako to say such things. In my opinion, one of the worst characters in the history of anime. Dreadful. Awful. Stupid. Just the worst of the worst. Literally had no choice but to lower my rating by one full point due to his presence, which rarely ever happens when I watch anime.Tamako Market is one of the weaker efforts from KyoAni. The only reason I rated it a 6/10 is because of the beautiful animation, the score, and Tamako. If this were made by any other studio, with a low budget, it would probably get a 4/10 or 5/10. If you are a die hard fan of KyoAni, then I guess I would say to give this series a go. It\'s harmless. It won\'t leave you angry the entire day or anything. There are no villains either. It just kinda felt like a waste of time for me. has to offer.Music, as per usual, is great. I love the OP soundtrack. Definitely can listen to that for days upon days.

Literally had no choice but to lower my rating by one full point due to his presence, which rarely ever happens when I watch anime.Tamako Market is one of the weaker efforts from KyoAni. The only reason I rated it a 6/10 is because of the beautiful animation, the score, and Tamako. If this were made by any other studio, with a low budget, it would probably get a 4/10 or 5/10. If you are a die hard fan of KyoAni, then I guess I would say to give this series a go. It\'s harmless. It won\'t leave you angry the entire day or anything. There are no villains either. It just kinda felt like a waste of time for me.', ""I present to you another reason as to why I don't drop shows. Tamako Market would've been an anime I would've dropped if I was the kind of person who judged after 3 episodes, or even less. I am GLAD I see an anime through to the end because Tamako Market started to grow on me after a couple episodes.I will admit, I only wanted to watch this because of the romance scenes I'd seen on social media platforms and through recommendations. I started it for the romance but stayed for the characters and story. It ended on such a good note that I'm even...more excited to watch the movie, knowing it will feature exactly what I've been looking for.Tamako Market didn't disappoint. The first couple of episodes were quite... eccentric. I had no idea where the story would go and wasn't fond of what I was seeing. But as it was only 12 episodes, I thought it wouldn't take too long and after pushing through, I really did begin to enjoy it.It is funny, heart-warming and sweet. The characters embody your typical personality types in anime, but I personally love Tamako's type. It's not often you'd seen her as the MC but I thoroughly enjoyed watching her interact with everyone. She is the definition of a natural, cute airhead. Kinda like Tohru from Fruits Basket. You have the boy next door vibe from her childhood friend, which is unsurprising, as he is quite literally the boy next door. All her friends, family, their characters are nicely developed. Not properly fleshed out, which is to be expected as this isn't that serious of an anime, but I'm glad there was personality and growth.In terms of the plot, it is quite chill. Reading the reviews prior to watching, I had some doubts about the mention of a talking bird, but Dera also ended up being a character I loved seeing on screen. And thankfully so, cause he shows up so often. But there is actually a plot, albeit one that isn't crazy serious, but there are hints of serious undertones.There's a lot more I could say but many other reviews already give detailed, spoiler free... reviews and descriptions. I'd probably move this onto my comfort animes list from how much I enjoyed it. I highly recommend anyone who's a fan of just sweet animes, SoL, romance or just light comedy in general to give it a try, and push further than 3 episodes.My score of this honestly moved from like a 5, maybe even less to a 7.5, almost an 8 (i wish .5's were part of the ratings). Finishes on a good note and is just overall so heart-warming. I'll definitely be back to rewatch this :) more excited to watch the movie, knowing it will feature exactly what I've been looking for.Tamako Market didn't disappoint.

Accordingly it is something you have to be in the mood to view for the show to really achieve what it sets out to do.Perhaps the best way to watch Tamako Market is to go in understanding what it is promising instead of expecting to find out along the way. I probably would have gone into Tamako Market expecting either a character driven light comedy like K-On, or from the first episode a light urban fantasy style show. However, it really is none of those things and does not really try to...be it. Tamako Market is ultimately a show about a place and its goings on; in essence it is about the atmosphere of the market which I think recontextualizes its title a lot.It is unusual, and frankly difficult, for a show to announce that it is about the atmosphere it is creating. Often it is just something that people are supposed to realize and it is rarely the central focus. Admittedly, since most slice of life shows centre around their characters in a setting, it is the default assumption that Tamako Market would naturally be about that. That line of thinking leads us to expect that Tamako Market be about its cast of characters attempting to achieve something related to the market. Alternatively, if the market is solely just a back drop and ancillary to the plot, then it must be about how our characters interact.Tamako Market does not focus on either of this and instead keeps a sort of 'Wes Anderson-type' heightened reality. It's characters remain grounded in the sense that while whimsical in presentation, their development is never quite pushed beyond something reasonable to real life. There is no plot or narrative that compels them to reveal deep seated things about them. What we get is what we could reasonably see from people who spend a year of their ordinary lives together. Yet despite this, there is still a whimsical sense of wonder from the market, even though for the entire show it is business as usual for them. While Tamako is our main character and there is clearly a core cast, it is very much the atmosphere that they collective create and inhabit that is the shows main goal. Even its 'overarching' plot, if one wants to call it that, is about the effect change can have on their community instead of what change means to the cast as individual characters.I had originally intended to give Tamako Market only a 7 until I watched its 9th Episode. That is when I realize started to see how well the show could handle atmosphere. It is a short delve into the pass of Tamako's father that somehow feels both happy and melancholic. This balance was incredible with the atmosphere of a sweet market community being maintained while bringing back the idea that there are still tragic things that can happen. It may not be a grand narrative or a particularly unique nor complex one, but it is in its tonal and atmospheric execution in which Tamako Market shines.Ultimately, Tamako Market is a show that you watch to see a location overflowing with sweetness and whimsical charm. Its characters are better seen as part of a greater whole than in standard show where their individual development is the point of the narrative. Watching Tamako Market knowing that it is about a premise and its atmosphere instead of plot and characters is how you will enjoy it. In that sense Tamako Market is an exceedingly good show for what it attempts to do. I think its main drawback is that it, though understandably, does not communicate this very well throughout its run. be it.

The story is an illustrated plot where the people are simple and predictable. The mood is relaxed till the end. Fear of losing someone is spare.The problem is the connection between roles is weak. Ordinary life can be extraordinary. There is heibon na kiseki in Hibana, a well-known drama by Netflix. There isn\'t an ordinary miracle here but ordinary life.Character: 67Suzaki Aya is more surprising when I found it\'s her debut. Hidaka Rina\'s voice is fusing with her role. Yamazaki Takumi\'s role...is anxious to ask for the laugh.Production Design: 80Cinematography: 77As for production design, the day humans reached the black hole and quantum physics problems answered will be sooner than the day ""Kyoto Animation"" screwed up. The style, color, detail, hair, and clothes are above the average.Editing: 68Episode 1 is ordinary, which takes 4 episodes to grow up. I was swamped half of the time, dragged along another. It moves with some stops and starts. Occasionally, the characters are together physically, not mentally.Sound and Music: 75The second highlight comes in Sound and Music. Music is the key to achieve the impossible in the possible. Without shiosai no memory, there is no memory at all. With umi／demo version、yuukuriarukidasu and numerous gems by Otomo Yoshihide, Amachan became a phenomenon. Tomoko Kataoka is an emotional genius. It\'s so sad to know that she passed away last year. Her work is an example of Life Aesthetics. It is a common fallacy that ordinary life is the most beautiful. The truth is life isn\'t beautiful while lifestyle could be: to see life as it really is and to love it.Directing: 70Unlike most, I watched Koe no Katachi and Liz to Aoi Bird before I watched it. After seeing the pinnacle of her creativity, I can\'t imagine the expectations for her, for a young female director. As her first original work, the taste of Naoko Yamada is unique. The anime reflect ambition and vision beyond simply recording performances. The aesthetics choices within it pleasing, satisfying, perfectly appropriate for the material. It is idiosyncratic and individualistic, is unreproducible. is anxious to ask for the laugh.Production Design: 80Cinematography: 77As for production design, the day humans reached the black hole and quantum physics problems answered will be sooner than the day ""Kyoto Animation"" screwed up.

The romance is not force, just enough for their age (heck no conclusions were made). Other aspects are explored well too, but not enough that the main plot is ignored.The pacing is lovely, the humor parts are done well: not so much as they ruined the story but enough to give you laughs here and there. Overall I had...a great time watching this show! a great time watching this show!"", ""If you came for the plot and thought that made it a bad anime, you're an idiot. Slice of life has never needed to prove it's worth by showing a grand story line or drastic character development in the run time of the show, which is why I think Tamako market and slice of life in general is a niche market for anime enjoyers and why it's pretty hit or miss for those who don't exactly invest hours into watching cute girls pound mochi, the bottom line is: it's a matter of taste.Tamako Market has somehow taken something mundane and turned it into something...interesting and eye opening. I've been to Japan once and I've never really put much thought into the family like dynamic in the street markets around Japan. But Tamako Market has managed to capture that spark and bring it to life through the show in an interesting way, which is one of the reasons why I stayed until the end and never once felt bored.The characters were diverse in variety although shallow, but that didn't matter as I think it played it's cards right in terms of showing how people at the market act. People know each other, but it's ok to not know everyone at a conceptual basis and the show makes that clear right from the start with the clique character traits that were established into the supporting cast.The show takes course over a year or so, and during that time we see people settle in, we see people living life, enjoying what life has to offer and we also see characters develop over that time and get over some of their annoying traits. Dera was a character I didn't really like as he was annoying as fuck in early episodes and only cared about himself. But as we see more of him as he grows fond of his newfound family, we see his character shape into a different persona through the influence of the people around him. The show takes it's time letting the audience settle in along with the characters and I think this was all thanks to the great mind of Naoko Yamada and her amazing way of portraying life through mundane things.8/10Amazing show and I want to live in a mochi shop interesting and eye opening.

She is very passionate about her work and is part of a close-knit community in a small shopping plaza in Japan. Things get a bit exciting when a flamboyant talking bird named Dera Mochimazzi shows up explaining that he is there looking for a bride for the prince he serves in a distant land. The show mainly follows what Tamako is up to in school with her friends and the goofy events the little shopping community performs for...each season before finally introducing us to the prince by series end to get us ready for the たまこラブストーリー [Tamako Love Story] film where we\'ll find out if Tamako\'s childhood friend Mochizou will be able to win her over. There are some fun moments, but overall, the plot is super simplistic and is definitely not going to be for everyone.Visuals: B *Is it just me or does Kyoto Animation do hair better than any other studio? The character designs of Midori and Kanna are both really good and I love how detailed their hair looks. Other than that, like most Kyo-Ani shows, the backgrounds are really pleasant to look at and the shopping plaza is vibrant and full of pretty colors and realistic looking settings.Voice Acting: Other than Dera who is hilarious and somehow even more fantastic and flamboyant in the dub, stick with the sub for this one. But for the most part, the voices of the characters are cute with very little annoying voices. Kanna\'s voice is probably my favorite in the sub because her personality is already weird and then you you add her goofy deep voice to portray her quips and it makes her comments even funnier.Film Score/Soundtrack: C *There are a few stand out tracks that play during the more ""emotional"" moments in the show and some fun upbeat ones too, but for the most part, this isn\'t a score you will be listening to outside of the show\'s context.Characters: C *Tamako Market is a bizarre show. I didn\'t really feel like I connected with any of the characters, but I enjoyed the experience nonetheless.Tamako is likable enough as your token ditsy friendly girl who obsesses over mochi. Her childhood friend Mochizou is a hardcore simp for her that is downright pathetic at times, yet he has a habit where he throws a string telephone to Tamako\'s window at night to talk to her which is super cute. Shiori was a super shy girl that had no friends and Tamako tried super hard to make her friend in an early episode... only for her to become a background character that we hardly see again. Kanna is there to throw sass at every character and to be super weird. But she is a good friend to Tamako and I enjoyed every second of her despite her being underutilized. Midori has my favorite character design of the bunch, but is bossy and does the whole ""I can do everything myself"" cliche where by episode\'s end she realizes she needs help and all\'s well ends well. I loathe morale lesson episodes of tv shows. Anko is Tamako\'s little sister who constantly complains about living in a family that makes mochi so she doesn\'t help them with anything. Yet she has a friend that she has a crush on who is moving away so she uses the mochi shop to give goodbye gifts to him and still doesn\'t help in making them. She is a whiny little brat and if she was my sister, I would whip her entitled little butt into shape real fast.And as for the adults, they felt more like cliches of character types as opposed to actual characters. Especially the dude that owned the record shop. He mainly existed as a plot device for other characters to feel better or to learn something and to move on. Dera the talking bird has his moments of brilliance and his moments that will make you head palm. But I will say for the most part, he was a likable character and I thought it was funny how scared of Choi he was. (Who btw also has an adorable character design)Cringeworthy Anime Moments: I get it that this is a moe anime and everything is meant to be cute about it, but I don\'t think Tamako losing her badge needed to have music that dramatic playing. In fact, just about every time sad music played in this anime, the reason a person was crying was so ridiculous that I couldn\'t take it seriously. At least in K-ON!, in most cases, the sad music is mainly for comedic effect because they know that the situation is goofy and should not be taken seriously. I also found Tamako\'s father to be extremely annoying as he screamed all the time every time people say anything negative about mochi, and when anything about his past would come up, he would just yell and be a huge tsundere to his daughter. I typically am not the biggest fan of tsundere\'s that are excessive in their outbursts and refuse to allow people to connect (and that are abusive) so if you think the idea of a tsundere dad is cute, I guess I apologize for placing it in my cringeworthy anime moment section, but I for one found it to be an annoying ongoing joke. Dera trying to peak on the girls in the bath and then getting a nosebleed when he saw them in their bathing suits was about as cringe as it gets. And when he does it a second and third time, it unsurprisingly got even less funny than it was the first time. I did find the part about girls sneezing on Dera as a sign of affection to be cute and funny, but the pervy lets add some fan service real quick scenes that plague anime drive me nuts.Opening: *This song is everything I love about J-pop. It\'s got an assortment of instruments, upbeat and fun vocals, a memorable chorus, and is just cuteness overload with the beautiful visuals to accompany it.Ending: *The beat and vocals both remind me of Kylie Minogue\'s Miss a Thing which is a super groovy disco-esque pop song. Absolutely love it!Final Verdict: 5/10 *Tamako Market is a show to c h i l l to. I can\'t really say it excels in any way (other than it\'s BOP of an intro and it\'s super catchy ending track), but I did enjoy watching it even though just about every episode had it\'s moments to roll your eyes at or really was about nothing of interest. It\'s definitely the weakest of 山田尚子 [Naoko Yamada]\'s works that I\'ve seen thus far, but I am intrigued enough to watch the たまこラブストーリー [Tamako Love Story] to see how it all ends. each season before finally introducing us to the prince by series end to get us ready for the たまこラブストーリー [Tamako Love Story] film where we\'ll find out if Tamako\'s childhood friend Mochizou will be able to win her over.

As of right now, the story is nothing special, it seems almost vignette in nature. The episodes are set apart by a month, and the episodes seem to be separated by holiday. I\'m not sure of the significance of this, but so far it\'s an okay way to tell the story.Tamako, her father, the bird, and Mochizou seem to be the only interesting characters as of yet. The other two girls, Kaana and Midori seem to be...only cardboard cut outs for Tamako to have beside her as ""school friends."" That seems to be okay because the series\' main focus as of now is to point out how special Tamako is to the shopping district and everyone around her. I don\'t know why she\'s so special yet as she\'s a stereotypical, lovable, moe character, but I\'m sure as I watch more there will be more of a rhyme and reason as to how that is.On top of that, the series is using K-ON!\'s popularity with the art style to draw potential viewers in. The art style is gorgeous, I\'m not going to lie, but the style is so copied that the series seems hardly original, and looking at comments on episodes, they are already comparing the characters to characters from K-ON! I fear that this series is only trying to piggyback on the success of the moe that is K-ON! and may fail in the story department as a result of attempting to replicate the popularity of another show. Will the story get better? I\'m not sure, but as of right now things look a little cloudy for Tamako Market. I\'ll keep watching for sure, as there are some loose ends that will be interesting to see tied up, but as of right now I fear that this happy moe train will crash into K-ON! fandom and not stand alone as it\'s own anime. only cardboard cut outs for Tamako to have beside her as ""school friends."" That seems to be okay because the series\' main focus as of now is to point out how special Tamako is to the shopping district and everyone around her. I don\'t know why she\'s so special yet as she\'s a stereotypical, lovable, moe character, but I\'m sure as I watch more there will be more of a rhyme and reason as to how that is.On top of that, the series is using K-ON!\'s popularity with the art style to draw potential viewers in. The art style is gorgeous, I\'m not going to lie, but the style is so copied that the series seems hardly original, and looking at comments on episodes, they are already comparing the characters to characters from K-ON! I fear that this series is only trying to piggyback on the success of the moe that is K-ON! and may fail in the story department as a result of attempting to replicate the popularity of another show. Will the story get better? I\'m not sure, but as of right now things look a little cloudy for Tamako Market. I\'ll keep watching for sure, as there are some loose ends that will be interesting to see tied up, but as of right now I fear that this happy moe train will crash into K-ON! fandom and not stand alone as it\'s own anime.', 'I\'ll confess: I bought the hype. ""New series, directed by Naoko Yamada, about a girl who loves mochi!"" What I\'d forgotten was that Yamada had a good foundation in Kakifly\'s K-On manga, and this is an original work, which can be hit-or-miss, even for Kyoto Animation. I did enjoy the innumerable (all right, 2 or 3) Munto remakes, though, so I gave this a fighting chance to the end.It was... all right, but following the heels of Clannad and K-On (both tough acts to follow), it felt lacking. This isn\'t KyoAni\'s strongest work.I think there are two principal reasons for this: (1) For most of...the show, the heroine is like the trees in Japanese school plays. We really don\'t see her developed until the final 2 or 3 episodes of the show, and after that she goes right back to being Happy Mochi Girl (her childhood friend/hetare Mochizo is even worse). (2) Dera, and to a lesser extent the other characters, steal the show.I think the production crew was deliberately avoiding the ""mascot character = cute little animal that talks, explains stuff, and is cute/comic relief"" trap and hoped that Dera would be kind of a partner to Tamako, which would have been great had there been actual chemistry between Tamako and Dera. Unfortunately Tamako wasn\'t written as a particularly assertive girl, and where a different character would be like ""Get off my head nao!"", she\'s more apologetic: ""No, he\'s not my pet, he\'s just sitting there."" In contrast, Dera is written as a preening, strutting narcissist. You\'d have to make him comatose to prevent him from stealing the spotlight. He has his moments (""de-panning your bird bread"" is probably the biggest LOL I had in the show, the comedic timing was perfect), and making him the comic foil to Choi helped a bit, but I feel like his role could\'ve been smaller, or better yet, Tamako written as a better straight girl in this double act.I don\'t know exactly why, but I found Dera grating on the ears. I guess Takumi Yamazaki (fun fact: he voiced Isamu Dyson in Macross Plus) was cast because he does a hilarious squawking voice, but the rest of the character feels like Jouji Nakata\'s voice might be a better fit. I won\'t go so far as to say it\'s a miscast, but I feel as though the timbre of the non-squawking voice was a little on the high side.So what do you do with an upstaged heroine? KyoAni\'s answer was ""not much"", unfortunately. We get episodes that feature her friends, her little sister Anko, the merchants of the shopping district, her father and mother... but it seemed as though developing the central character was off-limits until the very last minute. I found Kanna more interesting, and it\'s not like she got an episode of her own. This was frustrating to watch.There was better chemistry between Tamako and Mochizo than between Dera and Tamako, and yet it seemed the production was going out of its way not to further their relationship. I can understand doing this if, say, Tamako was a bit more of a cliche shojo character (An ""I don\'t want to admit to myself that I love you"" sort of thing), but in this show it\'s like any attraction on her part is surgically removed. It just doesn\'t feel organic, for lack of a better word-- it felt like an invisible wall in a AAA video game, and it felt ridiculous considering the importance they put on the ""everybody loves somebody"" episode. It\'s as though someone high up the food chain didn\'t want a straight-ahead romantic subplot or was saving it for a sequel/film... which, credit where it\'s due, does eventually happen in Tamako Love Story.I\'m still wondering, was there a good reason to hold off until the film?

What I mean by this is that, while the reason of Dera\'s presence (and later on Choi) influences the overall theme, it doesn\'t really have a presence in the episodes...themselves (it doesn\'t even really come into effect until the last two or three episodes). Rather, they are about Tamako and the residents of her little market and how they interact- and Dera.

Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1840/Zero_no_Tsukaima__Futatsuki_no_Kishi,"[""I suppose it's inevitable that Futatsuki no Kishi, being a second season of Zero no Tsukaima, will be compared to the first in one way or another, especially since it's pointless to start the series here, but I'll try to appraise its own merits as well.As implied by the ending of the first season, FnK is a direct continuation of the story. Several new characters are introduced almost immediately, and, while I don't have anything against them, I'd like to point out that they (most notably Agnes) take up quite an amount of screen time with their own subplots, leaving less for the overall story....Thankfully, they aren't dragged out for too long. Particularly refreshing is the noticeable advance in Saito and Louise's relationship, during which several important questions are raised and decisions are made.The animation is done on a fairly high level for the time, although it's not anything outstanding: characters still talk out one side of their face and all that, many scenes lack smoothness—just like in the first season, all things considered. Some scenes, particularly those of burning villages, are pretty nicely done. (I swear I'm not a sociopath!) The sound work borrows most themes from the first season. They're fine for what they are but still come off a little generic. New opening and ending are somewhat enjoyable, definitely more so than those of the first season IMO.As for the characters, the previously known Academy residents (Kirche, Tabitha, Guiche, etc.) have much less screen time. Not sure if I like that; personally, I'd prefer to see them some more. New characters are passable, if a bit queer-looking. Siesta is still there, being apparently dumber than previously. Yes, everything has to be sacrificed for the sake of fan service. (sigh) On that note, what is particularly annoying about FnK is that fan service has increased in quantity, but definitely not in quality. Saito's obsession with boobs might've been funny at first, but the obviously contrived situations become old very quickly. You might not even notice it at first, but by the last episode it will come screaming in your face. Then again, the finale itself is too silly, anyway.All in all, with FnK Zero no Tsukaima keeps being a good addition to your collection as long as you enjoy fantasy harem comedies with a questionably high amount of hit-and-miss fan service. Many will laugh, some might even tear up; overall I think the second season is almost as enjoyable as the first, barring the certain cheesiness and an overall drop in the quality of the comedy. However, it might leave something to be desired when it comes to the story progression, so I sincerely hope they won't drag it out for too long. Any further decrease in pace coupled with an increase in fan service could easily ruin the show. (Editing this paragraph from the future: It did ruin the show.)

If I didn&rsquo;t like the first season, then that would mean that I probably wouldn&rsquo;t like the second season, right? Then how come I like the second season more than the first? Read on and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.The story obviously needed work. I think the problem was that they tried to fit in many different storylines at a time. There was Saito and Louise&rsquo;s relationship, the ongoing war with Albion and there was Anies&rsquo; story too. Each story would have been potentially...better as stand alones, especially Anies&rsquo; story, but a combination of the three isn&rsquo;t such a good idea.  All three at once can be too much, maybe one or two at a time would&rsquo;ve been better.Furthermore, I&rsquo;m really getting tired of the Louise and Saito&rsquo;s love hate comedy act. It became so predictable &ndash; Saito does something that displeases Louise (usually looking at other girls), Louise brings out her whip, screams &ldquo;You damned dog!&rdquo; and beats Saito up. It&rsquo;s been like that since the first season. The only improvement is that both are more aware of their status, that Louise is a noble while Saito is a plain commoner, which is why they&rsquo;re still not official as a couple.I&rsquo;m a little disappointed that there was less screen time for the characters from the first season. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of Zero no Tsukaima fans were disappointed to see less of Kirche, Tabitha and Guiche. A good side effect from that was more exposure for Henrietta - She was barely seen in the first season so I didn&rsquo;t like her back then, but the second season showed a different side of her which made me like her more. I also like the new characters, Anies and Julio. Anies has such a cool personality and background, while Julio is such a hottie. He is so much better than Guiche.Visually, it looks the same as the first season - same colors, same backgrounds. However, I do think the character design looks different. I think the character designs look more crisp, but at the same time, the drawing became more inconsistent. I&rsquo;m especially glad that there was less fanservice, or rather, more tolerable fanservice in the second season.Another aspect that didn&rsquo;t change is the voice acting. I&rsquo;m glad it didn&rsquo;t change at all since a lot of my favorite and famous voice actors can be found in the cast list. Rie Kugimiya (Al in Fullmetal Alchemist, Shana in Shakugan no Shana) and Satoshi Hino (Yuuji in Shakugan no Shana, Kouichi in Kimikiss) are still Louise and Saito. There&rsquo;s also Ayako Kawasumi (Ruriko in Gate Keepers, Ohno in Genshiken) as Henrietta, Yui Horie (Eri in School Rumble, Hanyuu in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai) as Siesta and Takahiro Sakurai (Shun in Gatekeepers, Cloud in Final Fantasy: Advent Children) as Guiche.I also like the music. In fact, I think the music is better this time around. In the first season, the songs were too cutesy, but in the second season, the songs were more striking and had better quality. I really like &ldquo;I say yes&rdquo; by Ichiko, which is the OP. It&rsquo;s so different from all the other Ichiko songs I&rsquo;ve heard. I think it has more power and emotion to it, which makes it so special.Despite of its many shortcomings, I still like it better than the first season. I thought it was more funny and entertaining, I like the new characters, and I&rsquo;m especially glad that there was less fanservice this time around.

After all, Zero's effectiveness as a story may have been a fluke, a fortunate accident.Fluke it was not, all told. I'd still recommend the series to anyone whose tastes seem to run in the general direction of fantasy/harem romance/politics. But despite its strong latter episodes, Futatsuki no Kishi does suffer from a few weaknesses its predecessor managed to keep to a minimum or avoid entirely.Plot: Again we join Louise and her...hapless familiar Saito at the Tristain Academy, where their relationship has grown marginally stronger. I have no complaints with how the whole inevitable Saito/Louise pairing is portrayed at first; we're given the impression that things have moved forward for the two, despite Louise's fondness for brandishing that riding crop, and it's an impression we need to be given if we're going to believe in the two as a viable and vital couple. When relationships hit a standstill in the real world, of course, things tend to go sour very soon after.That said, one of the weakest points of the plot is its handling of the central romance. Louise and Saito make progress with one another in fits and starts, alternating between trite slapstick and almost extreme affection. It's the slapstick that bothers me most, partly because there's so damn much of it, and partly because the plot occasionally has to contort itself in unlikely directions simply to land Saito in unfortunate positions of lechery. Too many episodes are devoted not to progressing the underlying series of political events in any significant way, but to progressing Saito toward a pair of breasts, and Louise toward Saito and said breasts at just the wrong moment. And when they do get along, there are one or two moments of startling physicality that may make it a little difficult to fully appreciate (understandable as these moments may be, Saito and Louise being healthy teenagers and all).Don't get me wrong, though. Futatsuki no Kishi does have its truly sweet moments. The last episode really nails it, but as it's the last episode, I'll refrain from singing its praises too loudly here.Due to Futatsuki's focus on the central romance's sporadic twists and turns, the political storyline suffers -- a real disappointment to me, as the two arcs seemed to work so well together in the first season. The first half in particular often interrupts the continuity with breasts, Saito's appreciation thereof, and Louise's resultant disapproval. The shift toward politics in the second half feels like an abrupt temperature change at first, seemingly for the production team as much as we viewers, as the general organization of episodes seven and eight came across as a bit shoddy to me. When the suddenness levels out, however, we get a solid final four episodes. If you were a fan of the politics in the first season, hang in there; it's ultimately worth it.Characters: I have two major problems with the characterization in Futatsuki, the first being inexplicable personality shifts. The first season gave us a surprisingly strong cast, and I looked forward to said cast developing further from where they left off, but this isn't always the case. Saito, for example, seems at times to have been demoted into your average, everyday pervert. Siesta's resolve to wrest Saito's affections from Louise isn't surprising, considering her acts of momentary boldness in the previous season, but her willingness to throw herself at Saito is a bit disconcerting. These divergences don't seem to be indicative of the kind of change one thinks of when discussing character growth.Secondly, I didn't appreciate the marginalization of some characters. New characters Agnes and Julio ultimately earn our interest, but season one set Kirche and Tabitha up for a bit of explication, and we hardly see them at all this time around. I feel bad for Tabitha's seiyuu, having to make the trip down to the studio to record a grand total of three or so lines. With Tabitha and Kirche out of the way, it goes without saying that Guiche and Montmorency don't get much screen time, either.On the other hand, those recurring characters who are further fleshed did good things for me. I couldn't help being interested in Colbert's history and plight, and Delfringher, who has to be the cleverest talking sword in all anime-dom, is even more hilariously pithy than before. Even Henrietta shows her many good and bad sides this time around.Setting: Tristain Academy hasn't much changed, and, had the majority of the show been set therein, the place may have gotten old. Fortunately, we're introduced to a variety of locales as things move along -- a surprising number, really, considering how much of the plot is fanservice-centric (Saito doesn't let circumstances keep him down, so to speak). Our heroes visit such settings as an underground vault, a snowy mountain, and Louise's ample home, traveling between Tristain and Albion, the flying faux-Britain.We also gain insight into the general level of technology with the introduction of Tristain's musketeers. Despite this title, the guns employed in Futatsuki are decidedly similar to rifles, in terms of accuracy; it seems that magic coexists with a higher level of technology than was previously made clear. By implication, this tautens the dynamic between aristocrats and plebeians, as those not gifted with magic are proven to be perfectly formidable marksmen. Perhaps the aristocrats' control is not as total as it seems.Art: Futatsuki brings back the same clean, simple, Shakugan no Shana-esque art style as the original, retaining its reputation as the pastel equivalent of Shana's darkness and fire. Interestingly, the animation itself alternates between very good and shoddy, particularly where fight scenes are concerned, but it balances out in most episodes to be more than acceptable. I'm happy that J.C. Staff decided to forgo the use of 3D computer graphics in rendering flight sequences; such graphics have their place, that place being Last Exile and not here.Sound: Based on music alone, I would have rated Futatsuki below its predecessor in the sound department. Music throughout the series often comes across as generic action fare, and besides, the opening and ending themes didn't do as much for me this time. Maintaining the score at 7, however, are certain scenes in which the voice acting is absolutely dead-on. Futatsuki's all-star vocal cast definitely delivers.Verdict: Personally, I prefer my shows to be solid from beginning to end, rather than loaded with meaning, progress, and spectacle in the final four episodes. Either way, Futatsuki no Kishi turned out to be worthwhile thanks to that final stretch, particularly for a viewer who enjoyed the first season as much as I did. It's ultimately worth your attention as a follow-up to Zero no Tsukaima and a segue into the forthcoming season three, but be warned that it has its shaky spots. hapless familiar Saito at the Tristain Academy, where their relationship has grown marginally stronger.

The last episode really nails it, but as it's the last episode, I'll refrain from singing its praises too loudly here.Due to Futatsuki's focus on the central romance's sporadic twists and turns, the political storyline suffers -- a real disappointment to me, as the two arcs seemed to work so well together in the first season. The first half in particular often interrupts the continuity with breasts, Saito's appreciation thereof, and Louise's resultant disapproval. The shift toward politics in the second half feels like an abrupt temperature change at first, seemingly for the production team as much as we viewers, as the general organization of episodes seven and eight came across as a bit shoddy to me. When the suddenness levels out, however, we get a solid final four episodes. If you were a fan of the politics in the first season, hang in there; it's ultimately worth it.Characters: I have two major problems with the characterization in Futatsuki, the first being inexplicable personality shifts. The first season gave us a surprisingly strong cast, and I looked forward to said cast developing further from where they left off, but this isn't always the case. Saito, for example, seems at times to have been demoted into your average, everyday pervert. Siesta's resolve to wrest Saito's affections from Louise isn't surprising, considering her acts of momentary boldness in the previous season, but her willingness to throw herself at Saito is a bit disconcerting. These divergences don't seem to be indicative of the kind of change one thinks of when discussing character growth.Secondly, I didn't appreciate the marginalization of some characters. New characters Agnes and Julio ultimately earn our interest, but season one set Kirche and Tabitha up for a bit of explication, and we hardly see them at all this time around. I feel bad for Tabitha's seiyuu, having to make the trip down to the studio to record a grand total of three or so lines. With Tabitha and Kirche out of the way, it goes without saying that Guiche and Montmorency don't get much screen time, either.On the other hand, those recurring characters who are further fleshed did good things for me. I couldn't help being interested in Colbert's history and plight, and Delfringher, who has to be the cleverest talking sword in all anime-dom, is even more hilariously pithy than before. Even Henrietta shows her many good and bad sides this time around.Setting: Tristain Academy hasn't much changed, and, had the majority of the show been set therein, the place may have gotten old. Fortunately, we're introduced to a variety of locales as things move along -- a surprising number, really, considering how much of the plot is fanservice-centric (Saito doesn't let circumstances keep him down, so to speak). Our heroes visit such settings as an underground vault, a snowy mountain, and Louise's ample home, traveling between Tristain and Albion, the flying faux-Britain.We also gain insight into the general level of technology with the introduction of Tristain's musketeers. Despite this title, the guns employed in Futatsuki are decidedly similar to rifles, in terms of accuracy; it seems that magic coexists with a higher level of technology than was previously made clear. By implication, this tautens the dynamic between aristocrats and plebeians, as those not gifted with magic are proven to be perfectly formidable marksmen. Perhaps the aristocrats' control is not as total as it seems.Art: Futatsuki brings back the same clean, simple, Shakugan no Shana-esque art style as the original, retaining its reputation as the pastel equivalent of Shana's darkness and fire. Interestingly, the animation itself alternates between very good and shoddy, particularly where fight scenes are concerned, but it balances out in most episodes to be more than acceptable. I'm happy that J.C. Staff decided to forgo the use of 3D computer graphics in rendering flight sequences; such graphics have their place, that place being Last Exile and not here.Sound: Based on music alone, I would have rated Futatsuki below its predecessor in the sound department. Music throughout the series often comes across as generic action fare, and besides, the opening and ending themes didn't do as much for me this time. Maintaining the score at 7, however, are certain scenes in which the voice acting is absolutely dead-on. Futatsuki's all-star vocal cast definitely delivers.Verdict: Personally, I prefer my shows to be solid from beginning to end, rather than loaded with meaning, progress, and spectacle in the final four episodes. Either way, Futatsuki no Kishi turned out to be worthwhile thanks to that final stretch, particularly for a viewer who enjoyed the first season as much as I did. It's ultimately worth your attention as a follow-up to Zero no Tsukaima and a segue into the forthcoming season three, but be warned that it has its shaky spots."", ""As a sequel to the highly entertaining Zero no Tsukaima, I had expected a continuation of the first season with more fleshed out stories, more character development, and just overall better material than what Futatsuki no Kishi provided.  Don't get me wrong, the second season doesn't fail, it still provides a decent story with plenty of comedy and lplenty of fan service to back it up, but what Futatsuki mainly lacks is consistency.  I feel as though Futatsuki could have stood alone as an entirely different series, as it seems as though if the characters were placed in a situation where they met...their first season counterparts, they would barely recognize themselves.Story:  5While I'd recommend watching the first season first (for obvious reasons), I think that really, it wouldn't be too hard to just pick up from here and start watching.  This is one of the main problems involving the story as I mentioned in the introduction.I'm almost convinced that in the Zero no Tsukaima world this time around, having boobs or liking them makes you dumb, as the only sane person in the anime for the second season seems to be Louise.Furthermore, Louise and Saito must be the most beautiful couple to ever grace their land, as every busty female character seems to go after Saito, and the handsome male characters after Louise.  For every episode, be prepared to find Saito coming into contact with the cleavage of at least one female member of the cast.The story doesn't actually get serious until the last two episodes, where it feels as though these last few ones could pass off as a continuation of the first season.  In fact, I'd say that this is really the only saving grace for the story, and although the ending invokes an awfully convenient deus ex machina to wrap things up, the last episode as a whole was pretty moving and even made me a bit teary-eyed.The second season more or less has transformed the series into a pure harem anime relying on fan service and fan of the first season to keep viewers, and for this genre, it does well.  However, I feel that since that the first season didn't quite have this degree of females throwing their naked selves at Saito, that it didn't really fit in terms of the story.At times, it is as though the story contorts itself in ways just to have Saito in a situation with a girl such that if he was walked in upon, it would look really bad, and of course, who but Louise should always walk in on these times.  At least during the episodes, the story does progress some, saving it from becoming merely a mindless harem/ecchi anime.  It is unfortunate that the story is somewhat weak and ending lacks any real conclusion, but it is good (I hope) that a third season is in the works.  I should mention that at least the humor in the series isn't too bad, and also, like the first time around, the story is really predictable, but still fun to watch regardless.Art:  8This series contains some of my favorite character designs of any anime, especially Louise, who is just adorable; the female designs cater perfectly to those watching for fan service, and the male characters are handsome, as well.  Some rather impressive effects and animations are pulled off during the series, especially regarding spells (with the exception of Void Magic).  The coloring of the characters is rather pleasant to look at, and the rosy cheeks of many of the embarrassed females (particularly Louise) give off an adorable effect.  Overall, I can't say the art is among the most picturesque I've seen, but it certainly doesn't fail to impress.Sound:  8I personally liked the very beginning part of the opening song, but after that, it just turns into your standard j-pop number, not particularly bad, but it doesn't really stand out either.  Also, it maintain what they did in the first season in adding sound effects to the OP for the last episode.I'm sure that many people will find the ED to be ridiculously annoying, but I have to say that I thought it was adorable and very fitting (of course, since the OP and ED were made for the series, but that aside).  It is basically the perfect embodiment of what the first ten episodes will be like.Besides the OP and ED, the music wasn't too bad overall, and fit in pretty well with the respective scenes they were in.  Additionally, the voice acting definitely wasn't too shabby, either, with an experienced cast voicing many of the characters.Character:  7This is perhaps one of the biggest drawbacks of the second season.  It feels as though nearly all of the female cast hit their heads on something hard and now have an unquenchable desire to make Saito the object of their affection.Perhaps some of the new transitions are understandable, such as Siesta's newfound boldness, as it was seen briefly surfacing in the last season, yet instances like Episode 6 involving Henrietta are just plain ridiculous and seem forced.  It is fortunate that Louise maintains her character, however, Saito seems to have changed from the average (slightly more than average in terms of bravery though) teenager whisked from his home to a standard anime pervert who drools at every sight of cleavage he gets despite the fact that he is (somewhat unofficially) together with Louise.  Thankfully, he manages to regain his old self in the last few episodes but it's rather distracting having this &quot;new&quot; Saito prancing around.  It seems as though the characters have actually regressed, rather than grown and developed like they should.The budding relationship between Louise and Saito is sweet and fun to watch, although it's greatly stunted by the rough humor that is placed into nearly every episode, and doesn't really make any real leaps or bounds until the last few episodes, although there are a few scenes earlier on that are rather...risque, almost.It's nice that they added new characters, but most aren't properly developed, and furthermore, that means less of the characters that you've already come to know from the first season.  They gave back stories to many of the characters, such as Tabitha, and it's a shame that they didn't build on them more.  The one exception would be the story surrounding Colbert-sensei, but I won't go into details as to avoid spoilers.In summary, it's all your favorite characters from the first time around (plus a few new ones), just a bit more comical and perhaps perverted than before.Enjoyment:  7More or less, I found that my enjoyment of this anime was hindered by the excessive fan service and it's new extreme harem feel it had that contrasted with the first season.  If I had watched Futatsuki no Kishi for it being a harem, I'm sure I would have loved it, however, I was hoping for more of the goodness that comprised of the first season, and was rather letdown.Overall:  7By the end, I'd have to say that the only reason I kept watching was for Louise, and in hopes that the third season will be better.  If you've viewed the first season and liked it, then you should definitely check out the second season; if you haven't seen the first season yet, then I'd recommend it to you.The second season doesn't quite live up to it predecessor, but it's not too bad in whole.

Whenever huge boobs...show up, he MUST notice it. Hell I don\'t even remember being such a perverted guy when I was his age, I know he\'s a healthy boy but MUST HE NOTICE EVERY BREAST IN THE WHOLE WORLD? The second thing, Agnes, a new character, almost literally took half the season away from us with her arc, although it ended in a grand fashion that started a chain of other dramatic things.Let\'s get on to the real thing:StoryWell, in this review, I am mostly going to compare this season with last season and maybe some other shows too but I won\'t be comparing it to the higher standards.The story is pretty average, the first arc, a girl has village burned, wants revenge, yawn. Its ending was rather epic win though, I have to admit. Second arc is about the war, this arc is quite a bit more awesome because of everything there.There is pretty much nothing wrong at all with the story. I brief you no more, no less for it is pretty much that. The whole thing with Agnes, although pretty interesting, is not totally that great compared to the 2nd half. Seriously, I was thinking of giving this season a 6/10 with that arc but the 2nd arc totally turned it around for me, it was like the impact player in a football match that won the match for the team and that half did it.There was also another aspect I liked from the series. The fact that the character development of the main pairing didn\'t take a full 2 seasons (AHEM Shakugan no Shana) really pleased me. Or maybe that was the novel itself. Either way it\'s still a contributing factor but that keeps the score at average.6.4/10CharactersI have always loved Hiraga Saito for his manly acts and healthy teenager behaviours because well, we don\'t get a lot of that in Animes. He\'s unique, you can say. For example, you can see he\'s not that generic when you see someone like Yuuji from Shakugan no Shana (although he isn\'t totally generic, you get the point) or some other wussy from some other Animes (although Yuuji is actually not a wussy after he got used to life with Shana)Aside from the last badass episode that made him King Badass alone in the series, he hasn\'t gone all too badass himself.Hiraga Saito has been, as I\'ve hinted, toned down to a perverted badass (but not those bad people types who raep women) who cannot live life without huge boobies dangling around his life in every corner. If you are Hiraga Saito, you will encounter breast hams at every corner of the street. If you are Hiraga Saito, you are Dr. Boobs - no, you are Mr. Boobs. If you are Hiraga Saito, you will be beaten/exploded to death by over-used slapstick stuff from Louise.Alright Louise is definitely a tsundere. I might be biased because I kinda like tsunderes when they get really dere dere (e.g Taiga from Toradora!) but trouble is she\'s almost tsun 80% of the time. The 20% of dere-ness are nice moments but then 10% of the tsun will come out from the aftermath of the dere which results in over-used slapstick which is getting frustrating sometimes. There are people who love this and I say to you,""DAT WAS FUNNAY LOL but please, the internet is serious business. I know you\'re joking with me >_>""During the most dramatic episode I\'ve ever watched in the series (which I cried at, yea lol I\'m a sissy and I\'m a guy), after the sweet moment, for no reason at all, Hiraga Saito said something about huge boobs. What was the result? Does he ever EVER learn? Louise makes him explode and we see another slapstick that ruins the mood YET AGAIN. Brilliant directing [/sarcasm]. The slapstick immediately reverted me from butthurt sissy mode to normal, a bit pissed mode. It had such a huge effect but they totally ruined it by including another routine slapstick crap. How charming.There are also some absurd changes. Siesta, from a good and like-able girl, has gone to a camera-whore, almost literally. She is not afraid to walk around in a bunny suit with cleavage in front of Saito because, oh, you know, it\'s for Saito and she\'s convinced slut = win.The queen is still the same like-able queen. She hasn\'t changed much and all her actions in this season has not made me note of anything different at all. She\'s still the same queen in my opinion, the only time Henrietta went totally ballistics from her original character was in her ploy to draw out an enemy and that was actually justified so it wasn\'t too unexplainable to me (aside from, oh.. you\'ll see).Then new characters Julio and Agnes. Julio, to me, is one of my favourite types of stereotyped characters. He\'s the cool-headed nice guy who knows everything. He knows what and what not to do and is knowledgeable in the arts of teasing too. In a sense, you can compare him to the cool guys from other romance Animes you know (e.g Ikuto from Shugo Chara, Nomiya from Honey & Clover) but he generally radiates more friendly aura than most of them.Agnes however, is a different case. I didn\'t care much about her. Oh sure if she was more beautiful I\'d pity her more but that still didn\'t justify the ridiculous amount of screentime her repetitive story got. I know it\'s impressive and all that your village got burned and shitloads of revenge is stuck in your mind but why take more than half a season? The arc\'s ending was awesome though, Agnes in my opinion is not really needed, she comes off as someone you don\'t even care about at the end of the day.Then previously focused-on characters like Kirche and Tabitha are left out a lot more with the long arc although they were both regulars in the first season, that\'s a real pity given that Kirche was definitely a fine favourite of mine. It\'s also a pity imagining Tabitha\'s seiyuu going through all the trouble as going to the recording sessions and only to record approximately 3 lines an episode (and I\'m being generous here).The quality went more down-hill than it went up-hill for me, 7/10Art & MusicThe art is still very much the same, Shakugan no Shana-esque maybe, since the whole cast does seem Shana-like and even the animations too. The art is OK and deserves a pat on the back for fine consistency.The music is also well done. I am planning to get the OST sometime later but honestly, I still find SnS and Toradora!\'s OST to be better (I\'m only using those 2 animes because they are both tsundere-themed and feature Rie Kugimiya as well). The music was well-suited for everything. From the silly and funny moments, to the overtly-over-over-over-over-used slapstick to the saddening dramatic moments, it blended well. Usually it takes good emotional music to make me cry with a scene and this Anime is probably the 2nd one in my book. Maybe that\'s because I watched the whole thing in one go and maybe because I don\'t really like watching fully romantic stuff (e.g La Corda Passo D\'oro).The voice acting was not bad. Kugimiya Rie has lived up again to her title of ""Queen of Tsundere"" as her voice brings in the adjectives pampered and childish into mind, just like how Louise acts. Although I didn\'t like Yuuji\'s voice in SnS (who has the same voice actor with Saito, if you haven\'t a clue) too much when he\'s hurt and doing stuff (you know, the cracks and the heaves and the hos and the breathing in breathing out when he\'s shouting and/or yelling) but Saito\'s voice is really well done. No fault there. Other voices didn\'t bother me either. Excellent ones in my opinion are Henrietta, Colbert, Kirche, Julio, Siesta and probably her cousin.8/10Direction & EnjoymentNow here lies some problems:I have no goddamn idea.What the hell is up with the boobies.I mean seriously. I see boobies everyday and I don\'t go around staring at them perversely every single day of my life. That is how Saito has degraded into, your everyday huge-boob-lover. I cannot get what the hell is the obsession with boobs that this guy has. I know he\'s a healthy kid, but please know more shame, what the hell are you doing staring boob after boob as if you\'re on a relentless task of seeing every big boob you will ever encounter in your life?And what is the after-effect of this boobspotting sport you ask? Oh I don\'t know, ANOTHER ROUND OF OVER-USED SLAPSTICK MAYBE? This ruins the mood. Especially in some episodes when Louise went dere and they had a nice couple moment with each other, boobs are mentioned or something akin to that and boy oh boy, here comes the wonderful slapstick. Go to hell slapstick, it was kinda funny the first time but not the 300th time (for example, in season 1 episode 9 where she drank the love potion, there was slapstick at the end, I could live with that, it was reasonable, what is NOT reasonable is the f-ing ridiculous reasons she would beat him up for). Some people love this, I don\'t get it, the joke\'s on me huh?The drama is also very good ever since the end of the first arc. It was especially in its prime at the grand finale (that was the one that made me cry). The other ending of the first arc was also really sad to me. The new-found dramatic points in this season, when compared to the first season\'s drama, is a great improvement.The relationship though, is progressing at a good pace but in some cases almost totally ruined by, again, you must be bored of hearing this from me, the ""I has a boobs trauma because I has a flat chest and Saito is a boob fetish LOL!"" slapstick. Sigh, so low.Almost every time, the direction turns to huge tits. I don\'t get what\'s so funny about huge tits being shoved around my screen the whole day. I know tits are great, tits are fun but STOP SHOWING ME TITS PLEASE BECAUSE I WANT ANIME, NOT TITS. If I were looking for tits I\'d go to a bar or something. Hell even Shakugan no Shana never focuses that much on Yoshida\'s TITS, except for Shana-tan Returns because, well, it is a PARODY so they focused on her ridiculous boobs but in the normal episodes, her tits are not mentioned a million times. The first season had a number of tit-savoury mentions but those weren\'t that bad. The director must\'ve looked at the storyboard and said,""Hey! WRITER! WE NEED MORE TITS DAMMIT! ANIMES AREN\'T MADE WITHOUT TITS YOU KNOW! What the hell is anime without TITS GODDAMIT? Oh I know, stinker anime!"" Go figure.You director, must have a huge boob fetish to make the series become a boob-fanatic festival. You know you could just go to those sites and quench your thirst but don\'t put tit after tits up the screen and make even worse slapstick jokes.8/10Overall: 7.7/10 (not average)If you\'ve liked the 1st season and you like drama, the last half of the season will totally redeem everything you\'ve watched in the first half but just watch the whole thing because it\'s not really itself without watching the whole thing.I know lots of people are saying the 2nd season is far less superior than the 1st season but the last half of this was worth the score because I love teh drama :)In any case, if you love the drama in season 1, want more Saito x Louise-ness,  totally gay for boobs and over-used slapstick, you will definitely like (or maybe love) this season, depending on your preference because some people think the first half was too much crap for the other half to handle and blah blah blah so who knows, it\'s pretty much preference. I recommend you try it first. I only love the last half of season 2 more than season 1 in general because of all the built-up drama but the score suffers from the immediate boring old slapstick right after the effective drama. Meh -_-On the other hand, if you hate every Tsundere character on the face of the Earth, hate season 1, hate drama, hate the love-hate relationships of the couple (Saito and Louise), totally despise slapstick and are traumatic of huge, surreal and impossible boobies and the booby-watchers, then you will hate this season \'till you cringetl;dr 1st reviewkthxbai! show up, he MUST notice it. Hell I don\'t even remember being such a perverted guy when I was his age, I know he\'s a healthy boy but MUST HE NOTICE EVERY BREAST IN THE WHOLE WORLD? The second thing, Agnes, a new character, almost literally took half the season away from us with her arc, although it ended in a grand fashion that started a chain of other dramatic things.Let\'s get on to the real thing:StoryWell, in this review, I am mostly going to compare this season with last season and maybe some other shows too but I won\'t be comparing it to the higher standards.The story is pretty average, the first arc, a girl has village burned, wants revenge, yawn. Its ending was rather epic win though, I have to admit. Second arc is about the war, this arc is quite a bit more awesome because of everything there.There is pretty much nothing wrong at all with the story. I brief you no more, no less for it is pretty much that. The whole thing with Agnes, although pretty interesting, is not totally that great compared to the 2nd half. Seriously, I was thinking of giving this season a 6/10 with that arc but the 2nd arc totally turned it around for me, it was like the impact player in a football match that won the match for the team and that half did it.There was also another aspect I liked from the series. The fact that the character development of the main pairing didn\'t take a full 2 seasons (AHEM Shakugan no Shana) really pleased me. Or maybe that was the novel itself. Either way it\'s still a contributing factor but that keeps the score at average.6.4/10CharactersI have always loved Hiraga Saito for his manly acts and healthy teenager behaviours because well, we don\'t get a lot of that in Animes. He\'s unique, you can say. For example, you can see he\'s not that generic when you see someone like Yuuji from Shakugan no Shana (although he isn\'t totally generic, you get the point) or some other wussy from some other Animes (although Yuuji is actually not a wussy after he got used to life with Shana)Aside from the last badass episode that made him King Badass alone in the series, he hasn\'t gone all too badass himself.Hiraga Saito has been, as I\'ve hinted, toned down to a perverted badass (but not those bad people types who raep women) who cannot live life without huge boobies dangling around his life in every corner. If you are Hiraga Saito, you will encounter breast hams at every corner of the street. If you are Hiraga Saito, you are Dr. Boobs - no, you are Mr. Boobs. If you are Hiraga Saito, you will be beaten/exploded to death by over-used slapstick stuff from Louise.Alright Louise is definitely a tsundere. I might be biased because I kinda like tsunderes when they get really dere dere (e.g Taiga from Toradora!) but trouble is she\'s almost tsun 80% of the time. The 20% of dere-ness are nice moments but then 10% of the tsun will come out from the aftermath of the dere which results in over-used slapstick which is getting frustrating sometimes. There are people who love this and I say to you,""DAT WAS FUNNAY LOL but please, the internet is serious business. I know you\'re joking with me >_>""During the most dramatic episode I\'ve ever watched in the series (which I cried at, yea lol I\'m a sissy and I\'m a guy), after the sweet moment, for no reason at all, Hiraga Saito said something about huge boobs. What was the result? Does he ever EVER learn? Louise makes him explode and we see another slapstick that ruins the mood YET AGAIN. Brilliant directing [/sarcasm]. The slapstick immediately reverted me from butthurt sissy mode to normal, a bit pissed mode. It had such a huge effect but they totally ruined it by including another routine slapstick crap. How charming.There are also some absurd changes. Siesta, from a good and like-able girl, has gone to a camera-whore, almost literally. She is not afraid to walk around in a bunny suit with cleavage in front of Saito because, oh, you know, it\'s for Saito and she\'s convinced slut = win.The queen is still the same like-able queen. She hasn\'t changed much and all her actions in this season has not made me note of anything different at all. She\'s still the same queen in my opinion, the only time Henrietta went totally ballistics from her original character was in her ploy to draw out an enemy and that was actually justified so it wasn\'t too unexplainable to me (aside from, oh.. you\'ll see).Then new characters Julio and Agnes. Julio, to me, is one of my favourite types of stereotyped characters. He\'s the cool-headed nice guy who knows everything. He knows what and what not to do and is knowledgeable in the arts of teasing too. In a sense, you can compare him to the cool guys from other romance Animes you know (e.g Ikuto from Shugo Chara, Nomiya from Honey & Clover) but he generally radiates more friendly aura than most of them.Agnes however, is a different case. I didn\'t care much about her. Oh sure if she was more beautiful I\'d pity her more but that still didn\'t justify the ridiculous amount of screentime her repetitive story got. I know it\'s impressive and all that your village got burned and shitloads of revenge is stuck in your mind but why take more than half a season? The arc\'s ending was awesome though, Agnes in my opinion is not really needed, she comes off as someone you don\'t even care about at the end of the day.Then previously focused-on characters like Kirche and Tabitha are left out a lot more with the long arc although they were both regulars in the first season, that\'s a real pity given that Kirche was definitely a fine favourite of mine. It\'s also a pity imagining Tabitha\'s seiyuu going through all the trouble as going to the recording sessions and only to record approximately 3 lines an episode (and I\'m being generous here).The quality went more down-hill than it went up-hill for me, 7/10Art & MusicThe art is still very much the same, Shakugan no Shana-esque maybe, since the whole cast does seem Shana-like and even the animations too. The art is OK and deserves a pat on the back for fine consistency.The music is also well done. I am planning to get the OST sometime later but honestly, I still find SnS and Toradora!\'s OST to be better (I\'m only using those 2 animes because they are both tsundere-themed and feature Rie Kugimiya as well). The music was well-suited for everything. From the silly and funny moments, to the overtly-over-over-over-over-used slapstick to the saddening dramatic moments, it blended well. Usually it takes good emotional music to make me cry with a scene and this Anime is probably the 2nd one in my book. Maybe that\'s because I watched the whole thing in one go and maybe because I don\'t really like watching fully romantic stuff (e.g La Corda Passo D\'oro).The voice acting was not bad. Kugimiya Rie has lived up again to her title of ""Queen of Tsundere"" as her voice brings in the adjectives pampered and childish into mind, just like how Louise acts. Although I didn\'t like Yuuji\'s voice in SnS (who has the same voice actor with Saito, if you haven\'t a clue) too much when he\'s hurt and doing stuff (you know, the cracks and the heaves and the hos and the breathing in breathing out when he\'s shouting and/or yelling) but Saito\'s voice is really well done. No fault there. Other voices didn\'t bother me either. Excellent ones in my opinion are Henrietta, Colbert, Kirche, Julio, Siesta and probably her cousin.8/10Direction & EnjoymentNow here lies some problems:I have no goddamn idea.What the hell is up with the boobies.I mean seriously. I see boobies everyday and I don\'t go around staring at them perversely every single day of my life. That is how Saito has degraded into, your everyday huge-boob-lover. I cannot get what the hell is the obsession with boobs that this guy has. I know he\'s a healthy kid, but please know more shame, what the hell are you doing staring boob after boob as if you\'re on a relentless task of seeing every big boob you will ever encounter in your life?And what is the after-effect of this boobspotting sport you ask? Oh I don\'t know, ANOTHER ROUND OF OVER-USED SLAPSTICK MAYBE? This ruins the mood. Especially in some episodes when Louise went dere and they had a nice couple moment with each other, boobs are mentioned or something akin to that and boy oh boy, here comes the wonderful slapstick. Go to hell slapstick, it was kinda funny the first time but not the 300th time (for example, in season 1 episode 9 where she drank the love potion, there was slapstick at the end, I could live with that, it was reasonable, what is NOT reasonable is the f-ing ridiculous reasons she would beat him up for). Some people love this, I don\'t get it, the joke\'s on me huh?The drama is also very good ever since the end of the first arc. It was especially in its prime at the grand finale (that was the one that made me cry). The other ending of the first arc was also really sad to me. The new-found dramatic points in this season, when compared to the first season\'s drama, is a great improvement.The relationship though, is progressing at a good pace but in some cases almost totally ruined by, again, you must be bored of hearing this from me, the ""I has a boobs trauma because I has a flat chest and Saito is a boob fetish LOL!"" slapstick. Sigh, so low.Almost every time, the direction turns to huge tits. I don\'t get what\'s so funny about huge tits being shoved around my screen the whole day. I know tits are great, tits are fun but STOP SHOWING ME TITS PLEASE BECAUSE I WANT ANIME, NOT TITS. If I were looking for tits I\'d go to a bar or something. Hell even Shakugan no Shana never focuses that much on Yoshida\'s TITS, except for Shana-tan Returns because, well, it is a PARODY so they focused on her ridiculous boobs but in the normal episodes, her tits are not mentioned a million times. The first season had a number of tit-savoury mentions but those weren\'t that bad. The director must\'ve looked at the storyboard and said,""Hey! WRITER! WE NEED MORE TITS DAMMIT! ANIMES AREN\'T MADE WITHOUT TITS YOU KNOW! What the hell is anime without TITS GODDAMIT? Oh I know, stinker anime!"" Go figure.You director, must have a huge boob fetish to make the series become a boob-fanatic festival. You know you could just go to those sites and quench your thirst but don\'t put tit after tits up the screen and make even worse slapstick jokes.8/10Overall: 7.7/10 (not average)If you\'ve liked the 1st season and you like drama, the last half of the season will totally redeem everything you\'ve watched in the first half but just watch the whole thing because it\'s not really itself without watching the whole thing.I know lots of people are saying the 2nd season is far less superior than the 1st season but the last half of this was worth the score because I love teh drama :)In any case, if you love the drama in season 1, want more Saito x Louise-ness,  totally gay for boobs and over-used slapstick, you will definitely like (or maybe love) this season, depending on your preference because some people think the first half was too much crap for the other half to handle and blah blah blah so who knows, it\'s pretty much preference. I recommend you try it first. I only love the last half of season 2 more than season 1 in general because of all the built-up drama but the score suffers from the immediate boring old slapstick right after the effective drama. Meh -_-On the other hand, if you hate every Tsundere character on the face of the Earth, hate season 1, hate drama, hate the love-hate relationships of the couple (Saito and Louise), totally despise slapstick and are traumatic of huge, surreal and impossible boobies and the booby-watchers, then you will hate this season \'till you cringetl;dr 1st reviewkthxbai!', 'I will assume that, if you are reading this, you have watched the first season of Zero no Tsukaima. Also, the review contains spoilers for the first episode of the series and relationships further down the line.The first season of Zero no Tsukaima was an enjoyable experience. I admired the way it juggled character development and the small but steady reveal of the main plot. The first season is extremely solid and, by the end, I felt satisfied. It is charming, cool and, most importantly, engaging.The ending especially was shocking to me. Going in I already knew this series had four seasons and I...expected the love relationship between Louise and Saito to be stretched out until the last season, with small tidbits of development here and there. What I didn\'t expect was to see them kiss at the end of Season 1.""I get it now!"" I thought, ""I understand why everybody praises this series!""I didn\'t see the warning signs in front of me.Excitedly, and almost immediately after finishing season 1, I started watching Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi. The first episode is sublime (or at least so I thought). It is basically a long send-off to one of S1\'s main gimmicks: the Harem element.I don\'t particularly enjoy harems, and the Harem elements in S1 were no exception. However, I sat through it because the world and characters were so interesting I just couldn\'t stop watching. Going into S2, I knew the series\' mystique wouldn\'t trump the Harem elements if there were any.That is why I enjoyed Ep1. Having Louise chastise Saito for oogling or supposedly flirting with the other girls that, in S1, were potential love interests was a neat concept and, without the incredible power of hindsight, seemed to me, initially at least, a kind of send-off to the Harem in S1. I really can not be blamed for thinking this way, the episode seemed structured to give off that idea.From that episode on, I was hooked. I expected the series to leave behind the immaturity of the love relationships in S1 to portray a more mature and realistic love dynamic between Saito and Louis and, maybe even use the other female characters as more than just love interests for Saito.My disappointment when I realized this wasn\'t the case was unmeasurable.The Harem element persisted. Louise and Saito\'s relationship seemed to reset and all the progress done in S1 was flung out the window. My initial prediction about the love relationship in the series seemed confirmed.Now, I know what many of you might be thinking. ""You shouldn\'t criticise a series for what YOU want it to be."" And you are right, I shouldn\'t. However, I believe that this forced Harem, persistent up to the point I watched, hinders the storytelling and makes the humor of the overall series stale.As regards storytelling, the story matures and the plot thickens (that is the political and mystery plots), but the Romantic storyline doesn\'t follow suit. This dissonance between plot lines is jarring. One second you are hooked with political maneuvering and the next you are bombarded with a useless and unnecessary scene of a ship being teased. The overall quality of the show is damaged as I can not enjoy the intriguing scenes of the main storyline without being reminded of the substanceless Harem.I am aware that the Harem element is one of the main attractions of the anime, but, in this particular case, I feel it is misused.As regards humor, all the jokes seem reliant on Louise becoming jealous of another girl for flirting with Saito. The formula goes as follows:Saito showing interest in another girl + Louise becoming jealous=Saito being blown by an explosionI swear every joke plays out this exact way. There are some outliers, but for the most part, they are all like this. I don\'t have to stress how boring this becomes after a while. The joke wasn\'t even that funny, to begin with.Those are my thoughts in regards to the fatal flaw in Zero no Tsukaima.I will address the other points of critique of the series in a more ""rapid-fire"" kind of way.Tha animation is good. The character designs are distinct and memorable and everything flows quite smoothly. However, it isn\'t outstanding.The main storyline, the one regarding the war in Tristain, is good. However, as previously stated, it can not be fully enjoyed.Finally, most female characters are boiled down to love interests for Saito. As a result, they all come off incredibly weak.All in all, Zero no Tsukaima has potential. However, by focusing on the Harem instead of the infinitely more interesting elements it presents, it falls flat on its face and becomes boring after a while. expected the love relationship between Louise and Saito to be stretched out until the last season, with small tidbits of development here and there.

(though that could be an advantage for some). some acts got a bit tiresome after a while (mainly the constant whipping of saito).also i thought the characters changed slightly - particularly saito, who - in the first season - was your average kind, lovable character who's in love, changes to become quite perverted in the second season to the extent of annoyance, and start to question whether he really loves louise or not. on the other hand he becomes more serious at the end which makes up for it. another major change is siesta - the once gentle, kind, shy servant girl now becomes the determined rival to saito's love, which is quite annoying.also, some characters in the 1st season - tabitha and kirche especially, are hardly mentioned. their character (as well as louise) is hardly developed compared to the first season.personally the storyline was was worse than the first series - though that is expected as its hard to develop after youve had the good old girl meets boy and falls in love. the romance is still there, and does develop slightly, but is not focused on much (except towards the end), instead there are 2 other arcs, which seemed a bit too much to juggle in the one series. the overall storyline was quite predictable, apart from the end (which was pretty good and made up for the past).the action was more guns and machines centred rather than magic, and rather than school-based, it is battle-based. (though that again, could be an advantage)overall, the second series was pretty good, though it lacked ever-so-slightly slightly compared to the first season. well.it did still continue the good humour, storyline and humour too.however, there were many set backs.firstly the humour was much more ecchi.

Though this time the shift was HUGE...Okay so first thing first... the cons... and the biggest one of them all...THEY CHANGED THE EFFING CHARACTER PERSONALITIES!!!I mean in the first season... Saito was the typical lovable loser... he rarely did anything to make us not like him... This season... it's all different.. he's a HUGE perv.As for the other personality change, that would be Siesta... she goes from a good friend to the object of jealousy. Also other characters lose their spotlight, especially Tabitha.The other con that i'll mention is the objectionable scenes. In the 4th episode there was moment towards teh end that could be described as &quot;hentai with clothes on&quot;. Again this much ecchi elements weren't in the first seasonAnd more of personal peeve... the relationship btw Louise and Saito doesn't seem to advance AT ALL!!!Now for the prosWhen the show got into the 2nd half of the season... it became REALLY good. It added drama   elements and action. In fact episodes 7-9 had probably one of the best arcs i've ever scene. The finale was also quite good... quite epic and moving.I'll still be watching the 3rd season... hopefully it'll be more like the 2nd half of this season...So overall..1st half - 5/102nd half - 9/10leading to...7/10Similar to...Same list as first season Personal OpinionThis is another one of those &quot;shift in quality at middle&quot; animes.

As a 17 year old boy, I never really figured that this show would appeal to me. In fact, when I listed the few that I had watched and liked people tried to dissuade me from this genre.I ended up watching it after marathon watching TTGL and Code Geass for the first time, and then feeling really depressed at the end of both of them. I wanted something silly yet enjoyable and I figured I would give this a try.At the beginning of season one I was like... lame. I...can't stand Harry Potter (bear with me, I'm not saying its a Harry Potter knock off), so I was kind of put off by the whole magic school thing. But I stuck through it and ended up watching the whole first season in two sittings. After the first few episodes the characters start to develop a little more, as well as the story. By the end of season one I was watching it for the story more than the comedy.But enough about season one. ZnT: FnK took what the original season did with the story and made it 10x more thrilling and enjoyable. They kept the silliness exactly where I wanted it the whole time.I'm not ashamed to say this: by the end of FnK I was extremely emotionally invested in this shenanigan fest. Obviously I don't want to give anything away, but the end of this season had me on the edge of my seat, obviously not in a way Code Geass did, but in a less serious but just as enjoyable roller-coaster ride.Anyways, I know nobody probably reads reviews for this season, because you'll only be watching it if you saw the first season and liked it, but in my opinion this one blasted the first out of the water.Now I'm conflicted though... how am I supposed to enjoy season 3 knowing its the last one? can't stand Harry Potter (bear with me, I'm not saying its a Harry Potter knock off), so I was kind of put off by the whole magic school thing. But I stuck through it and ended up watching the whole first season in two sittings. After the first few episodes the characters start to develop a little more, as well as the story.

What I liked most was that they found a way to continue the plot in a way that continued the first one with the war, I'm just glad they didn't make a whole new story that came from nowhere which can be an easy mistake to make and people should really apreciate that more. Some people like to nit pick at it and complain but thats just because they want to have something to whine about, if one...things fixed then something else is wrong, just be happy we're getting more seasons. The ending really got to me, I loved seeing them finally admit how much they really care for each other, and what saito did (not spoiling it) almost made me and a lot of other people cry. while there are some smaller stories within the story going on I say just use your brain, a lot of people wanted depth now there's a little and they can't handle it, make up your minds. ZnT is great for everyone if you want laughs prepare to fall over rofl-ing, if you want a good story this one is well thought out, and if you want characters that are almost real then you're definately in the right place. Idc if there are animes with similar plots out there because this one does it right, time and effort were put into it, so sit back and just go along for the ride. btw stop complaining about louise whipping saito, it has never failed to make me laugh and I find it almost a must along with blowing him up. things fixed then something else is wrong, just be happy we're getting more seasons.

The first season was pretty entertaining and that hasn’t changed much in the second one either. The problem with season two is that most of the episodes follow an individual plot and build up the main storyline slower than what we have encountered in season one. There’s action going on, sure, but the whole bang starts during the last few episodes. Some may not care as much, but it will undoubtedly turn off a couple of less tolerant viewers.Surprisingly...enough, Saito and Louise’s relationship hasn’t changed much. From the very first episode it seems that they’re back to square one and Louise quickly goes back to whipping Saito as if nothing ever happened between them. I didn’t appreciate the lack of progress very much and Saito doesn’t help much either: even though he confessed his love to Louise, he keeps staring at other girls’ boobs and keeps the perverted thoughts coming. There are some nice little touches here and there, and there are a lot more significant scenes that depict the intimacy between Saito and Louise.There are also a couple of new characters introduced and some really add some edge to the overall feel of the series. First you’ve got Louise’s sisters Eléonore and Cattleya, who seem to start playing a significant role in the anime, but are later overlooked and neglected. Cattleya is of more of a gracious and good willed character than her other sisters and only resembles Louise due to her pink-coloured hair. Eléonore, on the other hand, is just as scornful and arrogant as her younger sister and she’s even got her own whip!By far the best character introduced is Agnès, the captain of Henrietta’s musketeer force. She is portrayed as being a tough military leader and her skill in swordsmanship is quite impressive. Many will consider her as being a tomboy and she does have a small story arc going on for a couple of episodes. Her presence throughout the anime is indeed significant and she does give the audience a nice break from Saito and Louise’s tiring situation. Another new character would be Julio Chesaré, a transfer student from Romalia who starts showing affection for Louise, which in turn leads to an interesting and funny conflict between him and Saito. There’s an entire episode devoted to his development as a character, but he turns out to be of little importance after that.The most negative thing about season two is Siesta’s character, which is completely butchered throughout the entire series. Many will recall her as the goodhearted love interest of Saito and a lot actually preferred her to Louise during the first season. There’s an obvious change this time around, though, and the character is completely butchered in season two. The kind and delightful girl suddenly turned into a lying and manipulative bitch that will do anything to sabotage Saito’s relationship with Louise and win Saito over. Not nice, not nice at all.As mentioned before, the story doesn’t progress too well and there are a lot of things that lack balance and don’t make too much sense. It’s still entertaining, though, which is always a plus, especially when you’re talking about anime. There are also a lot more ecchi scenes during season two – there are never enough anyway! The final episode is much more powerful and climatic than the one in season one and there’s a lot more emotion involved this time. There really isn’t any reason to skip Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi if you’ve seen season one and there’s enough entertainment to keep it from failing, even though it’s not as proficient in substance as the first season was. enough, Saito and Louise’s relationship hasn’t changed much.

But don't understand this wrong,Its not ALL war. Because there is Comedy in this anime (LOTS OF IT) and it alsohas its serious and intense moments. And some moments were you just think WTF!this anime has it all! An amazing story, good art, and most importantly, wellsomething That I feel is important that a lot of animes lack,Deaths of characters that you just love. Now dont get mewrong, I'm not for characters dying, but it gets all too boring whenyou can predict what happens in an anime. and this is not one of those animes.which is...exactly why I love it so much.The Genres of this anime or season are; : Action, Adventure, Comedy, Ecchi,Fantasy, Magic, Romance, School life and of course Harem!Now that is a lot of genres. and usually I dislike having many genres in an animeespecially because it confuses me quite often, its understandable for animeswhich have a lot of episodes like Naruto. But for a 12 episode anime to fitthis much in one season its really hard to do, or better yet, its hardto make it work well. But despite all that this anime did a really good job.Next im going to be talking about the soundtracks and the music,Im not sure about all of you, But this is something for me that is reallyimportant in any anime. If the music is not good and cant suit a certainmood, I probably wont watch the anime, Unless the story has me blown away.Music is what adds emotions to not only animes but also movies,This anime did a very good job on soundtracks and how they used themSo in the field of Soundtracks and Music I give this anime a 9/10The reason why I didn't give it a 10 is because my mind functions a littledifferent and I think other instruments could have been used. I will showyou guys an example of what I mean by that. So I will take a soundtrackthat is the same piece, but is played with a different tempo and differentinstrument, Some of you might know this soundtrack.Here is the First Sound track:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zj4VQy9k30And Here is the Second:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKYquaCRfIgSo I hope you understood what I meant by that. Moving on.Next is my perspective on art.The artwork on this anime was all too good, It could have been better,But in my opinion it could have ruined some parts in this anime, so stayingin between cartoon and a little more than mid realistic was a good choiceso Artwork gets a 10/10Next I want to mention the characters. While watching this animeI felt like there are a few characters that should not have been added.or at least should have had a different attitude to what they have.But progressing further into the anime, I did not feel this way any more,mainly because I got used to it, and also because I started thinking thatthis anime would be a little suckish if they were not there.Characters get 9/10Next will be the enjoyment:I feel that this is an anime that anyone will enjoy, while watching this animeI did not once look away to play with my rubix cube, or start kinda drawingon my desk or the nearest piece of paper like I would usually do,It was interesting and enjoyable throughout, there was never any boringmoments at allSo enjoyment also gets 10/10Lastly I would like to mention the actual story,There has not been a single anime that has less than 26 episodes in one seasonwhich is this breath taking. This anime is absolutely amazing and I cant believethat I hesitated to watch it for almost a whole year now. Absolutely incredible,there is not a single word  which can defy how amazing thisanime really is, Because it truly is amazing!10/10And overall rating for this anime is a 10/10 exactly why I love it so much.The Genres of this anime or season are; : Action, Adventure, Comedy, Ecchi,Fantasy, Magic, Romance, School life and of course Harem!Now that is a lot of genres. and usually I dislike having many genres in an animeespecially because it confuses me quite often, its understandable for animeswhich have a lot of episodes like Naruto.

It was on my to watch list for about a year. But tonight i\'ve watched the first two seasons through and through and now i\'m telling myself that i should have watched this so much sooner.The story really reminds me of fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. And in a lot of ways it is. To simplify, Zero no Tsukaima is like an opposite of fullmetal. Where fma had a lot of action and little romance, this has a similar story that is heavy on the romance and light on the actual action. And there\'s a purpose for this. Fma...most likely had a budget 2 maybe 3 times as big as the producers here. Thus we don\'t get a masterpiece like fma but it\'s still a really well done anime.But i do have some gripes with this show, especially with this season. It seems like most of the action at the end was really seriously cut off. The stuff you do see it pretty awesome, 1 v. 70,000, he kicks ass. But like i said before, the producers were probably like, ""ok guys, this is really getting pricey, wrap it up!"" but you know...in japanese.Another small small gripe i have, is that i wish they would use the familiars a bit more like in a battle or something. The only ones we really see are the dragons...and the others are more of a plot device. And whatever happened to the fat kid with the owl...did he die?Anyways, i think this is an anime definitely worth looking into if you\'re into romance with a good story. most likely had a budget 2 maybe 3 times as big as the producers here.

There's an even greater amount of romance in this series as well as drama. Again as the first it does not feature your cliched magic school academy in fact, it moves further away from that in...the second series and focuses more on the war that breaks out.The art was the same as the first so there int really much i have to say about the art of the series, other than it was flawless but not exceptional.I personally loved the opening of this series it was so touching and sentimental, but again no insert songs(not that i remember), had there been any it would have left a deep impression on me since the drama and romance was much more significant in this series.The characters carry on from the first story wth a few new ones coming in, for an anime with only 12 episodes i think they managed to give some depth to the new characters by focusing on them in certain episodes. In this series the relationship between Louise and Saito is brought out more and a level higherand this is especially evident towards the end of the series which was quite touching and sentimental, also there is a new couple which i won't spoil for you.I definitely enjoyed this season if not more than the first, the comedy still prevails to quite a good level which does not interfere or make the story lok childish. Even at the end, i found it quite hilarious and suitable ending to the series, of course there are some questions that are left unanswered, but the fact that a third season is coming out already solves that problem.Overall, The season was better than the first as they did not have to spend episodes introducing the characters again, however, as said of the first season, the series should be made longer as it lacks depth in some areas, but seeing that it is meant to be a romantic comedy its ok that there is a lack of seriousness in some cases, yet the true story is still brought out well with a good balance in the serious and comical side of the show, no doubt if you loved the first you will definitely enjoy this series. the second series and focuses more on the war that breaks out.The art was the same as the first so there int really much i have to say about the art of the series, other than it was flawless but not exceptional.I personally loved the opening of this series it was so touching and sentimental, but again no insert songs(not that i remember), had there been any it would have left a deep impression on me since the drama and romance was much more significant in this series.The characters carry on from the first story wth a few new ones coming in, for an anime with only 12 episodes i think they managed to give some depth to the new characters by focusing on them in certain episodes.

The previous season had some problems with one of the said problems being an uninteresting story. Another problem to address from the previous season would be the uninteresting characters, however this second season makes an attempt to spice up the story, and it does itself some justice...Story: 6/10Much like the first season, the second season of the \'Familiar of Zero\' series doesn\'t really have much of a exciting story. The story is still very cliched...and predictable. The last episode of this season was a little like that of the first season, which lead to me saying, ""Of course.""However to the shows credit, it did attempt to spice up the story by introducing a few new characters. One of these said new characters is named Agnes, a knight for Henrietta; the queen of Tristan. The show reveals that Agnes had a terrible past and is looking to seek revenge against the person that made her endure that terrible past.This leads to one of the shows major fixes, which is character development.Character: 7/10If anything, the second season of the show revolves around the character development between some of the characters such as Saito x Louise, and Agnes.Agnes wasn\'t that bad of a character, if anything she was probably the most memorable supporting character out of all of the other side characters. This is because the show teaches us about her past and what motivates her to achieve revenge.But besides Agnes, what\'s REALLY refreshing about this second season is the development of the relationship between Louise and Saito. Despite this relationship building being mostly in episodes 4, 10, 11, and 12 of this season, it was refreshing enough. The love-hate humor is still there, but because of the development between Louise and Saito, it made the humor more enjoyable because it makes the person watching this think, ""She really likes him, and she cares for him."" and vice versa with Saito.Art: 7/10The art factor of the season didn\'t change all that much, there just wasn\'t anything spectacular and eye catching. However, a memorable moment, at least for me, would be the flash backs of Agnes\'s past with the scenes involving fire. Was it memorable because it stuck out like a black bead in a container of white beads? For me, this was the reason why it was memorable. The animation for this part of the season was just a bit better then the rest of the other episodes.Sound: 6/10Regarding the section of sound, there wasn\'t anything memorable or worth talking about. To the anime\'s credit, the sounds were used appropriately when needed and gave the scenes the mood of the situation.Enjoyment: 8/10Despite this anime still having flaws, I fairly enjoyed this anime. I really enjoyed the last three episodes where the critical point of development between Saito and Louise bloomed (see what I did there? You gotta watch the last episode to get it.) Despite the ending being sort of like deus ex machina, it was still fun to watch.Overall: 7/10This second season of \'The Familiar of Zero\' is good. It fixes some of the points that were needed to be addressed in the first season. The points being character development, and art.Though the show still needs to fix its mediocre story, sound, and character development of the side characters (with the exception of Agnes).As much as I would love to recommend the third season of this show, I don\'t recommend it to everyone. I for one, being a fan of the show, watched the third season. The third season is similar to this second season of the anime, but with even more character development between Louise and Saito with the addition of an arc regarding a certain mage.If you are a fan of the show and want to see  the Louise x Saito pairing grow, I recommend you watch it.If you aren\'t a fan of the show, I recommend you watch at least episodes 1~5 and maybe episode 7 of season 3. Who knows? You might come to enjoy it. and predictable.

Despite this relationship building being mostly in episodes 4, 10, 11, and 12 of this season, it was refreshing enough. The love-hate humor is still there, but because of the development between Louise and Saito, it made the humor more enjoyable because it makes the person watching this think, ""She really likes him, and she cares for him."" and vice versa with Saito.Art: 7/10The art factor of the season didn\'t change all that much, there just wasn\'t anything spectacular and eye catching. However, a memorable moment, at least for me, would be the flash backs of Agnes\'s past with the scenes involving fire. Was it memorable because it stuck out like a black bead in a container of white beads? For me, this was the reason why it was memorable. The animation for this part of the season was just a bit better then the rest of the other episodes.Sound: 6/10Regarding the section of sound, there wasn\'t anything memorable or worth talking about. To the anime\'s credit, the sounds were used appropriately when needed and gave the scenes the mood of the situation.Enjoyment: 8/10Despite this anime still having flaws, I fairly enjoyed this anime. I really enjoyed the last three episodes where the critical point of development between Saito and Louise bloomed (see what I did there? You gotta watch the last episode to get it.) Despite the ending being sort of like deus ex machina, it was still fun to watch.Overall: 7/10This second season of \'The Familiar of Zero\' is good. It fixes some of the points that were needed to be addressed in the first season. The points being character development, and art.Though the show still needs to fix its mediocre story, sound, and character development of the side characters (with the exception of Agnes).As much as I would love to recommend the third season of this show, I don\'t recommend it to everyone. I for one, being a fan of the show, watched the third season. The third season is similar to this second season of the anime, but with even more character development between Louise and Saito with the addition of an arc regarding a certain mage.If you are a fan of the show and want to see  the Louise x Saito pairing grow, I recommend you watch it.If you aren\'t a fan of the show, I recommend you watch at least episodes 1~5 and maybe episode 7 of season 3. Who knows? You might come to enjoy it.', ""Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, the sequel to the previous season is the continuation of the epic saga of Saito Hiraga and Louise Valliere.The invasion of Tristain has been pushed back thanks to Louise and Saito and an ueasy calm settles over the land. Louise begins to practice Void Magic while Saito, having given up his chance to go home to Japan, tries to find ways to fill his time. But the wars are not over. The peaceful lull is but the calm before the storm, and soon Queen Henrietta must make a terrible choice between a temporary peace and a preemptive invasion...of Albion. Either way, Tristain is soon to be embroiled in war once more, and “Zero” and her Familiar will be right in the middle of it.The story is relatively new in some ways. New characters are introduced like pretty boy Julio Chesare, headstrong Agnes Chevalier de Milan, nasty Eleanor and precious Cattleya Valliere, and finally the seductive Sheffield. The continuation of the story is pretty new and brings a new sense of adventure in the series. I must admit though, Louise seems much more colorful and bright in personality compared to the last season with a black-and-white personality and obviously annoys some viewers at times.But the lackluster it holds is the lack of character importance for previous ones like Kirche, Tabitha, Montmorency, and Guiche. Some of them are just completely forgotten, hardly even referred to at times. The whole series mostly focuses not only on Saito and Louise's feisty relationship, but more on Agnes' past and her ambitions to avenge her past along with the mysterious history behind Mr. Colbert himself.Even if this was lacking in more story content, at least it made up for having some complexity in the plot, with some dramatic feelings in that one pivoting moment for Agnes to figure out what really happened in the past. This compensates that Zero no Tsukaima really isn't a two-dimensional show, it's got some good stuff in it. Even the pace to this anime is very smooth and flows perfectly along with the humor that includes Saito's naughty pleasure in cleavage and romantic comedy.The animation and art were good and very consistent. Background music was not the most impressive but it was pretty decent. Voice acting was good as usual, so I have to give props to the studio for at least making sure it continues to look and sound good.Honestly, season 2 starts off pretty much routine—and then I found it hard to sit through. First off, the relationship angle is fine between Saito and Louise—no problems, but the storyline seemed lack luster from the first. Maybe I expected too much. With the addition of newer characters—I had hope such like Julio and Louise’s Siblings. Fortunately—the last part was the only good part about it.The last scene was the critical moment in the season...not much to say but it's just a visualization of how beautiful Saito and Louise's love is.I give Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi a score of 9 because of how good it was to connect the series as a sequel. It left me a great feeling of satisfaction to once again to be worth my time to watch this. As I am a fan of romantic anime, this is probably one of my favorites to keep on to.

If they were to remain unchanged, it is apparent they take up an advance in...their relationship, the producers unwilling to take for the continuation of this franchise.In this season, more battles, inferred slaughters, introductions to viscous demented characters, but always in the end, did not go out of bounds from the usual kind of endings in each story, still the same as the first season in this regard.ps. sometimes, less is more, and more doesn't always mean less.

The second season had plenty of fillers, in my opinion. In the begginning, it was okay. Nothing was really happening. The story picked up abit in the middle. Near the end, however, it became more exciting, but there were some parts of it that you could have lived without. The ending of the last episode was touching, until the moment got ruined, but I'll let you guys figure that out, I wouldn't want to spoil for those hardcore fans.Art: I enjoyed the art in this anime, it...was very nice, and easy on the eyes. The designs were simple, yet they are excellent and appropriate for this kind of anime. Think about it, this is an anime that is surrounded by magic. You wouldn't want to see overdone graphics that makes it look worse, dispite the fact that it would be fully detailed and would have so much going on.Sound: Exceptional sound. Good magic sound effects. I think the begginning and ending was a nice touch. I didn't get tired of listening to them both.Character: The characters developed in good ways, than others. Louise became slightly more consious of her feelings towards Saito, she became more jealous, and has an ability of a magic that was thought to never exist. Saito, on the other hand, has become more of a pervert than I would have liked him to. His chest obsession has put me in positions where I became frusturated with him because of his growing perveted ways. The other characters such as Siesta and the princess became more developed in this anime, and are adding on to the story.Enjoyment: Saito pretty much killed half of my enjoyment, his growing pervertedness just ruins it for me. But I would like to say that I enjoy ZnT alot, and the third season doesn't look as bad.Overall: I would have given this a 7.5 if I could. This is an anime series worth watching. I would highly reccomend it for people who are open in the idea of a magical/slightly Harry Potter-ish anime with a good story, humor, fanservice GALORE, and interesting characters. was very nice, and easy on the eyes.

They should have just picked one and used the other as a supplement.Including season 1, we\'re currently 25 episodes into the series. So far, there are far too many crucial questions that have been left unanswered, such as: What is a Void mage? Why is it important? Why was Saito chosen as the reincarnation of Gandalfr? Why is Louise the only Void mage to appear in...centuries? Why now, as opposed to 10 years ago or 10 years into the future?Back story aside, let\'s look at current questions: Has Louise made any progress as a Void mage? Has Saito learned to harness his inner power?Important development questions like these are left unanswered, nor are they shown. We don\'t see either characters making progress. In an anime like Zatch Bell, we see definitive progress being made -- When Zatch improves through battle, we know he improved because we SEE him learning a new skill that are later actively used. Louise has a book of Void Magic. We see her use it once, and that\'s it. Has she learned any new skills or progressed further into the book? We dont know, because it\'s not shown.Other characters who are seemingly important actually end up having little to no relevance at all. When Julio was introduced as the 3rd member of Team Zero, I thought, ""Awesome, another character to finally add some dynamic"". Instead, he\'s been useful exactly twice, had maybe 1/10th the amount of lines even Siesta had, and hardly played a relevant role. No development with him is made, or shown on screen.Instead, silly scenes with Siesta are shoved on screen on practically every episode, despite it not furthering the series in any productive ways, and the plot dealing with the war is just dashed in as a side story.As stated at the start, I love the characters. Louise is like a magical version of Taiga from Toradora, and I love that. Saito is a perverted high schooler, who acts the part very nicely, though, it does get old once you see him doing the same thing (and getting beat for the same thing) an over abundant amount of times because the directors just can\'t seem to decide on what they want.That said, I still did enjoy the series, but these criticisms just keep me from giving it a high score. The series had so much potential and it really makes me sad that it\'s been squandered away. centuries?

I personally think that the 2nd season is better than the first..The Story, it obvious Zero no Tsukaima had a very stupid storyline chucked in with cute characters and etc. In fact, the plot is the totally messed up, or even worst, theres no plot to the story, it's totally about saito and louise's love and how they mate each other =OArt's not bad, I liked it. Probaly one of the strong point of Zero no Tsukaima. Characters are well drawn, although I prefer the manga version, which far more kawaii...than the anime version x3The sound are fine, although there are room for improvement on it. Actually of all the 3 season of Zero no Tsukaima, I liked this season's opening the most, motivated by some parts of the show heh heh heh.Characters are 50/50 to me, some are good, some are bad. The main reason for me to watch this show's because of louise and saito, louise's one of the best tsundere I ever seen before.. Saito is not bad though, although i really hate his pervert-ness, blah. Siesta is just.. irritating!! The bad guys is just.. retarded. Forget this show if you are expecting some big action from the bad guys because they can't do a shit at all.Enjoyment is... again, mixed. I can say nearly half of the episode are enjoyable, and the other half is not. The only worthwhile to watch this showto me is in fact... episode 4 and 12.. probably that the only 2 episode that made this season a good season.. otherwise I would rate this as 4 instantly. Siesta is such a annoying ass, why does she have to show up and ruin up the lovely atmosphere between saito and louise? Arghh!! I can't believe shes a character in the anime made to purely destroy your enjoyment (and make louise jealous).Well in overall, it's not bad... you got to watch the last episode though.. It's epic and you will never regret it, that episode (along with episode 4) drags the score up, I'll give it a 9!! than the anime version x3The sound are fine, although there are room for improvement on it.

If you're here from my review of S1, then let's get what you came for out of the way first.The good news is, Louise is more tolerable now, I often don't have a problem seeing her abuse Saito. Why is that? Well... thats the bad news... sadly the creator or whoever did S2 changed the respectful and reserved Saito into a pervert... (Disclaimer: Maybe he was always that way in the manga/LN? I don't read so can't say, if so then...he was changed in S1 and changed back for more accurate adaptation in S2) Remember I said those abuse scenes are done for laughs because the pervert gets what he deserves? Yeah, that's why most of the time it didn't bother me... the other reason being is most of the time she isn't using a whip anymore (Btw that got upgraded and used only once in S2) but instead using her magic which explodes so yeah, more funny now and much mroe tolerable than in S1 where it was just abuse, here its for actual anime humor. That said half the time it isn't his fault still (Misunderstandings and jealousy) And disclaimer in case you didn't read my S1 review, it's never ok to abuse someone irl nor is it funny, in fiction that's a different story and varies depending on the sitch. Anyway, although Saito is now a perv, I half suspect he's doing it on purpose to make Louise jealous but that's not confirmed yet and is just my theory. Hopefully S3 confirms my theory, I wouldn't count on it though being confirmed ever.The other bad news however for S2 is that in S1 we got to know and love/like characters, sadly, most of the OG cast are mostly side characters now... that really sucked but given the direction the anime went, while introducing new characters for the plot, it's understandable. Now for the GOOD news. The anime is no longer predictable. I mean sure you're going to know SOME of whats coming, but a LOT of stuff, I did not see coming. That + the more serious story really made S2 stand out FAR above what S1 had, but not everyone will like the direction the anime took. The good news is the new characters  are just as good (and maybe better) as the characters from S1, even S1 characters got some development like Siesta for example. (Ok, she got a LOT of development, she was mostly bland and just there in S1, NOT HERE!) Yes S2 is a BIG improvement over S1 and imo makes watching S1 more worth while given how good S2 was.That said S2 does have its own set of flaws, such as in one episode we see the death of someone, a character who loved that character that died then shows up the next episode seemingly back to their normal self. If you couldn't tell yes it was clear days if not weeks had passed and thats the thing am talking about here. It sometimes feels like we're missing an episode or in another episode why aren't these characters bringing up THAT? (Louise's house episode, just so you know what am talking about here) There's prolly more stuff but those are the major flaws. And now if you haven't seen S1 please stop reading because S1 spoilers are now going to be mentioned, feel free to finish reading this review if you see the end of S1. So, S2 is good, often times REALLY GOOD, but not everyone is going to like that war is now a thing and its been brought into the plot of the anime. It did make the anime better but there were times it didn't work. The characters in S2 however are what SELL S2, big time. Even Louise though she hasn't grown much, has gotten more likable and become a slightly better person. I really don't have much else to say about S2 due to spoilers so i'll end it here. I have no Love score this time like I did for S1 (See my review of S1 to get what am talking about if you wanna know) because S2's score is also the same score I would use for the love score and i don't use both scores if they match up lol Anyway,The Familiar of Zero: Knight of the Twin Moons (S2) I rate a 7.0 out of 10.0. Only reason it wasn't rated higher is due to the flaws I mentioned + them making Saito a pervert (Though if you can get over him being a pervert in S2, then that's one less flaw) he was changed in S1 and changed back for more accurate adaptation in S2) Remember I said those abuse scenes are done for laughs because the pervert gets what he deserves? Yeah, that's why most of the time it didn't bother me... the other reason being is most of the time she isn't using a whip anymore (Btw that got upgraded and used only once in S2) but instead using her magic which explodes so yeah, more funny now and much mroe tolerable than in S1 where it was just abuse, here its for actual anime humor.

Instead a bunch of new characters appears and they take up a decent amount of the story with their own problems to be solved. They...weren't bad, but it felt like they were also just casted aside for the most part too.One big thing is many of the characters really feel like they changed immediately right off the bat from the first episode. You notice mainly in Saito, he becomes a lot more of a perv, and Siesta's personality is that of obsession and that's all she's got. Louise becomes even more tsun and jealous at every step made.There were so many misunderstanding cliches which resulted in Louise disciplining Saito and I read it does not end throughout this series. Saito of course doesn't help, in-fact he actually becomes a worse person in my eyes with how he acts and Louise's short tempered reactions impact the plot which is bad.The ecchi factor as you can expect is increased a decent amount from the previous season and often feels unnecessary or out of place because of Saito blatantly going for it.Overall, I simply am not a fan of war archs in fantasy rom-coms they often feel rather forced throughout and have trouble with balancing both comedy and war with more serious tones. The show was really promising and was generally at times fun to watch, but it really takes a turn when you realize not much happens as you continue.

It got to the meat of the main two characters relationship early.  Too many times there are rom/coms that are great stories and wonderful shows but the relationship side doesn't happen until 3 episodes to the end of the entire series leaving you wanting to know what happened in the end. An example of this is Toradora.  The show was outstanding.  Art superb, Story awesome, Characters wonderful.  I loved every minute of it but you never found out how it all ended.  You had...to assume it was a happily ever after.  It was the same with My Little Monster  ZnT:KnF gave you a great idea where they stand early on and then ends so strong with the final two episodes of the season being emotionally moving.  I just started the rom/com genre and if other shows have this formula then I will really enjoy this genre.  Now, don't get me wrong...They still have a lot more to flesh out before I am happy with the final ending but with the pace this show is going, I'm sure I won't be disappointed at all. to assume it was a happily ever after.

Now, don't get me wrong...They still have a lot more to flesh out before I am happy with the final ending but with the pace this show is going, I'm sure I won't be disappointed at all."", ""For those who thought that this was not as good as the first season, they are definitely wrong. This is just as good if not even better thanks to the last episode. They really didn't develop the character stories as much and the story slowly progressed without much movement but it was still quite good. The last episode was really good with the emotional setup but I would have changed the ending. "", ""Futatsuki no Kishi inevitably invites comparison to its predecessor. Evaluating its merits independently, it seamlessly continues from the first season, introducing new characters like Agnes. Initially, these additions dominate screen time with subplots, but this diminishes over the show's length. Saito and Louise's relationship progresses noticeably, raising important questions without spoilers.Animation quality is commendable but not exceptional, with basic character details and consistent side-view conversations. Soundwork echoes the first season, featuring satisfactory but not memorable themes. New opening and ending themes are more enjoyable. Familiar Academy residents receive less screen time, and new characters, while generally acceptable, may have unconventional traits. Siesta's portrayal seems less...intelligent, possibly for fan service.Fan service increases in quantity but not quality, occasionally feeling contrived, particularly Saito's breast obsession. The ending hints at more eccentric characters in the third season, culminating in a somewhat ridiculous conclusion. Despite hit-and-miss fan service, the second season is a worthwhile addition for harem and fantasy comedy enthusiasts. It delivers moments of laughter and emotional resonance, almost as enjoyable as the first season, with room for improvement in story progression. Prolonged pacing and excessive fan service could potentially jeopardize the show's quality. intelligent, possibly for fan service.Fan service increases in quantity but not quality, occasionally feeling contrived, particularly Saito's breast obsession.

"", 'Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no KishiThe Familiar of Zero: The Knight of the Twin MoonsThe second season and what I feared happened.

The drama/storyline-oriented crowd here will be very happy as we go through this season. It\'s much harder to not spoil this season than it was in season 1 because this one features much more crucial story events. It\'s not yet a masterpiece, and it sure has dull villains, but thankfully there are finally more layers added...to the plot here. And kudos for the interesting dynamics between Saito and Louise. 8/10.ART:Slight (though not easily noticable) improvement, mostly in character design and magic animation. 7/10.SOUND:Improved overall. Not a big fan of the OP and ED but that\'s just personal taste so I won\'t be biased, but there are some BGMs that really seemed to blend in very well with the setting and fan its flames. Voice acting is great as always. 8/10.CHARACTER:Worsened. A lot.Saito and Louise\'s dynamics are very interesting here as I said, but when looking at each one standalone it seems like their development is getting dumped in favor of tiresome jokes. On her own, Louise is still a goddamn abusive tsundere and immediately after any sign of redemption, even the biggest ones imaginable, it\'s nullified by the same tsundere trope traits and her depth is cancelled. Saito is not much better, his depth and dedication are too often cancelled out by resorting to the tiresome ""omg tits"" gag. But I\'ll save my rant about the tactless humor for later.If your favorite from season 1 is Kirche, Tabatha, or Guiche, then I have bad news for you, because their appearances are borderline cameo. They\'re not ruined, though there are some points which felt like wasted potential. I\'m a bit glad that Tabatha stopped being basically the deus ex machina of the anime but... eh, spoilersThe new characters are OK. Agnes has an interesting arc which first seems like a filler but in the end of the day I think is fair to include. Except for her it seems that the new characters get just the right amount of screen time.The villains are straight out boring in comparison to season 1, but the one who saw the worst drop of quality is beyond all doubt... Siesta. Oh my, the horror. The script massacred her character and for the majority of the season seeing her behavior was no less than agonizing. She was severely downgraded to a thirsty, desperate, and one-dimensional character. Thankfully she seems to partly restore by the end of the season so it\'s nothing that can\'t be fixed, but I really, really hope that they didn\'t dare this again in the upcoming seasons.There is just one character in this show (which I won\'t specify because it\'s quite a big spoiler) that went through a massive, sudden development. That character\'s arc left me seriously surprised and I salute whoever came up with that idea.I wanted to rate Character this season 5/10, but that last one I mentioned alone is in my honest opinion better than all other character developments (or lack of any, in most cases) combined, and I feel obliged to show at least some sort of recognition to it and therefore raise it to 6/10.ENJOYMENT:Overall, I enjoyed it a bit more than season 1. Unlike the latter, this season somehow managed to get a few good laughs out of me, especially in the first few episodes. Many jokes are reused far too much to the brink of being annoying (we get it, he\'s a ""ばか犬"", we don\'t need to see it physically happen while the credits roll), but when they did come up with something original or managed to modify the usual jokes into a bit more clever one, they did succeed in making me laugh.Despite the disappointing character development and several issues I have with the very end of the season, the storyline got it to break even in my personal experience and I did find this season to be fun to watch. 8/10.Final verdict - if you made it this far, watch it.

It's also magical...i actually watch this since i was a kid.. i really love it..I recommend it to the children who loves watching comedies... "", 'There aren\'t many reviews for this show, so here\'s another.This is a pure comedy, so the story isn\'t really a focus in any way, but let\'s cover everything:Storyline wise, Akazukin Chacha, or ""Little Red Riding-Hood"" Chacha, is decent at best. Over the course of the series itself, it attempts to construe a vague, generic demon-king versus royal family/heroes of the land type of story. And it does a very good job of achieving what it set out to do, which is to both have an excuse to fight enemies over the course of the show, and to cause conflict during the episodes, giving the characters...something to react to. - 4Art in the show is arguably pretty good for the date and presumable budget. It takes a lot of money to make animation, and it\'s artwork is at a far better level of quality than some more popular anime that came out even a year or two later. (Detective Conan, for example). And it\'s about equal to others, like Dragonball.That said, it\'s nothing special. They did a very good job at distinguishing characters, but really they only animated the ones from the manga. It\'s obvious they made a good effort for comedic impact, though. Who can forget Principal Urara\'s eyes? - 6For sound, we have some adequate background music, nothing too memorable. It plays in the correct moments and doesn\'t feel contrived, so there\'s that. There are also the highlights like the ""Team Theme"" and the ""Panda Song"". The opening and ending songs are another story, and are excellent pieces of music. Both the opening, which never changes, and the latter two endings are catchy, fun and upbeat, all in a good way, just like the show\'s tone. The second ending is especially good, and extremely catchy, definitely worth listening to on an MP3 player. - 7The characters are a strong point of this anime. You have the blunt, selfish and frankly ""beepy"" (Think Ayumi from Conan or Hikase from Nichijou) Chacha herself, who the show would suffer a lot from without. Though that would go for most show\'s main characters, heh. Her lines, reactions, blunt and selfish verbal assaults are honestly some of the funniest parts of the show. If you don\'t like her, which I find really hard to believe, (maybe you just don\'t understand how she is and think she\'s coming off as annoying? I pity you if so), chances are you won\'t like the rest of the show.The brave, always hungry and a little dense, werewolf Riiya. His voice actor (someone from a boy band) did a great job, and suited him like no one else ever could have, making him sound at varying times energetic, a little slow on the uptake, lazy, cowardly, and bold.The wizard in training, the good boy Shiine-chan. (Soujiro and Sera Masumi in the Kenshin and Conan anime series, respectively), is always hilarious. From his vain attempts to show off in hopes of impressing Chacha, his love for work and study, his secret perverted ways, and his adorably-embarrassed side, you\'ll probably come to like Shiine-chan.Then there\'s Seravy-sama, the greatest wizard in the world. He\'s humorously superior, lacks common sense sometimes, and has a big thing for blonde curly hair and his favorite doll, which might actually be alive, Lizbeth.From his ""just-passing-through"" disguises (""I\'m only a just-passing-through master pastry chef!""), to his slightly negligent but mostly responsible upbringing of Chacha, and the way they fit each other like a glove, he\'s a very likable, enjoyable character that\'ll have you laughing along with his antics.The rest of the characters, Yakko, Marin, Orin, Rascal-sensei (Kindaichi from Kindaichi Case Files), are all characterized well and have matching seiyuu. In fact, I can\'t think of one seiyuu that doesn\'t fit their role perfectly, and they all seemed to have fun with the show, too, which is another pro. The crew got lucky with the cast, for sure. - 8The real enjoyment are the jokes. There\'s slapstick humor, sure, and plenty of it, but the most hilarious part is the interactions between the characters and the way they react to things. If seeing Chacha tear up because Riiya accidentally called her a fool, and then in the next episode turn around and insult both of her friends like it was perfectly natural like the comicly selfish person she is, or watching kids get drunk and summoning a bunny-dragon to take down the bad guys, or finding out Chacha can rewind and playback memories in slow motion (that was a classic), is not your idea of humor, then the show probably isn\'t for you.If it is, though, you\'ll find it absolutely hilarious, because it does an outstanding job at that specific type of humor. - 10Overall I give this series an 8. something to react to. - 4Art in the show is arguably pretty good for the date and presumable budget.

Bartender: Kami no Glass,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53407/Bartender__Kami_no_Glass,"[""Ah, Bartender—a timeless classic reborn in the form of a remastered anime, much like the beloved Spice and Wolf this season.At first glance, you might be tempted to write it off as just another run-of-the-mill series about alcohol. But oh, dear reader, it is so much more than that. Bartender is a journey into the heart and soul of libations, each drink carefully selected to match the patron's mood and tell a story of its own.Forget your overpowered heroes and flashy romances—Bartender is a different breed of anime altogether. It's a collection of short stories, each one a poignant tale of everyday people and their...encounters with the magical elixirs served up by our enigmatic bartender.What sets Bartender apart is its ability to create a sense of calm and tranquility, a refuge from the chaos of the world outside. As you sink into your seat and take a sip of your drink, you'll find yourself transported to a realm where time slows down and worries melt away.It's hard to put into words just why Bartender is so captivating. Perhaps it's the way each episode weaves together the threads of human experience with the artistry of mixology. Or maybe it's the comforting familiarity of the bar setting, a place where strangers become friends over a shared glass.Whatever it is, one thing's for certain: if you're looking for an anime with a chill vibe to unwind to, Bartender is the perfect choice. So sit back, relax, and let the soothing ambience wash over you. Cheers to good company and even better drinks—enjoy! encounters with the magical elixirs served up by our enigmatic bartender.What sets Bartender apart is its ability to create a sense of calm and tranquility, a refuge from the chaos of the world outside.

Cheers to good company and even better drinks—enjoy!"", '""Do you know the meaning of the word \'bartender\'? \'Bar\' means a perch to rest on, and \'tender\' means gentle. So \'bartender\' means \'a gentle perch.\'""This is a line from the first episode that sets the premise and the tone of the show, romanticizing bartending as a sophisticated and almost therapeutic vocation. Except that I am pretty sure that is not where the word comes from. A bartender is the person who “tends” the bar, as in “taking care of,” similar to ""tending to a patient."" This may sound like a strange nitpick, but it encapsulates the show for me.The show is at its most...interesting when it “talks shop” and explores the many kinds of cocktails, flavor, technique and bartending philosophies. If this is enough for you, you will have a good time. But in almost all other areas the show is awkward and unsatisfying.The writing in the bar scenes feels very simplistic for what is supposed to be a conversation between adults about refined tastes and hardships in life. Sasakura, the genius bartender and the main character, explains every single detail about what he is thinking, what he is doing and what he means by it. Nothing is left unsaid or ambiguous so that the customer (and the viewer) can contemplate and interpret. Sasakura speaks more through words rather than through his drinks, which I feel goes against the premise of the show. When he mixes in some trivia and some life lessons, he often comes across as preachy rather than sympathetic. The stories that the customers bring to the table are also straightforward, like a rough day at work or doubts about a career choice. There are no layers to peel back, unusual personalities, or particularly complicated circumstances.These interactions may be more enjoyable if the characters are charismatic or likable, but that is not the case here. Sasakura is just a “cool guy,” always poker-faced, both at work and outside of work, and he rarely says or does anything that reveals anything about himself. It is revealed in the first episode that he has some eccentric sides to him, but those have not been brought up again. I think his character is intended to be an enigma of sorts, but at the moment he just comes across as dull. Other characters are completely flat and get one-word descriptions like “perfectionist” or “workaholic,” if they are lucky. There seems to be an overarching story about recruiting Sasakura to work at a newly-open bar, but there is not much to it, and little progress has been made.Unfortunately, not much is going on in the art and animation department, either. The cocktails themselves look nice, but the rest of the art is very bland; the bars look mostly flat and featureless. Characters are not very expressive and barely move, and most scenes unfold with characters sitting still and flapping their mouths. I understand that this show is a drama where people sit down and have drinks, but it does not look like the director is trying to do anything creative here at all.I have not read the manga or seen the original anime adaptation, but I knew that they were well-regarded, and this show has not met my expectations so far. Going back to the “bartender” quote, I feel similarly about the show itself; it feels mildly pleasant but does not hold up to a closer look. This show is just not doing anything nearly as interesting or “elegant” as the subject matter itself, which makes the little annoyances all the more glaring. If you simply want to see great-looking cocktails, or if you want a calm, relaxing show to chill out to, you may enjoy this show. If you are looking for anything beyond that, I really doubt this show will deliver. interesting when it “talks shop” and explores the many kinds of cocktails, flavor, technique and bartending philosophies. If this is enough for you, you will have a good time. But in almost all other areas the show is awkward and unsatisfying.The writing in the bar scenes feels very simplistic for what is supposed to be a conversation between adults about refined tastes and hardships in life. Sasakura, the genius bartender and the main character, explains every single detail about what he is thinking, what he is doing and what he means by it. Nothing is left unsaid or ambiguous so that the customer (and the viewer) can contemplate and interpret. Sasakura speaks more through words rather than through his drinks, which I feel goes against the premise of the show. When he mixes in some trivia and some life lessons, he often comes across as preachy rather than sympathetic. The stories that the customers bring to the table are also straightforward, like a rough day at work or doubts about a career choice. There are no layers to peel back, unusual personalities, or particularly complicated circumstances.These interactions may be more enjoyable if the characters are charismatic or likable, but that is not the case here. Sasakura is just a “cool guy,” always poker-faced, both at work and outside of work, and he rarely says or does anything that reveals anything about himself. It is revealed in the first episode that he has some eccentric sides to him, but those have not been brought up again. I think his character is intended to be an enigma of sorts, but at the moment he just comes across as dull. Other characters are completely flat and get one-word descriptions like “perfectionist” or “workaholic,” if they are lucky. There seems to be an overarching story about recruiting Sasakura to work at a newly-open bar, but there is not much to it, and little progress has been made.Unfortunately, not much is going on in the art and animation department, either. The cocktails themselves look nice, but the rest of the art is very bland; the bars look mostly flat and featureless. Characters are not very expressive and barely move, and most scenes unfold with characters sitting still and flapping their mouths.

That said, this is type of show it's easier to write about it since it's not a Shonen or a thriller where the overall story can be determine how I feel about a show when it ends.This is mostly a slice of life adult anime. I say adult since it revolves around drinking, and dealing with problems you go through as an adult such as your career, relationships, adult stress, etc. You won't see issues like upcoming semester exams to getting your first girlfriend.Also as I mentioned, it revolves around...drinking. The coolest element with the alcohol and drinks is everything they discussed are all real. For example the main characters go to a real distillery that actually exists in Japan in one episode. The bottles they show are real brands and different types of liquor. Even the different cocktails they show off are real, and you can look it up how to make it yourself. I really appreciate that sense of realism, and in a way educational since they describe the differences in the types of alcohols and what is in a drink.Meanwhile the show is mostly about a very good bartender who is being pursued by a couple people at a nearby hotel who want him to help open up and run their bar at the hotel. Especially for international guests and wanting someone who can understand a customer's wants and needs well. For the most part he has refused, but between him and these two people, others slowly become a part of their story from other nearby bars and bartenders to other customers. The best way to describe it is you have the bartender as the main character, then a supporting cast with one off guests in an episode that drives the story and theme.If anyone has seen the Japanese drama, Midnight Diner, it is similar how you have episodes with different people while revolving the core cast. Personally I like that, and it's a nice change of pace from the typical Shonen or action shows.Overall I recommend it if you don't mind slice of life shows, and especially aim towards an older audience. It's a show to touch upon everyday life with the bar as the setting. It's not for everyone, and it's not perfect by any means. But it's an enjoyable and relaxing show to have with a drink. drinking.

This adaptation is way closer to the original and, yes, Sasakura Ryuu is a silly airhead when he\'s not working. That\'s what makes him as a character work for me. The 2006 anime took the episodic approach and removed basically all of the story and character development except the client stories. It was cool, ngl, but there\'s so much more to Bartender, and this version of it seems to take all (or at least most) of it. Ryuu is more than a cool placeholder behind the bar...counter, he\'s a character with a full personality: a genuinely kind and caring airhead with a smidge of a dark past (won\'t go into spoiler territory) he has overcome but professional and competent at his job.

Episodes are formulaic, and essentially is a toned down, more adult iteration of food wars.Character makes drink, gives drink to another character(s), takes a sip, insert surprised, orgasmic reaction while exclaiming how the drink is so good! Then you will get a long winded exposition dump-- what ingredients were used and the methods used and some sort of backstory behind the drink or character making the drink.Let\'s be real, no one watching this actually cares about the little details, and whether or not...they\'re even true.

Why is it getting remade almost an entire 18 years later? Other than how it might be connected to the fact that 18 is the legal drinking age in many countries, it beats me.I'd heard about this new anime coming out that focused on bars and drinks and all that, and I just had to check out the original. And guess what? I genuinely liked it! I'm not even old enough to drink,...and tbh, I'm pretty scared of alcohol, but getting to learn about different drinks, their origins, and the struggles of troubled individuals who wander into Eden Hall, all in such a cozy, homey atmosphere, was so refreshing.So, now that this remake's finally airing, what are my impressions of it? Well, I'm conflicted.Now, writing a preliminary review having only watched three episodes so far is kind of unfair in my eyes now, but WHAT THE HELL happened???? Nothing seems very comforting anymore and nothing is interesting. It just feels like some sort of odd ASMR instead, because the inside of the bar is so much more goddamn quiet, it's literally almost unnerving. The 2006 Bartender was one of those anime where it was soothing, and even lulled me to sleep a few times (because it was so chill, not because it was dead boring), but I just felt so oddly alert during every moment inside the bar in this one, and this feeling is strengthened even more by how off the characters and their dialogue seems, and the new sort of personality they gave Sasakura, our lovely bartender. It's like they made him so much more of a goofy idiot than actually mature and collected. Like, okay, maybe he regains himself when he's bartending, but there's still that lingering new aura around him that I just find so unfitting of him, and that really disrupts the already off-putting atmosphere.I'm glad they didn't take the core aspects of Bartender away, though at least not yet. It still seems to have the same formula of a stressed-out drinker coming in for a drink, and having their worries completely washed away by Sasakura's exquisite skills in creating the perfect drink for any individual. Sometimes there's a bit of drama, sometimes it's just that smooth-rolling, straightforward experience. This time, though, there seems to be a goal of trying to get Sasakura to work at a bar, specifically on the top floor of a building. The problem is, he has a fear of heights, and refuses every time he is asked. This is an example of how they made him kind of dumb, but hey, there's a little underlying goal there. But I want my Gary Sue ikemen Sasakura Ryuu in perfect form!!!!I'm not really liking this new adaptation of Bartender so far, but I'm not necessarily hating it either. It's got its unwanted changes in there, but it's not like it's a completely different anime. I'm holding on to hope that by chance this new adaptation could turn in a good direction soon, but that's gonna be a wait.

As much as the bartenders serves drinks, they also provide entertainment for those who desire it, and could be good listeners for the more somber customers - this is one of the many more points that this show proves.This protagonist of this show is Sasakura Ryu - the prominent and charismatic bartender of Eden Hall, the so called ""Glass of the Gods"". In his...representation, we see a lot of the before mentioned traits that his line of work expects him to have, but on top of that he\'s person who is extremely perceptive of his surroundings, and his clientele\'s physical and mental state, which is his personal style. On top of that, he uses his craft to cater and refine the cocktails he makes so that they\'d cater to everyone\'s personal desires, altering or straight up re-imagining the drink in new form and way to provide perfect service to those that are in need of it.But this story is one that is not focused on him alone - rather, it presents a view point to the whole bar entertainment industry and the proper etiquette while being in that kind of establishment, which is certainly a reflection of the experiences of Jou Araki, the mangaka that this work is inspired from.It\'s impossible to not mention the first adaptation of Bartender from 2006, and their differences. The newer work sticks closer to the source material, and presents us one more inexperienced and flamboyant version of our protagonist - his laid back demeanor and more carefree attitude is hardly evident in the previous version, in which we saw him as this gallant, refined and soft spoken gentleman. The support cast is far more evident and has much more screen time than in the original series, but they feel like much different people, more playful and silly. In short, the current adaptation feels as it is much more lighter, relaxing watch, but in the same way, a bit more prone to fit in tropes - many of the characters behave and express like caricatures of their former selves, including the protagonist. Also this adaptation is much more focused on the story\'s plot and it\'s development, while the original show provided more of an episodic, self contained vignettes of stories, but the way that they were developed, and the way that it used clever, often mind-bending cinematography, as well as much more somber, almost psychological approach, made the series absolutely phenomenal for the niche of watchers that enjoy exactly this, myself included.The dark and enveloping night, the bright street lights in defiance of that, the soft and comforting voice of the narrator, exploring yet another human fate on the canvas of this episode - a well defined character, often lost in his desires that they can hardly express properly, and the feint, gentle smile of Ryu, accepting their presence as yet another customer he\'d provide his craft for, by this way alleviating their anxieties. In contrast to this, the remake of Bartender provides story that is a bit more simple to consume, and is a bit more cheerful and joyful. In the same sense it also means that this newer interpretation is more appealing to the casual watchers who are not quite ready for the contemplative psychological approach to the version that 2006 has, but in the same sense that doesn\'t diminishes the current adaptation\'s qualities.In a sense, both adaptations provides two sides of the same coin, and in my opinion, both deserve our attention and praise. representation, we see a lot of the before mentioned traits that his line of work expects him to have, but on top of that he\'s person who is extremely perceptive of his surroundings, and his clientele\'s physical and mental state, which is his personal style.

Bartending isn’t the same as high school volleyball or competitive piano—many of the tropes that this show attempts to use feel awkward and forced because the parallels between bartending and sports/music are flimsy at best. The resulting drama feels contrived and out of place among working adults.I think Bartender: Kami no Glass works best in the background. It’s chill and relaxing, but it doesn’t reward you for getting invested. I enjoy it most when I’m not asking too many questions and...my brain is turned off.

Mostly often they over focus on the exposition topic, being food, science, etc; and leave it...lacking in any other aspect of story, character development and world building, creating some repetitive routines and becoming stale and boring very fast.A big one that does this well it\'s Doctor Stone, having its moments of exposition, but relying on the actual now and then of the story, even when focused on the scientific development.

Not only that, but the show has an air of pretentiousness when they\'re talking about drinks and bartending as a job. Especially when Sasakura serves drinks to elderly people or any persons in an authoritative position then they say some random shit like:""Mmm your drink is lacking a face""""your beefeater doesn\'t have enough character""What the hell does that even mean? lines like this just make me cringe because nobody in real life...would talk to a bartender like this. So pretty much, the difference between an average drink to an amazing one is either a slight change in temperature or whether it\'s stirred too much or too little.In real life, yes this is a real thing. A drinks temperature can drastically change how the drink will taste but the way it\'s explained just seems so high-sounding. Bartending isn\'t some kind of craft you need to master where every drop counts and the temperature needs to be exact, it\'s just a job to serve alcohol but it\'s glorified too much.Lets say, you\'re working a regular job like a cashier and a somebody tells you that you\'re lacking ""a face"" when serving customers, then starts telling you how you SHOULD be doing your job, they\'re being a pretentious asshole. It would be so much easier if they just said ""your drink is too warm, that\'s why it tastes different"" but no, they gotta say some eloquent nonsense to make it seem profound.I had a feeling I would run into this kind of annoying behaviour when watching this show and I was right. would talk to a bartender like this.

It would be so much easier if they just said ""your drink is too warm, that\'s why it tastes different"" but no, they gotta say some eloquent nonsense to make it seem profound.I had a feeling I would run into this kind of annoying behaviour when watching this show and I was right.', ""After watching the first episode I immediately fell for the show's charm and atmosphere so I started reading the manga right after the first episode.Only after reading it have I realised that this adaptation doesn't follow it at all, I quite liked the short story-esque with an overarching plot  in the background formula that the manga had, and this creative liberty of the studio to create a more connected story just doesn't sit right with me.Until it is done airing I can't really recommend it to someone that liked the source material, but I also can't say that the show is awful for an...anime only. anime only."", ""Only in an anime can you make the art of making cocktail this sensual. My alcohol lover senses got seduced from the first scene with the ice crack and that sexy ASMR sound. lol I feel like this anime is a campaign to promote bar hopping & it works too well on me.The show got an old school vibes to it where you usually seen in shows about people who's a master of their field. It's more about diving into that specific world/field than a plot driven story, which is interesting in a different way. I haven't read the original manga though it reminds me...of Drops of God where feuds and emotional baggages can be solved by the right alcohol; the approach here is way less dramatic. Of course that's not how real life works, but it's comforting to watch.The show direction is also super immersive. Since each scene are slower pace, it makes you feel like you're in the bar waiting for the next drink to try. The art just enhance every drops of lemon, every shine of ice, & the warmth of smoke. Enhanced by the ASMR sound & calming voice of our bartender, it just put you in a resting mood after a long day just like a good glass does. of Drops of God where feuds and emotional baggages can be solved by the right alcohol; the approach here is way less dramatic.

Suki tte Ii na yo.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14289/Suki_tte_Ii_na_yo,"['Oh how I wanted to say, I love you to Sukitte Ii na yo...  but I just can’t because you’re a flat two dimensional romance that just didn’t live up to my expectations.  It really is a shame, because Suki na yo had a tremendous amount of potential and gave us some things we don’t often get to see in the romance genre.  But as the series winds down I found myself lamenting what could have been.It’s hard for me to be too hard on the romance anime plot premise, I mean they have pretty much already all been done before and...they are all mostly silly as well.  Suki na yo is no different, with the unlikely story of the hot and most popular guy in school falling for a shy, friendless loner who kicked him down the stairs because she mistakenly thought he flipped her skirt.  The beginnings of true and lasting love if I ever saw it.  The girl Mei, and the boy Yamato, both have some interesting personality issues on the surface and despite the silliness of their meeting there was some enormous amount of potential in their relationship.  However this is sadly mostly wasted over the course of the story.Now here is where Suki na yo is a bit different from its other romance cousins.  For the most part our lead characters are in a relationship together from the beginning to the end of the series.  The typical format is 99% courting with the eventual payoff at the end when our little lovebirds finally realize their mutual affections.  While it can often be frustrating when it is drug out with silly misunderstandings and character cockblocks at least by then we have a clear understanding why they both love each other. The show is called Say I love you, but it should probably more aptly called Say why I love you.Even though I have some pretty serious complaints about the way the shows romance and plot unfolds, I can’t say I didn’t enjoy watching this series.  But when you compare it with its peers within the genre and even shows that were airing during the same time as this, it comes across as distinctly average and ordinary.Much in the same way as the story is underwhelming, so are the series main characters.  A romance is by nature very character driven and if we don’t get compelling leads it’s pretty difficult to care if they end up falling in love with each other.  Mei is your standard ""everyman"" kind of girl typical in shoujo romances.  She’s cute, though not particularly beautiful, and pretty much average in every other way.  She’s a nice girl with a strong spirit but very vulnerable as well.  Exactly the kind of girl most people can relate too and can root for as well.  It’s sweet how she slowly comes out of her shell and makes friends and learns to trust people again as well.  Even though this mostly comes across pretty corny and clichéd.  Though hell I like corny and clichéd anyway.Yamato is less interesting and in many ways is also your typical bishounen leading man.  Though I will give him some credit for breaking the trend and not being a cold, aloof, and unfeeling jerk.  You get the feeling most of the time he has genuine feelings for Mei but at other times he’s actions around her seemed to be a bit condescending and they he was treating her more like a pet and as an equal partner.  I felt some aspects of his personality were also very inconsistent, especially later in the series.  For a guy who came across as supremely confident he was surprisingly weak willed at times and his distrust of Mei\'s feelings at times was implausible considering what the pair had been through to that point already.The supporting cast is the weakest link though and stereotypical shoujo fair.  This plays in to the weakness of the plot but basically the same themes are repeated multiple times over the course of the story.  Girl appears, of course hopefully in love with Yamato, drama unfolds, girl is rejected and our leads love continues.  And the rejected gets new love and becomes best friends with our dear Mei.  While I mostly liked the supporting characters they simply lack the depth for them to be actually interesting.  Then of course you have to look past the unlikelihood that two romantic rivals are going to be besties afterwards, particularly when one side was involved in some pretty nasty schemes and bullying.Despite all these flaws though what Suki na yo really does best is both its artwork and musical soundtrack.  Both are typical of the genre but I really did love both of the songs.  The seiyuu cast is comprised of mostly veterans but none of them are real stars.  I thought they did solid, if unspectacular work.  While the artwork may not be a masterwork, it is very fluid and reality based, with clothes and body types that stay in the realm of possibility.Even though in the end I have quite a few complaints about Suki na yo, it’s still a good watch.  If you’re really starved, as I was, for a romance anime with a sweet ending and are not demanding to be shown some that’s never been seen before then you should have a good time with it as well. they are all mostly silly as well.

It really doesn\'t bring anything new to the table. You have your awkward girl, the hot guy who seems to like her, and some competition for his affections. Pretty standard formula.However, this anime actually accomplishes it WELL. Where it stands out is how dead on and absolutely accurate it depicts falling in love HARD the first time. Even if you\'ve been in love several times, you\'ll find something in Mei and Yamato\'s relationship that may bring tear to your eye.Mei is a good character. Several female leads in this...sort of role invariably fall into the ""Mary-Sue"" trap and end up just being an empty shell. What makes Mei stand out is the decisions she makes and how she reacts to the situations around her. Throughout watching all the episodes, I watched Mei make the same decisions I would of as a girl in her position in high school. She is realistic and very easy to sympathize with.Yamato\'s character could have easily suffered from the same sort of stigma that befalls his character archetype. The typical, popular, good-looking guy. This could have easily turned into a 13 episode version of the movie ""She\'s All That"" but his character keeps it from doing so. Yamato actually comes off like he has an absolutely beautiful soul. He strikes you as that rare individual that is good inside and out and instead of ""making over"" the heroine in his popular image he seems like he was looking for someone like her all along. Then he works to get others to see she\'s actually a good person the way she is.Their budding relationship is realistic as well, save for the part with Yamato\'s little sister. That part came out of left field but I digress. Watching them learn from each other and grow is entertaining and you want nothing more than to root for their happiness while watching. The show leaves you with warm fuzzy feelings inside that stick around for a while.The art is gorgeous and the music complements it perfectly. The intro took me a bit to get used to but once I did I found it very cute. Overall, even if you\'re the type to shun the typical ""romance, shoujo, slice of life"" anime - PLEASE try his one.

It\'s worth it.', 'Say \'I Love You.\'Where do I even start with this anime. The title even gives off an exceedingly romantic, unrealistic atmosphere. If there was ever a competition for ""The Most Generic Shoujo,"" Say \'I Love You\' would take the cake.Let\'s start off with a brief summarization. A reserved young girl who has no social connection whatsoever plays as the object of desire for the most popular, handsome boy in the school. They eventually establish an awkward relationship filled with uncomfortable dialogue and well, there you have it. There really isn\'t much else to say about this anime. It\'s simplistic, it doesn\'t try to break...any boundaries, and it\'s so monotonous it will probably make you yawn and fall asleep. It executed what every romantic comedy anime out there has ever attempted to accomplish. I can guarantee that you have seen this same template numerous times before, and I can also promise that you have seen better.Story - 4 / 10The story is generic and monotonous. It does not bring anything new to the table that makes itself memorable, or leave a mark behind in history. You can summarize the story in one sentence, and the reader could predict everything that will ever happen in the anime. Is there any completely unexpected plot twist? Is there any cliffhanger that leaves you at the edge of your seat? Or maybe there is some sort of symbolism, or undertone that it is trying to portray. The answer is \'no\' to all of your questions. The story is basically a silly, happy-go-lucky, simplistic romance that has been repeated too many times before with absolutely no depth whatsoever. The pacing also made me uncomfortable. First episode they meet, second they kiss, and third, they automatically become a boyfriend and girlfriend. It\'s immature and childish, and definitely does not represent the singular theme they have been emphasizing throughout this entire anime, which is indeed \'love.\' The storyline was just another contribution to why I find Say \'I Love You\' so bland.Art - 5 / 10The art is satisfactory. It doesn\'t do anything extraordinary, but it certainly isn\'t disgusting. The somewhat likable character design, and the brightening colors that were incorporated into the background scenery was what gave its\' animation a semi-respectable score, and I am sorry to say, is the pinnacle of this anime\'s accomplishment. Other than the sparkle and the twinkle that they sprinkle and sugarcoat in every single shoujo anime, Say \'I Love You\' does not outdo any other anime with its\' art. To wrap it up, it does its\' job, and with the wide variety of spectrum the animation studio ventures into when they bring this anime to life is a compliment I am reluctant to give, but I will just for the anime\'s mentionable work.Sound - 4 / 10The soundtrack of Say \'I Love You\' is almost like a lullaby. It puts you into a slumber, and makes you wonder whether Say \'I Love You\' is supposed to make you fall asleep or make you giggle and laugh over the chemistry experienced throughout adolescence. The opening theme is a heartwarming hymn, but certainly isn\'t anything special. It\'s calm, collected, but definitely doesn\'t introduce the romantic aspect of Say \'I Love You\', but gives you a more wistfully composed orchestral piece. The quiet piano and violin strumming away in the background is soothing and gentle, but it just didn\'t break a barrier or kick down a wall for me. The ending theme is practically an identical twin to its\' opening theme counterpart. The OST? More whimsical singing, making me picture it to be more of a children nursery rhyme than a love song. In conclusion, the sound? Nothing remarkable. But still bearable.Character - 3 / 10The characterization throughout Say \'I Love You\' is most likely the worst part of this anime. The main female protagonist is timid, reserved Mei Tachibana. Her introduction actually somewhat drew me in-- an anti-social, pessimistic student who doesn\'t believe in establishing relationships with her classmates. This really hooked me-- I wanted to know more about her perspective on the everyday boundaries of school life, and her thoughts/opinions on social hierarchy, interactions, etc. I also really liked it when I noticed the courage she possessed when she gave the most popular boy at her school a roundhouse kick in the face! But then this bright, intelligent, and audacious young woman that I believed had such an interesting view on the world suddenly transformed into your ordinary tsundere character who would never respond to the male protagonist, Yamato Kurosawa\'s affection. Which brings me to my next point. Yamato Kurosawa has got to be one of my least favorite characters in Say \'I Love You."" He is perfect, almost robotically so. Yamato Kurosawa, the academic all star, the athletic champion, the wealthy son of a successful family, and on top of all that he has a beautiful face and a social life. Which is what makes him so monotonous to observe as a character. I didn\'t like how there wasn\'t anything wrong with him. He is a human, not an alienish demigod who excels at everything he does. I also didn\'t like the sudden fluctuation between his interest in Mei. First he is all over her, his top priority, the one individual he wanted to see and spend his time with, and then all of a sudden, he almost forgets her. The process rinses and repeats like a cycle. Neither Mei Tachibana nor Yamato Kurosawa did their role as the main protagonist justice, not even decently so, which is why the score they have received is so long. It would have been even lower if Mei Tachibana\'s introduction wasn\'t so solid. This aspect of Say \'I Love You\' was yet another factor that made this anime so disappointing.Enjoyment - 3 / 10Alright, I will admit it. I don\'t usually watch shoujo anime. Yes, I have seen a lot of excellent shoujo anime, and I have seen a lot of completely gagworthy shoujo anime. Say \'I Love You\' to me is just a mediocre, soap opera fling. It is a decent anime to watch if you want to completely turn off your constructively critical brain, and just enjoy a romantic comedy. But that does not forgive the English bran muffin of a storyline, and the disastrous characterization. Say \'I Love You\' has done everything that has already been done, and if not worse. I certainly did NOT enjoy this anime, and this is coming from a female adolescent, which I believe is Say \'I Love You\' \'s target demographic. It claims itself to be a romantic comedy slice-of-life. But I did find the relationship that Mei and Yamato shared to be romantic, but more awkward, prepubescent, and coming-of-age. The most that Mei and Yamato did was hold themselves in an uncomfortable embrace, or a sudden kiss here or there. In my opinion, an adolescent attraction is not what love is, and if you haven\'t noticed already from its\' title, is what this anime is trying so hard to emphasize. It claims itself to possess comedy, and will promise laughter. But the jokes that were displayed only put a halfhearted smile on my face, because well, I can\'t put it anymore bluntly than it wasn\'t funny, and definitely didn\'t provide any entertainment for me as the audience. It does what it\'s supposed to with its\' slice of life genre, which isn\'t all too interesting to witness anyway. You have your high school, identical uniforms, and handsome/beautiful boys and girls. Nothing ever happened, nothing ever happens, and nothing ever will happen. Say \'I Love You\' just wasn\'t for me.And with that, I give it an overall score of 4 / 10.Sorry. :/ any boundaries, and it\'s so monotonous it will probably make you yawn and fall asleep.

I mean it as a gem that sparkles, shines, and is one of those rare classic shoujo that is pleasing to audience who are into the drama medium. The series is quite something to take an insight on because of the way it presents itself. Let\'s think of it this way and picture yourself in the story:You\'re an individual who has a troubled past. You have been ostracized by various circumstances and nowadays, you don\'t give a damn what anyone thinks about you or your life. That is till you meet one of the hottest student at school...who takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the first time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That, my friends, is where Sukitte Ii na yo shines. It\'s a discovery and it\'s a classic.Sukitte Ii na yo (also known as Say ""I Love You"".) is an anime series adapted from the manga written by Kanae Hazuki. The animation studio, Zexcs handles its production which is already known for some of its past works in the romance department such as Da Capo, Fortune Arterial, and H2O: Footprints in the Sand. The series fits within the romance and drama side as opposed to a pure romantic comedy because of the story involved.Like I mentioned before, the series is a classic for those into the shoujo medium. It is like a breath of fresh air to watch especially with the lighthearted backgrounds presented. For those into some school drama involving the typical high school life, it\'s like a journey all over again.The series kicks off with a girl named Mei Tachibana. She is nothing special although she used to get well along with others. Unfortunately, it seems that events in the past has shut her down and made her an unsociable person. In fact, classmates who knows her describes Mei as a girl who keeps to herself with little words and a person stuck in her own little world. Yet at the same time, we can see Mei as an honest girl who is caring, loyal, and willing to help others when the time calls for it. But time isn\'t always on her side especially during a day when she bumps heads to heads with the most popular student at school.Here\'s where the drama kicks in and his name is Yamato Kurosawa.Yamato is one of the most popular guys at school and his name may even suggest a male version of Yamato Nadeshiko (no pun intended). He meets Mei in a very unusual way at school and later on so helps her with a problem involving a stalker. Yikes! Now, from there on and out, the two forms a bond despite Mei\'s stubbornness.Now, the duo seems to very incompatible at first glance. I mean, Mei is one of the most plain looking girls at school with a plain way of dealing with her life. On the other hand, Yamato is the most popular guy at school who is idolized by many of the students. Sounds like living on the opposite of the world, right? Yet, what these two individuals share in common is their willingness to take on life itself with their ways of helping others and discover themselves. It\'s a pleasant watch and a rare gem we don\'t see too common in today\'s shoujo theme series. Later on, Mei and Yamato forges a relationship that seems to get quite the attention.I honestly think the duo are quite compatible that balances out each other. We know that Mei is a plain looking girl who is clumsy yet very honest with herself and with others. Yamato often goes out helping his classmates as well by putting others above himself. We can see that he dislikes people who just likes him for his appearance. When Yamato realizes that Mei likes him beyond just his physical appearance, the two becomes quite compatible. Although loathed by some of the other students at school, they are a good match.The other characters also plays their roles in the story as well that often brings forth new surprises and obstacles to the couple. That brings for the drama into the series.On the male side, we have Kai Takemura who has very similar circumstances with Mei. Both of them had a past they wish they can forget but they manage to move on. After their encounter, Kai becomes part of the love triangle between Yamato, Mei, and himself. It\'s drama to the D especially when we see Yamato\'s jealous and defensive side. On the female side, there is Megumi Kitagawa. She is seen as an idol on similar status with Yamato and is possibly what Mei wants to be: popular and beautiful. Yet, we see behind that outer shell is a very insecure girl who seems sweet but is only aiming at her own goals, aka Yamato. The three of them is a love triangle that makes Mei once again examine herself and the relationship she forms.The overall execution of the series follows that typical shoujo theme ways of portraying its ways, settings, and backgrounds. As such, expect some cliched and predictable moments especially between the duo of Mei and Yamato. Even from the pilot episode, it can be easy to tell where the direction the two are heading. The misunderstandings and some of the drama are also easy to see through especially involving Megumi. It\'s no surprising either that in high school, all sort of situations happen and love is may just be one of them. The series takes that love between the duo and drives it throughout each episode as obstacles and events are presented. It shows how much they discover themselves and how much they can change when they understand each other.The artwork of the series is quite realistic and portrays the backgrounds with the school life setting. The various classrooms, playgrounds, and characters are real and needs to be in that way to convey to the viewers what high school is all about. Yuka Hirama (the art director) does a wonderful job of that crafting the characters. Mei is painted as a plain looking girl. Yamato is painted as cool looking guy. Megumi is painted as a school idol with a beautiful figure. Kei is painted as a guy that used to have a rebellious nature. It is all there and the audience can see how each of them fits within their boundaries within the artwork department.Similarly, the soundtrack of the series is lighthearted. Although not too well known, Yuuji Nomi engineers the series\' music with his skills to create a sense of being there. It\'s nothing too special because it mostly is lighthearted and hardly noticeable at times. However, it is a sweet melody that depicts the settings and the characters especially the opening song. ""Friendship ~ for Sukitte Ii na yo"" by Ritsuko Okazaki is a very lighthearted song that gives off that melody of sweetness which depicts the duo\'s sweet relationship. Similarly, the ED song follows the same suit to match the lightheartedness of the series.All in all, Sukitte Ii na yo is a pleasant series to watch. The relationship between Mei and Yamato is quite warming and realistic to what some of us may have experienced during our teen years. It\'s heartwarming, sweet, and at the same time has drama to it especially involving the other characters. It is also a shoujo that fits within its boundaries without going over heels or trying too hard. Ultimately, it\'s a rare  little gem that deserves praise for its beauty. who takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the first time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That, my friends, is where Sukitte Ii na yo shines. It\'s a discovery and it\'s a classic.Sukitte Ii na yo (also known as Say ""I Love You"".) is an anime series adapted from the manga written by Kanae Hazuki. The animation studio, Zexcs handles its production which is already known for some of its past works in the romance department such as Da Capo, Fortune Arterial, and H2O: Footprints in the Sand. The series fits within the romance and drama side as opposed to a pure romantic comedy because of the story involved.Like I mentioned before, the series is a classic for those into the shoujo medium. It is like a breath of fresh air to watch especially with the lighthearted backgrounds presented. For those into some school drama involving the typical high school life, it\'s like a journey all over again.The series kicks off with a girl named Mei Tachibana. She is nothing special although she used to get well along with others. Unfortunately, it seems that events in the past has shut her down and made her an unsociable person. In fact, classmates who knows her describes Mei as a girl who keeps to herself with little words and a person stuck in her own little world. Yet at the same time, we can see Mei as an honest girl who is caring, loyal, and willing to help others when the time calls for it. But time isn\'t always on her side especially during a day when she bumps heads to heads with the most popular student at school.Here\'s where the drama kicks in and his name is Yamato Kurosawa.Yamato is one of the most popular guys at school and his name may even suggest a male version of Yamato Nadeshiko (no pun intended). He meets Mei in a very unusual way at school and later on so helps her with a problem involving a stalker. Yikes! Now, from there on and out, the two forms a bond despite Mei\'s stubbornness.Now, the duo seems to very incompatible at first glance. I mean, Mei is one of the most plain looking girls at school with a plain way of dealing with her life. On the other hand, Yamato is the most popular guy at school who is idolized by many of the students. Sounds like living on the opposite of the world, right? Yet, what these two individuals share in common is their willingness to take on life itself with their ways of helping others and discover themselves. It\'s a pleasant watch and a rare gem we don\'t see too common in today\'s shoujo theme series. Later on, Mei and Yamato forges a relationship that seems to get quite the attention.I honestly think the duo are quite compatible that balances out each other. We know that Mei is a plain looking girl who is clumsy yet very honest with herself and with others. Yamato often goes out helping his classmates as well by putting others above himself. We can see that he dislikes people who just likes him for his appearance. When Yamato realizes that Mei likes him beyond just his physical appearance, the two becomes quite compatible. Although loathed by some of the other students at school, they are a good match.The other characters also plays their roles in the story as well that often brings forth new surprises and obstacles to the couple. That brings for the drama into the series.On the male side, we have Kai Takemura who has very similar circumstances with Mei. Both of them had a past they wish they can forget but they manage to move on. After their encounter, Kai becomes part of the love triangle between Yamato, Mei, and himself. It\'s drama to the D especially when we see Yamato\'s jealous and defensive side. On the female side, there is Megumi Kitagawa. She is seen as an idol on similar status with Yamato and is possibly what Mei wants to be: popular and beautiful. Yet, we see behind that outer shell is a very insecure girl who seems sweet but is only aiming at her own goals, aka Yamato. The three of them is a love triangle that makes Mei once again examine herself and the relationship she forms.The overall execution of the series follows that typical shoujo theme ways of portraying its ways, settings, and backgrounds.

Well, when I was watching the earliest episodes, I thought it was really underrated. There are many out there that don’t really like it (and I’m talking about girls certainly) and that was always leads it to be given really unfair ratings.Well that’s exactly the problem with romance animes. Their stories redound to become mainstream and that’s why they don’t appeal much on their viewers, so that makes them complete them without considerate them as...a big deal. But here we have something special. A HUGE deal, actually lol.So, let’s start from the basics.We have our typical social-awkward girl and the popular hot guy who falls in love with her. Of course I was like “awww” when hearing the typical love words and stuff like “you’re my everything”, but what I liked more was the participation of the other characters in the story. I mean, watching a couple doing stuff all over the anime is totally boring. But here, you will see development in the characters. They will narrate their different pasts, their different stories and reveal sad truths and facts about them. So, there were some life lessons as well. Trying hard to be accepted by the others -so much that you harm yourself, overcoming your fears, the meaning of friendship, be envy of the others, isolate yourself. All these applied on the characters making you enjoy the show as you see how relations between them are being developed. And I think that was actually what made me curious about the next episode, watching it right after the previous ‘cause I just couldn’t wait at all :P What I also liked was the way that characters showed up in the show, leaving you more curious and making you wanting to “explore” their personalities and find out their connection to the rest of the characters, as well (which was an another strong point of the anime).So, about the “romantic” side, I have to say that I really liked it. You can clearly see what love really means, what love really is just by how the relation between the two main characters is developed. And this anime taught me that love has to do with completing and dedicating completely to each other. Hahah, and I’m putting aside the cute main character, our loving Yamato.Overall: 7Sukitte Ii na Yo was a decent romance anime. Not too girly nor boring and totally NOT stupid at all. It can keep you stuck to it until the end through its great love story, the shapely art, the variety of the characters and the zestful relations/connections between them. a big deal.

Is your appearance really all that matters?This anime brings a serious problem to our attention in a modern way taking a quite complicated school life as an example. Not becoming an outsider or being bullied means being nice to everybody, wearing designer clothes, accessories, make-up, as well as keeping your mouth shut, when someone gets hurt. So much effort to survive in school.Do I really need to be like everybody else?It’s difficult to be an individual in this school. Having fake friends is better than having none, you would think. None of us likes to be betrayed, but at...the same time you cannot rely on yourself only. Some might prefer not having friends like that, others cannot understand it at all. I can quite correspond to the main character’s choice. Opening up after being hurt is always difficult.Why did the best looking guy at school choose this particular girl? Why not me, when I sacrificed everything to look that great now?Expectations. It may be painful, but love at a first sight is possible, which most of the people do not understand. Its above all these things like looks, money or having many friends. It saddens me, that because of a peer pressure at school some of the students fight over boys or girls, just to have sex with her/ him. And having sex with someone popular or handsome at school means I will become popular too.At some point, many do not understand or will never experience what is like to be loved, so why not try and ruin other people’s luck? Will our first love and relationship overcome all these obstacles? Am I strong enough to cope with all that? I am impatiently waiting for another episode to find out. the same time you cannot rely on yourself only. Some might prefer not having friends like that, others cannot understand it at all.

This is all my own opinion, and if you don\'t agree with it, then that\'s okay too. We are all entitled to our opinions.Sukitte Ii na yo (Say ""I Love You"") was an anime I knowingly walked into as the new love story of the year.  Except it surprised me, in the best way possible.  The story seemed to rush into the love story at the beginning, I didn\'t really expect anything more than that....Except the story took a new twist.The story took a deeper path, by looking at the background of almost every character, the things that had happened to them.  Basically their dark secrets.  For each one it was either being a bully, or being bullied.  The story turned from this silly love story, into watching people overcome fears, battle their pasts, and learn to trust others.If there was one thing I took out of this anime, it was this:Everyone has a story to tell.  And the way people act now, is because of something in their past.  And if you never learn about that past, then you don\'t know the real them.A quote from the anime:""But there\'s nothing wrong to worrying. It\'s like a wall you need to overcome, to make it to the next level. If you\'re running up against that wall, it means you\'re moving forward. I wonder how many walls I\'ve broken up until now, but if you wont move yourself, you will never get anywhere.""I recommend this anime to anyone.

I'm an avid lover of romance anime, or anything for that matter, but it was literally frustrating and painful to complete this series. Classic loser heroine and popular boy likes girl.Oh, sure, the art was pretty good, but that's all. The only reason this anime was eye-catching was because of the artwork, IMO.However, I did enjoy the soundtrack. It matched the anime and feel of it.Very little character development. She was basically a loner, never doing anything or having any friends. He was a classical hot-popular guy with floods of girls who has a...soft side for the mysterious girl who has painful self-esteem.

When they\'re all complex and interesting, they\'re almost a family, and each has their own strengths and flaws, and when you want to get to know them. This anime had none of that. I didn\'t find any of the characters interesting at all, each were painfully stereotypical. The female lead was interesting to me in the first episode - she seemed shy, lonely yet strong - but after the first episode, she became extremely bland, and everything she did was frustrating and boring. The other character, her love interest seemed so over-""perfect"" that it was annoying and uninteresting. Also, the way that he fell ""in love"" with her seemed ridiculous and rushed, and it made no sense to me. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout the entire show. Some of the side characters had interesting back stories though, but that\'s about all.Enjoyment (3)The first episode was enjoyable, I can admit that. It showed a lot of potential and it got me interested, which is why I kept watching. Sadly, it just went downhill from there. I felt no emotion towards any of the characters.

Isn\'t love supposed to be enjoyable to watch? Not painstakingly boring and cringe worthy?  I wouldn\'t recommend it.

Now people have told me that, to be blunt, my reviews are sometimes a bit shit so I\'m going to try a different formula and see how that goes.THE GOOD:The characters in this anime are great, and you really...need them to be because, this is a high school romance anime, if the characters are uninteresting or poorly done, no one is going to care when the drama rolls in to shake everything up. That being said the two key characters that you\'re going to be following for this entire anime are anything but uninteresting. First you have Mei Tachibana a social exile for lack of better wording, who, when she was in elementary school, was blamed for killing the class rabbit by her \'friends\' and after that point she didn\'t make another friend until she ran into... or rather roundhouse kicked the most popular dude in her high school, one Yamoto Kurosawa, who, for some odd reason, is instantly interested in Mei right after she kicks him off a staircase.Now Mei might come off as a predetermined tsundere once she opens her mouth, but she\'s actually rather shy and timid. While Yamoto is the silver-tongued-suave-lady killer, who\'s loved for being a nice dude at school... and apparently he\'s handsome.... No comment. But because these two MC\'s are pretty much polar opposite it (at first) felt like Yamoto was a cat chasing after a ball of yarn, Mei being the yarn, but after the second episode you realize that, no, Yamoto does in fact what to be serious with Mei affirmed by the line, ""You are mine."".... *Whispers* I think he\'s a dominatrix. On a side note, the characters as a collective actually talk like they\'re in high school, they talk about sex and porn and boobs as, you know, actual people do/would.The sound design, for the voices, was done to what I\'ve come to expect as standard really, no one had an annoying voice and no one felt let the person voicing them had just woken up and wanted to go back to sleep, it was fine. Standard. Par. Good Enough. Alrig- Okay I\'ll shut up now. The music and sound queuing on the other hand was a little bit better than standard, at least at the start, the constant cutting of piano with the rapid editing of the visual blended really well, and I\'ll admit I actually jump a little with the scene featuring the train in the first episode. So the sound was all-round solid, nothing else to mention really.The art and animation didn\'t do anything to make me go, ""OMG MY EYES!!!!!"" in you, is was pretty much on level with the sound, on scene from the first episode sticks out because Mei was screaming and waving her hands around and the camera is solely focusing on her face and everything in the background is blurred instead of a standard shot where everything is in focus and still.THE BAD:The thing that this anime arguably lacks, personally I think it just doesn\'t really need it, is a plot. You can argue that it\'s about Mei learning to trust people again, but really the only thing that\'s driving all the events is the relationship, not that there\'s anything wrong with that, it\'d just be better if something else would be happening apart from the Mei/Yamoto relationship and the various dramas unfolding because of that.One thing that felt really forced by this show was the message of \'everyone is the same, regardless of what they seem like\' and this show really beats you over the head with that, ALL of the named characters have some sort of emotional or physical scar from the past that they somehow tie to Mei. Somehow. this aspect might be realistic, because there isn\'t a person on this planet that doesn\'t have some sort of damage like that, and if you\'re that person whose reading this saying, ""Nah not me."" 1.Bullshit 2.Wait a little longer, then get back to me.Another thing that personally annoyed me just a little bit was the final episode, episode 13, you could\'ve ended the anime on episode 12 and nothing would\'ve changed, I feel like they had the project done, but then realized that they needed something to do with all the time they had left and someone just put up their hand and said, ""How about another episode?"" That guy then got promoted.THE VERDICT:Sukitte Iinayo is a good anime, it\'s nothing outstanding, but it does it\'s job properly, it shows you what you came for and nothing really apart from that, no hidden meaning (FRIENDSHIP IS A LIE!!), and some pretty nice characters  that have normal conversations, instead of straight avoiding those blasphemous words and acting all embarrassed and innocent when someone hints at it. Say ""I Love You"" won\'t pry those words out of my mouth, but it will get me to take it to dinner and walk it home.Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one. need them to be because, this is a high school romance anime, if the characters are uninteresting or poorly done, no one is going to care when the drama rolls in to shake everything up.

Say ”I love you”) had potential to be a blissful romantic drama - for the most part, it is. It nails many aspects of a good story which make up for its flawed plot. The best part of this show is the cast of characters: they are solid, varied and interesting. All of them have their upsides, downsides, flaws and rivalries.Even without an external plot, the emotional plot alone carries this show far. The animation is really sick too: The lines are sharp and everything from backgrounds to people is finely detailed. Both the guys and the girls are attractive...to the eye but not overtly sexy. I can\'t emphasize enough how much I liked the art – oh, and the music! Both the intro and the end theme are amazing and I loved hearing them every time.The only problem with this show is its lack of a plot. Especially unnerving is how watered down the love triangles are. Every crisis is resolved way too easily, some of them almost instantly and without any actual developments. The good thing is, by the time you start feeling disappointed, you\'ve already reached the ending. The strong points for this series are the characters who have tons of personality and historic background.The show deals with plenty of social themes, mostly focused on the brutal side of social life, such as bullying, eating disorders, self-esteem issues, etc. These themes could\'ve used far more in-depth exploration.

""Sukitte ii na yo"" is smart because it avoids one of the grave sins of romantic fiction: Instead of falsely implying that lack of social skills makes you hot, the story actually digs into the theme of disparity in social stature and its effect on a relationship.

I can\'t emphasize enough how much I liked the art – oh, and the music! Both the intro and the end theme are amazing and I loved hearing them every time.The only problem with this show is its lack of a plot. Especially unnerving is how watered down the love triangles are. Every crisis is resolved way too easily, some of them almost instantly and without any actual developments. The good thing is, by the time you start feeling disappointed, you\'ve already reached the ending. The strong points for this series are the characters who have tons of personality and historic background.The show deals with plenty of social themes, mostly focused on the brutal side of social life, such as bullying, eating disorders, self-esteem issues, etc. These themes could\'ve used far more in-depth exploration.

I could write a review gushing about how great it is, or a scalding one about it's downfalls. I'll do both.Pros:-The romance itself is quite good. It's interesting to see the different sides of each other they bring out. They make one another less boring and have a truly touching love story, as sudden and maybe even forced as it was. They have heavy chemistry and you can understand why they love each other, even if seems that they fell in love rather fast.-That being said, Mei's character isn't your regular happy, cheerful, submissive...girl (well...), but she's interesting in that we can all relate to her pain and loneliness. She has had some tough experiences that were a bit dramatized and probably are...uncommon...but possible, and the pain she felt at being rejected by her classmates and being hurt over and over by her friends, is something we can all definitely relate to.-There is no annoying waiting. The main love interest tells her he likes her quickly, and they don't take ages to get together, which is refreshing. They are also surprisingly honest with each other, which is nice to see and helps the romance come at a faster, better rate.-The art is absolutely beautiful.-The story is familiar, but it has some new elements that make it interesting and very unique.-The romantic interest isn't a cold jerk to the girl for once. He is the cliche popular, rich, perfect player guy, but he is actually very kind, considerate and warm towards Mei, which is refreshing and interesting.-They have a very balanced relationship. He is considerate towards her, and Mei is honest with him. There is no one person dominating the other. They have one of the healthiest relationships I've seen.Cons:-The romance is good in terms of chemistry, but it happens way too suddenly, way too fast. You blink, and they're in love. He's nice to her, sure, but at the same time, she doesn't come off as the type to be so trusting and loving right away after all she's been though....-Talking about Mei, she goes off character many times. She goes from a cold,  prickly girl to a moe, kawaii blushing cute girl in the span of four seconds. It's just uncharacteristic to change so fast. It's not character development, it's just conveniently changing her with no reason to make her cuter, more appealing, and better for the romance relationship.-I can't stand the music, but some may, so I rated it average.-The main male romantic interest is boring. I've seen him in nearly every shoujo anime - arrogant but kind, perfect, good at sports, good at academics, rich, popular, every girl loves him yet he chooses the loser girl, player....yeah. Been done before, and there's no development or even backstory for him. He's kind and a great boyfriend, but beyond that, very hollow, shallow character with little interesting things about him.-A lot of the obstacles seem very forced, cliche, overdone and overdramatized. They take the smallest thing and blow it up to be some huge, mindblowing issue. It's just not that great story-wise. The plot is forced and kind of blind, despite some good themes it brings in. girl (well...), but she's interesting in that we can all relate to her pain and loneliness.

Even if you reach out to someone, they will only end up using you or simply outright betray you.Sukitte Il Na Yo, or Say I Love You, builds upon that premise with an added twist: what if the first person you begin to trust is your first love? This is quite a daunting situation because trust, as well as listening to each other, and spending time together, is an important element to a healthy relationship. It is similar to being forced to...run before learning how to walk. You just can\'t do it without knowing the first steps.This is the situation that our main female character, Tachibana Mei, is in. Having been bullied and excluded by friends during her childhood, Mei has withdrawn herself into her own cocoon as she enters high school. One day, the most popular guy\'s friend, named Kenji, pulls Mei\'s skirt, provoking her. Extremely pissed off, she ends up roundhouse kicking Yamato, who is the most popular guy in the school. It seems that her kick struck a chord in Yamato and he ends up seeing Mei as a love interest. I can\'t speak for all guys but, to all girls out there, kicking us guys, if we don\'t know you, will probably not make us fall in love with you. Anyway, ""Say I Love You"" follows a pretty typical shoujo plot: girl has problems, girl meets prince, prince changes girl\'s life, girl falls in love with prince. But this is not an anime where they get together and head off into the sunset riding on a white horse at the end. In fact, Mei and Yamato get together very early in the anime. What this anime shows is how they come to understand each other while being in a relationship. The situations that the couple was placed in were very interesting, especially the first couple or so, because given Mei\'s lack of trust in general, you get to experience her emotional turmoil as she struggles to understand what it takes to be in a relationship. However, as the anime approached the end, the situations were falling more into the generic Shoujo situations of misunderstandings and the like.While the primary storyline of the anime is the relationship between Mei and Yamato, there are a few subplots running about, especially near the end. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out how those plots tied into the main story but they tie into the bigger themes of bullying, trust, and friendship. I would say the anime does a good job of weaving these small stories into the anime without having them end up feeling like fillers.There is a relatively large cast of characters and unfortunately, most side characters don\'t get much development. I would say Aiko and Asami get a gradual development over the course of the story while the others seemed to just get a quick exposition and no more development afterwards. This is not a bad thing since I am seeing Sukitte for the action between Mei and Yamato but at the same time, the side characters were pretty interesting people that I wanted to understand more.Aside from the side characters, our two main characters are pretty good. Out of the entire cast, Mei is my favourite. Mei starts off as a really insecure character but as she grows in the relationship and climbs out of her cocoon, she reveals herself as a really good and passionate person, and in my opinion, a great girl for any guy to have. \x0bYamato is a decent guy. Like most other shoujo anime, he is a heartthrob who can claim a girl\'s heart simply by breathing. Although he can go overboard with his desire to help everyone, he loves Mei with all his heart. His development is mostly stagnant throughout the entire anime and he mostly serves as developing Mei\'s character.The artwork in Sukitte is very good. It takes a more realistic approach with, of course, the usual characteristics of a shoujo anime: long armed and tall guys and (much to a guy\'s dismay) flat-as-a-board female MC (anyone get the reference to another great shoujo anime?). The colour palette showcased dim, perhaps even washed-out, colours. I thought it complemented well to the relatively quiet nature of the entire anime. The animators deserve a lot of credit as they depicted the facial expressions of the characters very well. I recall in one scene where there was little dialogue but the facial expressions and body language effectively conveyed the tense and confusing atmosphere of the situation.The sound was well done as well. Although the soundtrack doesn\'t reach epic status, the music in each scene was well selected. I also enjoyed the relatively quiet OP as it complements Mei\'s personality and perhaps her relationship with Yamato as well. The voice actors also did a very good job. Mei\'s voice actor, Kayano Ai, was also the voice for Menma from AnoHana and Ibara from Hyouka while Yamato\'s voice actor, Sakurai Takahiro, was the voice for Matsuyuki from AnoHana (nice complement there), Suzaku from Code Geass, Jin from Sakurasou no Pet, and (for laughs) Tentomon from Digimon. Props to both of them for bringing great chemistry to Mei and Yamato.Say I Love You is a decent anime. It is not just a story about love but also about opening up to others. Sometimes, just putting yourself out there can do wonders. Definitely give this anime a watch if you are romance fan or looking for an anime where you see how the relationship develops throughout the course of the show (rather than simply seeing the couples get together at the end)!Let me know what you think of Sukitte Il Na Yo!

I would love to hear from you!', ""Sukitte Ii na yo. A very underrated anime, many people slate this anime but I believe if you're a fan of the romance genre you'll very much enjoy this and hence throughout this review I will tell you what the producers did well!Please note due to the nature of this review I will reveal a very 'slight' spoiler, not of great importance and revealed about two episodes into the series anyway, however; please be cautious before reading on!Story - First of all, let's start with what I believe this anime did right in terms of its story line. As I'm sure you're aware most...romance anime show the two main protagonists slowly coming together near the end of the series. Unlike this, 'Sukitte Ii na yo' has the two main characters come together near the very start of the anime, thus showing how they develop as a couple rather than developing into a couple, this makes for a fun and new change of pace for romance genre lovers.Art - I was a great fan of the artwork, I believe in general there was great simplicity, though I found the portrayal of the characters was fantastic! The characters were drawn in a way that almost gave insight into their characteristics: shy; naive; confident or so on, almost allowing the audience to foreshadow later events.Sound - I have little to comment on the sound other than, having personally watched the Dubbed version, the voice acting was strong and representative of the characters. I'm unaware what the original voice acting sounds like however.Character  - Naturally, in the genre of romance; characters are very important, especially when it comes to the main male and female protagonists. I want to avoid any further spoilers so will avoid telling of how these characters change the direction of the story, but will however comment on how their range of different characteristics allow the anime to have an edge, keeping the audience intent and interested with the story.Enjoyment - I found great enjoyment within this anime and believe it has high 'rewatch' value, I was content with the ending and didn't feel the need for any further story. The anime truly ended on a good note whilst also providing fan service.Last notes - Let's end this review in a conclusive manner, is 'Sukitte Ii na yo' worth a watch in my own opinion? Yes, the anime excels its expectations, providing a chilled, fell good and more over a enjoyable experience! romance anime show the two main protagonists slowly coming together near the end of the series.

It had messages that, despite being oversaturated, were still beautiful and helpful. At least, hypothetically. Say I Love You falls short in creatively telling a story about a high school misanthrope without any friends and a romantic partner and her daily school adventures with your quintessential campus crush and how they learn to acknowledge their scars, how to forgive ourselves, and how to trust. Already on the ""pessimistic introverted female"" and the...""perfect idol guy"" the grounds start to feel barren, yet the author was not able to spring up anything fruitful from it, making the journey towards the end more discomforting than what it already brings to the table from the start.Say I Love You suffers from cliched tropes and melodramatic elements on a romance-centered tale that at many times just felt dreadful or just bland to even witness. Drama for the sake of drama, conflict for the sake of conflict. It really wasn\'t that convincing of a 13-episode presentation, what with weird pacing and random, disparate character interactions and played scenes.On that note, the characters are second-rate actors performing second-rate scripts. Tachibana Mei is a person of the background in the character cast sphere with nothing in her to stand out as someone ""profound"". Kurosawa Yamato was a weird guy who barraged timid Mei with unsolicited kisses on the lips (I counted 8 in the first 2 episodes) which felt so out of character as we found out how he is actually someone on the sensible and reasonable side of things. But at the same time, his interactions with Kitagawa Megumi and his treatment of Mei in specific occasions raises an eye. A bland protagonist and an inconsistent and unlikeable male lead is a recipe for a subpar junk food.Enough of the criticisms, let\'s dive into the brighter side of things shall we? Say I Love You wasn\'t all bad. Despite everything I said about its painfully average storytelling and some downsides, I still have some gratefulness within me for the author\'s intent, regardless of its critical and technical executions. To not be afraid of trusting and to be open to opportunities on human connection is something integral which should be preached to the youth especially. On that ground, it had cool ideas. High school hormones are wild, teenagers are still at the peak of their flaws. Yet despite all that, authenticity is the key to meeting people who will love you for who you are, as well as the means to forgive yourself flaws and all.Mei\'s background made her easily empathize with Yamato\'s lenience and inaction, Aiko\'s forced transformations, and Kai\'s desire for revenge. It was through Yamato\'s love for her (which came as sudden as a sneeze) which was rather bewildering considering their social positions and personality that Mei learned how to speak her own mind. It was through his relationship with her that Yamato learned to be more mindful of his actions, and to be more assertive in his values (minutely shown on the grand scheme of things, however). This theme continues on with Kitagawa Megumi and her desire for love done in a very self-harming manner. The human instinct for connection and intimacy rang strong for Megumi who was bullied for her outer appearance and lacked the care of a parental figure, making her blind to the people in her life who truly loves the girl behind the facade. Authenticity and tackling life head-on with bravery was wholly discussed in the story. These actions are requirements for self-actualization. The title speaks directly to this--speaking with truth and integrity. The fact that Mei never was able to externalize this feelings of hers shows that there is still much room left to grow, so much weaknesses left to conquer, not necessarily an off-putting hole in the heart of the story or anything.In conclusion, I\'m still in confusion. I admire the ideas presented by the author, but they were just not executed convincingly, leaving me with a regretfully bad taste. A core with distorted flesh does not do much. I mean, most stories are awesome in theory right? The act of creation is already applaudable. But how it\'s handled is a make or break situation. Additionally, as a romance story, I did not even receive any sweetness nor any romance-related sensations from it. It had me focus more on human connections in general. The romance is a mere stepping stone for that, I guess?And so with all of that being said, I decide to mark Say I Love You as a hodgepodge melodrama that could have been more were it to calibrate its component cogs.

Likewise with Sukitte Ii na Yo.Okay now it\'s time to discuss the aspects that distinguish this anime from other romance anime. If anime romance in general has the concept of a story about ""how to establish a relationship"", then there is a slight difference with Sukitte Ii na Yo, because this anime discusses ""how to maintain a relationship"". Therefore, from the 13 episodes, Sukitte Ii na Yo had quite a lot of conflicts that they tried to present to the audience. However, these...conflicts tend to be shallow and easy to predict. There is nothing ""wow"" that makes this anime easy to remember.However, behind the conflict, they try to present interesting things to watch. That is about ""what exactly is that friend"". And this meaning is quite deep, because it involves problems that often occur in everyday life.Betrayed, humiliated, exploited - there are many reasons for someone to shut down and distrust others around him. Although at first glance it looks just like an ordinary romantic story, this anime actually has a deeper story, which is about people who have been hurt, such as Mei who was made a scapegoat for the death of a rabbit in his school, Asami who was mocked for his body shape, or Aiko who beloved by her lover. This anime tells the story of how they learn to grow trust in themselves and also in others. Indeed there are still general signs of an ordinary romantic story, such as new characters who suddenly appear to cause far-fetched problems, but as if understanding that this will only have a bad impact, this anime immediately limits the roles of these characters, so the story is more likely to feel colorful than too long. Compared to other romance genre anime, this anime has started to grow up.For the audio visual, well actually it\'s not a big problem. It\'s just that I don\'t like the character designs of this anime except for Mei because Mei is amazing ""I love you Mei"". Taking place settings at school, the character designs should also adjust to the background of the place they take.If you take the story of the genre slice of life, at least they should try to make this series look natural, look realistic. OK, I understand this is Shoujo anime, and they are trying to make female fans to get tired, in such a way as to make the male characters look handsome. But that is too much and not realistic!Besides that, there is nothing too special about this anime visual, but he still managed to support his story well, especially from an emotional perspective. Cold gazes from behind the shoulder, or a lonely bench in the middle of the corridor - this kind of silent cinematography is able to help the audience to understand the alienation suffered by the characters. Then the voice-acting section also deserves praise, because he managed to represent each character correctly so that each feels unique even in their tone of voice and manner of speech.For the Character How to save a girl from the stalker? According to Yamato, kiss him in public. How do you cheer up a girl who has just been decided? According to Yamato, sleep with him so he doesn\'t feel worthless. Although then try to be explained as naive in understanding women\'s hearts, Yamato\'s principle of \'kindness\' is more like \'cunning\' that takes advantage of the situation, so it feels really ridiculous when this anime actually wants to describe it as something romantic.Likewise with Tachibana Mei. Described as a girl who is determined not to look for friends, because she has the principle that if you have a friend it will hurt her. From here we can see that there will be an interesting development in Mei. Sukitte Ii na Yo managed to show the development that occurred in Mei.But on the other hand, the overly forgiving nature of this Mei makes the conflict seem very trivial. It\'s OK to understand if it\'s like that because he doesn\'t want to ""lose his first relationship"". But on the other hand, I don\'t know why the way he forgave that jerk Yamato was really strange.However, this is only a small part, while in other parts of this anime managed to explain the characters very well. Each of them is given a background and reason enough that their anxiety is so easily understood. And although the theme of bullying Mei be felt too often and repeatedly, it only makes their tendency to gather and seek mutual support more reasonable.- Overall:Love is about trust, so for Tachibana Mei who has long distrusted other people, loving someone is a long, hard road and full of obstacles. That is why this anime is superior compared to other romance genre anime. Instead of just talking about the romantic relationship between young men and women, this anime tells about the evolution of character. And with every part of it trying its best to help you understand the evolution, this anime has completed all the requirements as one of the best shows. (8/10) conflicts tend to be shallow and easy to predict. There is nothing ""wow"" that makes this anime easy to remember.However, behind the conflict, they try to present interesting things to watch. That is about ""what exactly is that friend"". And this meaning is quite deep, because it involves problems that often occur in everyday life.Betrayed, humiliated, exploited - there are many reasons for someone to shut down and distrust others around him. Although at first glance it looks just like an ordinary romantic story, this anime actually has a deeper story, which is about people who have been hurt, such as Mei who was made a scapegoat for the death of a rabbit in his school, Asami who was mocked for his body shape, or Aiko who beloved by her lover. This anime tells the story of how they learn to grow trust in themselves and also in others. Indeed there are still general signs of an ordinary romantic story, such as new characters who suddenly appear to cause far-fetched problems, but as if understanding that this will only have a bad impact, this anime immediately limits the roles of these characters, so the story is more likely to feel colorful than too long. Compared to other romance genre anime, this anime has started to grow up.For the audio visual, well actually it\'s not a big problem. It\'s just that I don\'t like the character designs of this anime except for Mei because Mei is amazing ""I love you Mei"". Taking place settings at school, the character designs should also adjust to the background of the place they take.If you take the story of the genre slice of life, at least they should try to make this series look natural, look realistic. OK, I understand this is Shoujo anime, and they are trying to make female fans to get tired, in such a way as to make the male characters look handsome. But that is too much and not realistic!Besides that, there is nothing too special about this anime visual, but he still managed to support his story well, especially from an emotional perspective. Cold gazes from behind the shoulder, or a lonely bench in the middle of the corridor - this kind of silent cinematography is able to help the audience to understand the alienation suffered by the characters. Then the voice-acting section also deserves praise, because he managed to represent each character correctly so that each feels unique even in their tone of voice and manner of speech.For the Character How to save a girl from the stalker? According to Yamato, kiss him in public. How do you cheer up a girl who has just been decided? According to Yamato, sleep with him so he doesn\'t feel worthless. Although then try to be explained as naive in understanding women\'s hearts, Yamato\'s principle of \'kindness\' is more like \'cunning\' that takes advantage of the situation, so it feels really ridiculous when this anime actually wants to describe it as something romantic.Likewise with Tachibana Mei. Described as a girl who is determined not to look for friends, because she has the principle that if you have a friend it will hurt her. From here we can see that there will be an interesting development in Mei. Sukitte Ii na Yo managed to show the development that occurred in Mei.But on the other hand, the overly forgiving nature of this Mei makes the conflict seem very trivial. It\'s OK to understand if it\'s like that because he doesn\'t want to ""lose his first relationship"". But on the other hand, I don\'t know why the way he forgave that jerk Yamato was really strange.However, this is only a small part, while in other parts of this anime managed to explain the characters very well. Each of them is given a background and reason enough that their anxiety is so easily understood. And although the theme of bullying Mei be felt too often and repeatedly, it only makes their tendency to gather and seek mutual support more reasonable.- Overall:Love is about trust, so for Tachibana Mei who has long distrusted other people, loving someone is a long, hard road and full of obstacles.

(8/10)', 'A mediocre tale written about a mediocre girl who falls in love with a mediocre guy, how cute.Say I Love You is the story about a girl who is never noticed falling in love with a guy that everyone noticed. In other words, it is the even more basic version of every high school drama series ever created.Story: 4The storyline isn\'t the worst and at times it comes off as quite adorable. It is also a storyline that many of us can relate to, if you were the kind of kid who was never popular in high school.Basically, Mei (female protagonist) is...a very antisocial girl who decides not to make anymore friends in high school. That all changes one day when she finally meets this guy, whom for some reason she has never seen before despite them going to a high school where everyone knows everyone, and he changes her outlook on social activity. Hooray!Art: 8The art is the only really good thing in this show. The characters are drawn well and everything looks very calmly and peaceful, which sets the mood for this kind of series.Sound: 7The music is nice and the overall sound is very appealing. However, it is still not all that unique comparitively speaking. Voice acting matched the characters well,  but nothing special enough for me to write about.Character: 2.8The characters, all of them, are completely stagnant and poorly developed.First you have Mei, which we all know to be antisocial, but I mean she could have at least tried harder in life. I watched the entire 13 episodes hoping I would watch her blossom into this mature woman, but nooooooo. She is beyond passive, and despite gaining a bit more confidence she still has the same mediocre tone to her personality.Then you have Yamato, the king of ""marty stues"". He is not only the best looking guy in the world, but he has messed around with every single girl he\'s met yet manages to still treat them with respect. Aw, how thoughtful of him to treat a human being like a human being, that must mean he is the most absolute perfect boyfriend in the world.The writers are trying to fool you into thinking he is this perfect guy, but he is completely docile and clueless when it comes to the poor behavior of himself or the people around him. And sure, he is a good boyfriend (at one point) to Mei, but you quickly realize he lacks the perfect qualities you are fooled into believe he has. However, it is still played off as if he can do no wrong and it makes the entire theme feel completely phony.Then you have everyone else, who is either beautiful and stupid or beautiful and rude. Either way, you are forced to believe that beautiful people cannot have bland personalities, that\'s for ugly people. I mean, this is why Mei is ugly, right? *rolls eyes*Enjoyment: 4Some of the scenes were very adorable to watch, and it is nice to watch shows where someone makes friends and their bond grows stronger. However, the entire series feels so fake when it comes to those strong bonds of love and friendship.All of Mei\'s friends are still better friends with Yamato, and they truly behave in the way of putting Yamato before her. She doesn\'t define her relationship and she never defines her relationship, Yamato is their relationship. This makes the series very frustrating to watch, especially since none of the characters really improve in terms of quality.Overall: 3.9Welp, it\'s not the worst anime I have ever seen... a very antisocial girl who decides not to make anymore friends in high school.

One can be overwhelmed by the ambition that this anime tries to achieve, however such stray from the norm can overwhelm the audience to weaken its premise as a memorable romcom.The art and music is presented with emotion that heightens the story. The anime's ED features Suneohair, who has also made EDs from other romances such as Honey and Clover and Arakawa Under the Bridge. In addition, the voice cast works hand and glove with each other, conveying the character's feelings that feels fit towards each person.Having said that, the character development is left...with silly misunderstandings and overwhelming drama that depicts society as a dismal place to live in. The supporting cast's lack of depth and main heroin's constant troubles overcloud the story into becoming more fictitious and far-fetched that believable. All the running gags and complications of a romance are shown in full effect, and while other anime such as Seto no Hanayome can pull this off with ease, Sukitte Ii na yo falls short. This can leave the audience yearning for more depth with Kurosawa and Tachibana (the main characters), but also shows the inconsistencies this anime possesses.In retrospect, sukitte Ii na yo provides a refreshing breath of the romcom genre with ambitious strives and leaps, however falls short with its lack of character development and its display of having a non-memorable storyline. with silly misunderstandings and overwhelming drama that depicts society as a dismal place to live in.

It sure isn't the most original anime but it's wonderful in it's own way.Story: It's your typical popular boy falls for shy girl romance blooms. However this is probably one of the most realistic romances I've seen in a while. Mei falls for Yamato but that doesn't mean everything is perfect between them. She's still painfully shy around him and sometimes says things she doesn't mean because she doesn't know how else to react in that situation. Sure there's lots of cliché jealousy but that happens in real life. There's just something so sweet about this couple you...want to keep watching more.Art: Not much to say, I really liked the animation of it. It's quite refreshing and smooth. It has clean lines and crisp colors. There's a watercolor-ish feel to the background as well.Music: The opening and ending songs are a bit annoying a first, but by the end of the anime I came to realize how nicely they fit in. Very sweet and slow. As far as the background music I thought it fit in nicely with the anime but nothing spectacular.Character: Mei, well at first she seems to fall into the Mary-sue trap but once you understand her character I think she's wonderful. She's very easy to relate to and root for and all her reactions to the situations are realistic. She's painfully shy at points but slowly begins to open herself up and make friends. Along the way convincing and helping other people as well.Yamato kind of comes off as cocky jerk. Which is true for the first couple of episodes. But you can tell he genuinely likes Mei and being in a relationship with her changes him. You can tell he's gotten all he's wanted all his life, and now he has to work to keep Mei. (Mei also has to work to keep him.)Enjoyment: I just really like this anime. It's by no means perfect but their relationship is so real. I came to genuinely care about the characters and when they cried I cried. The show also touches about a lot of important topics. Examples: How important is beauty, trusting people, bullying, how people view you, and most importantly being yourself.Overall: If you love romance then you'll love this show. There isn't much action but it's a sweet anime. I'd recommend giving it a shot. want to keep watching more.Art: Not much to say, I really liked the animation of it. It's quite refreshing and smooth.

THE LOVE IS REAL AND IMPRESSIONABLE, YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS ANIME, AND HAVE NO IDEA WHY.ITS THAT AMAZING.wow. First review I've ever written, and this anime just took my breath away, while warming my heart at the same time. Its SO good that I can't think of a better way of spending my time. I really don't know why it's so good, it's a typical shouja... But I can't stop thinking about this anime. The story itself just leaves...me thinking, and thinking, whats so special about it. But I think it's a must see, because the number 1 thing I noticed about this anime is that it makes me HAPPY.   its whimsical, funny and cute, its easy to follow, and fall deep into , it makes you believe that this love is possible. in only 13 episodes, i got attached and hooked, it was always just the right tempo. It makes you love there love, because it's real, id make the same decisions the lead character mei did, this anime just leaves you with the biggest impression, that will stay with you for a long time. Its a classic in its genre, I really recommend it if you've given up hope on unrealistic love, be prepared to regain faith, + be prepared to melt away by yamato's actions like I did. me thinking, and thinking, whats so special about it.

I pondered that in my mind for about 3 hours before finally realizing the answer:It\'s the most realistic romance anime you can find out there.Some of you probably have different reasons why you love the show, but that was what I came up with. You have tons of romance animes out there, such as ""A Bridge to the Starry Skies"", ""The Rose Madder Colored Hills"", even ""The Future Diary"" can be considered a romance in it\'s own way... the problem with...all of them, they seem fairly unrealistic. I doubt anyone in the world had to go through picking one girl out of an entire group of girls that loves him, picking either your fiance or your sister, or finding out your girlfriend is a sociopathic murderer in a challenge to become God.Now we turn to Say I Love You. It\'s how a lot of real romances go, the couple date, they kiss, they declare their love for one another. That\'s pretty much this show in a nutshell. For all we know, this might even be inspired by a true story. Might.For a story, it was good. It wasn\'t entirely original, but there were moments in the show that got me wanting to know what happens next. A lot of shows revolve around some mini stories and one big story. This show pretty much only had one main story with the exception of one mini story, which kind of tied in with the main story, so if you\'re following me, there was only the main story. So as I was saying about it being slightly unoriginal, it\'s basically a Guy-Meets-Girl plot line. Luckily I liked the show because it was one of the better Guy-Meets-Girl stories.Artwork, good. I liked the character\'s designs, especially Mei. She seems pretty average looking, but the artist made something about her make me like her a lot. Other characters were well drawn, but there were some exceptions, like Kai\'s character art. First of all, no offense to those who like his style, I\'m not the biggest fan of mohawks, nor male earrings. It makes him look a lot like a punk rocker. Then there were the ""mean girls"" of the show. They try to look ""fabulous"" by putting on tons of makeup and stylish clothes, and in the end, they make them look scary. I mean like ""I wanna punch them in the face"" scary. Those are the only problems I had with the artwork though. I liked the backdrops, most of the character art, and it just gave me a real image of what Japan looks like.Sound, voices were good. They weren\'t extraordinary, but the voice actors did their roles well. Don\'t have any negative comments about any of them, I just think they sounded pretty average.Characters, 9. I loved all of the characters. Despite the fact Kai had a mohawk and piercings, I still liked him. None of the characters made me grow a hatred towards them, except for the mean makeup wearing freakshows, so I was satisfied with that. I thought, ""Finally, there isn\'t really a villain in the show"". Mains were all cool, I liked their personalities, and Mei and Yamato make a great couple. I dig the whole Tall x Short thing going on between them.I can say that I really enjoyed the show. A little unsatisfied with the ending of the show, I feel like they could have done so much more with it, like make a really good finale, but the rest of the show made up for it. It had a few good laughs, a well thought out vision of what would come next... overall it was a really good anime. For those of you who like romance animes, this is definitely something you want to watch. It gives you a real taste in what romance is like in the real world.

I hope this review helped.', 'Honestly, this show is the cringiest garbage I\'ve ever seen. The dialogue is pulled straight from a 12 year old perverts fan fiction.Howeverrrr, I rated this show a 3 because despite the terrible characters, cringy dialogue, awful writing and ridiculous pacing it DOES have some positive aspects. “Say ‘i love you’” has some genuinely nice moments as well, It’s just a shame that those moments are almost instantly ruined by something stupid happening. But because I am such an uplifting positive fella, i’ll review the best parts of the show first.The Music (7):Easily the best part of this show. The soundtrack has a...slow, uplifting vibe which offers a similar ambience to actually good shows like Mushishi and the Aria series. Quite often the only background sounds are birds chirping or the sound of feet tapping on the sidewalk which honestly is pretty neat. The relaxing, feelgood vibes always set the ideal mood when entering scenes. The OP/EP are both excellent as well. Unfortunately it takes more than a good soundtrack to make a show any good, so it’s all downhill from here im afraid ;)The Art (4):The art and animation isn\'t awful, I mean, it\'s not good either. The drawings are quite often noticeably bad, eyes pointing in weird directions, triangle boobs, literally a rectangle to draw someones entire body.. But for the most part it\'s not awful?Characters (3):Lets start off with my least favorite character, Yamato.. His literal only character traits is that he is popular, good looking, creepy, hypocritical, self centered, probably even a sociopath.. oh an he\'s kind, sometimes? Almost half the show is about him pressuring Mei into sexual favors all the while claiming the opposite. ""lets take this slow"" as he forces himself onto her whilst just assuming she wants it ""cuz im popular, duh"". Later in the show he shows himself up to be one of the more hypocritical characters i\'ve seen in anime, all to add a lil bit o\' that drama.Next up we have Mei Tachibana. Her character in the first few episodes was actually the one redeeming quality about the show. She had integrity, was honest, had her own character (as raw as it was). Unfortunately her character actually regresses and loses personality the further into the show you go. Take note all, if you get a BF you\'re supposed to have your entire life revolve around him and lose all of your character traits so you are a literal walking drama-doll. If he talks to another girl? DRAMA! If he forgets to text you? DRAMA! If he doesn\'t show up to school because he\'s sick. OH SHIT, DRAAAMAAAAA!!the other two main characters (Yamatos childhood friends/GF) show up out of nowhere.. Guess what their entire purpose for being there is? Yep, DRAMACLOCK. Sadly, these two characters are probably the MOST DEVELOPED CHARACTERS IN THE ENTIRE SHOW.Story (3): ehh.. I think my character discussion kind of explained the entire stories structure. The end goal is accomplished in the first two episodes, the rest of the show is just adding unneeded melodrama in order to ""develop"" their relationship.Fortunately there are some genuinely well written moments in this show. There will be moments you feel bad for characters, feel pity for them, even feel like you understand them.Unfortunately those moments are very few and far between.Dialogue (2):Jesus, where to start.. This show has the worst dialogue I have ever seen. I\'m not even joking. Na you know what, the dialogue is the best part of the show. It gives you something to laugh at.There you have it, fellas. ""say \'i love you\'"", A modern masterpiece. I highly recommend this show to everyone. slow, uplifting vibe which offers a similar ambience to actually good shows like Mushishi and the Aria series.

""say \'i love you\'"", A modern masterpiece. I highly recommend this show to everyone.', '“When it comes to people you really love, you don’t care about yourself”- a problematic delusion that is all too pervasive in romantic fiction. A relationship that is founded upon the worship of another, to the extent of crippling anxiety when that other doesn’t notice you for a second, is only supported by the pen of the artist who strokes that fantasy into existence. Say I Love You features one of the most toxic relationships in all of anime, where a girl allows her mood to be dictated by the prerogatives of her impossibly dense free spirited partner, and that partner has their life...ambitions interrupted out of consideration for his clingy girlfriend’s anxieties.Tachibana Mei\'s struggles with social anxiety and depression can be relatable - many teenagers struggle with image insecurities and loneliness. However, the solution to these issues is not ""get a sexy BF""; counseling, building self confidence through productive hobbies are more effective options. Mei tries to enter a relationship as a means of patching these holes in her life, and the result is her obsessing 24/7 over the wherabouts and actions of her popular boyfriend who is just too attractive to ever go out with her. It soon becomes painful to watch her succumb to her insecurities over and over again, repeating the same mistakes of not trusting in others and failing to confide in loved ones. She doesn\'t have any peculiar personality quirks or hobbies that make her stand out on her own. She\'s just an extension of her anxieties and love to a popular dude, and a pitable figure whose moments of triumph are few and far in between the awkward silences and harsh treatment of a loved one. If you couldn\'t tell already, this is very transparent attempt to serve as a peripheral for viewers who can relate to feeling lonely, and want a prince charming to save them from issues that are not curable by obssesive romantic love.Kurosawa Yamato was certainly designed to be a prince charming, appealing to the wish fulfillment audience that wants a hunk in their lives. Yamoto is also designed to be an incredibly stupid, dense “nice guy” who doesn\'t seem to understand the power he holds over the hearts of his admirers. This is a guy who had sex with a girl entirely out of pity because they begged for it and no other reason. Like legit, he wasn\'t even trying to be a playboy. He just felt bad for her and screwed the girl out of remorse. How does he first charm Mei? He kisses her without any warning, under the excuse of ""protection"" as some admirers were making advances upon her. Yamoto has a sucessful modeling career. Guess who isn\'t a fan of that? His GF Mei. Does Yamoto halt his modeling career out of consideration for this GF, at the expense of himself? Yes he does. That\'s not kindness, it\'s an example of how toxic this relationship is and how ingenuine their decisions are.What separates the generic from the great in the shoujo genre is character likability, and Say I Love You does not have likable characters. None of their experiences together as shown in the anime really matter, nor are there any strongly communicated themes that are promoted through their relationship, because these characters are flat and boring people. This show can work pretty well as wish fulfillment, but if you don’t closely relate to the characters experiences then it falls apart at the seams. ambitions interrupted out of consideration for his clingy girlfriend’s anxieties.Tachibana Mei\'s struggles with social anxiety and depression can be relatable - many teenagers struggle with image insecurities and loneliness. However, the solution to these issues is not ""get a sexy BF""; counseling, building self confidence through productive hobbies are more effective options. Mei tries to enter a relationship as a means of patching these holes in her life, and the result is her obsessing 24/7 over the wherabouts and actions of her popular boyfriend who is just too attractive to ever go out with her. It soon becomes painful to watch her succumb to her insecurities over and over again, repeating the same mistakes of not trusting in others and failing to confide in loved ones. She doesn\'t have any peculiar personality quirks or hobbies that make her stand out on her own. She\'s just an extension of her anxieties and love to a popular dude, and a pitable figure whose moments of triumph are few and far in between the awkward silences and harsh treatment of a loved one. If you couldn\'t tell already, this is very transparent attempt to serve as a peripheral for viewers who can relate to feeling lonely, and want a prince charming to save them from issues that are not curable by obssesive romantic love.Kurosawa Yamato was certainly designed to be a prince charming, appealing to the wish fulfillment audience that wants a hunk in their lives.

Please note I have NOT read the manga, so I will not be making comparisons between them; instead I will pit this series between past shows to see how it fairs, as well as my thoughts on the elements that make up the show. But first, the summary which I will make as vague as possible as to not give any spoilers; (I might give some in the actual critique).  The story is typical to shoujo high school romance archetypes in which an unpopular girl becomes of interest...to the most popular guy in the school; soon challenges arise in every step, from misunderstandings to mind games and even physical altercations. Vague enough? Good, I’ll go into some more details in the next paragraphs. It’s not looking too good…Story: 6The story mimics many of the past shoujo romances in the past such as Kaichou wa maid-sama, and Kimi ni Todoke just to name notable shows.  The frustration I get from this series is that it’s as if the author did this in such a blatant way that I felt the plot was written with strict guidelines that one must NEVER cross; as a result, there is nothing that particularly stands out and separate this series from any other series in the past. I think even the director(s) of the anime had their own guidelines about story progression that I can pretty much predict what kind of “dilemma” would happen at what episode; from Mei’s and Yamato’s “breakup” to the introduction of Yamato’s past, to  the designation an antagonist.  They must have had a lot of vanilla to come up with a timeline like this.Another complain of mine is the episodic nature of the series. What I mean about this is that as far as conflicts go, it feels like in they disappear as fast as they come. Let me lecture a bit about high school English: there are 5 parts to a story, the exposition – the beginning of a story, and description, rising action – conflicts, complications and the like, climax – the collision of everything good and bad, falling action – the wrap up, and resolution – the closure; with those elements in mind, in the episodes throughout the whole series, these elements were recycled. To clarify my statement, you could visualize an ECG (a device to graphically measure a heartbeat), but that heartbeat is resting, and you see absolutely no difference in between beats, not like if you were measured from rest to run, where things get bigger, and more erratic and intense.   To put together all that jargon I just said, the episodes just do not seem to contribute to what SHOULD be the climax that is the last 3 episodes of the whole series. But instead, the conflicts themselves just feel isolated and the climax per episodes doesn’t really overlap, or outdo each other. This kind of plot progression doesn’t really suit the kind of tone this series, as well as the nature of its characters.The one thing that I noticed immediately about this show is its serious tone. I can’t really bash nor praise this element because I would probably become bias; I like my over-the top and somewhat childish scenes, and overall nature of a show.  Throughout the 12 episodes, this show did nothing to give anything outside of the main plot line to make me smile, and was more focused on getting out the progression with no quirks in mind. Quite simply, the series was “meh” about anything else, and was too busy with its own ***t.  I didn’t feel offended by it, but at the same time, there was nothing in the series to disengage the audience even just a little bitCharacters:  7The one thing that I give praise about this anime is its maturity. With that said, I’m talking about some of the character’s backgrounds. Within the first five(?) episodes, I got to know Yamato’s past, and how he had done the deed way before ever knowing Mei. This goes along with Yamato’s friends; it’s just like the high schools of the current generation.  But with that said, Yamato himself is new to actual romance, yet he knows how to sweet-talk to a lady, quite evident on how he talks to Mei, especially in private.Mei, well there’s really nothing particularly unique about her; she is shy, almost never ever shows her feelings, quiet, borderline anti-social, homely, and downright boring at times. Of course throughout the series, I can see her develop in both personal and social wellbeing, while giving a few lessons back to Yamato, including how to take care of cats (lol). However, there’s really nothing about her that stands out from any other main character of the same genres.As for the side characters, we have a somewhat preppy big-boob girl with a history of being bullied, and former bulimic/anorexic bitch turned friendly, a perverted guy friend (of Yamato), and a “former” friend turned rival, and finally a designated antagonist who’s as or more popular than Yamato vying for his love and turns into a complete bitch against Mei.  It’s a mishmash of generic archetypes.Sound:  7I like acoustic music, so naturally I would like this one; although I’ve heard others that I in my opinion are better. I do have to give credit where credit is due: Ritsuko Okazaki was also the composer and/or performer for classic anime such as Love Hina, and Fruits Basket, while Suneohair  perfomed the songs for Honey and Clover – one of my favorite anime ever.Art: 7Again, TYPICAL. I mean I don’t know how else to describe it, the characters have gigantic eyes, the guys are tall, yet gentle to the eyes. The women are mostly petite, and slender. There is obvious attention to the characters, while the background blends itself in around them. The color is neutral, going with the serious theme of the plot, and the emotions of the characters. I’m honestly running out of words.Enjoyment: 6I love cheesy. I love cliché; and I have to admit this anime has all of that. It’s just the execution that really brought it down. The rollercoaster of emotions was just not there. There’s just a little bit of excitement or happiness -  that one silver glint – and a conflict arises, and honestly gets boring after a while.  I don’t know if that is deliberate or not, but it’s as if the directors want the cats in the anime to be the only true source of happiness, because I must admit, they made me smile more than the characters did.Overall: 6Shuffle! is considered to be the generic harem.  To me, Sukitte Ii Na Yo is the generic high school romance.  It did good to focus on what happens in a relationship; all the hardship, misunderstandings, competition between lovers and friends, just plain old bitchiness sometimes, and the awkwardness of love itself. With all these elements, It would have been a sure hit. But sadly, the execution just could not be par to the expectations of years and years’ worth of the same material. The potential is there, just not dice.I do think this would be a good start to someone new to the genre, while still having a somewhat mature theme with it, but that’s really all the credit I can give it for. to the most popular guy in the school; soon challenges arise in every step, from misunderstandings to mind games and even physical altercations.

I think everyone will love this anime as we all were once the awkward, unsociable girl/guy...so it is relatable.Art-9/10I actually loved it...the male characters were weirdly attractive and of course the animation was interesting in every episode.Sounds-7/10It was cutely cheesy...the theme song was beautiful and colorful at the same time. Ironic because the main female...character is anything but colorful.Character-8/10Yamato's character was astonishing as he broke the stereotypical pretty boy story we expect. As this character showed us that everyone has problems despite their appearance and status...which was refreshing. Also, Mei wasn't the typical beautiful heroin...she was quite the opposite: insecure, pessimistic and ordinary. Thus the character development was beautiful as you would see how each of them grow due to the influence of the other so I liked it.Relationship 4/10- This part I did not like...13 episodes and you already love each other?! Come on. I just felt it was very fantastical and compared to the characters it was a let down and way too far illogical. Furthermore, their 'love' for each had so many holes you had to cringe-the bad communications, secrets and the short months they have actually had a serious 'relationship'. I just couldn't see the genuine love there...yes crush but not the sacred word love. No way.

It didn’t really make sense to me why she would like him.However, after those initial episodes he’s quite different and likeable enough at least. My main complaint is that the first handful of episodes are not consistent with it’s tone and the show feels kinda seedy but then shifts into feeling like a mature...consistent shoujo romance anime.The story is very similiar to Kimi ni Todoke in that there are even characters that are basically the same roles. Except this show is played more straight with less comedy. It’s a slightly more mature show overall. The nasty characters are nastier and the demons everyone carries are lot more mature than KnT.Mei is a cool main character. She is comparable to Sawako of KnT in that she’s a shy socially inept girl brought out of her shell by her love interest. But they’re different. Sawako’s struggle with social interactions stems from everyone misunderstanding her for a long time. Mei hates everybody, she doesn’t trust anybody. And is reluctant to accept Yamato\'s friendship.In some ways I appreciate Mei more. She feels more real than Sawako, however, comparatively Sukitte Ii Na yo is a more serious romance to KnT a comedy romance.The story wraps up fine. I was satisfied with it. I was pretty satisfied with Megu’s story arc especially. I think every backstory was interesting except Yamato’s, I didn’t really care but it was also told during the moment of inconsistency so.I don’t know if I can recommend it based on those first few episodes though because i can totally see people just dropping it. If you’re willing to tough out the weird seediness in the first few episodes that disappears you might enjoy it. But overall I think Kimi ni Todoke is a more enjoyable iteration of a similar story. So unless you finish Kimi ni Todoke and really want a similar premise, just watch Kimi ni Todoke.I’d probably rate the show a 5 in the first few epsiodes and then a 7 when the consistency kicks in. consistent shoujo romance anime.The story is very similiar to Kimi ni Todoke in that there are even characters that are basically the same roles.

Though, while I wish this was the case for the remainder of the series, it wasn\'t.As far as story goes, it\'s very similar to Anime like ""Kaichou aw Maid Sama"" and ""Kimi ni Todoke"" in that the main female lead is a bit closed off due to past experiences and the love interest slowly opens them up with their persistence towards the girl. While I loved Maid-Sama and Kimi nii , there where a...few things that kept me from feeling the same about this series.While this series pretty short, the pacing and build-up towards the character\'s feelings feels a bit rushed and sloppy. I began watching this series really liking the first episode, though by the second one I felt a little disappointed with where it was heading. It really felt like they could have done a lot more with the plot. Despite that, I wanted to watch every episode to see if the ending would be satisfying and worth watching the whole series. I still had my hopes up, and really wanted to like this Anime as it seemed faily popular. The ending still left me feeling disappointed, unfortunately. There was really no sense of rising action or mystery to what would happen.Another aspect of the story that bothered me a bit was the message regarding the main character\'s relationship. That may sound a little vague, but what I mean is that a lot of times it felt a bit sexualized in that a lot of the characters feel that a relationship means nothing unless you do something physically. I do see that the Anime wanted to get across that the characters love can break walls, and that there are genuine people in the world, but that message felt a bit watered down when a lot of the cast is emphasizing that they are closer to the main male character because they slept together. This kind of thing becomes an issue with the main characters so often, that it can confuse what the creators where really trying to get across. The great thing about Maid Sama and Kimi ni Todoke is that they took on the idea of just loving and admiring someone, and only needed that as the plot went on to express comflicts and the general progression of the series (Sorry, if that doesn\'t entirely make sense ^^;)I have mentioned characters a bit already, but have yet to review that aspect as a whole. As far as the set of characters in ""Sukitte Ii Na Yo"", I actually really liked the main two characters. The female lead was very expressive and unique as not a lot of Shoujo Series\' got that far with a quiet, introverted character. Her expressions and thoughts alone really portrayed her conflicts with trust and loneliness well, and I\'m sure many people can relate to situations this character is seen in. With that said, it does feel like her build up as a guarded individual is kind of for nothing, as the plot dives into her talking to people after being alone and resentful for years.As far as art and music, I did think the opening was alright, and the song was a good match for this type of plot, but it wasnt anything memorable as I can even recall the melody of the OP or ED song after 13 episodes straight.The animation, however, was very impressive! The art style was very clean and unique, and the movements where often very fluid and natural looking in combination with the art style. I came into this series being imediately pleased with its visuals, and really enjoyed that aspect alone.All in all, I really do feel ""Sukitte Ii Na Yo"" started off with a lot of potential. Gradually, though, flaws became apparent and I was left feeling that this Series should have taken an entirely different route. I do see how this series could have been really good. It wasnt bad, but it definately was not among the better Shoujo Anime I\'ve seen, and I\'m generally a big fan of Shoujo as it\'s one of my favorite genres. While visuals are very good, that definately doesn\'t make up for the plot.I really wanted to love ""Sukitte Ii Na Yo"" but I ended up not being able to.

That's a question I'm asking myself, and to be completely, genuinely honest: I have no idea.It's a completely generic and stereotypical show. It's generic shoujo with a stereotypical plot with generic music and stereotypical characters with generic drama and stereotypical conflicts.So why is it so good? What sets it out from all of the other generic shoujos out there?I reiterate: I have no idea.All I know is this show gives me copious amounts of warm fuzzies, and that's all that matters. Give it a shot, maybe you'll get those same warm fuzzies. "", ""Have you ever watched an anime which is well made and has a lot going for it yet it feels like it lacks something big? Well Sukitte Ii na yo is one such anime.The story follows the romance of shy and friendless Tachibana Mei and popular and outgoing Kurosawa Yamato and how Mei learns how to trust people and Yamato learns how to be more considerate.The story itself moves a great a good pace and does just enough to keep you interested and the artwork is very good as is the music so why doesn't do anything for me?The main reason is that it lacks...any kind of humour. There are virtually no laughs. Most of the characters are dripping with teenage angst ,your teenage years can suck big time but for most people there are at least some good memories. This is made worse by that, with the exception of Mei, they are all completely uninteresting. I just didn't care about them at all.Sadly this could be a case of something that works really well in manga but not as well in anime.

""Friendship ~「for Sukitte Ii na yo」"" by Okazaki Ritsuko... absolutely fantastic, especially for this anime... normally we see up beat, happy songs to start an anime off, this one was slow and sweet and the lyrics were pretty simple but deep... I guess the best way to describe it is a harmonious oxymoronic piece of melodic poetry...

It really gave us a lot of tension between Tachibana and Kurosawa, and seeing Tachibana learn the ways of talking to other people and learning who her true friends were was very interesting. Although, the ending was a little bit disappointing to me. I for one rarely find anime endings that are ever good. I was hoping for something romantic in the last episode.[ART]-----------The quality was very good and clear, so there isn't much to say about this topic, although the scenery was kind of bland.[SOUND]-----------I never watched the dubbed version of...this anime (if there even is one), but the subbed version was fantastic! The voice actress for Tachibana really showed the character's emotions as being shy very well. Although, there wasn't much background music, and the opening and ending didn't really suit my style. Of course, this is only my opinion.[CHARACTER]-----------I for one really liked Tachibana, because she really reminds me of myself. She always looked shy and seemed to have social phobia as well. Both Tachibana and Kurosawa were great characters. As for the others, like Kitagawa, she was one of the characters that really annoyed me, but it was only because of the plot, so she had to fit in with the story, but she was a real.. well.. jerk?[ENJOYMENT]-----------I really enjoyed the beginning of the anime. Again, it brought a lot of tension between the two main characters, but the ending was a disappointment to me. I did watch the sequel (Sukitte Ii na yo.: Dareka ga), but it didn't really explain much about what happened. I guess most anime just like to end with something that wants the audience to be creative and imagine what happens next themselves.

It's probably because I feel I relate to Mei, or the fact I'm a sucker for cute romance anime's that hit me in the feels but Sukitte Ii Na Yo just hits different.

I can feel their emotions and its beautiful.Only fault i can give...it is that their relationship progressed REALLY quickly, though it tells a good story and makes me fangirl over Yamato so not too many complaints.

The character development is pretty great, the art is average I'd say, and the music is pretty good. But, I think why I really like this anime so much is because of the romance. Mei's development romantically is something you typically don't see in most shoujo anime. At first, she confines herself from others, claiming they only betray you when it becomes...convenient for them. But when Yamato, the most popular boy in school begins his pursuit of Mei, she slowly opens up and begins to make friends. But the strange part is that her personality stays relatively the same.

Mei, who, while shown to be quiet and reserved from the beginning, also has moments where she can be fantastically brave and kick-ass (the round-house kick, sticking up for Asami, sticking up for Aiko and helping Nagi with her problems). I dislike her development throughout the series as it is not smoothly done. Initially it is understandable to be nervous about starting new relationships with people as she has avoided forming connections almost completely throughout her life but later in the series when she is frustrated with her situation with Yamato,...or confused about when he is upset over something, instead of simply asking ""have I upset you/what is the matter"" and resolving the issue she is constantly having long-winded, sighful inner-monologues and basically has to wait until someone tells Yamato how she is feeling because she is entirely incapable of doing it herself. By the end her consistency is the problem with her character going too regularly from being glad to have finally made friends to being mopey and passive about whatever her new problem is.  Aiko says it best when she tells her to stop pussy-footing around. The voice actor, at least in the english dubbed version, was far too forlorn.My critique of Yamato\'s short comings are less harsh because, while he should be more understanding of the way his behaviour makes Mei feel, and that he should show more trust, he does have to deal with trying to decipher every single thing that Mei thinks as she is basically a mute. Goddamn I would just have enjoyed the show more if she weren\'t so meek. (sorry)Otherwise, I don\'t mind this anime. While it comes off as a bit preachy at times with the whole ""we should all take care of each other/everybody has problems"" shtick that pops up in almost every episode, where at the beginning someone is being a really nasty person and it turns out that is because they have their own inner-demon,  then everyone is friendly by the conclusion.. at least the message is a good one. I also like the way the story doesn\'t stick to the usual formula of taking almost the entire season (if not several) for the two main characters to get together, instead with their relationship starting almost immediately (however, I would like that aspect more if, like I said, their relationship wasn\'t so frustrating).The supporting characters range from mildly entertaining (although, they all have faults), to just plain awful. Aiko is probably my favourite of the supporting cast, as she shines in the moments where her blunt way of speaking helps to resolve problems. Seriously, her calling-out other people\'s BS is great. Unfortunately, she is also one of the characters that has a friendship with Mei that does not really make sense. She was absolutely atrocious to Mei in their interactions at the beginning of the series. Even with the back story supplied, I can\'t really buy their best-friendship (even though I am glad it eventuates).  Nagi is another of the characters who I like. However this is mainly because her interactions with Mei are some of the few times in the series where I like her. They have a good connection as they both had difficulty with making connections with people they could trust and rely on. I thought it was very sweet. Although, again, Nagi has a very bratty personality at times which is irritating, though, refreshingly accurate.The animation is quite pretty in this anime and all the characters are well drawn. Likewise the music does a lovely job of carrying the mood of the scene to the audience. or confused about when he is upset over something, instead of simply asking ""have I upset you/what is the matter"" and resolving the issue she is constantly having long-winded, sighful inner-monologues and basically has to wait until someone tells Yamato how she is feeling because she is entirely incapable of doing it herself.

I also like the way the story doesn\'t stick to the usual formula of taking almost the entire season (if not several) for the two main characters to get together, instead with their relationship starting almost immediately (however, I would like that aspect more if, like I said, their relationship wasn\'t so frustrating).The supporting characters range from mildly entertaining (although, they all have faults), to just plain awful. Aiko is probably my favourite of the supporting cast, as she shines in the moments where her blunt way of speaking helps to resolve problems. Seriously, her calling-out other people\'s BS is great. Unfortunately, she is also one of the characters that has a friendship with Mei that does not really make sense. She was absolutely atrocious to Mei in their interactions at the beginning of the series. Even with the back story supplied, I can\'t really buy their best-friendship (even though I am glad it eventuates).  Nagi is another of the characters who I like. However this is mainly because her interactions with Mei are some of the few times in the series where I like her. They have a good connection as they both had difficulty with making connections with people they could trust and rely on. I thought it was very sweet. Although, again, Nagi has a very bratty personality at times which is irritating, though, refreshingly accurate.The animation is quite pretty in this anime and all the characters are well drawn. Likewise the music does a lovely job of carrying the mood of the scene to the audience.', ""For a very quick review I'd like to say that this was a fantastic anime and I would really recommend it to anyone who enjoys sad shows.  Great characters and a fairly unique story ( to m knowledge ), my only peeve with this show is that after Megu is introduced the story strays from the original focus a lot and ruined the whole reason I liked it.  I would have enjoyed this anime a lot more if the story had stayed on the main character topic. "", ""Sukitte Ii Na Yo seems to be a standard shoujo work.  And it is.

There is absolutely nothing exciting about her.  She doesn't do sports, she isn't in a club.  She's just an outcast.  Even her [outward] personality isn't something to note.  But that's the point.  She is normal.And despite Mei's lack of quirks, she ends up with Yamato, who seems to be the epitome of a male lead in shoujo.  Sociable, well-mannered, popular, handsome.  Making him the perfect foil for Mei.All in all, this is refreshing amidst all the other romance/slice-of-life works that have been coming to light as of late.

The connection between the characters, their feelings being portrayed, for both the loving feelings and sometimes the bad ones. Are they compatible as friends as well as lovers? It\'s nice when they go to the next level and make it a deep story, showing how they get to where they are and let you enjoy the journey along the way.Sukitte li na yo, or Say ""I love you"", has those qualities....Mei realises she\'s better off on her own, friends just hurt her and it always ends the same. The person she is at home and at school are completely different. At home she can be herself, nobodies around so she doesn\'t have to have her defenses up. When she\'s at school, she\'s constantly prepared to protect herself from people, trying her hardest to avoid them and just get through her day.Yamato seems to take an immediate liking to her, she\'s not like everybody else. The way he goes after her, trying hard to become her friend is adorable. It gives it such a good beginning and made me very excited to see how the story between them goes.He\'s the usual handsome guy character, his thoughts and actions are adorable, lots of girls are interested in him but now, he\'s just interested in one, Mei.

On the one hand, it has some of the most realistic interactions and relationships between characters that I have ever seen, with characters able to talk about kissing and sex without getting kicked 10m across the room. On the other hand, taking advantage of a girl in the middle of the day by forcibly kissing her as a way of ""scaring away a stalker"" is considered perfectly acceptable.It\'s kind of hard to fairly judge romance stories in anime. A lot of their basic premises are so similar, a lot of people will...write them off as being ""cliché"" or ""unoriginal"". But what makes each individual romance story unique is its execution. Say ""I Love You"" attempts to break through the cage of unoriginality by presenting us viewers with characters that actually accept the fact that they love and care for each other. No big misunderstandings. No cockblocks. No elaborate schemes by side characters to bring the painfully obvious couple together. Just pure, unadulterated romance. The way it should be.Despite loving the realistic way the show presents itself at the beginning, I have some major complaints about some of the directions the plot decides to take and how certain events unfold. It left me feeling dissatisfied and, at times, a tad frustrated.In the same vein that the story left me feeling dissatisfied, the main set of characters are a rather mixed bag as well. Tachibana Mei is your run-of-the-mill shoujo protagonist. She has no friends and looks and acts average in every way possible. A prefect slate for most of the show\'s viewers to place themselves into. Kurosawa Yamato, on the other hand, is your run-of-the-mill shoujo love interest. He has loads of friends and looks and acts cool in every way possible. A perfect character to have the show\'s viewers romanticise about. And thus a beautiful romance was born (?).Joking aside, the characters do have some quality to them. Tachibana\'s slow progression from having no friends to realising that she has people she can rely on is incredibly heartwarming, and the way that Kurosawa helps her achieve this is very cute. She is a very flawed person that can make you mad or even cringe at times, but that\'s just what makes her such a strong character.Kurosawa is the opposite. His flaws aren\'t what make you angry, but instead, his supposed lack of flaws. His over-confidence and easy-going attitude make him, at times, detestable. However, he is not always awful. His devotion to Tachibana and his realisation of his (many) mistakes make up for his blandness.Despite the main characters\' lost potential, it\'s hard to call either of them ""unlikeable"". I wish I could say the same about the supporting cast. Barely any of them are interesting in the slightest, and those that are don\'t get enough development to become anything memorable.

Ever since then, I wanted to watch a love anime which had the same standards, if possible, higher. However, when I sat down to watch this show just because of its cover art, I thought it was fine. However, I finally realized just how bad it was. As a matter of fact, this is not worth a penny when compared to Clannad Afterstory. Now instead of putting my analysos together in one enormous bundle, I shall set it up in all of the anime's different components.Story: (1/10)This anime...#2 flaw was that it was not at all original. It didn't even have one aspect of uniqueness. The story itself had noting which I haven't seen or heard of. However, Sukitte Ii ya no's # 1 problem was that it didn't even have a story for 40% of the time. The only thing it had was when Yamato became a model, Megumi had run away, and Yamato's old friend came along during the beginning of the series. The entire story, however, was also just a cycle. It's Mei becomes upset, Yamato comes to help, Mei becomes upset, Yamato comes to the rescue, etc. It was so difficult to watch the show by episode 8, that I was about to drop it. I have seen a lot of anime, some before this series, and have only quit watching one.Art: (5/10)The art for the story was well simulated. The background also had the same result. However, the character design was  pretty much, similar to how the series is, unoriginal. Now, some characters actually looked unique, such as Kai and even Kurosawa. However, besides that, everyone looks regular. Nothing about the art was amazing.Sound: (5/10)The music  scores were not well done. The opening was not at all emphasizing any of the story's aspects. It, by itself had no romantic mood or tone. Sure it was rather pleasant similar to the anime, however it would have gone better with some other anime, such as Shigatsu wa kimi no uso. The ending was actually somewhat better. However, it had, althoguh not as emphasized, the same atmosphere as the opening did. The soundtrack was somewhat better because it had actually brought out somewhat of a romantic mood. The sound for the anime however, was pretty good and unfortunately, was the best part of the show.Character: (4/10)The characters were terrible. Yamato was actually the best character on the show, with a 2/10. The characters are a huge part of why this show is so conventional. The characters are huge stereotypes. Mei was the outcast who was also somewhat of a tsundere. Yamato was a talented person at everything he did however, have a somewhat interesting backstory. Aiko also had an unoriginal backstory and was at the beginning, somewhat of a tsundere. Her other friend, whose name I can't remember, was at most, a futile part of the show. The show also brought in characters who just created more repition for the show.The characters weren't even original. The best point for the characters was that, as many animes, especially romantic ones have pervertedness, this anime didn't have any characters of the sort.Enjoyment: (3/10)I couldn't bear watching this show. It was just that terrible. I was counting down to when the last episode finally ended. I don't think that this show should have been released into the mainstream crowd.I gave an overall score of 3/10.

You spend the time and money for good music and art... then create the most generic story ever.This really feels like an attempt at creating a fanbase of obsessive depressed girls as that\'s really all the anime caters to. To do this it tells the story of how a depressed girl gets a ""hot"" guy by just living life... and then presents copy paste scenarios of the guy fighting for her love while everything just repeats itself.As I\'m not part of the target audience it felt extremely boring throughout, I only...completed it because I hate leaving thins unfinished.

Aside from that, I\'m sad to say that the show leaves a small impression overall.But (and there is a but) the way they showed how the romance unfolds between the two is memorable enough that even if I don\'t remember much about different aspects of the show, I still find myself recommending others to watch this title because of how realistic the show\'s portrayal of 2 high school students who are in a relationship.I\'m only reviewing this from memory since I only rewatched certain episodes...lately. For some reason, episode 8 really strikes me as the definitive episode of this show. It encapsulates what the whole series is about. I won\'t talk too much about it as I\'d rather you go see it for yourself. Honestly, if you\'ve liked that episode, I\'m pretty sure you would have enjoyed the whole series. If not, then maybe it\'s time to give this show up. (Although 8 episodes in might be a bit too late?)Story-wise, while it did grant us the leads getting together, there were still some parts that you will still find frustrating. As you would come to expect from the Popular Guy with the Unpopular Girl trope, there would be lots of girls who would come in between them. Not to mention, the misunderstandings. There were still tons of hair-pulling times when you just end up shouting to the screen ""God just tell her/him!"" but I believe that\'s something you can encounter in real life couples as well. There was really nothing spectacular story-wise. The last episode even left me wondering \'Okay, this is how they\'re going to end this?\' but that\'s really better left to a bigger discussion on Manga and Anime adaptations in general. Not to say the finale episode is completely underwhelming, however. You just have to watch it til the end.Looking back on it now, it\'s almost like they used the main relationship as a springboard to introduce new characters and bring to light their personalities and history. There were no new ""kinds"" of characters in Sukitte Ii na Yo. There were pretty much true to the type you\'d find in most Slice of Life/Coming of Age and Bishoujo animangas, but what I do appreciate that the author and writers have done here is give them a different dimension. Gave them a sense of maturity, if I may dare say.Art-wise, I have no complaints there. This is typical bishoujo fare. Slender, thin stylish characters. Surprisingly enough the guys (Yamato and Kei, the one who appears near the end?) seem to be designed alternatively? More punk-rock alternative than just mainstream good-looking. I don\'t mind it at all. I paid no attention too much on the sound, except the seiyuus have done a commendable job on their voice acting. Some parts can get pretty heavy drama-wise and they have managed to convey the emotion needed for those scenes. So since I don\'t care much for the OP and ED, I\'ll just give it a fair score.Overall, I find that as a romance coming of age series (I do consider it as that as we get to see the girl, at least, come into her own) Say I Love You or Sukitte Ii na Yo is pretty fulfilling and enjoyable.

To me, it did a fair job delivering the show's point.Sukitte Ii na Yo is like a combination of Kimi ni Todoke and True tears but more closely similar to Bokura Ga Ita. Though it had a few humor here and there, the anime feels more toward the serious feel. However, it had the typical boy-meets girl kind of plot, thus, the predictability. It had, on the contrary,...enough moments to swoon the anime's target audience, being a shoujo anime, which are the younger females.What ruined it is exposition. It had the complete elements of a good story, the continuity of the scenarios flowed without ruining the story line and they introduce a character subtly before letting it enter into an important scene. But the inter-relationship of the characters--where the character believability is most centered--fell. There weren't enough scenarios to portray the development. Their friendship was there, and it showed to be a vital part of the story, and the struggle was there but I so craved--as an audience wanting more intimacy from the charas--for more portrayal of the deepness of all their closeness and elaboration to sustain the character development. The plot might've focused too much on the two protagonists that it left some other potential side stories that could boost the character believability, relatability and lovability only to mediocrity.Rest assured, still, for that did not ruin the romance. As I've said, there were a lot of scenes that can make you swoon. And that it does not have any unnecessary details that can confuse, it stayed loyal to its path.I have nothing to comment about the art, it was well made for me. And the OP/ED did a good job into introducing and ending the story feel. The background music was also not interfering or irritating to overpower a scene, only to support, so I think it served its purpose.If you're looking for romance, like me when I did watch, give this a go but if you're looking for a story I'm not sure if this can satisfy you.

Personally the characters seemed a bit off from the manga, and the whole feel of the anime was slow and awkward. The manga is 100x better in my opinion, i pretty much had to force myself to watch the rest of this. ', 'Why I hated it but it was goodI watched a lot of animes without writing about my opinion in details (I am actually lazy), but it felt like I should state what in my view is the main point of this show and why it can be considered good.I didn\'t enjoy this for the most of time. Many times I was ready to drop it and mark it as bad. It makes you think just how messed up everybody is here a lot of times, with them behaving silly or bitchy (having random sex included, though I think of it as of a good part...because it is unusual to see in shojou). I also hate the feeling you get watching how misunderstandings create problems out of nothing as well as people pulling dirty tricks on others, and here you will get it a lot. All the predictable cliche situations probably ruined the impression for many people, too. Though, somehow it manages to make you continue watching and wonder about the next episode.After your typical shojou start where a popular guy meets a strange girl and takes an interest in her with all the moments which make you like ""aww"" - despite we don\'t have to watch them being too shy to approach each other directly till the end - they begin dating almost right away and this makes you curious what will we get to see next.The great thing is how it is not just focusing on depicting girls\' dreams about a great guy afterwards but on relationship problems, including friendship. I could say a lot analyzing each of the characters but it all sums up as they had their story which made them act as they did, not meaning it justifies their actions but somehow makes you understand and even like them more gradually. You can see that in other animes, too, but all the mess here was exceptional. Someone even compared it to School Days - but this show is certainly more realistic without yanderes killing anybody. Even the least stupid character (and I actually think he\'s a great guy) was trapped in a wish to get a revenge on his bullies (though he realized it was pointless afterwards).And this is how life is, as well. I bet some people could see themselves here or at least relate to the characters at some points. Everyone goes through similar problems in their school years, though it doesn\'t always work out in real life as it did here. That\'s why afterwards it leaves you in deep thought. Was it good that everything worked out for them here - well, I think yes. It would be a disappointment and too much of drama otherwise, while this way it even gives a viewer some hope.Things could seem rushed sometimes but I guess it can be overlooked since we only have 13 episodes. Actually, I think this being hard to watch already would only get worse if it had more. I didn\'t read the manga, though.There are some good dramatic moments and the art was nice, though some of the girls who were supposed to be beautiful looked more like silly and plastic to me. No complaints about the sound and the OP song was quite touching.Also, the last filler episode was kinda bad while the 12th episode really concludes the story, but I can imagine someone finding it funny.Then, in general I wanted to say that despite a lot of flaws and being hard to watch this is still worth watching. My overall score is 6 which I don\'t consider bad, more like ""somehow enjoyable"". The one thing is certain - with a lot of people hating or loving this show it probably won\'t leave you indifferent as well, so at least give it a try.P.S.: This is my first review here and I am not a native English speaker, so sorry for my writing flaws if you find any. because it is unusual to see in shojou).

I\'ve seen this story flushed out before..., but I would have to say a highlight was episode two, where it was actually interesting and unexpected, hehe. Another episode that I enjoyed was the episode with Nagi-san and the encounter of the cats! You will have to watch for it. There are love triangles and the occasional mean girl -- there are always mean girls and gossip around the school genre.Art: The animation was above average, but nothing extraordinary.Characters:The characters stick...out, that I enjoyed the secondary characters more than the main characters! IMO, I liked Kai-kun, Nagi and Megu-tan after she gets over an obstacle ( I will not say what, you will have to see).Enjoyment: I did enjoy the series overall. There are some cute episodes, some comedy and the romantic scenes are not obnoxious as opposed to harem genres...I\'d say give it a try, if you want a more slow-paced, slice-of-life type of romance anime, but if you\'re looking for a better romance with plenty of comedy these series trump over Sukitte Ii nya yo: 1) Toradora! 2) Ouran Host Club 3) Kaichou wa Maid sama 4)Skip BeatAlso, ""My Little Monster,"" which is what I\'m currently watching, has a similar premise, but the main guy and gal characters are more memorable. out, that I enjoyed the secondary characters more than the main characters!

It happened in high School for most of us, middle school for a few of us, and much later in life for those of us who were less fortunate.  It was that shy, awkward time in our lives when our hormones were raging, our need for intimate one-on-one companionship was impossible to ignore, and after putting forth more and more effort until it felt like we were just screaming our ears off into a dark abyss, we finally managed to convince the object of our desires to invest some time in us.  Well, that, or you...were the one being persuaded, and you eventually gave in and relented, but either way, we finally found somebody that we could call our own...  Somebody we could say was ours, to spend all of our free time with, all while people gossiped behind us about what may or may not be going on behind closed doors.  For the first time, we found somebody that we wanted to do all of that mushy stuff that grossed us out when we were children with.  We were finally one half of a couple.  You never forget something like that.For Mei Tachibana, first love isn’t the subject of nostalgia...  It’s coming for her, and it’s coming hard.  While she was used to spending time by herself, avoiding all of those phony, blood-sucking, backstabbing social circles who have burned her before.  With no interest in impressing anyone, Mei retreated into the background, not wanting to attract any attention to herself...  Which, ironically, attracts the attention of Yamato Kurosawa, the most attractive and infamous boy in school.  Having fallen in love with her at first sight, Yamato will stop at nothing to make her his, even while admirers, a former flame, a famous model, and even his own little sister try to compete with her for his attention.  She is of course attracted to him as well, but how can she let down her defenses for him, when she’s been hurt before?  How can she give herself over to someone, to trust him as he trusts her, when she has no idea what his intentions are, or what a plain, ordinary girl like her can possibly offer someone as perfect as him?  Oh, what’s a troubled young girl from Forks...  Um, I mean, Japan, to do?Say I Love You was animated by a company named ZEXCS, which is apparently pronounced like Zekushizu.  I don’t think I’ve ever come across that name before, but they were also partially behind the production of Diabolik Lovers, so I must have.  Taking a closer look at it’s history, it was apparently formed by a former JC Staff producer, and yeah, now I’m starting to put this company into context.  The work that I’ve seen from JC Staff have been wildly varying in terms of quality, but I’m kind of surprised to say that in this case, we have a title that’s wildly varying in quality all by itself.  Say I Love You was clearly a low budget series, as evidenced by the plethora of shots where people are frozen in the background like mannequins, stuck in time in the middle of their conversations, but it overall isn’t bad looking animation, either.  Thankfully, this kind of show doesn’t need to be heavy on movement, as a lot of it’s story is told through inner monologue and long wistful stares, so the constant dips in budget don’t ever get too distracting.Well, I say that, but the material they may have wasted a bit too much on is also present more than a few times.  That’s not to say saving money for the sake of scenes that require more movement is a bad thing, but the frozen backgrounds become a bit less forgivable when you’ve got money to waste on pointless shots like animations of children running at a distance as well as other similarly blurry, shaky-cam looking shots that I’m still not sure what they were trying to do with.  Like I said, though, this isn’t a genre that really needs to be told through a lot of movement,and considering how fluid the little movement it has actually is, this show actually looks slightly above average compared to others of it’s ilk.  They put a lot of effort into making basic motions and interactions such as minor scuffles and walk cycles look realistic, even if characters freeze a bit too often when they’re talking to each other.  Aside from the few key visual tropes of a shoujo anime, character designs skew towards realism, and while the backgrounds are adequate overall, there are brief moments where the artwork and lighting are so beautiful that you might actually forget the few nagging budget issues.The music for the series has a very pleasant tone to it, as do most Shoujo based soundtracks, but this particular composition by Yuuji Nomi just had that little extra bit of effort and diversity behind it.  Some of the tunes are a bit loopy, and can become annoying when played on endless repeat in the background of scenes where nothing’s really going on, but the ones with actual purpose and intentions behind them are kinda genius, using a number of different instruments to bring a soft, melodramatic feel to the story.  From the xylophone to the violin, every note is played with the right atmospheric pace, with vibrations in all the right places to convey the wavering hearts of the cast.  Unfortunately, the opening theme Friendship by Okazaki Ritsuko, is a bit more on the generic side.  If you’re heard a shoujo opening song before, then you’ve heard the one, which honestly just feels like a bland version of the op from Fruits Basket.  It’s not necessarily bad, per se, but you won’t miss anything by skipping it, and the same goes for the ending.Likewise, the English dub isn’t bad, but it’s really kind of unremarkable, as it mostly just goes through the motions.  honestly, they didn’t even bother matching the lip flaps in a lot of scenes.  Actors Greg Ayres and Monica rial, who should have been breaths of fresh air in any dub they’re in, play disappointingly close to their most common typecastings, with Ayres playing the pervy girl-crazy best friend, and Monica playing the likeable, bubbly best friend.  The same could be said for Andrew Love, who once again plays a somewhat dimwitted tough guy role, but since he gets misused a lot easier than those other two, I’ll just consider his playing to type a good thing.  If there’s an especially sour note among the cast, it’s Leraldo Anzaldua, who I’ve never been a particular fan of, and they gave him the lead role.  His approach to the character seems to almost be inspired by Robert Pattinson’s approach to Edward Cullen...  Play him as you see him, even if that interpretation is a negative one, and Leraldo plays Yamato like a wet rag with all the personality and enthusiasm you’d expect if Shyamalan was directing him.There are a few beaming lights, though...  Caitlynn French does a way better job with Mei Tachibana than the role actually required, all while giving just as honest a portrayal as Leraldo gave.  She plays the role as sometimes bitchy, sometimes preachy, while never becoming unlikeable in either tone, and she even made her character’s depression feel a lot more crushing than the original Japanese seiyuu did.  There are some lines she had to speak in this show that were downright uncomfortable, and probably not by design, and she still did surprisingly well with them.  Emily Neves was also a gem as the snooty, duplicitous Megumi, and while that’s not really a surprise as she’s always been a bit of a chameleon, you don’t really get the full effect of it until she breaks down towards the end of the series.  Oh, Brittany Karbowski and Tiffany Grant also get small parts in this, and while that alone should be a selling point, they’re roles are limited, both in time and in content.  I can’t really condemn the dub, as there are a few really good performances in it, but I feel like if I’m being honest, I’ve gotta recommend the sub.You know, I’m not immune to the charms of a good shoujo anime.  I really don’t think anyone is, even if they protest that fact.  They’re like anime chick flicks...  Sometimes, even hardcore action and gore fans need to sit down for a feel-good viewing of The Princess Bride.  Likewise, I’ve yet to meet an anime fan that didn’t enjoy Princess Tutu and Ouran High School host club, and while those two shows do deliberately contain a lot of dual appeal, I don’t really mind the more stereotypically shoujo anime, either.  I liked Fruits Basket.  I love Ikuhara’s work.  Those of you who remember my Vampire Knight review will know that I consider the first season to be a major guilty pleasure.  I don’t mind the giant eyed heroines with absurdly rendered pupils and eyelashes.  I don’t mind skinny bishounen makes with haircuts that are ultimately dated because they’re based on whatever’s popular at the time.  I’ve got nothing against the genre or it’s tropes, so I don’t want you to think I’m biased when I say that my first time watching this series, almost exactly one year ago, I dropped it after three episodes.Before I get intro why, let’s go over some of the more persistent problems hiding right in plain sight just beneath it’s flowery surface.  Starting with the main character, Mei Taniguchi, we’re told early on that she’s not like other girls.  She’s not like the gossipy girls who play social games for their own benefit, and she’s also not like the girls who alter their natural appearances to impress guys.  Okay, we know what she’s not, but what is she?  We know she has a tragic backstory where some rotten kids blamed her for something they did wrong, and that’s caused her to become distant and bitter even several years later, and we know that she’s honest, and occasionally has wisdom to offer people, but aside from all that, I’ve gotta be honest, she’s kind of boring.  She’s a textbook Mary-sue character, who’s only real flaws are her shy nature and mistrust of others, and she doesn’t do a whole lot to solve these problems.  Other people do.  Hell, she rarely ever makes progressive or active choices as a protagonist.And her boyfriend Yamato Kurosawa is even worse.  This isn’t really my biggest problem with him, but his biggest problem is objectively the fact that he’s so damned inconsistent.  There are a ton of examples I can bring up, but I feel like one of te most obvious is when we find out that he’s not a virgin.  It’s explained to us that it’s because he’s really selfless and kind, and he slept with a girl because she made him think it would make him happy.  Well, this happened in the same episode that he invited himself along on Mei’s trip to the salon to get her hair cut, but he immediately hijacked her plans in order to take her out on an abrupt date.  She misses the salon, upon which he says that he likes her with long hair.  Oh, NOW you have an opinion?  Your pants fly off because a girl asks for your dick, and you’re totally a martyr, but when a girl thinks her hair is getting too frizzy to manage, THAT’s something you’ll voice your opposition to?  When it comes to character development, actions speak louder than words, and his actions in this case just felt controlling and manipulative.And that’s not even him at his worst.  People often give him shit for kissing Mei without permission in order to get rid of her stalker...  Which, while effective and somewhat excusable, feels a bit overkill.  As a wise red dragon once said, never play an ace if a 2 will do...  They seem to forget that in the same episode as the salon incident, towards the end, he catches her hiding and watching him, and takes the opportunity to kiss her without permission again, ultimately pinning her against a wall and kissing her into submission.  If she hadn’t been receptive to that, she could have had him behind bars for sexual assault.  He ditches her for hours in the middle of a date because his friend had something to give him, he went over to another girl’s house for weeks after school without telling Mei, and he doesn’t even make a habit of asking her what she wants to do until the final third of the story...  Up until then, it’s always “Let’s do this,” or “You should...”  I am honestly convinced that the anime adaptation skipped over some info dump about him suffering some kind of brain damage as a child, to explain the way he behaves throughout the series.See, this isn’t just a shoujo romance series.  It’s something far more insidious.  It’s a self insert wish fulfillment fantasy boyfriend series.  Mei isn’t supposed to be an interesting character, she’s supposed to be a blank slate for the audience and presumably the writer to imprint themselves onto, so that they can live out the experience of having a popular, handsome boy getting all up in their business.  Yamato isn’t supposed to be an interesting character either, he’s supposed to be an unobtainable dreamboat who only has eyes for the main character, much to the dismay of, like, oh my god, the entire school.  It’s like Twilight without the sparkling vampires, or 50 Shades of Grey without the BDSM and torture devices.  Hell, the only torturing device involved was my own DVD player.  Don’t get me wrong dudes are guilty of this too...  We tend to get a lot of stories that depict us as badass loners who get bothered by sexy girls who fight with us but eventually succumb to our awesomeness through no real change of our own, like Steins;Gate and Sword Art Online, but Say I Love you takes this concept to a special new low, because I have a very specific person in mind who might be dreaming it up.Just for fun, I’d like you to imagine Tomoko from Watamote...  Yes, we’re really doing this...  Alone in her room, bitching about the people in her life, when all of a sudden she’s like “Wouldn’t it be awesome if the most popular boy in school fell in love with me?  That would show all of those losers.  He’d be obsessed with me, and it would be because I’m different.  I’m not like all of those back stabbing bitches, or those tramps who slather on gallons of make-up to whore themselves out to boys.  He’ll fall in love with me at first sight, and he wouldn’t take no for an answer.  I’m not easy, though, so I’d play hard to get, and he’d come at me kind of rough, but that’s okay, because we both know we’re going to be together forever!  He’d even turn down a model for me...  no, wait, he IS a model!  Oh shit, I’d better write this down!  I can make a manga out of this!”  And then after two hours of brainstorming, she’s like “Ooh, and then his friend comes back, and he totally falls in love with me because we like the same theme park, and they’d totally fight over me!  Oh, and we get a hotel room, and...  Nope, gotta think of my demographic.  nothing happens at the hotel because he respects me, and while he’s more experienced than me, none of what he’s done before me matters, because none of it involved me!”It’s mindlessly self-indulgent right down to the fact that backstabbing classmates are used as a constant source of antagonism, as well as being basically what every named antagonists’ backstory boils down to, and no attempt is ever made to humanize them.  They come close to it as part of Megumi’s backstory, when they abandon her in favor of someone she refused to invite, but even then, the abrupt decision and hive mind element to the scene make no sense.  Actually, there’s a lot of occurrences in this anime that make no sense, from Mei and Yamato leaving a festival early all because they’re friends decided to go home(They seriously wouldn’t take the opportunity to be alone?), to Yamato’s creepy relationship with his sister, who he seems to act as both the parent and the crush of, to how easily Megumi comes undone over her inability to ensnare Yamato, even though she literally just decided out of the blue that she wanted to date him based on his looks.  The tragic part is that she’s clearly a rip off of Ami from Toradora, who was a much better written and explored character.Earlier in this review, I referred to the relationship between Mei and Yamato as their first love, and I did so for a specific reason...  It was my attempt at gently stating that, in all likelihood, it won’t be their last.  Not only are such romances doomed to fail in real life, but the one between them isn’t even based on a solid foundation.  Yamato’s love for Mei was decided and settled upon based entirely on his first impression of her, and he doesn’t even bother getting to know her before imprinting on her.  Outside of his good looks, I can’t see what Mei sees in him, outside of his persistence and refusal to give up on her.  Their love, respectively, is superficial and circumstantial.  He didn’t even open her up to other people, like she claims...  Once he picked her, other people came to her out of curiosity, through no effort of his own.  In their own mutually exclusive ways, these two characters don’t even know what love is, and eventually, I can’t help but get the feeling that their relationship is destined to end with tears and heartbreak, with the school’s new power couple splitting up, and honestly?  I’m okay with that.With most high school anime romances, even the bad ones, you’re given a sense of purpose in the two of them staying together...  Even in a shitshow like Clannad, where I wanted Tomoya to get remarried after his wife died, he was still destined to marry Nagisa before anybody else, as their emotional codependency formed too intense a connection to break.  In the Love Hina manga, we get to see over time how the spineless dumb-ass Keitaro was able to win Naru’s heart.  In a good show like Toradora, you know enough about Ryuji and Taiga’s friendship and backgrounds that we know they don’t make sense with anybody else.  In Say I Love You, I didn’t get a sense of any of that.  If they were to break up, with Yamato dating Megumi and Mei winding up with Kai, those relationships wouldn’t necessarily last forever either, but it wouldn’t feel like some major tragedy...  It would just feel like “Ah, part 2 of the story!”  And yeah, with this being the worst case scenario, the series lacks any real stakes, making it kind of tedious to get through.  Honestly, the final episode was a joke, with the two of them being separated by a series of phone tag related coincidences.  Yawn.Say I Love You is available from Section23 films both on Bluray and DVD, and can also be viewed on Crunchyroll.  The original manga by Kanae Hazuki is available stateside from Kodansha comics, and the live action film is apparently not available in the US, but from what I’ve heard that’s not such a bad thing as even fans of the anime and manga find it soulless and bland.Much like the shoujo genre, I really don’t have anything against melodrama, but there’s a much clearer distinction to be made with that material...  Melodrama tends to work best when it’s self aware.  Anime like Bento and so many shoujo titles outside of this one were written by people who knew that the stories they were writing didn’t measure up to much in terms of stakes, so they compensated by amping up the emotions, infusing character development into the plot, and using themes to add flavor to what was going on.  Say I Love You tries to do this, with a breaking bracelet symbolizing a broken heart, and cats getting along when their owners do, but for the most part, it does the bare minimum, creating a bad romance between two 2-dimensional characters that has no reason or power to stand the test of time.  The music and the animation are above average, and to be fair, Mei and Yamato do become a lot more tolerable of a couple in the final third when Mei starts to show a bit more initiative and Yamato starts to treat her more like a person, but I think a romance where the guy sounds ten times happier about his new kitten than about his new girlfriend leaves a lot to be desired.  I give Say I Love You a 3/10. were the one being persuaded, and you eventually gave in and relented, but either way, we finally found somebody that we could call our own...  Somebody we could say was ours, to spend all of our free time with, all while people gossiped behind us about what may or may not be going on behind closed doors.  For the first time, we found somebody that we wanted to do all of that mushy stuff that grossed us out when we were children with.  We were finally one half of a couple.  You never forget something like that.For Mei Tachibana, first love isn’t the subject of nostalgia...  It’s coming for her, and it’s coming hard.  While she was used to spending time by herself, avoiding all of those phony, blood-sucking, backstabbing social circles who have burned her before.  With no interest in impressing anyone, Mei retreated into the background, not wanting to attract any attention to herself...  Which, ironically, attracts the attention of Yamato Kurosawa, the most attractive and infamous boy in school.  Having fallen in love with her at first sight, Yamato will stop at nothing to make her his, even while admirers, a former flame, a famous model, and even his own little sister try to compete with her for his attention.  She is of course attracted to him as well, but how can she let down her defenses for him, when she’s been hurt before?  How can she give herself over to someone, to trust him as he trusts her, when she has no idea what his intentions are, or what a plain, ordinary girl like her can possibly offer someone as perfect as him?  Oh, what’s a troubled young girl from Forks...  Um, I mean, Japan, to do?Say I Love You was animated by a company named ZEXCS, which is apparently pronounced like Zekushizu.  I don’t think I’ve ever come across that name before, but they were also partially behind the production of Diabolik Lovers, so I must have.  Taking a closer look at it’s history, it was apparently formed by a former JC Staff producer, and yeah, now I’m starting to put this company into context.  The work that I’ve seen from JC Staff have been wildly varying in terms of quality, but I’m kind of surprised to say that in this case, we have a title that’s wildly varying in quality all by itself.  Say I Love You was clearly a low budget series, as evidenced by the plethora of shots where people are frozen in the background like mannequins, stuck in time in the middle of their conversations, but it overall isn’t bad looking animation, either.  Thankfully, this kind of show doesn’t need to be heavy on movement, as a lot of it’s story is told through inner monologue and long wistful stares, so the constant dips in budget don’t ever get too distracting.Well, I say that, but the material they may have wasted a bit too much on is also present more than a few times.  That’s not to say saving money for the sake of scenes that require more movement is a bad thing, but the frozen backgrounds become a bit less forgivable when you’ve got money to waste on pointless shots like animations of children running at a distance as well as other similarly blurry, shaky-cam looking shots that I’m still not sure what they were trying to do with.  Like I said, though, this isn’t a genre that really needs to be told through a lot of movement,and considering how fluid the little movement it has actually is, this show actually looks slightly above average compared to others of it’s ilk.  They put a lot of effort into making basic motions and interactions such as minor scuffles and walk cycles look realistic, even if characters freeze a bit too often when they’re talking to each other.  Aside from the few key visual tropes of a shoujo anime, character designs skew towards realism, and while the backgrounds are adequate overall, there are brief moments where the artwork and lighting are so beautiful that you might actually forget the few nagging budget issues.The music for the series has a very pleasant tone to it, as do most Shoujo based soundtracks, but this particular composition by Yuuji Nomi just had that little extra bit of effort and diversity behind it.  Some of the tunes are a bit loopy, and can become annoying when played on endless repeat in the background of scenes where nothing’s really going on, but the ones with actual purpose and intentions behind them are kinda genius, using a number of different instruments to bring a soft, melodramatic feel to the story.  From the xylophone to the violin, every note is played with the right atmospheric pace, with vibrations in all the right places to convey the wavering hearts of the cast.  Unfortunately, the opening theme Friendship by Okazaki Ritsuko, is a bit more on the generic side.  If you’re heard a shoujo opening song before, then you’ve heard the one, which honestly just feels like a bland version of the op from Fruits Basket.  It’s not necessarily bad, per se, but you won’t miss anything by skipping it, and the same goes for the ending.Likewise, the English dub isn’t bad, but it’s really kind of unremarkable, as it mostly just goes through the motions.  honestly, they didn’t even bother matching the lip flaps in a lot of scenes.  Actors Greg Ayres and Monica rial, who should have been breaths of fresh air in any dub they’re in, play disappointingly close to their most common typecastings, with Ayres playing the pervy girl-crazy best friend, and Monica playing the likeable, bubbly best friend.  The same could be said for Andrew Love, who once again plays a somewhat dimwitted tough guy role, but since he gets misused a lot easier than those other two, I’ll just consider his playing to type a good thing.  If there’s an especially sour note among the cast, it’s Leraldo Anzaldua, who I’ve never been a particular fan of, and they gave him the lead role.  His approach to the character seems to almost be inspired by Robert Pattinson’s approach to Edward Cullen...  Play him as you see him, even if that interpretation is a negative one, and Leraldo plays Yamato like a wet rag with all the personality and enthusiasm you’d expect if Shyamalan was directing him.There are a few beaming lights, though...  Caitlynn French does a way better job with Mei Tachibana than the role actually required, all while giving just as honest a portrayal as Leraldo gave.  She plays the role as sometimes bitchy, sometimes preachy, while never becoming unlikeable in either tone, and she even made her character’s depression feel a lot more crushing than the original Japanese seiyuu did.  There are some lines she had to speak in this show that were downright uncomfortable, and probably not by design, and she still did surprisingly well with them.  Emily Neves was also a gem as the snooty, duplicitous Megumi, and while that’s not really a surprise as she’s always been a bit of a chameleon, you don’t really get the full effect of it until she breaks down towards the end of the series.  Oh, Brittany Karbowski and Tiffany Grant also get small parts in this, and while that alone should be a selling point, they’re roles are limited, both in time and in content.  I can’t really condemn the dub, as there are a few really good performances in it, but I feel like if I’m being honest, I’ve gotta recommend the sub.You know, I’m not immune to the charms of a good shoujo anime.  I really don’t think anyone is, even if they protest that fact.  They’re like anime chick flicks...  Sometimes, even hardcore action and gore fans need to sit down for a feel-good viewing of The Princess Bride.  Likewise, I’ve yet to meet an anime fan that didn’t enjoy Princess Tutu and Ouran High School host club, and while those two shows do deliberately contain a lot of dual appeal, I don’t really mind the more stereotypically shoujo anime, either.  I liked Fruits Basket.  I love Ikuhara’s work.  Those of you who remember my Vampire Knight review will know that I consider the first season to be a major guilty pleasure.  I don’t mind the giant eyed heroines with absurdly rendered pupils and eyelashes.  I don’t mind skinny bishounen makes with haircuts that are ultimately dated because they’re based on whatever’s popular at the time.  I’ve got nothing against the genre or it’s tropes, so I don’t want you to think I’m biased when I say that my first time watching this series, almost exactly one year ago, I dropped it after three episodes.Before I get intro why, let’s go over some of the more persistent problems hiding right in plain sight just beneath it’s flowery surface.  Starting with the main character, Mei Taniguchi, we’re told early on that she’s not like other girls.  She’s not like the gossipy girls who play social games for their own benefit, and she’s also not like the girls who alter their natural appearances to impress guys.  Okay, we know what she’s not, but what is she?  We know she has a tragic backstory where some rotten kids blamed her for something they did wrong, and that’s caused her to become distant and bitter even several years later, and we know that she’s honest, and occasionally has wisdom to offer people, but aside from all that, I’ve gotta be honest, she’s kind of boring.  She’s a textbook Mary-sue character, who’s only real flaws are her shy nature and mistrust of others, and she doesn’t do a whole lot to solve these problems.  Other people do.  Hell, she rarely ever makes progressive or active choices as a protagonist.And her boyfriend Yamato Kurosawa is even worse.  This isn’t really my biggest problem with him, but his biggest problem is objectively the fact that he’s so damned inconsistent.  There are a ton of examples I can bring up, but I feel like one of te most obvious is when we find out that he’s not a virgin.  It’s explained to us that it’s because he’s really selfless and kind, and he slept with a girl because she made him think it would make him happy.

I give Say I Love You a 3/10.', 'To be fair, I don\'t watch/read alot of Shoujo anime/manga (I think my username spoils this) but I did ended up watching this title and another one this year (Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun). I think the last official Shoujo title I checked out was Vampire Knight, for a couple of volumes till I got bored.Anyways.....Art = 7: I liked the art style of this anime, very soft and warm. Gives me that warm summer feeling, yes - that\'s a technical term. It\'s not a frantic anime so it was never pushed to the limit. The designs were ok for the most part.Sound = 6: It did...its job.Character = 7: For the most part, the stereotypes were filled in this title, maybe except the male protagonist - he didn\'t really have the ""im too hot and cool vibe"", just a normal cool guy, but that type of character is predominant in western media so nothing new for me. I guess I gave this a decent rating because of the chemistry between Mai and Yamato.Story = 6: Its pretty generic, nothing new to see here.Overall, even though this anime got ok marks technical wise, I still enjoyed it. Can\'t explain it other than it has that ""it"" factor. Personally, it reminds me of summer love, reminiscent to that movie ""A Walk To Remember"".So if you\'re a romanticist (like I am), or just looking for a decent Shoujo anime then you might as well check it out as it might incite old feelings of romance in our old, narcissistic minds, lol. its job.Character = 7: For the most part, the stereotypes were filled in this title, maybe except the male protagonist - he didn\'t really have the ""im too hot and cool vibe"", just a normal cool guy, but that type of character is predominant in western media so nothing new for me.

Its a 'hot'/popular guy falling for a unpopular girl who has little to no friends. This topic is a bit overused in animes. Also, I think this is quite similar to Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun because it starts out at guy liking girl who has no friends, the girl 'having' some friends, then some other guy walks in and likes the girl and wants to win her over. I would say this anime is okay, not exactly my favorite, I feel there are a lot of awkward scenes, and, do not be offended!, but I find...Yamato very unattractive and kind of hard to look at.

They are never really there for you."" (Not exactly like that, but you get the idea).Now Mei doesn\'t speak to anyone in school. So when the most popular boy in school, not to mention the most handsome boy, ends up getting on her bad side she pretty much kicks him in the face. From there, Yamato Kurosawa (the popular boy)...is instantly intrigued by her.

The anime just continues to follow the relationship between Yamato and Mei.When it comes to the overall enjoyment, I would have to say this anime kept me smiling and wishing for a boyfriend all the way through. It was cute and had romantic and giggly scenes that were also very heart-wrenching. But don\'t be fooled. The anime takes a very serious turn with the introduction of characters such as Aiko and Megumi. From there the anime focuses on the importance of self-love and dignity. I believed that the introduction of such a serious topic was brilliant and really made the person watching become more self-aware and learn much more about their life and themselves.I would heartily recommend this anime to anybody who is feeling down. It was capable of making me smile and laugh at my darkest moments, and those are dark. So 7/10 overall with a 9/10 rating in art- because I thought the art was so different and stunning.It\'s worth a try and I promise, when you watch this anime, you\'ll never regret it. is instantly intrigued by her.

This isn\'t your everyday typical heartbreak romance. This anime could be hit and miss towards a variety of audiences. For example: If you are the type of person who enjoys a very dramatic romance, this isn\'t your pot of tea. If you\'re into a solid romantic story line between two lovable characters with interesting pasts, then I\'d definitely recommend it. 9/10. When you watch the anime, you\'ll find 13 episodes, that\'s what this review is based off of. People around the internet have been saying that the story continues in the manga but...there just haven\'t been any new episodes for anime. I would prefer the anime over the manga. there just haven\'t been any new episodes for anime. I would prefer the anime over the manga.', ""In any art form, there is a reason formulas exist. Even when 'tried-and-true' passes into 'old cliché', we humans are drawn to the same things over and over again, because ultimately humanity itself hasn't changed. We all face the same basic problems and have the same basic desires. And so when we see these things portrayed in a story, we connect with it, no matter how unoriginal it may be. In fact, there's a sense in which a story can be made all the better by being as unoriginal as possible and instead simply dealing with the life experiences we all have in a way...we can all identify with.Such is the brilliance of Sukitte ii na Yo. It's not the most exciting anime, the most thrilling, or the most clever. Rather it finds its charm in simply being genuinely human.*Story*Mei Tachibana is a Grade A introvert, a social recluse who has withdrawn herself from any and all friendships on the sentiment that relationships will only end up with her getting hurt. But quickly file away any tsundere stereotypes that description may evoke—Mei isn't afraid to speak her mind or portray her feelings, she simply struggles with finding anyone she trusts enough to do so.And the least likely of all people to become her first close friend is the most popular boy in high school, Yamato Kurosawa, yet that's exactly what happens when an incident with one of Yamato's friends ends up with Mei innocently and unintentionally stealing Yamato's heart. Unmoved by all of the skin-deep offerings of love from the other girls in school, Yamato is drawn to Mei above them all, first out of simple compassion and then out of love for her genuine depth of character.It's a love story that wastes no time delaying romance for the big climax, but instead establishes very early on who the pair will be and then spends the rest of its time showing their development, and all the life situations, trust and broken trust that come with it. It's both a story of one young man's relentless pursuit of the girl he loves for reasons even she cannot comprehend, and how one person's affection can heal old wounds and restore lost joy in life for everyone around them. And no, it is not easy. It *is* complicated, it *is* messy...but it is also beautiful, not merely in spite of it all, but even because of it.If that description doesn't make it clear enough, however, shounen fans should be warned: Sukitte ii na Yo falls pretty heavily in shoujo territory. While it may not be a terribly unique romance, a generic one it is not, clearly skewed to a female perspective. Not that that's a bad thing, but it is something to be aware of going in, as this in itself will limit Sukitte ii na Yo's audience, particularly among males.*Characters*Sukitte ii na Yo is not interested in prolonging unnecessary social drama through misunderstanding and miscommunication and overreaction as is typical for slice of life and romance anime. While that's not to say none of the characters or situations they find themselves in are exaggerated in any way (they are), they all seem to share the same level of intelligence as the viewer rather than be cursed with substantially less. Slice of life anime buffs will encounter several familiar scenarios that usually end up painfully drawn out for no other cause than at least one character's utter stupidity or sudden indecisiveness, but instead Sukitte ii na Yo seems to be almost self-aware, using these moments as opportunities to really let its characters shine, often in unexpected ways.Of course, not everyone is instantly likeable. In fact, *at first* it is perhaps difficult to like much of anyone at all aside from Mei, who is undoubtedly the series' anchor. But this is part of the journey that Sukitte ii na Yo takes the viewer on: the same journey of Mei herself as she struggles to open up and learn to appreciate those around her—or rebuke and reject them as bad influences, if need be. It isn't always immediately obvious what each character's true colors are, and there is a purpose for each personality represented—even those painted in broad brush strokes to make a point. It could be said that a few characters develop too quickly, however this is simply an anime that covers a long period of time very fast, and overall the pacing is just right to allow the audience to develop with the characters without feeling distanced or left behind. And time is just what these characters need—initially each is carefully designed to bring something out of Mei, to whom even Yamato takes a distant second on her personal journey back into society, but it isn't until the final third of the show that it becomes apparent just how deep and complex everyone else truly is and has been all along.*Animation*Each decade has brought with it its own style of animation, but Sukitte ii na Yo deviates a bit from them all, opting instead for a style that, much like its plot, is just one step short of actual realism. It isn't *completely* removed from popular animation, seen in how often it falls back on familiar touches to keep itself accessible and clearly recognizable as modern anime. But at the same time, it is realistic enough that the viewer can often get lost in its world and forget that it is 2D animation, and yet true to its genre it remains more beautiful than life, engaging the imagination from the very start and never letting go. Unfortunately it does also fall into the common trap of portraying Japanese high schoolers as 20-somethings of more or less ambiguous ethnicity, but while in theory this ought to detract from the realistic premise, in practice it ultimately makes the plot easier to identify with for a wider range of people. If you don't believe me, just look up a trailer of the live-action adaptation of this story and see if it maintains the same atmosphere in J-drama form. Sukitte ii na Yo both is and isn't a great departure from the norm—all the familiar anime character types are here; they're simply more grown-up and life-like than average for anime. Even so, Sukitte ii na Yo is a nice blend of realism and fantasy, something refreshingly different despite not being entirely unique.*Soundtrack*Sometimes the mark of a well-done soundtrack is that it goes completely unnoticed. It could be said that is true of Sukitte ii na Yo, what with its mostly subtle cues occupying the background and more often than not supporting the scene rather than defining it. What matters is that the soundtrack here really does perform that supporting role, augmenting the atmosphere just enough to generate the intended feelings, emotions, and atmosphere.And on quite the other hand, the anime's opening theme song, an arrangement of the late Ritsuko Okazaki's 'Friendship', is one of the most perfect little diddies I've ever heard in this or any other medium—one of those songs so soft and light and that flows so naturally you can't help but feel as if you've heard it a million times before. If you're at all susceptible to the genre it will immediately sweep you up in its bliss, and yet 'Friendship' isn't strictly-speaking a happy song. Instead the lyrics effortlessly capture both the beautiful and difficult aspects of life, not only driving home the overarching themes of the anime but giving all who identify with its message a life song to listen to over and over and over again. The soundtrack of Sukitte ii na Yo may be so-so as a whole, but like Mei in a crowd of mediocrity this one track is easily capable of making up for it, and singlehandedly sets the anime's tone very well with each successive episode.*Conclusion*Overall, Sukitte ii na Yo is an above-average anime that tells a mostly average tale. While as time progresses certain unusual events arise to shake things up from the norm, what makes it truly special is simply that it begins where most stories end with a 'happily ever after' and instead explores a much more human alternative. And while like many slice of life anime it suffers from being a bit contrived at times, for the most part it rises above what is expected and builds its characters with a surprising amount of depth and maturity. It may not quite be a classic, but its cult following is well earned by the likes of its deep characters, themes, and solid animation. we can all identify with.Such is the brilliance of Sukitte ii na Yo.

No supernatural beings, no action, just... romance and drama. These types of anime aren\'t necessarily my favorite, but I was surprised and pleased with the warm, bubbly feeling Sukitte Ii na yo left me.My thoughts on...Plot:I really enjoyed how they went about with the story plot. It wasn\'t too rushed, other than the beginning when Yamato kissed Mei to protect her from the stalker. It did a good job showing how romance works as well, with both love...and arguments, and how interactions could affect them. It wasn\'t just automatic love either, unlike some anime. The different scenarios the both of them got into made their relationship stronger and brought them closer together, eventually to the point that they weren\'t afraid to admit that they were dating and weren\'t afraid to express their love to each other. Overall, the plot was good and had good pacing. The romance wasn\'t rushed and seemed realistic.Overall Score: 8/10Characters:-Mei TachibanaI could actually easily relate to her. Her personality resembles mine, kind of reserved and quiet. I also hold in strong emotions like she does and I don\'t really talk about what\'s going on that causes that emotion. The main thing I disliked about her was the fact that she easily believed rumors. I did feel kind of bad for her though, because it did seem as Yamato was being a total jerk at one point.-Yamato KurosawaI really enjoyed his personality and how he expressed his feelings for Mei. He seemed to genuinely care about her and wasn\'t one of your typical, emotionless shoujo guys. He was kind to almost every person, which is also something I liked about him. I didn\'t care for how he was a jerk at times, however, he always made it up. I absolutely loved it when he would run after Mei and try to find her to apologize. It always made me smile.The side characters were okay. I didn\'t necessarily care for any of them or in a way that would make me want to mention my thoughts about them like I did to the two main characters. Something the anime could\'ve worked on was giving them more airing time, because I never actually got attached to any of the side characters like I do in most anime.Overall Score: 6/10Artwork/Character Design:I actually enjoyed the artwork in this anime a lot. It was really nice and had the correct amount of detail. Enough that it showed good features, but not too much that it became overbearing. The only issue was the fact that occasionally the background was too colorful that it distracted me from the rest of anime.  My favorite character design was Yamato\'s. I really enjoyed the details of his hair and how his eyes have sharp details but look soft. I also did enjoy the eyes of this anime. They\'re so detailed, especially the eyes/eyelashes.Overall Score: 8/10Final Thoughts:A really cute anime that is very realistic with the aspects of life. The plot was typical for an anime of the romance genre, but it was original in its own way and made the anime different somehow. I would recommend it to anyone who likes shoujo or romance with a bit of drama. and arguments, and how interactions could affect them. It wasn\'t just automatic love either, unlike some anime.

It\'s refreshing in that the ""whole does he/she like me"" is over pretty much episode 2 which allows you to see the relationship grow. The bad thing about it is nothing ever really establishes why these two actually like each other and have a connection. Yamato\'s initial reasoning for being interested in Mei is that she roundhouse kicked him which makes her ""interesting."" Mei on the other hand is so new to having friends or anyone show any real interest in her, would fall for...the first guy who genuinely gave her attention (something that is kind of made obvious when another character comes in). While they do have personalities that seem to get on well and work together, there is no real spark to them. The amount of obstacles they face would have broken up any normal couple with this little passion and substance.The story\'s strength lies in the fact that despite characters with all sorts of traits with various levels of popularity, they have all struggled with their insecurities and their relationships (both romantic and platonic). Although there are some background characters, the majority have their own stories. Transitioning them into the main story is what throws everything off. It\'s never really stated why Mei\'s two best girlfriends all of a sudden became her BFFs out of almost no where (especially with the one who appeared latter). A person of Yamato\'s past who is transitioned in also was done poorly and his actions didn\'t even make sense with the story. Even Mei\'s nemesis who is interested in Yamato is poorly done and their first initial encounter is out of character for her Not to mention they do not explain her relationship to a friend you had no idea she even had when she was younger. Allowing connections and relationships to develop a bit more would have greatly strengthened this story. Transitions are super rushed. the first guy who genuinely gave her attention (something that is kind of made obvious when another character comes in).

I found them always so boring but they become quite interesting because of all that drama that happens. Not to mention that they are usually 12 or 13-episode-long, which makes them perfect if you just want to relax. I saw a short video on instagram for this anime and I instantly wanted to watch it. And here is, a few days after I finished it, the review on Sukitte Ii na yo or Say ""I Love You"".Plot and Story LineSay ""I Love You""...follows our main character Mei Tachibana trough her high school life. After an incident in middle school, where all her so-called friends turned their backs on her she decided to stay away from people as far as possible. She never wanted to have friends again because she didn\'t want to go trough the same experience again. Her method seemed to work until a certain guy showed up and changed everything. That boy happens to be Yamato Kurosawa-the most popular guy at school.  He was probably the only one not to ignore the introverted Mei and what\'s more, he even freely gave her his phone number.Sukitte Ii na yo is a story about the slowly developing relationship between Mei and Yamato, along with some side stories that add up to the drama of a teenage life. It is all about relationships, friendship and good looks. It really portrays the daily school life of every teenager. Whether it is a girl, jealous of the other one because she is going with the guy the first one likes, or it is a boy that just wanted to fit in... Everything happens in Say ""I Love You"".Fact is, in the middle of the story stands the relationship between Mei and Yamato and their steady disagreements about how hard it is to confess to someone and say I love you.  But Sukitte Ii na yo also tells stories about other characters from the show. My favorite side-story was about Kitagawa Megumi. She is an always-cheerful and happy model that only lives for looks and the way others see her. She goes trough a thug time and undergoes a great character development. Her story delivers the message ""Be your-self and don\'t let others control you"". And even tough she is a ""witch"" and manipulator, she is also very strong and brave. I was so glad that she actually became a better person in the end.One thing is for sure about Say ""I Love You""-drama, drama, drama. It is also hilarious, especially in the Mei-Yamato moments. The plot is really good. There are no plot holes, the story is smooth and the only bad thing about it...There is no second season. There is an OVA and one special but...that\'s not it.CharactersAaaand again, an anime with awesome characters. Sukitte ii na yo is an anime with so many interesting, unique and amazing characters and personalities. There are also so many character developments, which is actually a part of the life of a teenager. Growing up and realizing who you really are.Of course the major character development happened to our protagonist Mei Tachibana. An introverted, creepy loner turned into a rather popular, cute and friendly girl. She became someone that gives advice to others even tough she has no idea about friendship and relationships. She is also a strong and funny character.I really thought that I\'d hate him, but I didn\'t. I hate overly perfect characters, and even tough Yamato looks like one, he is not. He is popular, good-looking, supportive, nice etc, but also has his own flaws. He was afraid not to fit in and be lonely so he gave up on his best friend. Later on he realizes what he had done and truly regrets it.Animation and StyleThe animation of this anime is great. No flaws at all. Yet, I personally liked the style the most. The characters really looked different and I loved them. The colors are bright, you can enjoy beautiful settings and if you don\'t like the story that much, you can at least enjoy the good animation.ConclusionTo conclude, Sukitte Ii na yo or Say ""I Love You"" is a romance, drama and slice-of-life anime you should watch after an extremely hard week. Watch it all at once. You won\'t get boring and in no time you\'ll be saying ""I Love This Anime"". follows our main character Mei Tachibana trough her high school life.

The last episode was not needed. The voice actors were fine, the art was fine, but everything from the story to the enjoyment was not good at all. Basically two people fall in love at the start and have basically two drama's that stretch throughout the whole series, it is boring, and there is no ending, the ending physically is just not an ending. I hated this anime. I hated it a lot. "", ""I'm going to keep this review short.While I was watching this, it maintained a 'meh' atmosphere for me. The characters weren't really realistic and neither were their developments. But the biggest, biggest problem I have with this anime?I keep getting it confused with My Little Monster.I literally can't tell them apart. I honestly believe Mei and Shizuku are the same people. And I get Haru and Yamato mixed up all the time.Once I was trying to explain to my friend what Say I Love You was about, and I found myself getting really confused as I described Haru and Mei and...a mixture between the two storylines.Is it just me? Or do other people get confused too. a mixture between the two storylines.Is it just me? Or do other people get confused too."", ""I am a big fan of shoujo and romance in general, but I have to say.....I really did not enjoy this. I've never had such a strong urge to drop a series, but I kept watching with hope that it would get better...I would suggest this to someone starving for more shoujo but if you are a big fan of character development and/or story.. I'd point you in another direction (Akatsuki no Yona or Kimi ni Todoke).Sukitte seemed like a constant foodfight... Spaghetti everywhere. "", 'So I thought of writing the story line of Sukitte Li na yo..Well the anime is about a girl named Mei who always feels lonely but cute and a nice girl. An honest girl who is caring, loyal, and willing to help others when the time calls for it. But time isn\'t always on her side especially during a day when she bumps heads to heads with the most popular student at school.Here\'s where the drama kicks in and his name is Yamato Kurosawa.Yamato is one of the most popular guys at school and his name may even suggest a male version of Yamato Nadeshiko...(no pun intended). He meets Mei in a very unusual way at school and later on so helps her with a problem involving a stalker. Yikes! Now, from there on and out, the two forms a bond.Now, the duo seems to very incompatible at first glance. And I honestly think the duo are quite compatible that balances out each other. We know that Mei is a plain and nice looking girl yet very honest with herself and with others. Yamato often goes out helping his classmates as well by putting others above himself. We can see that he dislikes people who just likes him for his appearance. When Yamato realizes that Mei likes him beyond just his physical appearance, the two becomes quite compatible. Although loathed by some of the other students at school, they are a good match.The artwork of the series is quite realistic and portrays the backgrounds with the school life setting.Similarly, the soundtrack of the series is lighthearted. Although not too well known, Yuuji Nomi engineers the series\' music with his skills to create a sense of being there. It\'s nothing too special because it mostly is lighthearted and hardly noticeable at times. However, it is a sweet melody that depicts the settings and the characters especially the opening song. ""Friendship ~ for Sukitte Ii na yo"" by Ritsuko Okazaki is a very lighthearted song that gives off that melody of sweetness which depicts the duo\'s sweet relationship.All in all, Sukitte Ii na yo is a pleasant series to watch. The relationship between Mei and Yamato is quite warming and realistic to what some of us may have experienced during our teen years. It\'s heartwarming, sweet, and at the same time has drama to it especially involving the other characters. It is also a shoujo that fits within its boundaries without going over heels or trying too hard. Ultimately, it\'s a rare little gem that deserves praise for its beauty.Like I mentioned before, the series is a classic for those into the shoujo medium. It is like a breath of fresh air to watch especially with the lighthearted backgrounds presented. For those into some school drama involving the typical high school life, it\'s like a journey all over again.It is just like you\'re an individual who has a troubled past. You have been ostracized by various circumstances and nowadays, you don\'t give a damn what anyone thinks about you or your life. That is till you meet one of the Good and Nice looking student at school who takes an interest in you. Your heart pounds and for the first time in your life, you give a damn about your life and those around you especially regarding that student. That is where Sukitte Ii na yo shines. It\'s a discovery and it\'s a classic.It looks like I\'ve written a lot..Hehe..!!! yep it took a while but it is all I think about it. :) (no pun intended).

To say it somehow is more realistic. The anime does not focus much on how the main characters get to know each other, it's based on their actual relationship as a couple. This allows the serie to talk about some subjects that will make you feel identified with the characters, and remember some moments you might have been...trough with your romance partners.The story itself doesn't follow a guideline with some conclusive final, it's more based on the characters daily life experiences and their own development. For that reason this anime is risky because this may cause the story to be boring somehow, but this is not the case. The anime goes by fast, and it's very dynamic, they use the appereance of new characters and also some details introduced at some point in the series to get you hooked.Art:The animation is good, accurate details, nice landscapes, but nothing special. The anime itself is simple to make compared to others such as Shingeki No Kyojin, for that reason I'll give it an 8/10.Sound:Opening and ending are great. OST is good, it suits the kind of story, and it's appropiate I'd say. Then again, it's not anything special, it won't make you wake up from your sit or anything.Character:The characters are well-rounded, every single one has his own single personality, and they also have some development. Having in mind the lenght of the series I think the development is actually great. I also liked how they presented the background of every single character that's significant for the story development.Overall/EnjoymentMy rating is based on my own personal enjoyment, and for that I'll give a 9/10. I would suggest this anime to any Shoujo lovers, or to someone who just wants to watch a short/chillout anime. trough with your romance partners.The story itself doesn't follow a guideline with some conclusive final, it's more based on the characters daily life experiences and their own development.

The relationship is established early on, so there’s none of this bs of “will they, or won’t they” and confessions being interrupted.Mei and Yamato are also affectionate with each other as opposed to a typical shoujo universe where holding hands is a huge deal and induces extreme nervousness. The characters are actually sexual active, which makes sense considering they’re young, good-looking, and full of hormones.The conflicts are resolved rather quickly; misunderstandings aren’t exhaustively drawn out and the antagonists don’t overstay their welcome. It is gratifying to see Mei...gradually come out of her shell and learn to trust people again. gradually come out of her shell and learn to trust people again.', ""Sukitte Ii na yo is a cute anime to watch when you need a quick shoujo fix.

Yamato Kurosawa comes into her life and shows her that all people aren't the same, and he tries to gain her trust. Their first interactions are sweet, and it will probably make you swoon over the lengths that Yamato goes to show that he cares for Mei.There are several times throughout the anime...where I found myself lost. I feel like certain plot lines were opened up and then quickly closed. This caused confusion and after wondering for awhile why something had happened I just had to let it go.The growth of their relationship was rather slow, but I appreciated how Yamato was willing to be a gentleman towards Mei and not rush her into anything that she did not wish to do. Because of this I hope there will be a second season because right now their relationship is not to the point I expected it to be.While the plot is rather slow and somewhat confusing at times, I still found myself rushing back after classes to continue watching them grow.

It is hard for me to believe that anyone could go through childhood and never experience the kinds of events and emotions that make up this series.The main point of writing this review was to provide a counterpoint to some reviews you might read about this show. The main gripe seems to be that the plot/characters...are too boring or basic. On the contrary, I would say that the character interaction and plot is actually quite complicated and intricate. Unlike most romance series, this show doesn\'t hit you over the head with its message and spoon feed you everything through narration or dialogue. The author relies on the experiences of the audience to inform their understanding of the plot. When you take that into consideration, the series\' complexity is deeper than most.The art and sound are competent, but not particularly special. I do like that it doesn\'t sexualize the female characters or shove fan service in your face at every turn (I will always mark up art design that doesn\'t do these two things). The series\' art seems to go downhill as the episodes move on, which makes it seem like they started to run out of money or time and had to do the later episodes without quite as much polish to make up for it. I would give the beginning an 8 and the rest a 6, so I give it  a 7 overall for art. The music and voice acting is competent and you won\'t notice any of the common issues with bad anime.Overall the series is a very good. If you like romance plots, this is a must watch.

"", ""if you're looking for an okay love story, with a hot main character that goes through day life problems, then watch this.the story isn't that unique, its about a hot guy who falls in love with a girl thats different from most of the girls around him, and all girls get jealous from her. its not so interesting, yet worth a shot.the character adaptation is what kept the anime a live, all the characters are live and you feel what they feel.the art, was good as well.overall: an ordinary love story, but worth a shot. 7/10 "", ""Hi! Robert's Too Late Reviews back again! The question today is do I want to say I love you to the dubbed version of Sukitte Ii na yo? The short and dirty of it is yes, yes I do. It's nowhere near as formulaic as the premise may sound, and actually pulls off a very wonderful love story. It is not, however, without its problems, which we will address shortly. But for the time invested, it is worth the ride. Will the RTLR wall of romantic sweetness get a new entry? Let's throw down this hoedown.Story: 8I know what some of you might be thinking....Here we go with a 'Cant Hardly Wait' style setup or one from a number of teen movies where the popular guy remakes the plain jane girl into a stunner, but that does not happen here, not in that sense. The main character, Mei, is awkward, introverted, and very distrustful of everyone, yet the popular guy that falls for her helps her open up her life, come to terms with the pain of her past, and grow as a person. There is no shallowness in the setup like I was very worried there could be. Another fear to be assuaged I think is that the popular guy really does love Mei, and remains in love with her throughout the series. No 'hit it and quit it' type mentality. There are even a few times when two of the guys talk to each other that features actual emotions and are not full of toxic masculinity, which in my mind is a huge relief and a joy to see. We have enough caveman chest thumpers, time for men to get real about how we feel and realize that's not 'gay' or 'girly' to have emotions.Of course, this being set in high school, there's more than enough jealousy and elitism to go around when the hot guy from class starts making over the mousy, plain girl. The couple are beset by jealous girls, subjected to schemes and rumors, and have just about everything a nasty set of teenagers can throw at them to break them up. Mei also has to come to terms with the guy's popularity, the fact he's gone out with, and kissed a large number of girls. He has even been sexually active. This is hard for Mei to process, and one of the hurdles the story leads us through that moves this from another trope-ish show to something with a bit more weight.Another positive point is there are redemptive arcs to be found all around. There are other characters that grow, change, and become better people for what they go through. We see old enemies become friends, we see non-primary characters break down, and we have all of this framed around the primary relationship, so it never seems to stray, story wise, but offers more than a singular focus on just two people. This gives the series a more dynamic feel, and explains the various characters' motivations far more clearly than other romance anime.However, even with this praise, there are flaws. This is a romance anime for sure, so you should be aware of that, and know what you're signing up for. There's going to be girls that try to come between the couple, there's going to be guys that do the same. There's going to be drama over miscommunications, there's going to be self doubt and worry. And let's be honest, this isn't really a spoiler but love triumphs in the end, which in itself is totally predictable.There is a lot more angst in this series than most others I've seen, save for maybe Kids on the Slope. Many times Mei is at odds with her feelings, thinking she should give in and break up with the guy, or that he can't really love her, or that loving him and getting close to his circle of friends is just a way to be let down. She really is addled with self doubt, and while she grows and moves forward, the series does not put her past these feelings. Even in the last episode she is neurotic and freaking out over trust issues. To me, this makes the anime a little different than most, but not always in a good way. The guy repeatedly makes gestures of true feelings for Mei, and she constantly doubts him and herself, and it can get old at times. Not so much to break my enjoyment, but enough there are moments when you just wanna kick her in the ass because her guy is clearly into her in a huge way.But those problems, faced with the lover boy's intense support makes it all come together and worthwhile. He may be the pretty boy in school, he may have kissed nearly every cute girl, but he's not a player anymore, and devotes himself purely to winning Mei's heart. He's a former playboy that basically sees Mei, and gets his shit together because he's smitten at first sight (which involves some physical violence, strangely enough).Art: 8I loved the way the series looked. I must admit that it is hard, I think, for most anime to draw 'plain' characters, especially females. Mei, and all the bitchy girls in school, are continually saying that she's not good enough for the lover boy, that she's too plain, not cute enough, etc. Yet her appearance is adorable, with wonderful eyes and a great art style. The various cast members change clothes for different events, and they are all distinct enough to be identifiable. Since this is a romance drama, there's not a lot of hardcore animation to be done like a battle anime, so I didn't notice any rough spots.Sound: 7This didn't make an eight because of Mei. As I said, she does moping, moody teen very well, but there are times she sounds almost bored with the role. When it comes time for the more romantic and positive things to be said, she just doesn't pull it off as well as she does the pessimistic. The lover boy's voice is well done, and the nerdy guy friend is perfect sounding. The other girls all sound good, no squeaky ten year olds to be heard anywhere.The background music caught my ear, swelling up in emotional scenes and moving to dark and brooding as Mei despairs over different issues. It was well done, and I think the experience was better for it. And that's what the background tracks are supposed to do right?The opening theme is fitting, and very pretty, but the ending theme is just a horrible match to the show's style. It's a little more upbeat, more 'intense' which is at odds with the major cliffhangers the show tends to end on. I was hoping for a sweeping ballad or something similar, and get this kind of upbeat music instead. Not what I was expecting, and something I quickly began to skip when it started.Character: 8As I have said, Mei carries such mistrust and isolates herself so much that it's painful to watch her at the beginning. She slowly opens herself to the idea of friends, and is better for it, but it's a long hard road for her. Honestly I identify with Mei on many counts. I'm very much an introvert in real life, and I too once dated a girl that was considered by everyone around us as 'out of my league'. That girl chose me, and gave her all for the duration of the relationship, and no one, not even I, could figure out why. But the heart wants what it wants. I have few friends in the real world (though many here thankfully!) and I fear opening up to people because of betrayal and the fact some people just use you and toss you aside. So Mei's apprehension makes sense to me. Might be a point lost on you more confident viewers, but perhaps lover boy might be a character you can feel an affinity for.The lover boy is honest, and really gives his all to Mei, regardless of what others think of his choice. He doesn't care if she's not in his 'social circle' or that she's the class oddball or what have you. He's a stand up guy, he doesn't use her, and he doesn't take advantage of her. Unlike we see in real life and even sometimes in anime, he does not pressure her into anything, though their first kiss was somewhat out of the blue. He realizes Mei is the girl he wants to be with and puts his days of being a player behind him all for her. He's almost too good to be true.There is another notable cast member, a girl that tries desperately to break up Mei and lover boy. She is a model, and at first a super bitch. She even gets lover boy to do modelling shoots with her, trying to lure him away, but his devotion never wavers. She's particularly interesting because after spending most of the series being such a mega bitch, she has her own redemptive arc and comes to understand herself and realize her own flaws. She grows from this and becomes another soul saved by the light.The supporting cast of friends are all fun, the nerdy guy falling in love with the silly girl and them dating, the other guy and gal jabbing at each other. They come to truly care for Mei as well, being true friends to her, something she's not used to having in her life. They are interesting enough not to be boring, and bring an important element in Mei's growth to light.Enjoyment: 8I did truly enjoy this anime. It's just different enough from the other romance dramas I've seen to hold my interest. And when you add in a character that I can relate to so well is just a huge bonus. Mei learns to have confidence, and all us introverts and loners should too. Life isn't all about abuse, and there are those out there that truly care for you, even if you don't know it. Not everyone is an asshole. Promise. And the ending, the last line of the show was just perfect. I can't think of any better way to wrap it up than the method they use. And if you've read any of my other reviews, you know me finding endings I like is fairly uncommon.Best Girl: Megumi. Mainly because of her transformation arc from super bitch to real person. If she had stayed evil, I wouldn't have picked her, and when she was in her 'celebrity mode' I couldn't stand her. But when she came to see who she really is and what she really needed to do, she won me over.So there you have it. I gladly say I love you to this anime because it was a wonderful ride with characters that weren't just horndogs or vapid airheads. It's almost like an anti-School Days in a way. Its nice to see characters that have morals and values and stick to them. Wish there were more people in the real world with such guts. As for the RTLR wall, Mei and lover boy Yamato bump off a superhero and gain a spot. Give this one a chance, you might just fall in love too.

The little sister Nagi is easily the most interesting part of this.I found their relationship on the first two episodes to be downright predatory, specially coming from Yamato.

I watched it all, and it got better, but Yamato seemed to me like he was beyond saving as a character.

When I watched the first episode of this anime, I just started watching romace anime, and for me, I had lots of shows on my list. The First episode didn\'t catch on to my childish taste in romace, so I left it there, and forgot about it.Last Night, while browsing YouTube aimlessly, I came a cross a...top 10 YouTube video. With nothing but ""Trash Harem"" on my plate, I clicked on the video. Althoght this anime wasn\'t rated that high on the list, I found myself wanting to give it a second chance. So here I am (7 am), after a allnighter finishing this show episode after episode.First, lets talk abut the setting. There really isn\'t anything new here as far was the Shoujo and school romace genres go. An anti social girl and the hotest, most liked boy in the school, An idea that has been done countless amounts of times. But to me, a overused setting/background does not mean the anime is automaticlly going to turn out bad. The most importent parts to an anime is how they handle the character devalopment and the overall story line, in my opinion.Lets talk about Characters. The charaters here are fairly well done, beside one fact, it seems to me that everyone has the worst childhoods ever. Having tragic backgrounds gives the characters\' actions more emotion and give the viewers more things to relate on. But this show does it to everyone who is some what of a main character. Overall, the characters seemed fairly realistic and likeable. Tachibana, Mei\'s Change was every well doneThe art is something that put me off at first. It\'s always hard to have something other than the main steam anime art style, but after watching every little detail, I realised how beautiful some of the animations and still piantings looked. The charater\'s faces are done at perfect timings to give the show its comdy effects here and there. The art is different, but it sure is not bad.Here is where I talk about how this show was about to move me. As someone who watches 90% romace, a special kind of romace anime has always been at the top of my list: Those that can pull of a ""relationship starting early"" well, without the same events repeating themselves over and over again. Some of my all time fav such as ""Golden Time"" ""Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii"" and ""Bakemonogatari"" all did a great job of that. This show was not that far behind. Events felt some what relatable, and uselly ended on a good note, which is aways a good thing for rommace anime. There were moments that moved my heart, actions that I was exctied about, and words that will drive me carzy between happiness and sad. The Enjoyment was definelly high up there.If you are looking for a masterpiece, you are most likely in the wrong place. But if you want a cute romace story that has a story to keepyou hooked, this  is the shoujo/Romace for you.(Oh yeah, why does this show make it seem like Highshcools in Japan are just full of kids being bullied, fake friends and having sex with any hot guy and girl you can find?

How it doesn’t have more attention given to or, or given a second season is really beyond me because this romance story was really wonderful! I feel that this is an anime that allot of teenagers can relate to on a personal level, not just because of the romance but also the messages it sends to people.Story (10/10)To me the story was absolutely wonderful. It was the best part of the story. It’s a story about a girl named Mei Tachibana, a girl who has lost the...ability to trust others due to an incident that happened when he was younger, and because of that incident she has lived a majority of her life lacking the desire to make new friends, but all of that changed when she met Yamato Kurosawa, the most popular, handsome guy in the school. Yamato was able to open Mei’s eyes to the possibility of having a social life, not per say to become popular but to be comfortable with the idea of being around other people, and trusting other people little by little, and not everyone is gonna stab you in the back. Yamato has taught Mei and the audience that there are people out there who would want to hang out with you because they genuinely want to get to know you, and even Mei has passed on those lessons towards people facing similar struggles to hers.The story teaches us that no matter the social status, the amounts of money we have in our bank accounts, no matter how happy we are with ourselves now, that doesn’t mean that person hasn’t went through hardship, and that everyone has their own scars that they’re hiding. Everyone has been through trials and tribulations to get to where they are in life now. Everyone has their own story, and I love that message.Talking about the romance between Mei and Yamato now, I love how they started their relationship within episode 3, and not wait till the near end of the season to do so, that’s actually my favorite type of romance show where they two soul mates get together early in the series, because truth be told, a couple’s story doesn’t end at them becoming a couple, if anything that’s only just the beginning, so it’s nice to see them get into a relationship early on in the series. Watching how their relationship grew step by step, no matter if the step is a small one or a big leap, it was wonderful to watch them grow as people and as a couple.Art (9/10)The animation was wonderful. It was smooth, it was clean. The characters all looks great, the designs of the characters and the backgrounds too. I REALLY love Yamato’s design, especially his hair. It made him look so cool, and I also loved Kai’s design too, he looked like that rough and tough bad boy with the Mohawk and I absolutely gravitated towards that design too. Overall the animation and the art style were all amazing!Sound (9/10)I really enjoyed the intro music. It was calming and soothing to the ears, and it actually suited the style to the anime. It’s not some overly hyper theme song, it’s a ballad song, and I thought it suited the style of this show, and as well as the ED it’s was great too. It was slow, and pleasant to the ears. I also enjoyed the sound track of this show, the background music was really good.Characters (10/10)Usually when I do a review, I only talk about the main characters, the characters the story focuses on. While we will discuss Mei, and Yamato in full detail, I also wanna talk about some of the supporting cast too, generally the ones that had more of a presence on the series. So characters like Daichi Kurosawa, or Masashi Tachikawa won’t get their own segments since they didn’t do much on the show… So let’s get this started.Mei Tachibana. I relate to Mei on a personal level, I am someone who has allot of trust issues, and it also stems from how I was treated as a child moving forward to my teen years by people outside from my family. I’m also Shy, and awkward around people, it’s hard for me to open up to people or really tell people, including my family how I feel, and what I am going through because I fear that they won’t understand my struggles… I have few people in my life where I can truly open up, and tell them what’s going on with me, and it honestly does suck because that sense of loneliness does fester inside of me allot! Getting personal here, I’ve always been out casted by people, and usually that token friend, the disposable friend, someone who can easily be discarded by people when they get board of you, and to be honest that really fucked me up mentally, and gave me this really conflicted view on the world. So when Mei in the first episode said that she doesn’t need friends, and she’d be better off alone, I honestly felt that because to this day I still have that mindset of wanting to be alone, and rather have the idea that everyone is untrustworthy. Admittedly, I do agree my trust issues is a problem, and little by little I am trying to fix that and open up to people. So Mei is a character I truly can relate to, and because of that I sympathize with her, and I gravitate to her character more, because I see allot of myself in Mei and her character. So I think the way the show handled her struggles was really good!Yamato Kurosawa. Other than the fact that I love his design, his hair and his overall look, Yamato is a really lovely character. He is exactly the type of boyfriend Mei deserves. Someone who can open her eyes to the many possibilities. One of those possibilities is her making friends and teaching her that there are people out there who won’t throw you away or stab you in the back. He’s the type of boyfriend who wants to open up Mei’s world, and that is exactly what Mei needed, he couldn’t have been a more perfect match for Mei. Despite him being the right match for him, he isn’t a perfect human being, like I said when we tackled the story, everyone has their own scars, things they’ve done in the past they are not proud of, facing trials and tribulations. Yamato is an example of no matter the social status, or how much he is beloved by everyone, he has his own scars, and his demons. Yamato is the type of person who puts other people’s happiness over his own, a trait like that is both a blessing and a curse to have. I love Yamato’s character, and how they handled his character and how they displayed that he is flawed like everyone else!Now let’s tackle some of the supporting characters that made an impact on the series…Aiko Mutou. I actually liked Aiko for the most part, I was a bit indifferent with her in the beginning but she was a character that grew on me as the series progressed, I starting warming up to her when she got more involved in Mei, and Yamato’s relationship and helping them with their struggles. She is that type of girl who takes no bullshit from anyone, and says it how it really is, and I appreciate that about her. Like our two leads, and allot of the supporting cast we talk about, she has her past scars, physically and mentally. She uses her experiences to help Mei in her relationship and for that I really grew to like having her around.Asami Oikawa. I like her, she is that character you instantaneously like because of how kind and cheerful she is. Her personal struggles lies with her breasts. It’s usually girls making remarks, calling them “Melons” when we all know that those girls are just jealous of them so instead they make fun of her for them, and the guys also make fun of her boobs to hide the fact that they are secretly turned on and wanna be in bed with her. It’s a stupid thing to make fun of someone for, but it’s something that would upset her, and make her feel insecure. Her relationship with Takeshi is really cute.Megumi Kitagawa. Like Aiko, I didn’t dislike her, interestingly enough I was interested in her character, like we all knew that she had some baggage on her, it’s just that we didn’t know what it was. Her struggles lies on other people’s superficial opinions on her, it’s a struggle I do face myself, I used to care about the opinions of others, despite it really being completely useless to me. I actually did sympathize with her towards the end because you can tell all she wanted was to be accepted…Kai Takemura. Say HELLO to the new addition to my anime crushes! Anyways, I love his character! The moment he was introduced I really liked him, we heard about him previous from Yamato himself, he was his best friend who was constantly tortured and bullied, so badly that he transferred schools. So he came back stronger than ever, and was ready to fight the bullies that tormented him in his middle schooling days, but he quickly realized, that in doing that it won’t accomplish anything, and by the end of it, Kai will get nothing to gain from doing such things. He turns into more of a voice of reason character, especially towards Mei, and Megumi. Also I see a relationship blossoming between him and Megumi, and I am all for it!!Nagisa Kurosawa. Nagi, though she was indeed a brat, she was an adorable one at that. I relate to her struggles of not wanting to go to school, but our reasoning’s for it are completely different, I know how it feels to completely lose trust and faith in other people. I really like the relationship she has with her brother, and with Mei. It’s really nice watching them together and getting along, they’re like one big happy family!!Enjoyment (9/10)I absolutely enjoyed this completely. There were so many moments where I stopped and just related to the situations that Mei and everyone else were going through, mentally speaking. Anyone who has been through life struggles, lost trust in anyone, has scars that they hide, who have been through any kind of hardship, I feel can relate to this anime, and can enjoy this anime for what it is.Overall (9/10)My biggest complaint with this show is that there isn’t a season 2. What the hell is up with that?! Also that the score for this should have been higher!! I absolutely recommend that you guys watch this because it really is such a gem of an anime.Story (10/10)Art (9/10)Sound (9/10)Characters (10/10)Enjoyment (9/10)Overall Score (9/10) ability to trust others due to an incident that happened when he was younger, and because of that incident she has lived a majority of her life lacking the desire to make new friends, but all of that changed when she met Yamato Kurosawa, the most popular, handsome guy in the school. Yamato was able to open Mei’s eyes to the possibility of having a social life, not per say to become popular but to be comfortable with the idea of being around other people, and trusting other people little by little, and not everyone is gonna stab you in the back. Yamato has taught Mei and the audience that there are people out there who would want to hang out with you because they genuinely want to get to know you, and even Mei has passed on those lessons towards people facing similar struggles to hers.The story teaches us that no matter the social status, the amounts of money we have in our bank accounts, no matter how happy we are with ourselves now, that doesn’t mean that person hasn’t went through hardship, and that everyone has their own scars that they’re hiding. Everyone has been through trials and tribulations to get to where they are in life now. Everyone has their own story, and I love that message.Talking about the romance between Mei and Yamato now, I love how they started their relationship within episode 3, and not wait till the near end of the season to do so, that’s actually my favorite type of romance show where they two soul mates get together early in the series, because truth be told, a couple’s story doesn’t end at them becoming a couple, if anything that’s only just the beginning, so it’s nice to see them get into a relationship early on in the series. Watching how their relationship grew step by step, no matter if the step is a small one or a big leap, it was wonderful to watch them grow as people and as a couple.Art (9/10)The animation was wonderful. It was smooth, it was clean. The characters all looks great, the designs of the characters and the backgrounds too. I REALLY love Yamato’s design, especially his hair. It made him look so cool, and I also loved Kai’s design too, he looked like that rough and tough bad boy with the Mohawk and I absolutely gravitated towards that design too. Overall the animation and the art style were all amazing!Sound (9/10)I really enjoyed the intro music. It was calming and soothing to the ears, and it actually suited the style to the anime. It’s not some overly hyper theme song, it’s a ballad song, and I thought it suited the style of this show, and as well as the ED it’s was great too. It was slow, and pleasant to the ears. I also enjoyed the sound track of this show, the background music was really good.Characters (10/10)Usually when I do a review, I only talk about the main characters, the characters the story focuses on. While we will discuss Mei, and Yamato in full detail, I also wanna talk about some of the supporting cast too, generally the ones that had more of a presence on the series. So characters like Daichi Kurosawa, or Masashi Tachikawa won’t get their own segments since they didn’t do much on the show… So let’s get this started.Mei Tachibana. I relate to Mei on a personal level, I am someone who has allot of trust issues, and it also stems from how I was treated as a child moving forward to my teen years by people outside from my family. I’m also Shy, and awkward around people, it’s hard for me to open up to people or really tell people, including my family how I feel, and what I am going through because I fear that they won’t understand my struggles… I have few people in my life where I can truly open up, and tell them what’s going on with me, and it honestly does suck because that sense of loneliness does fester inside of me allot! Getting personal here, I’ve always been out casted by people, and usually that token friend, the disposable friend, someone who can easily be discarded by people when they get board of you, and to be honest that really fucked me up mentally, and gave me this really conflicted view on the world. So when Mei in the first episode said that she doesn’t need friends, and she’d be better off alone, I honestly felt that because to this day I still have that mindset of wanting to be alone, and rather have the idea that everyone is untrustworthy. Admittedly, I do agree my trust issues is a problem, and little by little I am trying to fix that and open up to people. So Mei is a character I truly can relate to, and because of that I sympathize with her, and I gravitate to her character more, because I see allot of myself in Mei and her character. So I think the way the show handled her struggles was really good!Yamato Kurosawa. Other than the fact that I love his design, his hair and his overall look, Yamato is a really lovely character. He is exactly the type of boyfriend Mei deserves. Someone who can open her eyes to the many possibilities. One of those possibilities is her making friends and teaching her that there are people out there who won’t throw you away or stab you in the back. He’s the type of boyfriend who wants to open up Mei’s world, and that is exactly what Mei needed, he couldn’t have been a more perfect match for Mei. Despite him being the right match for him, he isn’t a perfect human being, like I said when we tackled the story, everyone has their own scars, things they’ve done in the past they are not proud of, facing trials and tribulations. Yamato is an example of no matter the social status, or how much he is beloved by everyone, he has his own scars, and his demons. Yamato is the type of person who puts other people’s happiness over his own, a trait like that is both a blessing and a curse to have. I love Yamato’s character, and how they handled his character and how they displayed that he is flawed like everyone else!Now let’s tackle some of the supporting characters that made an impact on the series…Aiko Mutou.

Well whatever.. I really liked how the character's faces were designed especially Mei's face.The rest of the art was good too, nice backgrounds, but well, nothing out of the ordinary so 7/10.Sound 6.5/10I thought the opening was quite good considering the kind of anime it was, but it was far from being great either. The ending was just okay. Overall OSTs in this manga are not extraordinary except for one near the end, I can't get you the name, but the situation it was used in and the OST itself is just an exceptional combination! That moment really was great thanks to the OST.Character 7/10Well character development is okay. I really liked how some characters were develloped such as Mei and Kai mostly, these 2 characters are the most lovable characters in this anime and each has a story which can really touch people's heart depending on your background.Megumi was a quite well develloped character too, but it seems like the watcher wil not necessarily like her so it's hard to put ourselves in her place.Otherwise, aiko was quite a great character.My true problem with the anime characters lies with Yamato.. Handsome and loves Mei.. What else is there to say about him?? Not much I guess.Enjoyment 8/10This show was really enjoyable :D I would recommend to any person who likes slice of life/romance animes.

It very much hit the romance spot left after finishing MY Love Story.The characters were the standout here. I tried describing the side characters after the first few episodes and had to sum it up as they feel like real people. It's not a matter of do you like a character or not [though I ended up with strong feelings in both directions about them all] but just how real they feel.The romances - that's right romances not romance - are fantastic. The main one betwen Yamato and Mei is of course the most complex but it follows the route of a...first romance between two people who might not be adjusted enough for it beautifully. The side romances feel like more than just a foil or plot device too. They have their own arcs that could probably fill an anime by themselves but take a back-seat to Yamato and Mei in this one.I found the intro/outro quite slow but the sound throughout the epsiodes was lovely. It fit the situation and was noticeable without being intrusive.As a bit of an extra, the anime I'd watched before this had left me very upset about the treatment of cats. Mei gets me. Mei and Yamato and cats were just everything in this anime.I might have nostalgia goggles on but this still didn't quite meet My Little Monster & Black Prince and the Wolf Girl, for me. That being said, I fully recommend watching it and can see myself watching it again. first romance between two people who might not be adjusted enough for it beautifully.

It is predictable, but I\'m okay with that when it comes to romance anime. However, the biggest issue I have with this show is the time it wastes on other characters and stories. With only 13 episodes, the cute romantic moments I wanted were infrequent. When good moments did occur, they were short and unsatisfying.The branching stories are edgy for no reason. This show wants to be dark and fails at it. The sad moments should amplify the happy moments- so why were the ""happy moments""...so unimpressive?Each episode feels painfully long and yet covers so little ground.There is not enough focus on the main couple. The bad times are too long, and the good times are too short.The characters are very flat and generic. One makes a heel-face turn with seemingly no reason.

The main girl is woefully uneventful and friendless with a sexy, good-natured to a fault main boy. Both, beyond the few moments of blissful emotional momentum, rarely communicate honestly and thus create their own relationship problems. The friends are a beauty and an honest punk who both snicker watching the couple blush at the implication of existing in the same timeline as the other. I admit the main man has a better sense of what he wants than most interests in these types of shows,...seeing as he makes his move (pretty non consentually) early on.I feel everything done by this show was inferior to Fruits Basket. The side characters had far more to them, and the plot didn't rely on the main relationship. There's a lot of the issues they share, but Fruits felt like it went further with its plot and characters. I can also compare it to Kimi no Todoke, seeing as the 3 shows are intensely similar, besides the amounts of episodes.I called this show junk food because in your heart you know exactly what you're going to experience, which can be comforting. If you watched one slice of life anime romance, then you've seen them all. Do you honestly believe they're gonna go nuclear with their Mary Sue? This is anime. You don't put a blanket on for new outcomes, you do it because its cozy.

Because while watching, I felt not only attracted to Yamato, but to Mei too. With her, I felt as if I was watching myself on the screen (excluding the romance). She was just really relatable to me so I found the storyline really enjoyable (same for the manga).The art style wasn't as good as the manga (unique). It reminded me of a couple of different animation I watched prior (been a while). So I did like the art just it didn't blow my mind.Each character had their...own backstory entered in the anime and that made me happy, you know? Like if someone treated you like crap or bullied you, you'd want their backstory, right? You're curious about what happens in their life? But we never get these answers. In this anime though, each character opens up about their past and how it made them who they are.

While the main female heroine had some character and spine at the beginning, the series regressed to a typical pattern where shy and unsecure girl is in love and gets together with the hottest boy in school and other hot boys and girls are thrown into their way as obstacles to their relationship.It has its sweet moments, however, the teenage melodrama gets a bit irritating at times, which in turn makes it quite unattractive to mature audience. The main heroine is quite cute, but the secondary characters introduced in the story tend...to be either blunt or annoying with more screentime than they actually deserve. All in all, this series suffers mostly from overused cliches and formulistic moments, as well as weak and irritating secondary characters. Romance fans won't miss anything of value if they skip that series. to be either blunt or annoying with more screentime than they actually deserve.

Now I am currently reading the manga and decided to watch the anime and I've got to say, I personally like the manga better.

Until she meets Yamato...Kurosawa whom she accidentally injures and he ends up falling in love with her and they start to date.

Every episode, even if it was only for one, it would talk about one of the characters past and how they got bullied, like Mei.Characters: I liked most of the characters like Mei. She was hilarious at times and other times she made me supper depressed but because of her making new friends, her true self, the funny and shy type started to surface. Another one of the best characters and my favorite at that was Aiko. Her past just really hit me and just her character in general. She stands up to anyone that pisses her off and that's what I loved about her. I did not like Yamato one bit. Sure he did help Mei out of her lonely bubble but he was just such a prick. He would keep thinking that Mei was cheating on him and he didn't stand up for Kai when he was being bullied. He was just such a crappy character, not a crappy written one but the character himself, his personality and everything was horrible. Now the last character I'm gonna talk about his Megu. I did not like her but when her past was revealed and it was a lot like Mei's was what got to me. She was a bitch to Mei and almost a lot of other people but she sorta made up for it but I still don't really like her. Though her hair is gorgeous, oh my god.Animation: It wasn't anything amazing, in my opinion but for the opening I think it really stood out. At the beginning where Mei holds out her hands was probably the best part of it all but I will say that not one single moment did the animation look terrible.Music: The voice actress who voices Megu, Minako Kotobuki did an amazing job with the room scene between her and Momo. The way she portrayed the character in that scene and any other scene was amazing. I also give praise for Ai Kayano who played Mei, Risa Taneda who played Asami and of course, Yumi Uchiyama who voiced Aiko. The opening was beautiful, most likely because it was performed by the late Ritsuko Okazaki who I adore, even though she is gone, she is by far one of my favourite Japanese singers.Overall I enjoyed myself watching this anime, for I got really into it especially the last four episodes where I couldn't stop screaming at the laptop, hoping my anger will smash into Yamato and Megu somehow.I most definitely recommend this anime if you happen to like romance and shitty characters (Yamato) and characters that have a depressing past but still want to punched them out (Megu.)I give Say I Love you a 7/10 and a 3.2 out of 5 stars.

However I didn\'t like the lead couple.The male character is a little too ""alpha"": too self-confident, too perfect, too tall, and too possessive. One gets the unpleasant feeling, as the shows progresses that he *could* become an abusive boyfriend/husband. The female character falls for him too easily, and then she becomes way too submissive. Overall, too often it looked like he treated her like she was his pet, to put it bluntly.So that\'s it. I simply didn\'t like the personalities of the main characters, but that doesn\'t mean they are bad.

The story was beautiful and sweet with some subtle drama for some moments. It went deeper than many similar anime by putting in topics like trying to lose weight and change your look to appeal to someone. The art and character design were perfect for the story. Though the soundtrack was not anything too memorable. For the characters, I immediately fell for...Yamato even though it is quite a cliché archetype for the guy to be perfect in every way however his dark backstory was very tearjerking and made a lot of sense for his character.

First, it regularly brings up the forbidden three letter word in shojo romance (SEX), and although it doesn\'t show anything, it\'s clearly a big part of the story for many of the characters. It also includes many of the darker aspects of adolescence,...including struggles with body image and bullying. So for some this might make it seem like the show is more ""real"" that your usual ""I\'m so inexperienced about love I don\'t even know why this guy is trying to hold my hand"" romance (I\'m looking at you, Naho from Orange). But truthfully, it\'s completely the same:- Despite certain characters being more ""experienced"" than others, they are all, as the story tries to tell us, pure-hearted maidens who are just trying to figure out love.- People are completely oblivious to normal human interactions, though instead of it being mis-read signs of love it\'s people not realizing how absolutely cruel and heartless they are acting/speaking in the presence of others. Seriously, I\'ve never seen a show reach quite this level of cattiness that could have been resolved if just one of them had the slightest ounce of self-reflection.- The drama is almost exclusively driven by a total lack of the basic capacity to communicate as a human being. I wish I was kidding about this, but in one episode (the last!) about 5 minutes of the show is wasted watching a character run around looking for the other character because he somehow failed to see her hiding behind a telephone pole that was literally right outside of his house in an otherwise quiet residential neighborhood. And this only happened because they somehow forgot how to use their cell phones, which were ultimately the main tool that produced the initial misunderstanding that caused all the running around.- It introduces a new character at nearly every episode who\'s sole purpose is to stir up drama. They then only have a few seconds of cameo in later episodes, so you wonder why they were even introduced.At the end of the day, if you are a hard core fan of shojo, and I should add, are also a fan of the aesthetics (the characters certainly also break a bit of the typical mold in their looks, which I wasn\'t the biggest fan of), then you\'ll certainly get something from this show.

That has to be the best part of this anime and manga. It\'s telling a story, a real story. There are no action scenes to force the suspense or adrenaline, no dramatic scandal to build the anxiety. What happens in this plot line is real, it\'s something you can naturally build anticipation with without wearing yourself out trying to keep up. I have not seen anything this sweet or youthful in a while. Will be watching this one again, and again, and again, very soon.The only downside I can add about this anime is that the live action movie did not do the series justice. It was cute, and mostly true to the story, but it cut out too much of the scenes and incidents that made this anime the relatable piece it was. Not to mention did it leave a lot untold about the relationships and where they ended up. It was average, to say the least.

The story line in the anime is amazing and really touches base to what believe is society now and days. The art is simple and beautiful, it really allows you to focus in on the story and reveal the emotions the characters have without them having to say anything. The character development is nothing like I have seen before.. it was so well done you couldn't help...but fall in love with every character and root for Mei the entire time as well as rooting for her friends.

Overall, I give it a fair 6.The story is about a girl whose whole life was friendless- because of a bullying incident when she was young. She accidentally wrongfully kicks the most popular boy in school - but he starts to think she is interesting. He wants to know more about her, and...almost immediately, he starts falling for her.

It had a very nice overall message for young people, which I always appreciate.Other than that, I was just gushing over this anime the whole time I was watching it....I blushed when they blushed, I panicked when they panicked, I laughed when they laughed.

This is mainly because of the characters, especially the main character, Mei. At the beginning of the anime she's a very big outsider and didn't have many friends, if any. She was very protective and got angry very quickly. She also had very little trust in people due to past events. However when she meets Yamato and starts to trust and like him, her personality changes. I also like how they made her hair grow longer to represent her becoming more friendly.Once she meets Yamato she starts to get more friends but also uses...Yamato as an anchor. As Mei opens up she gets more popular. Personally, however, I liked her when she was more independent and badass, but she needed to rely on Yamato for the love story to progress. Mei is the perfect example of selflessness and cute bewildermen. Yamato is more confident but still has flaws due to his past.Another thing I like about the story, is Yamato's younger sister. At first she didn't accept Mei as her brother's girlfriend. But once they both found out that they had a lot in common to fo with friend issues, Mei was able to help her and there were some really, really adorable scenes.This anime has so many different characters with different personal problems and they somehow all lead back to Mei. You really connect to Mei and her emotions and at a couple of points your heart will actually break because of what happens to Yamato and Mei's relationship.The art in this anime is one of my all time favourite styles, it's so beautiful and elegant but really clean too. They character's eyes are the best bit- they almost always are. Not only that but the scenery is really pretty especially because of the way they create the sun rays. That's the most summery thing in the world.The music in it represents  the emotions Mei is feeling at the time perfectly and makes the atmosphere so much more devouring. Not only does the music connect with Mei's feelings but also the season they're currently in.Overall this is a beautiful anime amd I recommend it to anyone who like cute fluffy romanceAnime.It also has really cute cats =^_^= Yamato as an anchor.

Dieting and not feeling good enough can send someone down a dark path when you feel like your alone.

They fall in love and become a couple. Of course there are other people getting involved during this too.What made this anime very enjoyable for me, compared to other romances, was:- They become a couple very early on, like on the second episode or so, and the show itself progresses at a rather fast pace (throughout the...whole show, there\'s a whole year passing I think). So there is a lot of focus on their development as a couple, instead of development to -become- one like so many other romances out there do.- There is no crappy drama based on stupid misunderstandings where you\'d just think ""how can you be so dense?!"". Of course there are misunderstandings, and both of them are not that well when it comes to handling a relationship, but it always gets cleared up properly (and fast), which I find favorable compared to other shows who tend to throw a relationship back to square one for multiple episodes because of some stupidity.- There is no excessive rivalry built up, I find it annoying when basically the whole show focuses on the fact that there is a love rival. There is some rivalry, but it doesn\'t get dragged out exceededly.The characters are likeable, even those who start out to be hostile end up to be very nice additions.

So there is a lot of focus on their development as a couple, instead of development to -become- one like so many other romances out there do.- There is no crappy drama based on stupid misunderstandings where you\'d just think ""how can you be so dense?!"". Of course there are misunderstandings, and both of them are not that well when it comes to handling a relationship, but it always gets cleared up properly (and fast), which I find favorable compared to other shows who tend to throw a relationship back to square one for multiple episodes because of some stupidity.- There is no excessive rivalry built up, I find it annoying when basically the whole show focuses on the fact that there is a love rival. There is some rivalry, but it doesn\'t get dragged out exceededly.The characters are likeable, even those who start out to be hostile end up to be very nice additions.

While I'm sure it could be argued that Mei reacted well within an acceptable standard for a very distrusting and socially isolated person, I felt that that, coupled with Yamato's own insecurities, meant that the plot fitted itself into an almost mind-numbing loop. Throughout the series I was always holding out for those painfully infrequent glimpses of a confident Mei, who appeared in flashes but never stuck aound...long enough to be anything more than a brief moment of satisfaction.

I haven't seen a lot of romance anime so I guess this was a good start. "", 'One kick leading into a relationshipMei Tachibana voiced by Ai Kayano is a very shy, anti social stoic girl, having the belief that having friend will lead them to betraying to later on, it\' not until her chance encounter...well more like kick to Yamato Kurosawa voiced by Takahiro Sakurai where she one, develops a growing relationship with Yamato and two, open herself up to not only Yamato but everyone else as well.For this kind of premise, it\'s in similarities to Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, Kaichou wa Maid-sama and even Toradora with the dynamic of Yamato and Mei in a ways and was LA\'s early thoughts on...the primary relationship in question, where the main protagonist changes her.his ways when coming across his/her counterpart both in personality and changes the both of them for the better.For many, if not ALL romance animes, there are trials and tribulations in which the relationship goes through much like Yamato and Mei\'s comes across, many of which seems in favour of Mei more than Yamato and LA isn\'t saying this in a good way. Mei goes through ALOT in this anime, sure the character and belief change about having friend sis one of the main goals for this anime by having Mei and Yamato in being together but man, does Mei goes through LOTS of rivals in order to do so, let\'s see we have, Aiko Mutou voiced by Yumi Uchiyama, a sorta ex of Yamato, Yamato\'s own sister Nagisa voiced by Mariyse Ise and the biggest obstacle Megumi Kitagawa voiced by Minako Kotobuki, while Yamato only needs to deal with Kakeru Hayakawa voiced by Yuki Kaji who rattles Yamato being the playboy but is only a focal point in one episode and his biggest obstacle, Kai Takemura voiced by Tomoaki Maeno who gains a crush to Mei after a heart to heart.No point scoring or anything but many of Yamato and Mei\'s rivals defrost over time and become supports towards Yamato and Mei\'s relationship or moved on, as such Aiko, Megumi and Kai for instance being the best examples, so this is a good direction to place Mei and Yamato\'s rivals in, they aren\'t just rivals just to cause drama and then never be seen again. Megumi is actually an interesting case as her development contrast easily with Mei, as Mei gains new friends, Megumi starts to lose friends from Mei\'s circle and that causes her to lose it and goes almost into narcissistic territory but also regresses to pre-Mei before meeting Yamato and starts closing herself off from everyone thinking they will betray her. Yes Megumi did HORRIBLE things to mot only Mei but everyone around her when she lost it, but her development and contrast to Mei makes for a good rival, so at least the rivals were utilized quite well as abundantly in favour of Yamato it is.But what about Yamato?, he ""may"" seem like the perfect boyfriend material but we learn more about him and he\'s not that perfect at all giving dimension Mei and their relationship. Yamato\'s always the caring one to anyone even before meeting Mei and that comes into play due to his backstory of him to able to save or help someone in his childhood, because he was a spectator, he now helps anyone so that he\'ll never see anyone sad anymore, so typical white knighting but this also comes into play towards the fact he\'s always willing to help someone, comes into their and Mei\'s relationship and how he really never been in a proper relationship so even he makes mistakes time to time be it neglect, misunderstandings or just communicating to Mei. In all, we have a main relationship where both of them are flawed in their own way and they learn form each other and that bond only got LA to be invested in both of them AND their relationship, Mei for opening up to people, while Yamato was about communicating properly to Mei. Barely anything progresses if the couple is ""perfect"".The beta couples aren\'t that bad either and this includes some of the rival\'s and friends as well. So LA WILL say that in the character and drama department was actually done very decently and LA rooted for the main couple of the anime ALL THE WAY THROUGH so that\'s a good sign, not to mention that Mei and Yamato themselves also developed outside of the relationship as fleshed out character themselves.With all that being said, Mei was quite obviously LA\'s favourite character, not only in reliability but LA rooted for her the most, not to mention all the crap she went through while still keeping her head up the majority of the time might also been a part of it.The animation done by Zexcs was done decently in all regard, decent and character designs and the consistency towards the entirety of the anime was pretty solid. Sukitte Ii na yo. did rarely have some chibi moments but those were limited towards the comedic moments. Overall it was ""decent"" from Zexcs.Voice acting, well LA actually has ALOT more to say in this department, from Ai Kayano doing a pretty decent stoic, shy and quasi-tsundere cadence as Mei and quit honesty for LA, the MVP of this anime, but also Yumi Uchiyama and Minako Kotobuki did quite well as Aiko and Megumi respectively, mainly in the dramatic department but also for their range much like Ai\'s. Others like Takahiro Sakurai and Tomoaki Maeno as Yamato and Kai did great in their roles as well and add Risa Taneda as Asami Oikawa. With a stellar and well known cast, LA kinda HAD to gush about this voice cast.If there were any more flaws LA could pinpoint to Sukitte Ii na yo. well if LA did, then LA would also have defending points towards them but here goes, the melodrama at the start of the anime was a bit underhanded in all regards and all targeted towards Mei at that but like LA said about the many rivals Mei went through they actually became friends with Mei and supported their relationship latter on, they weren\'t ""just rivals"", next would be as much as Sukitte Ii na yo. employs the typical romance cliche, Sukitte Ii na yo. managed to make it use to it\'s advantage, yes some things are gonna be coincidental but to further Mei and Yamato\'s relationship?, well it works...to a certain degree. Lastly would be the open ended and lackluster finale, well spoilers but not really but their relationship was pretty solid even after all the rivals and trials and tribulations about themselves they went through, yes the ending gives a ""read the manga"" ending, but IF you root for this relationship, it\'s a no brainer that their relationship is solid and will continue as much as we can\'t see it in anime form for a proper conclusion but it\'s there.Sukitte Ii na yo. was a very well done romance anime, sure the romance littered with rivals mostly targeting Mei in many aspects, but in this regards, Sukitte Ii na yo. still gives a very well done romance with a main flawed couple you want to root for, flawed main characters with backstory and fleshed out characters outside of their relationship, a rocky but overall decent supporting cast and sincerely, a decent melodrama that works in favour of the main couple or character\'s development.Because, hey if you root of the main couple to be together, then your doing something right for a romance. the primary relationship in question, where the main protagonist changes her.his ways when coming across his/her counterpart both in personality and changes the both of them for the better.For many, if not ALL romance animes, there are trials and tribulations in which the relationship goes through much like Yamato and Mei\'s comes across, many of which seems in favour of Mei more than Yamato and LA isn\'t saying this in a good way. Mei goes through ALOT in this anime, sure the character and belief change about having friend sis one of the main goals for this anime by having Mei and Yamato in being together but man, does Mei goes through LOTS of rivals in order to do so, let\'s see we have, Aiko Mutou voiced by Yumi Uchiyama, a sorta ex of Yamato, Yamato\'s own sister Nagisa voiced by Mariyse Ise and the biggest obstacle Megumi Kitagawa voiced by Minako Kotobuki, while Yamato only needs to deal with Kakeru Hayakawa voiced by Yuki Kaji who rattles Yamato being the playboy but is only a focal point in one episode and his biggest obstacle, Kai Takemura voiced by Tomoaki Maeno who gains a crush to Mei after a heart to heart.No point scoring or anything but many of Yamato and Mei\'s rivals defrost over time and become supports towards Yamato and Mei\'s relationship or moved on, as such Aiko, Megumi and Kai for instance being the best examples, so this is a good direction to place Mei and Yamato\'s rivals in, they aren\'t just rivals just to cause drama and then never be seen again. Megumi is actually an interesting case as her development contrast easily with Mei, as Mei gains new friends, Megumi starts to lose friends from Mei\'s circle and that causes her to lose it and goes almost into narcissistic territory but also regresses to pre-Mei before meeting Yamato and starts closing herself off from everyone thinking they will betray her. Yes Megumi did HORRIBLE things to mot only Mei but everyone around her when she lost it, but her development and contrast to Mei makes for a good rival, so at least the rivals were utilized quite well as abundantly in favour of Yamato it is.But what about Yamato?, he ""may"" seem like the perfect boyfriend material but we learn more about him and he\'s not that perfect at all giving dimension Mei and their relationship. Yamato\'s always the caring one to anyone even before meeting Mei and that comes into play due to his backstory of him to able to save or help someone in his childhood, because he was a spectator, he now helps anyone so that he\'ll never see anyone sad anymore, so typical white knighting but this also comes into play towards the fact he\'s always willing to help someone, comes into their and Mei\'s relationship and how he really never been in a proper relationship so even he makes mistakes time to time be it neglect, misunderstandings or just communicating to Mei. In all, we have a main relationship where both of them are flawed in their own way and they learn form each other and that bond only got LA to be invested in both of them AND their relationship, Mei for opening up to people, while Yamato was about communicating properly to Mei. Barely anything progresses if the couple is ""perfect"".The beta couples aren\'t that bad either and this includes some of the rival\'s and friends as well. So LA WILL say that in the character and drama department was actually done very decently and LA rooted for the main couple of the anime ALL THE WAY THROUGH so that\'s a good sign, not to mention that Mei and Yamato themselves also developed outside of the relationship as fleshed out character themselves.With all that being said, Mei was quite obviously LA\'s favourite character, not only in reliability but LA rooted for her the most, not to mention all the crap she went through while still keeping her head up the majority of the time might also been a part of it.The animation done by Zexcs was done decently in all regard, decent and character designs and the consistency towards the entirety of the anime was pretty solid. Sukitte Ii na yo. did rarely have some chibi moments but those were limited towards the comedic moments. Overall it was ""decent"" from Zexcs.Voice acting, well LA actually has ALOT more to say in this department, from Ai Kayano doing a pretty decent stoic, shy and quasi-tsundere cadence as Mei and quit honesty for LA, the MVP of this anime, but also Yumi Uchiyama and Minako Kotobuki did quite well as Aiko and Megumi respectively, mainly in the dramatic department but also for their range much like Ai\'s. Others like Takahiro Sakurai and Tomoaki Maeno as Yamato and Kai did great in their roles as well and add Risa Taneda as Asami Oikawa.

The main character, Tachibana Mei, is your average reserved high school girl who\'s been through some drama in her life and deals with it in a very usual manner. The story can become really easy to predict at most points and that is actually my only issue with the series; I sometimes found myself getting zoned out because I was predicting the events of the series too well.I enjoy the art direction of the series; it\'s very bright and animations...are pretty fluid. Character development, while very quick, is very realistic. Though at sometimes Mei\'s character irritated me. But that is typical with most reserved characters for me. For the most part, the main characters are pretty interesting.

Just loved it. 9/10 definitely.', 'I found this anime through recommendation from another Shoujo Anime, and finished it in one day (had spare time). I really enjoyed it and was surprised to see the score was quite low for this show so I decided to write a review.While this show isn\'t a master piece (score 9-10) objectively speaking, as it does has its flaws, I thought it was a very decent shoujo anime that should have deserved an 8 or 8+, so this review is sort of to argue about how I personally think the score should be higher for this show. Though legitametly speaking nobody is actually going to...read this (sadly), so I am basically just putting my thoughts out. Well enough of the introduction and let us proceed.Story:Score: (objectively: 8) (personal: 9)This shows overall as well as minor plot structure is nothing new and quite simple. The over-arching story being: shy (&cute) girl meets nice bi-shounen, bishounen falls for her, and she falls for him. The heroine through the bi-shonen gets to know new people, and in each encounter she faces drama and grows in character.While the story is quite typical I found the playout of it to be quite good. While all the arcs are quite stereotypical in which heroine meets bad girl, then drama, heroine then befriends bad girl, makes bad girl good, and along the way the heroine also grows. I thought the sub arcs were executed quite good. All the sub arcs were quite fast and the heroine always quickly overcomes the social situation she faces. Leading to the audience never being quite bored.Another thing I liked about the plot is that 65% of shoujo manga/anime take a long time for the main male and female to get together but in this show they got together quite early. So from the get-go of the show we got to see the pair experiencing the hardships of dating. Rather then a bunch of time being wasted on the pair trying to get together.The plot of this show was not perfect though, as previously stated it is quite the typical shoujo story line, so yes indeed some points off there. And also while the short story arcs made the audience less bored, at the same time due to their short duration I feel like the story of the sub arcs as well as supporting character of the arcs were not developed as well. Though to the credit of the anime, they did show enough to make the plot flow and make sense.But anyhow speaking of characters..... Let\'s transition to the next segment.Characters:Score: (Objective: 7) (Personal: 8)Well let\'s first talk about the supporting cast as I feel that will be easier. Well the thing is, there isn\'t that much to talk about as they were all the typical side character tropes. Given the short duration of the arcs for these side characters they weren\'t developed as much, and we didn\'t get to know them so indepth. Only one side character was more of an overarching villain so was developed and flushed out more.But in my personal opinion just because the supporting cast is typical that doesn\'t mean I have to rate the character segment of the show down. While the supporting cast may have been typical, there was nothing particularly bad about them. And to their credit, there were moments in which one of the side characters did play quite the decent role of supporting the main pair, so much so that she once called out the male lead for being a dick (really liked that part personally).Anyhow the show\'s main focus is on the heroine (and the male lead) so that is what I\'ll be judging the character segment mostly on. The heroine was also quite a typical shoujo heroine character, but personally i found her to be appealing. She had a good, honest personality making you want to care for her and watch her story. And through out the anime compared to other shoujo heroines she didn\'t whine as much and always faced her problems quite fast. Her character also developed a significant amount.If we simply focused on the heroine character I would\'ve given the character segment an 8 but due to the problem with the supporting cast and the male lead I gave it a 7.So regarding the main male, well I don\'t particularly like him. Throughout the show he was portrayed as your typical nice guy and despite being the main male character, in contrast to the heroine, his character did not develop at all what so ever. In fact the only ripples we see in his nice guy character is when he became a hypocrite or insensitive ass. And hence causing me to dislike him and lose enjoyment on the show. Therefore lowering the character segment score from 8 to 7.Art:Score: (objective & personal: 8)This is a slice of life shoujo show so you aren\'t going to be seeing some crazely well animated fight scene, and shouldn\'t expect it. But through out the anime the animation was smooth and nothing to complain about.The backgrounds for the show though was done quite nicely and due to this their were some nice frames that would make for great wallpaper.Moreover I personally like the character design very much. Some shoujo anime like to overdue their ""shoujo aura"" and make the character design sort of exagerrated in a shoujo sense (for example with the eyebrows and lips) (shoujo fans know what I am talking about), this show doesn\'t do that making the characters all quite pleasant for the eyes. The character design isn\'t sooo shoujo that it scare off non-shoujo fans and hence is pleasant as stated.Music:Score: (Objective & Personal: 7)The only part of this show that I was not entertained by was the OST, and if we were only going off the OST I would\'ve marked the music segment quite low. In the OST for the show there wasn\'t any outstanding tracks nor could I say it added or complimented to the show. Basically OST was bland and hence bad.But the saving grace were the themes songs. The OP was quite nice, but most of the ED was great.The ED was done by Suneohair and that should say enough. I\'ve known the band from other animes and I like them. I am not particularly knowledgeable about music so I can\'t give an indepth reason to why it\'s good but well I\'ll just say I personally liked it a lot.Enjoyment:Score: 10I personally love the shoujo romance genre, so to me the plot being a typical shoujo romance is not a minus but rather a major plus. The usual main problem I have with this genre is whether the heroine is annoying or if this was a plain reverse harem show (which I dislike). But for this anime the heroine wasn\'t annoying nor was there a reverse harem. And hence I loved it and enjoyed it greatly.Overall: 8.6 if I average the scores but objectively speaking I\'d say more of an 8.1.This show isn\'t very very unique or has a special twist or super indepth an story that would make it one of those legendary shoujo manga/animes. But it isn\'t downright bad or unenjoyable in anyway.For shoujo fans that watch a lot of shoujo anime and have or finished all the classics I feel this could be a very decent addition to the repertoire. If you enjoy the genre there is nothing particularily bad that should turn you away from the good old same old.And even for non-shoujo fans too, there isn\'t anything to dislike about the show so much so that you can\'t enjoy it.So hence I definitely thing the shoujo should bottom line have an 8 score, given that for the typical MAL-er, a show being below an 8 means being shit.For those who have read so much of my shitty writing to this point I appreciate and thank you very much. Hope you have a nice day too haha lol read this (sadly), so I am basically just putting my thoughts out.

Hope you have a nice day too haha lol', 'Having just watched this show and also being a big fan of the Romance and Drama animes, I can\'t help but to like this anime. I would recommend this show to the people just starting in the romance/drama genre.In my opinion the show moved a long quite fast. Its not a bad thing at all, especially for this show. To me, I didn\'t see any unneeded developments though the story. Considering this is in the drama genre of anime there were character introductions I didn\'t like because they interfered with the relationship of the two people. (That\'s just me though.)As a romance I think...it did a pretty good job with the amount of episodes they were given to work with. The two main people in this show seem like polar opposites. The girl (Mei Tachibana) being someone that keeps her distance from everyone because she thinks friends only bring pain to ones self, Then the guy (Yamato Kurosawa) seems to be this handsome guy that every girl in the school has their eyes on with the fact that he is super popular.The art style of the show seemed to be of any typical Shoujo anime. But of course ZEXCE added its own styles to it like the eyes, hair, and of course the kisses. I didn\'t have a problem with the animation of the show, in fact i loved it!As you could tell I really liked this show if not loved it. I do recommend this show. It was a good enjoyable romance that caught my eye. The name Sukitte ii na yo meaning ""Say I Love You"" grabbed me the most out of everything because I don\'t see many animes that have the word love in it and not be a romantic comedy.So over all it made me happy that I watched this show and it showed me even a good romance story can be told in 12-13 episodes. it did a pretty good job with the amount of episodes they were given to work with.

When you watch the first couple of episodes, you build high expectations because the story is good and the drama is great but it progressively flattens out. The main character Tachibana Mei is extremely annoying and very unlikable and by the end of the series she gets 0 development. And the main male character Yamato is not that hot yet he's portrayed as such. On a hotness scale of 1-10 he's a solid 3 but then again it's a matter of taste I guess.The plot is actually really good and they could...have made it so much better had the characters had any development at all. At the end, Mei is still the same negative passive girl despite having outside encouragement and good friends who cheered her on. Honestly, the light of this show is Aiko-san who is a very strong independent female that don't take no sh*t. She is easily one of my favorite anime characters ever. Too bad she wasn't the main person.All in all, it gets a 5 from me for the huge let down. have made it so much better had the characters had any development at all.

And guess what. There's no fanservice in sight (this is in case you haven't checked the genre section of the show yet). Okay, story. Mei Tachibana is a high school student who grew up to be alone since her friends betrayed her when she was a child. However, a miracle occurs when she meets her high school's most popular boy, Yamato Kurosawa, and he falls in love with her. Then, it's your classic shojo shenanigans, but...what does make this different is that Yamato has to break down his walls in order for Mei to break down hers. I know I just described every other romantic shojo ever, but if I explain anymore, it would just spoil the show. I promise that it's original in some light because it does have interesting side stories. Score: 9/10Art: The animation is so cute and for something very simple, it's very clean, and it does present what the story is telling the audience. When there is a funny scene, the art does match that without breaking apart from the rest of the animation as if it's a different show. With its soft colors matching its calm yet somewhat emotional tone, it makes it something beautiful to look at instead of using it as an anime to listen to as background music while doing your homework. Definitely a 10/10.Sound: The soundtrack is beautiful because of the calm setting the show mostly has. No score is set out of place at all. The only thing I really have to mention to you all because I'm obsessed with it is that the opening has to be one of the most beautiful openings I have ever listened to in my entire life. The opening's purpose is to pull you into the spirit of the show, and Say, I Love You's opening does that extremely well. Though I don't think the ending is just as catchy, it does match what the ending to each episode is, and there's nothing I can really complain about with it. 10/10 it is.Character: Every character from this show has got some insecurity they have to overcome, and at least they have an episode or two dedicating to overcoming it because of the main characters. Of course, you have Mei, your introvert, who would rather be alone than get involved in drama, who also ends up being cherish by someone she doesn't really know because he admires her courage, strong will, and moral values. Yamato has to be one of the cutest male love interests I have ever seen in a long time. He acts like your stereotypical, calm male lead, but he also has a past that everyone seems to only tell Mei just to scare her off and give him to the other girls who think deserve him better. What I love the most about Yamato is that whenever Mei does confront him about what others are saying, he doesn't even hide it. He'll be completely honest with her, and he'll do anything to make it up to the one person he cares about. The side characters are also very enjoyable to watch. My favorite side character has to be Asami. She's just this ball of energy who ends up friending Mei because Asami's pretty much an outcast herself, but for a different reason. Their friendship is so genuine that you actually want them to stay friends when in other anime, the friendship is there for connivence and continuance of the plot. There are plenty of more characters that'll take me forever to describe, but I promise you won't be disappointed in this category. Score: 10/10Enjoyment: Though it might be slow at times, just watching life happen can be pretty interesting. Unlike other romance anime of this type, Say I Love You goes through the real life of teenagers when it comes to self worth or true love. You see a lot of physical insecurities because many of the characters try to hard to look the part in order to mentally play the part. I suppose that's what makes Mei the hero of the show because physical appearance is the least of her focus and she confronts others to just be themselves instead of playing teenage actresses or actors. When other anime just shows the couple having small issues and treating them like it's the end of the world, but with this show, it's so real that you just get sucked into the lives of the characters and want them to have happy endings. In short, 10/10 again, man.Overall: I pretty much said what I wanted to say. I highly recommend this series to any romance fan or any anime fan in general for its beautiful story and relatable characters. With all that, the overall score is a rounded 10/10. what does make this different is that Yamato has to break down his walls in order for Mei to break down hers. I know I just described every other romantic shojo ever, but if I explain anymore, it would just spoil the show. I promise that it's original in some light because it does have interesting side stories. Score: 9/10Art: The animation is so cute and for something very simple, it's very clean, and it does present what the story is telling the audience. When there is a funny scene, the art does match that without breaking apart from the rest of the animation as if it's a different show. With its soft colors matching its calm yet somewhat emotional tone, it makes it something beautiful to look at instead of using it as an anime to listen to as background music while doing your homework. Definitely a 10/10.Sound: The soundtrack is beautiful because of the calm setting the show mostly has. No score is set out of place at all.

However, after a traumatic incident when her ""friends"" abandoned her, Mei\'s idea of friendship completely changed forever and she stopped having friends and trusting them (Tachibana-san and I kind of resemble each other...). In order...to not get hurt again, Mei decides to stay away from people as much as possible, and she doesn\'t want anything to do with having friendships or relationships with any one. During her current life in high school, everyone thought of her as gloomy and stoic. However, as fellow student Yamato Kurosawa—one of the most popular boys in her high school—decides to intrude into her quiet life, Mei begins to question whether or not her choices to distance herself were indeed the right ones.Story (8/10):I-I can seriously relate to Tachibana-san. I-I can remember when I have been hurt by people who I have considered to be my friends. Even my own family has betrayed me sometimes...b-but I\'m also envious of Tachibana-san because she has someone like Kurosawa-kun (n-not the fact that he\'s handsome...! >////<) to be there for her and teach her how to love herself....I-I honestly wish that I had that for myself.Art and design (7/10):I-i think that the art of this anime was really thought out and beautiful. W-what made me happy about the art of this anime is that Kurosawa-kun and Tachibana\'s relationship is really beautiful even though they are both different and similar in their own ways. *blushes* I-i guess that you can say that...o-opposties attract...?Sound Effects (8/10):I-i really don\'t have an opinion on the sound effects because I believe that it\'s the same as all romance and slice of life anime.

We both have had controlling and unbearing fathers, friends who have betrayed us...b-but we also have the same shy personality. I-i believe that if Tachibana-san was in my world or me in hers, I believe that we could become very good friends. Also, K-kurosawa-kun is very loving and caring towards Tachibana-san...I hope that all goes well for those two.Overall:I would recommend this anime to anyone who is interested in romance, drama, and slice of life.

When you love someone, you have to be brave enough to tell them. The romance between Yamato and Mei is sweet and gentle, taking it's time to develop, and I think the relationship and the story are all the better for it. There are definitely some of the typical manga/anime cliche's here, conflicts for the sake of conflicts, etc., but they don't bring the story down. If anything, the way these cliche's and conflicts are handled make the story better. My only complaint? The last episode was very cute and enjoyable, but probably not the...best one to finish the series with. But that's really a minor complaint considering how enjoyable this series is overall.Characters:At first, the characters seem rather stereotypical, but after spending some time with them, you find that they are anything but. They are incredibly real and 3 dimensional and full of life. They have real struggles, real fears, real weaknesses, and real strengths, and I thoroughly loved all of them.Art:The art style is very simple and clean and understated, which I really like. When you have a story with the kind of slow, patient pacing as this one, you don't want the art to be flashy or over the top, and the overall style fits the message and pacing of the anime to a T.In Conclusion::I won't say this is one of my favorite anime's, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. From reading the comments on crunchyroll, I noticed a number of people seemed to be disappointed by the lack of a real conclusion to the series. While I do think the final episode wasn't the best one to end on (I loved it, but if it had been placed before the next to the last episode, I think it would have worked much better in the series), I don't mind the overall ending to the anime. The manga series is still ongoing, and an open ended ending to the anime means the possibility of continuing the story in further episodes. Which I certainly wouldn't complain about. best one to finish the series with.

"", '""I used to hate people because they were so quick to betray each other.  They\'ll say you\'re their friends, but then ignore you, or even shun you when it stops being convenient or fun for them.""Story & Characters: Say ""I Love You."" takes place in a pretty normal high school.  We learn that Mei Tachibana, our main female character, used to be decently popular among her classmates in elementary school, but due to a misunderstanding, distanced herself when they started getting confrontational with her.  She started avoiding people more and more, until her social interaction was practically non-existent.  In the current...day, we notice that many of her classmates still call her gloomy and lonely, and don\'t approach her as a result.  One day, when she\'s on the stairs, Kenji, a classmates of hers, flips her skirt, and she responds by kicking one of his other friends, Yamato, down the stairs.  So how does he respond?  By laughing it off.  Yamato decides to approach Mei with the premise that he wants to get to her know.  This is because he has the opposite view of people - that there is always some good in them, and he wants her to believe in them.  This continues for most of the early episodes until they start dating, but even though Mei falls in love, she has a hard time figuring how to display affection.  She simply doesn\'t know what to do in a romantic relationship, much less a normal friendship.Much of this series reminds me of Horimiya, even though our lead main cast do feel pretty different.  Yamato is obviously not very withdrawn like Miyamoto is, from Horimiya, but his approach to a relationship does feel very similar.  His constant optimism in people is always on the go, and we do see this when Mei tries to ignore that she might be bothered by how he reacts to them.  Mei constantly questions herself and can\'t tell if what she\'s feeling is simply a normal emotion, or if she\'s actually overreacting.  This all makes for a fantastic storyline.  How, as a teenager, do you react in situations that you\'re not experienced in?  Mei, and the show in general, seeks to ask and answer that on a constant basis and it creates great storylines.We see multiple friends within our main cast\'s friend circle, and there\'s a decent group there.  Kenji is a bit of a weirdo, but is very forward with his thoughts on people - while also being a bit of a creep in the early going.  He doesn\'t get a ton of screen time, but what he does get never feels wasted.  Asami, one of Mei\'s friends, is a sweet, sensitive friend that seeks to try and be a good friend to Mei, unlike many of their classmates.  She seems to know what she\'s thinking, while still acting like your typical school girl.  Aiko, another classmate, is a really nice fit in our group of friends because she\'s very stern and anything but a pushover.  She has a bit of a difficult past to contend with, and even though we see her as a bit of a pain in the butt early on, she becomes a really good character for the rest of the series.  Megumi has a part time job as a model, and you can already guess the complexities that comes with doing that at a young age.  While none of the story lines revolving around her are ever mind-blowing, the way they go about it is fantastic.  Yamato\'s sister, Nagisa, and his old friend Kai, also make appearances and have their own little stories too, both of which link back to Mei\'s personal conflicts.As you may have guessed, with so many characters, each episode seeks to show each one off and how they conflict, or work with, Yamato and Mei.  However, the core story is still about Mei, and her character progression as the series goes.  I thought each of these arcs were wonderfully told, eventually leading us to a happy conclusion.  The former arc shows you the steady transformation of Mei, as a character, and each new character that gets introduced into her life, contributes to her evolution, as a person.  Mei questions people, as usual, but she does so that feels believable.  I would have liked if they went into more depth of her troubling past, as it would have added more layers to the great character stories that already exist.  The latter, like with Mei\'s classmates, changes as the series goes on.  Yamato is no pushover, and he\'s stern when he needs to be, though he can often feel like he\'s \'too\' nice.  Regardless, the moments between these two characters rivals that of many other romance series.  My only gripe is the last episode felt a little awkward, as it feels like there were better steps taken in the series on episode 12, than any other.  (Story: 8/10, Characters: 9/10)Art: The art style here is a little different to a lot of other series.  The viewing angles are fine, but some of the character models looked really lanky, which was a minor distraction.  The rest of the animation looked pretty standard though.  (7/10)Sound: Unfortunately, I didn\'t love the sound work here.  The OST wasn\'t anything special, which doesn\'t tend to bug me in itself, but the songs felt a little flat, even if the lyrics had decent messages in them.  The voice cast also felt a little lackluster, as it felt like both leads, Caitlynn French (Mei) and Leraldo Anzaldua (Yamato), had a hard time adapting to their characters throughout the more touching scenes.  Monica Rial (Asami), who I\'m rarely a fan of, was actually really good here.  I just felt like multiple cast members didn\'t throw as much emotion into this as I\'ve seen in other series, something that could have been born from subpar script or directing.  Speaking of the script, I really didn\'t love that they kept using the -kun, -chan, etc. suffixes on many of the names.  It just sounds really weird when mixed into the English language and I don\'t remember the last series I watched that pushed them as constantly as this one.  (5/10)Overall Enjoyment: Despite some really subpar sound work, Say ""I Love You."" was an enjoyable watch.  Characters are excellent and the story elements, while not pushing any limits, are well worth the watch.

(8/10)', 'Wonderful bit of shoujo. The hunk of the school gets interested in anti-social girl who doesn’t believe in having friends. Although the characters aren’t as interesting to me as the more lovable bunch of My Little Monster, they probably live in a more realistic world. Sex is more casual here; something that for some of the characters is more of an option than not (although it seems to be contained to either a character’s past, or to more unsavory characters). The biggest strength of it for me is simply about watching the main character open herself up to experience, and realize that she can trust...people.

I do enjoy a good love story every now and then because it does you some good.The Story (8/10):Well it revolves around our main character, Yamato, winning over Mei (the girl that has had no REAL friends her whole life) and he struggles a little...bit but gets through that pretty early. The rest is their fight to maintain the relationship and their struggles to change themselves and those around them.The Art (9/10):I did very well enjoy the way this anime looked. It had a great style and I liked the way the characters were drawn. The ONLY thing I didn't like, though this was just a small thing I noticed, was that most of the characters (in fact, I can't think of one who didn't) had brown eyes. Now, I am not sure if that is how it is in Japan since this is supposed to be more realistic than having a girl with purple eyes or something but I just seemed to notice that.The Sound (8/10):The soundtrack was appropriate for the tone of each moment, though not very memorable. I did love the opening theme because it was a rather soothing song. The voice acting though was great and definitely matched the tone and emotion of the situations.The Characters (9/10):The characters had great development for each of them and no matter how much you came to hate one character, something was revealed as to why they were that way and you began to feel for them. There was one in particular that I actually didn't think could recover into a likable character but she did, for me at least.Enjoyment (10/10):This obviously is just my opinion and how I felt about it. Though most of this is just my opinion other than when I state something direct about the characters or story.Overall (8/10):I loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys romance anime.

But in reality, it\'s so much deeper than that. It\'s about love, and friendship. I know that sounds cliche, but it isn\'t.Art 10/10I love the art in this. The art is just beautiful and fluid and gorgeous, and the surroundings are detailed. I love the dark color scheme in this. The art is just plain beautiful.Sound 9/10The OT and ET are beautiful. I especially love the opening theme, ""Friendship."" It just describes the series perfectly. The themes are nostalgic,...and fit the series perfectly.Story 8/10I gave the story an 8/10 because the story is typical in a romance anime, but yet it isn\'t.

The anime revolves around one central relationship but on-the-low follows about 4 others as they, for the most part, follow the usual story-line (happiness, trouble, happiness). This anime became significant  to me after I came to the realization that every episode provided an interesting plot twist and left you dying for more.Now for...specifics. This anime gives of a Fruit Baskets type vibe, if you\'ve watched it, and adds to the sentimental feeling you\'re left with.I loved that the personalities of each character they are unique in their own sense while also being realistic. that realistic effect helps make the anime feel that much more personal.The creator did a great job in making sure that there were enough distractions to lengthen the series into 13 amazing episodes but leaves you feeling full by tying up all the loose ends by the end of the series. if you like love stories, you HAVE to add that to your ""to watch list"". specifics.

I was keen to find something else of the same genre to get into. Sukitte Ii Na Yo was what I ended up watching. Sadly, it didn't live up to expectations.The story itself was quite simple, the challenges the characters face uninteresting, cliched, and the outcomes predictable. Every support character was so one dimensional, the story playing out like something from a teenage girl's diary.Only the main character, Mei, was interesting enough to keep me going, which is a credit to the series. There are moments where you really feel for her. But, in the end,...there isn't much else to go on.Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but certainly not the best. there isn't much else to go on.Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but certainly not the best."", ""First, I started to read the same named Manga and was more than happy to find an anime about it!The story is so real, that it could dedicate so many girls out there which I really like include myself. However, I need to say that besides the good character development and the plot, I still think the anime lacks important points which can be read in the manga.But all in all, I think it's not so bad as many suggest.

She is always available to help others see clearly through their own problems but never hers. Yamato surprised me as well: On the surface, he is just a very good-looking guy drawn to Mei's kindness, but he tends to bring out the best in the girls he has been with and he seems the type of guy who is attracted to the soul more than looks.Mei is very pretty of course, but Yamato...adores her. They go through some bumps in the road in their relationship and made mistakes that made me throw my snack at the screen, but overall, this anime easily earns between 4-5 stars.

Nothing ground-breaking or profound, but it does feel surprisingly human. One issue I do have with the series, however (aside from how short it is), is how quickly the lead couple hooked up.So, we\'ve got Mei, a timid, pessimistic, and socially awkward girl who\'s completely jaded to the idea of making friends after being bullied for so long. She meets Yamato, the typical popular guy who\'s also Mr. Knight in Shining Armor, and at the start, she seemingly wants nothing to do with him. It\'s understandable why she\'s so short with Yamato when you take her...past into account. She\'s aloof, skeptical, and always expects the worst from people because all she\'s ever known about ""friendship"" is betrayal. Suddenly having the popular guy, who\'s friends with the idiot who peaked up her skirt, asking to be her friend, is not something a jaded loner would agree to.So why is it despite only knowing Yamato for a few days, they instantly become a couple? By Ep. 3 Yamato states that they are indeed a couple, while Mei is still unsure of their relationship status and overall feelings for Yamato. Them suddenly becoming a couple by the 3rd episode feels as if the relationship is being forced onto Mei, even more so considering how closed-off and shy she is at the idea of being in a relationship. I get that this must be Yamato\'s way of getting Mei to open up and be honest with her feelings since by Ep.2, It\'s quite obvious that Mei has developed some feelings for Yamato, but the issue is that it feels like Yamato isn\'t giving Mei much breathing room, or a chance to slow down and gather her thoughts and emotions. Consider the fact that she\'s been heavily bullied, doesn\'t have friends and has never even been in a relationship before, so of course this would be very overwhelming for her, yet Yamato kind just asserts his affection onto her, despite her protests.Being able to relate to Mei heavily, I feel that it would\'ve taken me A LOT longer to open up, let alone date anyone who suddenly took an interest in me without giving a reason as to why. Someone as cynical and guarded as Mei should\'ve asked her love interest WHY exactly he took an interest in her. I know Yamato confesses to her that he fell in love with her the moment she kicked him down the stairs, but that was AFTER he had already taken an interest in her, so he wasn\'t really being honest about why he even fell in love with her in the first place. I\'m sure the incident at the stairs further sparked his intrigue of Mei, but what made him so curious about her to begin with?I thought Ep.1 was cute, Yamato gave Mei his number, and she calls him because some creep is following her, and he comes to her rescue, with the episode ending with Yamato kissing Mei. Ep.2 was pretty solid, as well. I liked that it showed Mei struggling with her sudden feelings for Yamato after he kissed her. I wish she had pressed him for further answers, like why he started liking her when she was just a nobody before they bumped into each other. Mei clearly took a liking to Yamato but couldn\'t completely trust him because he\'s known for being a bit of a people pleaser and she doesn\'t want to get hurt again. The scene when he kisses her over and over doesn\'t really answer anything for her. To me, it just shows me a guy who\'s infatuated with a shy girl but doesn\'t give a clear reason for why other than ""She\'s cute."" Later on in the story, Yamato proves his love and loyalty to Mei and works to better himself, which I appreciate, but I think having the two hook up very early in the story only made Yamato look like he was forcing the relationship onto Mei. They could\'ve started off slowly, like a  proper slow-burn romance, rather than just declare that the two are a couple just because they shared a few kisses that honestly felt one-sided on Yamato\'s part.I think the story would\'ve been better if the romance had been paced properly, and maybe then I wouldn\'t feel so conflicted about Yamato\'s character. Don\'t get me wrong, I think he\'s endearing and charming. He\'s really kind and sweet, and he\'s ultimately the one who helps Mei realize the good in others. However, his approach to hooking up with Mei was too rushed, which made it feel like his advances were forced and a bit uncomfortable. I get he tries to help Mei, but I just wish the writers could\'ve had Mei and Yamato get together a bit later in the story.Overall, the story is very sweet and wholesome. I haven\'t read the manga, but I\'m hoping the romance doesn\'t struggle with the same pace issue, though I\'m sure that\'s not the case, unfortunately. past into account.

I confess that I saw it early in the morning and at that moment it entertained me significantly, but some points within the plot bothered me a lot. If you want a deeper romance or a more complete backstory, you won\'t find that in this anime. In fact, one thing that really upset me is that the main character\'s personality changes in the middle of the story... [SPOILER]...And that doesn\'t make any sense! Before getting involved with the popular guy, she had a traumatized girlboss behavior: I don\'t need anyone, my childhood friends abandoned me and now I hate everyone. Even in the first scenes, she gives Kurosawa a flying kick, but soon after the two become romantically involved she loses all of that and suddenly becomes the introverted little girl, shy and unable to complete a speech with more than three words. Can we interpret that she used all that armor to hide the fragility she kept within herself? Yes. But within the plot this is extremely loose, making it seem as if the character only assumed this personality to comply with the cliché.Furthermore, Yamato is not that captivating, I also found him a bit random [SPOILER]. Other than that, I watched it well and when I finished I thought it was ok, but with that feeling of ""hmm, I think I wasted my time"". And that doesn\'t make any sense!

The romance here is real, it has development. It's an average art, average sound. But they managed to snatch my attention, and make me feel so much, and also the anime is basically the definition of love, you learn, you see, you cry, you smile.My personal opinion, this series is one of the most realistic rom-com where nothing is perfect, where even the perfect boy ain't perfect, where everyone fails, and learns. Everyone cries, get sad, the perfect girl isn't perfect, the perfect doesn't exist... Some pretty deep stuff you can learn from this anime.. if you haven't already, please consider watching it! happy, feeling emotion all the time while I was watching it.This series in my opinion, is a very underrated series.

I feel as though the things in this show that weren\'t quite what I was looking for were simply based on my tastes. I did enjoy this anime as a whole but towards the end there were scenes that I felt were incredibly dragged on. I also wish there had been more play into the romances of the other characters. I felt the ending itself was a little bland. It was similar to what I would call a happy ending except without any details. I think it is a good quick what but I also feel...that there were some character backgrounds that were shown; where there should have been done to close that characters emotional ties to the story but their weren\'t. It was as if these things were shown to explain a character but they actually played no real role in the actual current story line and had little to no effect to the relationships between each character in which it seemed there should have been more conflict.I\'d say it was worth the watch but if it had taken me more than a day/been more than 12 episodes I probably wouldn\'t have gotten very far. It felt boring; and even though the genre of this show isn\'t supposed to have super high moments it just felt like some things were kind of repetitive/far fetched.

To keep it simple, its good to just binge in a few hours if you have time to kill or just get lost in something. The good thing is that the anime is so generic, that once you finish it, you will barely remember anything. its almost as if a few hours of your life ""disappeared"", not wasted, but not really gripping either.Story: 4completely generic. and utter childish bullshit. all the plots are very very simplistic. as you can see from the description, heroine\'s...""trauma"" is that some of her classmates shove the blame of class pet\'s death on her, and she doesn\'t trust anyone. pretty much ALL plots revolve around some kind of bullying and all of them are shallow, and most of the resolutions to those plots are pretty shallow too. not much romance except cliche dialogues.Art: 8pretty much the only redeeming feature. I like how the main character feels like a modern anime handsome boi, but the main female lead has a design that you see in old anime like Great Teacher Onizuka and other classics. there\'s not many situations to go all out, but the art of the magazine cover photoshoots was really clean and pretty. It stays very consistent most of the time and honestly one of the reasons this anime is watchable.Sound: 5not saying its bad, but usually when i watch anime, i usually remember atleast one moment where i liked the background music, whether it be a comic music like kanojo mo kanojo or really smooth anime songs that play during confessions like shigatsu wa kimi no uso or maybe the sound effects in kobayashi maid dragon. but this time, nothing. the very definition of mediocre.Character: 3the weakest part of the anime.

I loved Mei and there was so much room for her to develop as a good written character but if you watch the second episode and the last episode you can see the relationship between them and even the characters their self has not made any progress even after a year later. I still can't wrap my head around them being in a relationship with such dry conversations and Mei still acting “jumpy” and shy with her boyfriend she's been with for over a year. And the fact that Yamato fell in love with her for kicking him? Seriously wtf was that she wasn’t even consistently “tough” or “brave” to the point that she kicked a stranger she never knew (like she did in the first episode), throughout the whole series. “So, Yamato fell in love with a bland character because she's not borderline pathetic and obsessed over him” ...yes.One of the things that I did like about the series is how they tackled the issue of being insecure and constantly pleasing other people to the point that it can be damaging emotionally and physically through the character of Aiko, some people might think that she's a bitch, but I feel like I resonated and empathize with her more than any other characters, without going through the same experiences, her transition from being a bad character to a good one was sudden but I can still appreciate that they put in some real struggles of teenagers in a high school could experience to make it seem realistic. And Asami struggle with self-image, how Megumi handled the hate she received and how she bounced back from that, or just the picture that this show has painted of how important friendships are, I don’t think it’s the best execution but I still appreciate it. So, I did like it except the little to none character development and the relationship dynamic. There is so much more I can say that I didn’t like and like about say I love but this is probably gonna be like a 2000-word review. This is just my opinion idc if you like it or not I was really hoping for Mei to find happiness and confidence without Yamato and love herself within.

The second half of the anime is especially egregious when it comes to this. So many of the ""drama"" points in the story consists of: Mei or Yamato misunderstanding something thinking the other doesn\'t want to see them, then someone else says something which they proceed to misinterpt even further, a whole lot of self-doubting and/or crying occurs, and finally Mei and Yamato meet up IRL and resolve the conflict for like 10 minutes until...the next one begins. It seems they learn more about each other only after resolving 5 misunderstandings every time. I know Mei is shy and doubts herself but it is ridiculous how the misunderstandings are the only plot device, there is literally nothing else driving any conflict. the next one begins.

You have this timid girl who has issues and a trauma, and they present that to you as if it's going to matter at all in the future, and she's going to work on herself and learn new things and overcome her fears but then...

He gives up career oportunities and even some traits of his own friendly personality to suit the female lead who never really grows to be an interesting character, but rather just spirales deeper and deeper into someone no one would ever want to be around in real life.It's really not a romantic story at all unless you're like, under 12. perspective that if you're single you're sad and lonely and jealous, and if you're in a relationship, then you have it all.

I don't mean to say that that is necessarily a bad thing. I just felt like there was nothing that spices it up and by the episode 2 it became quite boring to watch.Disclaimer: I dropped this anime, haven't seen the last 2 episodes!But overall the worst thing about Sukitte Ii na yo is the main male lead. Great guy, really handsome and kind good friend, but not a boyfriend. In my eyes this dude failes at being a boyfriend material at many points...and I hated to see that. Especially since the main female lead is quite really nice. and I hated to see that. Especially since the main female lead is quite really nice."", ""I have enjoyed other shows that were similar on paper, but I didn't get into the characters and plot of this one.The show tries to add depth to characters by showing them as insecure or having bad things in their past, but this doesn't make the characters engaging.This is my interpretation of their dynamic: The main character and love interest have a pursuer-distancer dynamic. The guy sees what he wants to see in the girl, but his idea of her doesn't match most of her thoughts and behaviour. He seems to be actively drawn to her because she is bullied and pushes people away....He wants to be someone who stands up to bullies. He is also more interested in someone who rejects him than someone who pursues him. He sees her as both someone he can rescue and as stronger than him. There are a few reasons in his backstory for this.Despite her defensiveness, once she lets someone in, they have a lot of control over her. She is sensitive to even the possibility of rejection.In my opinion, this show either needs:-more humor (so the odd behavior doesn't break suspension of disbelief).-or to be darker (diving into the complexity and putting the focus on exploring the trauma and dysfunctional relationships)-or perhaps just better writing, so the characters and relationships feel more believable.Overall it was dissatisfying and I stopped 3/4 of the way through.

Sigh.Say ""I Love You"" is incredibly disappointing. The romance is lackluster with the typical perfect guy falls for the unpopular girl. The couple has no chemistry, they barely have common interests, and their communication is non-existent. Alas, welcome to the world of melodramatic high school teenage bullshit!Characters 1/10 for the MC, 8/10 for everyone elseHere lies the main problem I have with romance animes: having an insufferable female lead. And good lord, Mei Tachibana might take the cake of being the most boring, plain, and insecure MC I\'ve...ever had to witness. Her personality is as interesting as a stale piece of white bread. She\'s cynical and meek, and is probably socially retarded in some sense. She\'s the epitome of what I hated about Bella Swan, except Bella was actually nice on the eyes. In every aspect, Mei is the type of character that simply can\'t carry the show by herself, and it\'s painful to watch her mull over her feelings and act all melodramatic and shit.As for the other characters, I actually enjoyed them very much. I loved Aiko\'s ""I don\'t give a fuck"" attitude, Asami\'s bubbly exuberance, and Nakanishi\'s playfulness. I absolutely adored the growth Kai and Megumi went through (their characters definitely stole the spotlight). Then we have Yamato, the love interest, who was an overall swell guy. The only problem is that he seems to have the ""demigod syndrome"". See, the guy is perfect.... too perfect. He\'s suave, gorgeous, nice, rich, smart, athletic, etc etc etc. I mean, I wouldn\'t be surprised if they introduced some kind of outrageous hidden ""heir to the throne"" plot. In this regard, he reminded me of Takami Usui (from Maid Sama); although, he\'s not as overly ridiculous as that other guy. In the end, Yamato got his character development and was able to admit his mistakes and be there for his friends. With that being said, I\'m just baffled how the writers were able to write such likable and interesting characters but decided to give Mei the short end of the stick?~Oh, and what the hell was with that pacing? Sometimes relationships are developing too fast or too slow with barely any middle ground. The friendship with the side characters just...happened. No progression; instead, Mei who had no friends and had severe trust issues suddenly became friends with Asami overnight. And Aiko, who hated Mei, just...forgot about her bitchiness? Like, try to make these relationships somewhat believable, geez.Romance and Plot 5/10Because I found Mei so damn intolerable, I really couldn\'t root for the romance. Usually, when there\'s the cliche of a pairing of a popular and unpopular character occurs, the ""popular"" one always seems like they\'re dating down. Or at least, that\'s what everyone else thinks, but the audience secretly knows that the ""unpopular"" character actually has an amazing personality, and that\'s why the ""popular prince/ princess"" couldn\'t help but fall in love with them--- right?See, I don\'t mind this kind of plot because, in some twisted way that abides by a social hierarchy, this trope tries to showcase the characters as each others\' equals. That the popular, perfect person had a reason to fall for the social outcast. Say ""I Love You"" doesn\'t do this. I was racking my brain out to come up with any plausible reasons why Yamato might fall for Mei. What I concluded, was that Yamato was so shocked that Mei didn\'t fawn over him the moment they met, and the chase was what kept him on his toes.Honestly, all of the girls that were a ""threat"" to their relationship, truly were all relatively better than Mei in every single way. They were better at communicating their feelings, they were courageous, had strong personalities, and knew how to style their hair so it didn\'t look like a rat\'s nest (I guess May never went to that salon, huh?). Suffice to say, Mei as a character is horrible. But Mei as a girlfriend is even worse. Homegirl expects Yamato to read her mind because she\'s mute for 90% of their interactions. Really, there\'s no other way to say it: Yamato deserves a lot better.Art and Sound 6/10The art is mediocre. It\'s very obvious that it was adapted from manga since it retained the source material\'s style very closely. I didn\'t hate it; I didn\'t love it. The animation could\'ve been more fluid in some scenes (haha remember that running scene?), and there could\'ve been more facial expressions for the character. Like I said, very mediocre.The sound is probably the most positive thing I have to say about this anime. I liked the recurring piano melody that played in the ""emotional"" scenes, and the OP and EP are bangers. No complaints here in this department.Overall 5.5/10Look, the romance genre is very hit and miss for me. And Say ""I Love You"" definitely missed its mark. If you\'re up for teenagers who are boring and stupid navigate their romantic relationships in the most melodramatic way possible, then this is the anime for you! It\'s not a complete waste of time, but I would still recommend you to skip it. ever had to witness. Her personality is as interesting as a stale piece of white bread.

I'm autistic and I used to have a hard time when I was in school. I was constantly bullied for being unique and different, I couldn't speak very well with people because of my disorder. I was always shy, reserved and quiet like our main heroine. She reminds me a lot of myself when I was younger. The loveable characters popped out to me because they generally reminded me of real life high schoolers. The popular girl who had fake admirers...following her around like the queen bee of the school, the girls whop didn't have a lot of budding confidence in themselves (especially because of being picked on through their young adolescent lives), and that popular male character whom all the girls fall for.This anime just gave me a sense of realism that I had lived out at one point in my life.During my last year of high school I met a boy from England, and even though I had gone through a horrible break up he comforted me and eventually we got talking and later became an item, similar to the life of Tachibana san (to some extent). This anime hits home because Tachibana went through similar problems that I had faced when I was younger. I didn't let too many people get close to me, I was shut off from the world for being bullied and for being awkward and shy. I had this boy from England who opened up a whole new world to me, one that I hadn't fully experienced before. Over the years I gained some confidence in myself being with this boy, and I fell for him soon after like our main heroine.He had opened up a whole new world to me, where I met people who actually cared about me (unlike the high school girls who I thought were my friends), and they became precious to me also. Even through all the rough patches like being scared of your partner cheating on you, or worrying over some girl trying to snatch up your boyfriend, to the times where you feel alone and hurt and it's hard to let people help you get through those troubling times. This anime describes my life quite well.I personally loved this anime for it's portrayal of realism and how much it brings back old memories of past experiences from when I was younger. Re-watching this anime for the second time now I get those flashbacks in my head reminding me of the good and bad times, and it's nice knowing I wasn't alone with feeling the way that I did. That it was normal to feel the emotions that I did.I give my hat off to you for the creation of this anime.

We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained."" - Marie CurieEveryone wants a second chance in life, amirite? Whether is it to resuscitate loved ones that could\'ve a chance to live if not for reckless decisions made internally or externally, or to amend for mistakes done so badly that he/she falls out of grace from their passion at life? Well, look no further than Bokutachi no Remake a.k.a Remake our Life!: the...fortunate pairing of one of the best AniManga tropes ever seen on the face of the earth (which is time travelling, Steins;Gate or Tokyo Revengers style), together with the abundance of school and working life (that are striking similarities to both Re:LIFE and Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo). And if the series\' tagline of ""Let\'s time-travel to 10 years ago and re-enjoy creative and sweet youthful days."" doesn\'t get to you, then I don\'t know how to sell this show to you.""When you have confidence, you can have a lot of fun. And when you have fun, you can do amazing things."" - Joe NamathThere\'re dreams and aspirations that each and everyone of us wants to chase become, whether is it through influence or birthed from young (and it runs in the family), those are expectations. But the world isn\'t so kind to both good and bad boys and girls like us, such as the thought that the yearning or longing is but a distant dream left in our wildest dreams, that is reality. And for MC Hashiba Kyouya, everything about him screams like your typical MC with no backbone, but only a failure of a life lived with every regret on his shoulders: his 28-year old self being at the despicable end of his young adult life with a company-bust bankrupt of a salaryman\'s passion job. Even joining hands with one of his co-workers for a quick hand at a similar job also proves to be a bust. Well then, he\'s out of options, and out of jealousy for this group of people dubbed the ""Platinum Generation/Era"" that had a tumultuous ride in a different profession from Kyouya, and what is the next logical step down the pipeline? A night\'s sleep worth of rest to somehow mysteriously bring Kyouya back 10 years into the past of his beginning college days at the Oonaka University of Arts, and that\'s his new reality to start things afresh with the foreseeable future in mind to rid of potential missteps in the timeline.""Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution."" - David J. SchwartzThis is where the Re:LIFE similarities end, and in comes Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo with the whole vibe livening from the cast of characters and the aforementioned setting: the school life and the shared dorm house of these talents (which they form the Platinum Generation/Era). The Share House Kitayama consisting of the talents of illustrator Aki Shino (everyone just calls her Shinoaki), singer Nanako Kogure and author Tsurayuki Rokuonji, add Kyouya into the mix and you\'ll have an exact copy of Sakura-sou of young adults just living life together both at home and in school, where these 4 trudge through the usual tendencies of school with their Arts program of learning essential skills pertaining to video making, while keeping their friendship as a track record together. I\'m very sure that we\'ve all been through college at one point, and depending on your IRL relationship, these are the last memories of friendships before the adulting stage, where everyone just forgo friendship to chase after their dreams. Even with rival and future co-worker Eiko Kawasegawa, these dreams don\'t come easy, as Kyouya dips into each of their lives, trying to amend their mistakes by following the future already foretold, that he simply forgot that this absolute madman of a control would come back to haunt their lives. ""S(he)\'s a super freak, super freak"" as Rick James would sing out. Keep a look out for Keiko Tomioka, she\'s not only a veteran in the game industry playing the Senpai role to the rest, but because she\'s part of the reason why this show works, with or without reason.""Doubt can motivate you, so don’t be afraid of it. Confidence and doubt are at two ends of the scale, and you need both. They balance each other out."" - Barbra StreisandPersonally, Bokutachi no Remake touches the heart pangs of a specific life chapter where all of us wanted to be: if we could just Re:LIFE, and relive a time in our lives again to fix all the loopholes and missing pieces of our lives being a huge jigsaw puzzle of sorts. But being human, it\'s easy to be misled that nothing is ever 100% perfect in the first place.

And by far, Bokutachi no Remake is yet another crowning achievement of the stellar and vibrant visuals and animation that we\'ve come to know of the studio, that quality is more than quantity, leading to better produced shows overall. Especially though in the OP and ED visuals, those are some really striking visuals (and not just for fanservice reasons), and my eyes are easily blinded by such incredible talents working on this show. So I must say that feel., you\'ve done it yet again.If anything, I\'m very drawn to music bands from Bushiroad\'s many franchises (because of D4DJ), and the OP/ED set by BanG Dream! idol groups Poppin\'Party and Argonavis are great, upbeat songs. No favouritism, but while Poppin\'Party\'s OP is good, Argonavis\'s ED is a perfect fit that vibes along with the heartstrings of the anime\'s themes of possibilities. Also, since this Summer season is a season where EDs are a lot better than OPs, Bokutachi no Remake is no exception to that moniker. I just love the sound of youth from Argonavis which brings the early 2000s teen movie vibes, and I\'m all here for it.""Love who you are, embrace who you are. Love yourself. When you love yourself, people can kind of pick up on that: they can see confidence, they can see self-esteem, and naturally, people gravitate towards you."" - Lilly SinghThere a lot of charm that can be said about Bokutachi no Remake, but it would be best said if you watched the anime and let those feelings tug at your heart.

And if the series\' tagline of ""Let\'s time-travel to 10 years ago and re-enjoy creative and sweet youthful days."" doesn\'t get to you, then I don\'t know how to sell this show to you.""When you have confidence, you can have a lot of fun. And when you have fun, you can do amazing things."" - Joe NamathThere\'re dreams and aspirations that each and everyone of us wants to chase become, whether is it through influence or birthed from young (and it runs in the family), those are expectations. But the world isn\'t so kind to both good and bad boys and girls like us, such as the thought that the yearning or longing is but a distant dream left in our wildest dreams, that is reality. And for MC Hashiba Kyouya, everything about him screams like your typical MC with no backbone, but only a failure of a life lived with every regret on his shoulders: his 28-year old self being at the despicable end of his young adult life with a company-bust bankrupt of a salaryman\'s passion job. Even joining hands with one of his co-workers for a quick hand at a similar job also proves to be a bust. Well then, he\'s out of options, and out of jealousy for this group of people dubbed the ""Platinum Generation/Era"" that had a tumultuous ride in a different profession from Kyouya, and what is the next logical step down the pipeline? A night\'s sleep worth of rest to somehow mysteriously bring Kyouya back 10 years into the past of his beginning college days at the Oonaka University of Arts, and that\'s his new reality to start things afresh with the foreseeable future in mind to rid of potential missteps in the timeline.""Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution."" - David J. SchwartzThis is where the Re:LIFE similarities end, and in comes Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo with the whole vibe livening from the cast of characters and the aforementioned setting: the school life and the shared dorm house of these talents (which they form the Platinum Generation/Era). The Share House Kitayama consisting of the talents of illustrator Aki Shino (everyone just calls her Shinoaki), singer Nanako Kogure and author Tsurayuki Rokuonji, add Kyouya into the mix and you\'ll have an exact copy of Sakura-sou of young adults just living life together both at home and in school, where these 4 trudge through the usual tendencies of school with their Arts program of learning essential skills pertaining to video making, while keeping their friendship as a track record together. I\'m very sure that we\'ve all been through college at one point, and depending on your IRL relationship, these are the last memories of friendships before the adulting stage, where everyone just forgo friendship to chase after their dreams. Even with rival and future co-worker Eiko Kawasegawa, these dreams don\'t come easy, as Kyouya dips into each of their lives, trying to amend their mistakes by following the future already foretold, that he simply forgot that this absolute madman of a control would come back to haunt their lives. ""S(he)\'s a super freak, super freak"" as Rick James would sing out. Keep a look out for Keiko Tomioka, she\'s not only a veteran in the game industry playing the Senpai role to the rest, but because she\'s part of the reason why this show works, with or without reason.""Doubt can motivate you, so don’t be afraid of it. Confidence and doubt are at two ends of the scale, and you need both. They balance each other out."" - Barbra StreisandPersonally, Bokutachi no Remake touches the heart pangs of a specific life chapter where all of us wanted to be: if we could just Re:LIFE, and relive a time in our lives again to fix all the loopholes and missing pieces of our lives being a huge jigsaw puzzle of sorts. But being human, it\'s easy to be misled that nothing is ever 100% perfect in the first place.

I ultimately failed. The waifus carried it. No, in all seriousness, It’s a show that I struggle to quantify what exactly made it tick for me.I guess if there’s one lesson to be taken away from the series, it’s that you should pursue things you’re passionate about when the opportunity is presented. The MC’s whole dilemma in life and ultimate time travel scenario is set up because of him not going to art school. Instead of starting...a coup and genocide as a result, he just works at a video game company before being transported back in time.I loved the characters in the show and thought their chemistry was really good.  The MC basically becomes the glue that holds a talent generation of artists together. I felt at times he was used as primarily a tool for their growth rather than actually being his own character. I don’t think it was detrimental to the overall story, but it was noticeable at times. I also found the direction of the plot to be a bit confusing at times. Especially in the final stretch of the cour where it seemed like there was twist after twist with little time to explain in 3 episodes.The show ultimately gets more right than it gets wrong though. I love shows that focus on creatives. Artists have their own unique issues and we get a little exposure into that world. While dramatised, we also get a pretty nice look into the world of video game design and Japanese work culture in general. The pressure that the MC’s team is under while designing a video game in a couple episodes was really palpable. I also enjoyed his problem solving skills and seeing him overcome seemingly impossible odds in some scenarios.Time Travel anime can either be hit or miss. They’re usually all worth watching and BokuRemake is no exception. I certainly loved watching this show and have it in my top 3 of the season, but at times the story feels a little… lacking? The main sell here is the waifus and slice of life moments, which is more than enough for me in fairness.BokuRemake gets 9 out of 10. a coup and genocide as a result, he just works at a video game company before being transported back in time.I loved the characters in the show and thought their chemistry was really good.

It's not exactly an unique idea but let's face it, we're in 2021 and most ideas have been overused already. Remake Our Life decides to use time travel as a catalyst to remake a main protagonist's life.Based on the light novel of the same name, the series is fundamentally what it sounds like. The chance to go back in time and remake your own life is something that I'm sure some of us have wished for in our lives....As a video game creator, Kyouya Hashiba gets his second wind when he wakes up 10 years from 2016 to 2006. The story drops him into a timeline where he gets the opportunity to turn his life around and avoid a catastrophic future.Watching Remake Our Life was a bit cautious at first because time travel can be a risky plot device. Some anime can work wonders with such an idea while others is almost unacceptable. How should time travel be accepted into this show? Well for starters, we have to understand that Kyouya is 28 years old who became unemployed after his dream job company went bankrupt. It's a circumstance that happens often in the video game industry. By getting the break he needs with this time travel, Kyouya literally can make his own life successful again by becoming a more creative game creator. It's harder than it sounds but thanks to the second chance, he can follow his dream and not be a washed up salaryman.Despite being the main protagonist, the show shares a fair amount of screen time for it leading cast. It's almost if the cast is linked and destined to meet one another. The character roster includes Aki Shino, Nanako Kogure, Tsurayuki Rokuonji, and Eiko Kawasegawa. Most interestingly, these characters are young adults than the typical high school kids you find in light novel adaptations. As the series wants to explore a more young adult environment, it's more refreshing and also allows the audience to see the what the video game industry is like from inside and out. At its core, the principal character cast here are unified almost like a family together.  They are all there to be in their own roles and also support Kyouya in some way or form. It's also realistic at the same time as we see the hardship of working. A risky problem for Kyouya is how much he has to carry the burden and keeping the passion alive. Watching him take calculated risks such as coding games and building projects shows how much of a daredevil he is. Not only is he risking financial investment into games, he also risks his mental health and relationships with his co-workers.Speaking of relationships, the main triangle (or perhaps more suitable as 'love triangle') is between Kyouya, Aki, and Nanako. One of the episodes specifically dedicates time to give Kyouya and Aki intimate time with a festival mood. Throughout the series, it becomes more obvious that Nanako also harbors feelings towards Kyouya and it's hard to decide who to root for. More interestingly is that the show focuses a lot on realism involving character relationships. With each passing episode, you almost forget the anime had a time travel element in it. Furthermore, Kyouya's friendship and rivalry with Tsurayuki is a cleverly executed as the two brings out the best from each other. Tsurayuki himself is also a fascinating character after we see his involvement with a girl from the past. The show builds him as a secondary protagonist with his own assets and characteristics. Furthermore, the anime also establishes Eiko as a mature young woman with skills in the video game industry. It's pleasing to see the show not forget any of its main character cast regardless what timeline they are in.Among many subjects, one of the bigger sell points of the show is realism. This has been mentioned before it's very refreshing to see young amateurs build their way up and learn about the video game industry such as Kyouya. Has to learn and experiment with creating video games firsthand to understand its mechanics. It's more than just textbooks that he learns at school and we can see how difficult is to become succcessful at making just one game. As a gamer myself, this show drew me as it shows how every game has its own challenges to make whether it's coding, researching or crunching hours to meet deadlines. At its apex, I believe this show has an inner psychology that explores the realism of adult working people. And that is a something that should be respected for this anime.With a character cast of young adults, the anime has an overall more mature feeling. The female character has their alluring tones such as Aki's big breasts or Nanako's lavish blonde hair. Eiko herself is quite a looker with her scarlet red hair. Kyouya lands a bit lower in the looks department but he attracts at least two girls in the show. And while the anime is very light on fan service, it still has some compromising moments and the obligatory beach episode.This isn't a difficult anime to get into and you can watch this without breaking a sweat. It's a simple show that uses time travel as a plot device but ultimately doesn't rely on it to sell its main story. Instead, it's the character cast that carries the show together staring Kyouya. For an anime like Remake Our Life, it's so pleasing to see it turn an overused idea and turn it into a blessing.

A time-travel anime about a man who failed in life that went back 10 years ago, definitely doesn't sound like plagiarism right there.Story: 7/10The story is definitely not the most original you can find or sink your teeth in for a brand new experience, but the plot execution is done well and introduces good set pieces that mean something as you progress later into the story. Around the last quarter, it...begins to unfold its real message. The twist is well-built and realistic that you wouldn't expect it to come in the first place.Art: 8/10The character designs and art background absolutely delivers it. They may not look like the most beautiful art to ever been witnessed, but they sure look pretty good and the animation is smooth. It may have some odd moments, but I was interested to look more at what the anime has to offer.Character: 8/10There are some good characters that are proof of the author's genuine attempt at making someone and not a carbon copy of one's personality, but some of their dialogues and interactions with one another can be a bit predictable and hard to look at. Indeed, the main character doesn't have the best personality, but the storyline makes it doable for him to be worth the attention.Enjoyment: 9/10I really enjoyed it because I goggled a lot at the art of some characters and thought to myself of how gorgeous do these people were designed. It's not pretty bad and I'm glad that the story was able to keep me intrigued from the whole start to finish. Though the first episode can feel dragged. The anime was a great experience and I hope for a possible sequel. begins to unfold its real message.

Misplaced fanservice:Bokutachi no Remake is apparently a show about a man with underutilized creative potential getting a second chance at life, and he gets...to intermingle with 3 of the most talented people in the industry in his new life. In his rewound timeline, after taking the road previously not taken, he finds himself in a dorm with 3 people. Hmm, I wonder who they are? By the way, the main cast comprises 2 males and 2 female characters.3 episodes in, you explore the male characters\' personalities, their strengths, and weaknesses.But the first female is introduced by a boob shot, and the second one gets bra shots and has so little spatial awareness that the only way to file cans in a shelf in an empty room is from behind the male MC in a way that her chest rubs against his skull. Right after a ruminative moment.It is disheartening that in an anime that is supposed to have themes most people can relate to, half of the main cast is sexualized in these immoderate manners which often break the immersion or ruin the tone of the narrative. What exactly does this anime want its viewers to do? Contemplate life while getting a hardon? Ofc if you only watch anime for fanservice, that\'s a different devil.I will exclude harem, ecchi-tagged anime from this sort of criticism because they\'re what they\'re supposed to be.2. PlotThis will be pretty short but here\'s the gist. What is the point of having an MC remaking his life if apparently, he\'s already so adept that he becomes everyone\'s saving grace? Is he a relatable MC or is he what we wish we could\'ve been?Some dialogues flow as if they were written by a preteen. Interactions are so mechanically emotional, it\'s akin to watching a melodramatic play. Why is X just frowning while Y (a stranger for all that matters) is spitting hostility towards him? Why does Z accuse X of doing something really specific only to casually take it back for pseudo-bonding after a ""fight""?My complaints would likely increase as I keep watching because the episodes keep declining in their consistency. Overall, the appeal of this anime seems to be on the themes that may be found as relatable to many, but for a lot of reasons, it falls short. to intermingle with 3 of the most talented people in the industry in his new life.

Overall, the appeal of this anime seems to be on the themes that may be found as relatable to many, but for a lot of reasons, it falls short.', 'oh boy... here we goI was (moderately ) hyped for this show... well because of the big \'plot\' on the poster lmao and tbf this season was very mid with exception for few animes that I\'ve watched.I watched the first ep and thought to myself that it was somewhat decent but i still think that it could be good after few eps or so i thought....And here we are, all wrapped up, and with my score, you can probably tell what I thought of it.The premise is interesting, but the execution is disappointing because by the end of it, u don\'t even know what was...the point of kyouya going back in time other than use it as plot device?. Interestingly enough this show setting is in college, which is refreshing since a lot anime deals with high school story. Unfortunately, the college setting wasnt really use that well because when i watched it, it felt like im watching yet another high school harem , slice of life, wish fulfilment anime and its really sad tbh . At first, I didn\'t like how kyouya solving every basic stuff for his friends but after that, the show took a surprising turn where we see kyouya is in a devastating state after what he did to the platinum gen in one ep but fear not jesus kun was able to pick himself up and able to solve a company issue in the next ep. In a nutshell, this is a decent time-waster but ultimately disappointing.This show gave me a lot of stress and irritation to see how much love this show is getting, while im sitting here and wondering how the hell u think this show is great?. its so annoying to see on reddit, mal, yt or Instagram praising tf out of this show ( yes, im well aware that enjoyment is important but like i dont even see a lot of the ppl pointing out how terrible written this story is ) .Also, im not even watching anime to be objectively critical or whatever i just wanna enjoy anime but with this anime i cant even turn off my brain to tolerate some of the writing. Every time a new ep comes out, i always try my best to enjoy this show but bruhh some of the sloppy writing in this show gives me headache. also, the fanservice in this show is stupid and weird and also completely disrupting the tone of the narrative that the show trying to potray. The choice to make kaguya\'s va sound like a toddler is stupid because when a scene involving her talking something important, it makes me hard to not pull a face. Talking abt aki, why does maki look exactly like her mother? geez, talking abt taking laziness to another level.The problems that i have with this series:1. the pacing or detailsThis show could\'ve been more than 12 eps considering how many things that they skipped over and how badly pace it was. For example, in ep 2, kawasegawa came out of nowhere starting to accuse kyouya that he\'s underestimate filmmaking and basically saying her team is gonna be better than kyouya\'s team. Now, this could\'ve at least expand more or show us or tell us on why kawasegawa acting like this or maybe she just plain rude ( but i dont think thats the case ) or jealous because later on the story she became somewhat friendly or not the same person as she was in ep 2 - ep 4. Even if it was abt competition ,its still weird  . Moreover, they didnt even show us how good her video was and this becomes a trend where the show just gave us the students perspective or comments or how they feel abt the video presentation . Lets go on to ep 4, this is where the drama starts or should i say melodrama, kawasegawa was asked by her sister to join kyouya\'s team but again they jump straight to a new semester and completely disregarding kawasegawa\'s impact on the team. We could\'ve seen her bonding and building a relationship with the team and kyouya ,but no, all we got was a time skip and a badly written conflict between kawasegawa and nanako. Let me breakdown the situation, they had another film presentation and what a surprise they didnt show anything abt both kyouya and this student\'s team video. All we had was (again) the comments from the students saying that one of the member students\' team did a wonderful acting but nanako\'s acting was a bit robotic ,again from the student\'s perspective. How can u expect us, the audience, to care what kawasegawa said to nanako, for all we know nanako\'s acting probably didn\'t suck because its a matter of perspective, one can say that aki\'s voice is annoying asf but the other will say that its terrible. That scene can be much appreciated if we developed kawasegawa , as a new member, being implemented in kyouya\'s team and as well seeing her understanding nanako ( especially her personality), because for her to do that is a humiliation for nanako and besides, they won the bloody presentation so for her to do that is hella dumb. (imo) They could\'ve done one more presentation where kyouya\'s team lose because of the team not performing \'seriously\' ( because they want to focus on that topic so much ) and it took eiko to step up and hit reality on the team but noooo. A proper build up can make the audience more caring abt that moment and make kawasegawa to not look like a jerk. Moving on, in ep 5, this is where i got respect for kawasegawa because she knew she messed up and had the balls to confront nanako ahhh such a sweet moment but wait our beta mc ,kyouya, had to ruin that moment. im sorry but why in the fuk did u do that? who are u to say that kawasegawa didnt need to apologize? im actually baffled when that scene happened, he completely stole nanako\'s right and stole that beautiful moment. The first half of ep11 was weirdly pace that u are confused to how kyouya manage to solve this company\'s problem because we didnt see him contacting anyone or discussing with anyone abt fixing the problem in the last ep and somehow he gave a document ( out from his ass i guess ) abt this new engine. There\'s also a weird transition happened in ep 4, where it cut from kyouya in the share house to a cafe scene just like that.2. KyouyaIf u fully expecting to have something that u can relate with the mc or seeing the mc going through such obstacles to achieve his goal, yeah u will not get that with this anime .The relatable part of the MC starts and ends with the first episode where he is depicted as someone who has made mistakes throughout his 20s. After that, he ceases to be relatable and becomes Gary Stu/Jesus-kun where whatever problem is thrown at him, he magically resolves it(and before anyone says ""he has experience from his old life"", the problem with that is that, there is no ""presentation/process"" of him coming up with his solutions, hence, instead of looking like a genius, he comes out as someone with bullshit powers of problem-solving). idk how to describe it because throughout the show he show no weaknesses and his surrounding was sucking him off as if he was a reincarnation of god, and that\'s a big problem for this show is that the mc is too perfect that is too hard for ppl to root for him cause u know he\'s gonna succeed at it and it can be boring af. Can u tell me if this good? because later on the only \'mistake\' that he done throughout this series is ruin the platinum gen ( i mean yeah that\'s big ) but really? the only way to make him a good protagonist is to make his character have many flaws and relatable i guess. He\'s adaptable, competent , op and many more characteristic of an self insert harem protagonist . Overall, he suk . idk if this is a good analogy but whatever, kyouya is basically where u completed a game and it showed that u got a bad ending and u remembered that there was a choice to either have a gun or a knife but u chose a knife instead. Usually, when a player completed the game, they will be given the ability to go back to a certain checkpoint or mission to redo or to try differently from what the player initially did and also the player will have all the abilities unlocked for them to use . Essentially, I\'m saying kyouya is op because all he had to do is to choose art college and boom he have a \'perfect\' life. All im saying is this show doesnt need time travel because in ep 9, where he got sent to the future by keiko, he suddenly able to do his job just like that without any confusion abt what he\'s got to do or anything, like the dude just stupid op. What was the point of the time travel? and mind u this dude only been in college for 2 semester and a half, i know he have experiences in the og timeline but come on. Im just gonna say that he\'s too lazy to find another job when he was 28 and then wuss like a little puss talking abt i wanna redo my life just to have a better future.3. RomanceI love romance story, i adore it but i have to say Mal should remove the romance tag for this anime, literally zero romance happened in this anime other than the kiss. Throughout the series, i dont see Kyouya have any sort of romantic feeling for all the girls that he met and he even said it. Literally, the decision to make aki and kyouya married was retarded, like there was never a proper build up or development in the romance department for aki and kyouya to even justified that they are married. Also, why do they ended ep 5 with a kiss and then the next ep not addressing anything abt that kiss? im sorry if a girl just kiss me, i will definitely ask her \'why did u do that?\' and also what was the point of letting nanako witnessing the kiss? i though there will be a drama or something. i guess thats one more thing abt this show that makes it bad. Overall, the romance in this show serve nothing to the plot other than to please the 14 yrs old seeing their waifu end up with the mc. Zero progression in the romance part and stupid attempt to make as if nanako had a chance with the mc. Also, continue on the kiss scene was dumb because there is no real buildup to the romance scenes or context, (for God’s sake the main characters doesn’t even likes her other than admiring her art) which makes the scenes unsatisfying and coming out of nowhere. Dont watch this show for the romance because u will get none of it.4. Time travel and keikoThe time travel concept in this show is barely explored in any imaginable way and feels like it\'s only a plot device to works conveniently in favor of the protagonist. Questions like: ""Why Kyouya? Why not Kawasegawa? Or Tsurayuki?"" , ""Who or what triggers the time travel?"" and ""Is a deep-seethed regret the prerequisite to be a candidate for time travel?"" never occurs to the mc and its actually ridiculous considering how this anime trying to be realistic. Throughout the series, we never learn anything abt how kyouya got back in time and also why \'they\' choose kyouya?,Questions like these, haven\'t been answered after 11 episodes, and if the final episode doesn\'t give us anything about the time travel, then it is sufficient enough to conclude that it\'s nothing more than plot device and it\'s just there to ""satisfy"" Kyouya\'s desire for change. the explanation is just stupid, how can a man got travel back in time ( he even said before that it was impossible ) and not even bother to question abt this phenomenon that is happening to him ( or at the very least tell us that he did try to investigate but didnt get anything that is useful but in the mean time, he just need to move forward) and even the second time, he didnt do nothing to question abt keiko sudden appearance and as well as how he got back in the future instead he just live his normal life just like that and able to adapt to his new job . He\'s a 28 yrs old man, shouldnt he know that someone\'s future will change if he interrupts someone\'s past but i guess he didnt care that he got back in time. Also, why did his goal change? he goes from i wish i can go back in time and choose art instead to he\'s here to help the platinum gen, whatttt???? im so confused to his logic, look i guess he\'s a bit retarded that he took awhile to realise that aki was a member of the platinum gen but like shouldnt u be thinking that they will become famous in the future so their problems will be sorted by their own but instead he tries to help everyone. I mean i guess it cant be helped that he had to meddle their problems but shouldnt he strategies abt how to approach this guys problems and not to disrupt their future that much. Now, he got to face the consequences that he didnt meant to do and as well was somewhat innocent from the first day since he got sent back in time out of nowhere. Look, no one is asking for the time travel to be amazingly explained or whatever but pls make it logical instead of this crap. if the show make the mc awares abt the time travel and as well make the mc\'c personality less generic, i would accept that but yeah instead we got this crap. Questions need to be answered here, who\'s keiko and why?oh well kyouya dont care at all since his look in the last ep just says it all that this show dont care if they use the time travel as a plot device.  No normal human being will react like that .In conclusion, ill say that this show couldve been better if the EXECUTION was done right and if they make this a 24 ep show and make the pacing be decent. Truth be told, this is a mediocre series and couldnt understand the positives vibe that it gets. I can see what the author is trying to tell but it turns out to be a huge disappointment, the Ln is probably better but idk. Overall, idm u enjoy this show but pls stop saying its great or a masterpiece or even good because its sure is not, it had some good moments and message but its fall flat by the piss poor pacing and story telling. If u want to watch some deep stuff, better off watching sakura sou or ping pong or even 3-gatsu no Lion than this garbage, at the very least sorata is a way better mc than this self insert mc. If u want to watch ppl make games, just watch saekano, they have better fanservices than this one. Thank god, its over. the point of kyouya going back in time other than use it as plot device?.

This duration is the same as watching 2 episodes of TV anime at once.

Here you can be inspired because you see the lives of students/campus life who take their studies to explore the sciences to hone their talents. Here you also learn, what is the fate of someone who is serious about studying, or who is too serious, or who is always relaxed, even lazy.  This will affect the quality of your work later.

This anime is a romantic genre, even so, the struggle to achieve that success is playing this anime project. How can they make a movie, How to organize a discussion, and also how they do team work. In a work team, anyone in your team must have experienced failure, and some have experienced success. When there is a problem in the team, each member must have a different path.  Giving up is not a solution, and if you have a problem with your work team, try to be more open to your fellow members, then think of ways to overcome the problem.If you can\'t get up on your own, ask someone else for help.If we are already destroyed by our own mistakes, then wait for the right time to get back up.If you can\'t invite other people, walk side by side with them.Everyone have weaknesses.It all depends on how we see it.That is called a ""Life!""Yeah, it just nonsense', 'Basically RE life,  but better . I will not lie, many people after reading the synopsis and watching the first few episodes will be immediately reminded of Relife which is why i will write first about why this seems to be a better take of improvement and character development than the very famous relife.We had two 1 hour debut this season one was the highly anticipated tantei wa mo shinderu and the other was this one ,No one had any high expectations of bokutachi no remake but the 1 hour special definitely was a great decisionSO why do ithink this is better than...Re life which is already a very amazing anime?The one hour special is the answer.1)The first episode makes it very clear of the current situation if the MC and where he currently stands and what he does etc and why he is here. The whole problem was caused  since he refused to be admitted into art school even after being accepted after highschool, in Relife we know he is a failure but not why .2)We are also  shown that the MC always did try to improve his situation , yes this is a big factor and certainly makes him likeable in relife the MC just cries about his situation and we never shown did he even try to improve his life ?This show has production values that might make movies fall to shame since the art is beautiful and gorgeous .the sakura scene at the end of episode 1 was truly magical , the voice acting is great with the exception of the loli voice of the female lead who is supposed to be in her 20s ,the story is nice with a good take on redemption which i cannot see failing (unless the erased  cocblockending is repeated ;/)Just watch the first episode and your sure to fall in love with this one Re life which is already a very amazing anime?The one hour special is the answer.1)The first episode makes it very clear of the current situation if the MC and where he currently stands and what he does etc and why he is here.

You have anime like Steins Gate, Re:Zero, or Tokyo Revengers managing to add something new to the concept, and while not everyone might like them most people should agree that they’re all at least somewhat unique in their own way.And then you have Bokutachi No Remake give its spin on time travel, following our main character after he gets sent back in time and decides to… enter an art college?The story kicks off with the painfully generic main character, Kyouya, struggling to...find a stable job in his current life. When life is looking worse than it’s ever been, he makes a wish to get sent back in time, and would you believe it? His wish conveniently comes true! Apparently, the only other possible choice he has to fix up his life is to enter an art college so that’s exactly what he does. I’m not sure why he doesn’t become financially stable using his knowledge of the future to win some bets or lotteries, but each to their own I suppose. Once he settles into the college, he enjoys making films and various pieces of media while being surrounded by his own harem, what a lucky guy. The aspect of time travel barely phases him, and rather than try to figure out the source of it he simply enjoys life as a 28-year-old in an 18-year-old’s body. Oh boy, it sure is great getting to project myself onto another pathetic main character who’s been put into a situation that others would only dream of.Mr. Self Insert isn’t without his flaws, however. You see, he’s too amazing for his own good, often negatively influencing other people’s lives by simply being too perfect. This is a major issue that Kyouya is forced to overcome with each episode. Maybe his genius is from his extra 10 years of experience, or perhaps he’s naturally talented and wasn’t given the correct opportunity in his previous life. Either way there is very little attempt made to justify his amazingness, and you just have to accept that he is and always will be an incredible human being. They’ve made sure to give him the same character design as every other light novel character to ever exist, so you will have no problem imagining his experiences as your own.“After all, no matter how amazing an individual is, they’re less interesting without some kind of flaw.” This is a quote taken right from the very first episode, and it is absolutely hilarious to look back on after having watched all 12 episodes. It dares explain basic storytelling techniques straight to the audience and then completely butcher it in practice. To state out loud the character needs flaws, then to proceed to write a main character without any, is one of the funniest ways I’ve ever seen an anime screw itself over. It can’t go an episode without contradicting itself in some way and it’s almost impressive.But I don’t wanna bully the poor main character too much, as there are plenty of other characters to focus on as well. There’s a writer, a voice actor/singer, and an artist all living with Main Character-kun. They aren’t great, but when compared to the main character they are a massive improvement in terms of writing. They help provide a good insight into the struggles and hardships of various artistic industries while actually adding a sense of life to the anime. Granted it’s not perfect, but I can appreciate how the series at least attempts to show some of the struggles of real-life through the characters. An artist might lose their motivation to draw, a writer might be overwhelmed by how hard it is to become truly successful, or a singer might lack the self-confidence to truly work for their dream. These are all shown to some extent through the character decisions and various pieces of dialogue. It isn’t great, but at least there is something there in terms of character depth.For a show that likes to ramble on about media and storytelling it really sucks at both. There’s one scene in the first episode where we get to listen to a characters explain some screenplay techniques. This was more for the sake of showcasing the characters’ intelligence than anything but seeing as the anime went out of its way to spend five minutes explaining it, I might as well see how well it goes when paired against its own advice. It brings up the idea of ‘complications,’ an unpredictable turn in a story that leads to the protagonist failing. In this anime, however, you’ll find that the ‘unpredictable turns’ are simply terrible. The twists make no sense as this anime is pack-full of plot contrivances. Our protagonist never truly fails, and small inconveniences are overdramatised to the point where they just looks silly. This anime will try to make you believe that minor incidents are huge failures when they’re obviously not. Also, in case you’ve forgotten the main character is a generic self-insert, and no one wants to insert themselves into a guy who fails at something. Seeing him effortlessly complete every task that comes his way is anything but a complication, and no, I don’t count the fact that he is too good at everything for his own good to be one.Scenes will often feel incredibly forced, with numerous out-of-character moments that only exist to make something is happening on screen. There is never any sense of fluidness in the writing, and the entire anime is filled to the brim with ridiculous plot conveniences. The main character makes progression in a relationship? The love rival appears. The protagonist needs help doing something? Another character will appear with exactly what he needs. Multiple characters will act different to their usual selves in some scenes for the sake of the plot, completely ruining everything that had been built up about them previously. It’s lousy writing down to the core, and everything about it feels forced.The art and animation are subpar for the most part. A decent amount of effort was put into making sure the girls were cute enough, then the bare minimum was done for everything else. Character expressions are surprisingly well done for the most part and you’re able to get a good understanding of the characters through them. The soundtrack was forgettable, and I still can hardly remember anything about the opening or ending after having finished the anime.Bokutachi no Remake had the comedy tag when it began airing, but by the end was labeled as a drama with touches of supernatural and romance. Childish ideas are hidden behind failed attempts at a dramatic telling of a situation many people may wish to find themselves in. Because of this, this anime will never be anything more than another typical and forgettable light novel adaptation full of plot conveniences and lackluster characters. There are much better time travel anime out there, and there are other anime that manage to achieve what this anime attempts at a much better standard.

All of the missed opportunities, people you never met, mistakes you made. If you could change the years you regret the most, would you?Imagine the most generic school harem anime possible: Remake Our Life is what comes to mind. Forgettable character designs, monotonous background music, and archetypal love interests compete for the everyman protagonist. Kyoya, the bland harem hero, is a failed adult who gets a second chance to relive his college years. After getting fired from his dream job at a game company, he mourns his...wasted youth. He regrets not enrolling in an art university, then falls asleep. Upon opening his eyes, he is ten years in the past and instantly decides to go to college. Once enrolled, he immediately recognizes his roommates as successful artists from the future. His writing skills impress everyone—because he accidentally stole the idea from his only male roommate. Though he regrets benefitting from his friend\'s failure, he still reaps the rewards. Some of the rewards include ladies who quickly become attracted to him for his generic looks and filmmaking talents.He is where he belongs: A place where people recognize his talent. Kyoya embodies the everyman trope prominently utilized in isekai light novel adaptations. A businessman in a dead-end job living with his parents, he yearns to relive his youth. Suddenly, an unknown power transports him to the past! He takes this monumental once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to... enroll in college. Now he can become the man he has always wanted, an artist and professional womanizer. Kyoya lacks discernable characteristics or individuality, making it easy for you to project onto him.All the girls surrounding Kyoya are the same height and body type to be as marketable as possible. For this reason, I will refer to them by hair color first. Though three out of five of the main cast are women, their dialogue is mainly with Kyoya or about him. As the poster art suggests, this is a harem anime dressed up with melodrama. You\'ll see plenty of fanservice at inconvenient times, but they tone it down after the first couple of episodes. Shinoaki, the blue-haired girl, is a sleepy and airheaded artist. Her character arc begins and ends in one episode—she questions her talent, and Kyoya quickly reassures her that\'s not the case. This moment sparks a flame of love. There is no romantic progression or chemistry between the two, which just happens to us. We are helpless passengers aboard this slowly derailing train. The red-haired girl, Kawasegawa, is a little too confrontational for her own good. Frequently she harshly criticizes people for justified reasons; however, the direction frames it as a bad personality trait. Suddenly dark music plays or cuts out altogether, and they use close-ups to emphasize the anxiety she causes. She works through this flaw—which being critical isn\'t really a flaw at all, and that\'s the crux of her arc. She has a cute side that she only shows to the main character. Is it love? Watch to find out. Her primary purpose in Kyoya\'s story is to provide motivational speeches and assist him on art projects.Nanako, the blonde girl, is stern and has character development—reserved for the show\'s first half. She becomes irrelevant afterward. As an actress conflicted about her future, she deals with self-doubt and insecurities. Although her turmoil seems exaggerated with melodramatic dialogue, she is more compelling than the rest. She, too, has a cute side that she only shows to the main character. Their romantic development is gradual rather than forced. If only Kyoya had the character depth to compliment hers. The dialogue, especially involving Nanako, is awful: they utilize her for fanservice and to fawn over Kyoya, only to sideline her shortly after that.What the hell kind of friend are you? There\'s a recurring problem here: Kyoya assumes the wants and needs of his friends without actually asking them first, and the story rewards him for this. At best, it\'s presumptuous to believe you could solve someone\'s issues for them. Though the show pays lip service to this idea, it is ultimately a mistake it continues to make until the end. I wouldn\'t say I like the term ""self-insert"" because it implies the author wrote himself in the story as the main character. Instead, Kyoya is an avatar for the audience. He is an everyman—generic in every sense for us to project onto him. We can live our fantasies like a hot college film student surrounded by single attractive women. And no judgment if you want an ego boost. The ladies vie for his attention; one girl even says the classic ""I won\'t lose"" line, implying she\'ll never give up on her love. The other men are, of course, perverts, unattractive, or lacking the talent Kyoya possesses. There are a couple more recurring faces that leave little impression.Attempts at self-aware humor fall flat without follow-up. Kyoya\'s friend says, ""All of those girls, for no reason, are in love with me as soon as the game begins!"" He shrugs it off, and then things move on to normal. Cue the fan service and girls fighting over him despite being thoroughly mediocre. Jabbing at the cringe-worthy nature of dating simulators is funny but woefully misguided here. Remake engages in the same harem cliches it mocks, and in the words of a better writer than me: ""Self-awareness does not absolve anybody of anything."" We\'ve been aware of a show\'s problem, but there\'s no subversion. Shinoaki continues to dizzily follow Kyoya around like a lost puppy, and Nakano pines for him in the background. Tsurayuki, the aforementioned male roommate, has the unfortunate role of getting pushed around by our hero. Kyoya does his best to apologize and explain, and it works to keep him in order. Similar to the ladies, his insecurities manifest as imposter syndrome. He worries he\'s not contributing enough—and this is an intriguing theme that Remake cuts short.The art is utterly forgettable—generic character designs, bland background art, and minimal animation. Of course, dynamic artwork is unneeded for a shallow harem LN adaptation primarily made up of tedious conversations. The music adds insignificant emotional impact because it\'s recycled repeatedly—kind of like a typical visual novel soundtrack. The catchy opening track sung by the leading ladies somewhat makes up for the lackluster OST. The outro is mellow and relaxing, shown on a movie reel to reference the film they created. Remake suffers from coming off as insincere in its portrayal of artists at times; during the film screenings, characters tell us how great the short films were, but the viewer rarely sees them. When we\'re supposed to believe these are super talented artists, you have to prove it. There were moments it did prove to us their talents, such as with Nanako\'s singing and Shinoaki\'s art, which fulfilled this potential.In the ninth episode, the show evolves. It threw a curveball to grab our attention as it sunk into mediocre melodrama. The author finally used the time travel mechanic, though it was ultimately in vain. He attempts to confront the implausible fantasy premise of the show with a Butterfly Effect sort of twist. Credit where credit is due, Kyoya develops ever so slightly, but not enough to be relatable. The dialogue primarily consists of narration to catch us up on new information—similar to a recap episode. And you have to admit, recap episodes are pretty dull. Despite the balls it took to make drastic changes so late, this was ultimately the weakest part of the show. There needed to be a practical reason for forgoing the character development of the first eight episodes.Ten years ago, the tacked-on-time travel premise would\'ve been inventive. Today it\'s derivative. Better anime have done this premise before Steins;Gate, ReLife, Orange, and even Erased. Ironically, the main character travels to the past to relive his youth, never realizing our experiences—even the cringe-worthy ones—make us who we are today. Flawed, imperfect, but unmistakably ourselves. Like Kyoya\'s memories, mistakes, and poor choices, Remake Our Life should\'ve stayed in the past. wasted youth. He regrets not enrolling in an art university, then falls asleep. Upon opening his eyes, he is ten years in the past and instantly decides to go to college.

Flawed, imperfect, but unmistakably ourselves. Like Kyoya\'s memories, mistakes, and poor choices, Remake Our Life should\'ve stayed in the past.', ""I first want to clear out some discrepancies that seemed to have arisen with this anime.1. I was told this anime is similar to ReLife. Because of how doltish and clueless ReLife is, Remake Our Life is *ONLY* similar to it in the time travelling aspect. You can ask for a link to my Anilist review to understand how stupid ReLife is.2. This anime is also said to be similar to Sakurasou, though this is a bit more warped comparison. The two main girls are both artists, but other than that, this anime is similar to Toradora, Bunny Girl Senpai, Golden Time, quite literally every...romance with drama you can think of. Of course, it just has its own little twist to give it its own name.Now onto the analysis.Remake Our Life isn't anything new to the mix of romance anime, though in saying this, it works at both ends. It's not an enlightening piece of media one may never see the likes of again, but it also isn't so abysmal you'd lose faith in humanity. It's just like everything else, as I have pointed out. So honestly, there is no real reason to work my way through the narrative/characters and what have you because in what I would imagine is a largely popular genre, people will already understand what the ridiculously consistent logic will have to say about this anime, that is, basically everything you've seen and known thus far.The only thing I can really talk about is the gimmicks and how effective they are at making this anime physically able to stand by itself. I came out of this anime not actually having too much memory as to what differentiates this from everything else, sure there was the time mechanic, but that wasn't explored too much in this anime unfortunately and seemed to be a back-of-the-head thought brought up every now and then. Self-aware note here, I am literally trying to think of other aspects that would otherwise make this anime more independent and nothing comes to mind. The only thing I can praise is Hashiba's leadership which seems to be non-existent with our young anime protagonist, at least most are have self-competence.The audiovisuals here basically fall under the same o' so tyrannical order romance anime kneel down to, so I don't need to go over that, but the character designs are nice here for originality, though one could easily superimpose that with any other anime and get some similarities. There was an attempt at least.I am not sure what I was expecting from light novel adaptation #40904, but I thought this would turn out to be a lot more different than I anticipated. I guess I enjoyed it, I guess everyone will enjoy it, I mean, even if generic (which doesn't mean bad), who doesn't like a good romance anime? But this anime seems to get a lot more traction than I thought was possible, and there were tropes here that have gone past the expiry date of unique quality, which this anime doesn't seem to realise. At the end of the day, it's a nice story, but there is nothing here to suggest it is a big deal. I'd recommend it to all, looking for something to watch when you have nothing else. But there is better out there in terms of high school stories.I suppose I will give out a few:Kimi ni Todoke - elaborates on its bliss; how ecstasy feelsHigh Score Girl - romance in the gaming world and how one has to fix that in with realityBeastars - a great idea with a great presentation of social order in school (Warning: 2nd Season goes to shit towards the end, imo at least) romance with drama you can think of. Of course, it just has its own little twist to give it its own name.Now onto the analysis.Remake Our Life isn't anything new to the mix of romance anime, though in saying this, it works at both ends. It's not an enlightening piece of media one may never see the likes of again, but it also isn't so abysmal you'd lose faith in humanity. It's just like everything else, as I have pointed out. So honestly, there is no real reason to work my way through the narrative/characters and what have you because in what I would imagine is a largely popular genre, people will already understand what the ridiculously consistent logic will have to say about this anime, that is, basically everything you've seen and known thus far.The only thing I can really talk about is the gimmicks and how effective they are at making this anime physically able to stand by itself. I came out of this anime not actually having too much memory as to what differentiates this from everything else, sure there was the time mechanic, but that wasn't explored too much in this anime unfortunately and seemed to be a back-of-the-head thought brought up every now and then. Self-aware note here, I am literally trying to think of other aspects that would otherwise make this anime more independent and nothing comes to mind. The only thing I can praise is Hashiba's leadership which seems to be non-existent with our young anime protagonist, at least most are have self-competence.The audiovisuals here basically fall under the same o' so tyrannical order romance anime kneel down to, so I don't need to go over that, but the character designs are nice here for originality, though one could easily superimpose that with any other anime and get some similarities. There was an attempt at least.I am not sure what I was expecting from light novel adaptation #40904, but I thought this would turn out to be a lot more different than I anticipated. I guess I enjoyed it, I guess everyone will enjoy it, I mean, even if generic (which doesn't mean bad), who doesn't like a good romance anime? But this anime seems to get a lot more traction than I thought was possible, and there were tropes here that have gone past the expiry date of unique quality, which this anime doesn't seem to realise.

Before I lose you all, allow me to explain: It starts off strong, undeniably.  It has a slow burning, but well written 50 minute first episode to provide the setup for the MC Kyoya, and the quality is good for the next two episodes.  From there, however, is all downhill.This show has ZERO sense of pacing, scenes fly by and any conflict that feels like it should last for longer than an episode to develop characters who we should become very acquainted with are just dealt with...in a matter of a few lines.  It's a show that seems almost disrespectful of its side characters, we never understand them or their motivations.  In fact, it’s even worse when they become completely irrelevant by the time you get to the last hurdle of the show — they proved to have no impact whatsoever.Ironically for a show about creative arts students, it lacks creativity.  The characters almost never do anything without Kyoya getting involved, and for a series with a teacher who seems to be teaching her students to think outside the box (aka like the stereotypical beret wearing art students), this show falls sinfully back on very tacky visual 'symbolism' that miss the mark entirely.  The saddest part being that this show looks SO GOOD but is let down by thoroughly weak writing with many, MANY, plot holes and poorly written moments.  Interestingly, some of what I mentioned IS something that is addressed, but good grief it's executed so horribly that it renders it pointless.  Even then it explores a twist 10 episodes in the making with shocking levels of poorly thought out conversations, character logic, and a situation that’s hardly given the room to breathe. in a matter of a few lines.

I have been interested for a few years in the art of photography and cinema. I thought that the setting of the show was written for me. The main character, Kyouya , after failing his first video game industry job is thrown back in time 10 years into the past. He then decides to enroll in an art college. The show has promising themes like regret , finding a creative voice or the struggle of creating art etc... Heck, maybe along the way...we will learn more about technical aspects of art. Sadly, the show wasted its premise.The show doesn't really use the premise to its advantage. The main character doesn't have a goal beyond doing well in school and he doesn't have anything that he misses or needs. That is how the show wasted the potential themes that it set up in the first episode. And in addition creates a boring character.In addition, sequences in the show flash by in an instance which result in a feeling that things are just happening without any pay off. For example, in one of the episodes, “screenplay dude” gets the wrong camera for the filming. The solution is that the main character learns how to photograph. There are no scenes where the kyuya learns how to photograph or makes any mistakes. We aren't taught the basics of photography. We are only shown him getting dericons over the phone. And that is the only thing that the show does with the problem, other than more set up. There is no real depth/ build up /consequence to any of the problems. When it does try to raise an interesting personal problem, because of the pacing, the solutions feel unearned.There is no reason why the story had to be set in the past. The main character could have just gone to college, found a new job related to video games or made his own game. The only reason was to make a power fantasy.I think the show is somewhat self aware about it. Episode 6(10:00-10:55 and 15:30-16:00) points out good meta points about the show. The fact that the main girls are in love with Kyouya for no reason and that nobody talks in real life like anime characters and that school romance anime sells well.By sending Kyouya to the past he gets some kind of superpower. He is able to know what is successful and use that knowledge to his advantage. I wouldn't mind this superpower if they did something interesting with it but they only use it as a part of the power fantasy.  I think that the show wants us to be aware that he is from the future but at the same time not. Because if you think about it you would realize that he is dating a girl that is ten years younger than he is. we will learn more about technical aspects of art.

Those feelings are intensified by the present times, constantly we are reminded that the path that we took could have been different by people that are successful in their fields, and even in success the sentiment is still there. Letting time go is nothing but a sacrifice that we do over our own sense of satisfaction, the future is so uncertain that the anxiety that comes with our actions is constantly there, looking at us like a tiger...in the woods. Bokutachi no Remake is an attack to those remarks, to understand the consequences of the paths that we take and to explain to ourselves a final thought, that every action has its consequence.The anime presents itself with such goal in mind. All the events that are presented have such goal in mind. The message is translucent, transparent, and somehow strong. Our lives are subject to every single action, the sensation of failing is nothing but nutritive to our future goals, a learning aspect that we should all face once, and that whatever path we take will have consequences on those who are besides us. Nothing that we do will work in vacuum, and to obsess with the what ifs is unhealthy, because if we put ourselves in such situation the branches of the destiny would completely differ from our beloved dream.It is then a question of how you present such message, such relatable perception that is strongly human, likely a fate that we all must meet once in our life. The problem is that this anime doesn’t compromise itself with anything, it leaves itself to the path of the generic trails and bastardized troupes that we have all seen before. The message is obscured by the endless competition of who is the best girl, obscured by the extremely shallow and childish exposition of those issues that the main character is meant to tackle.The feeling that is left from this anime is that the message was interfered by those desires and delusions of what humanity could do. The main character, someone who is pretty much reasonable, psychologically human and leave a huge impression in terms of emotional tact is set in a world filled with superficial issues and lacking the action and consequence of human relations. All events are presented in a grotesque fashion, a bitter sense of delusion and ignorance of how everything works, with comedy levels of resolutions.This lack of compromise could have been solved easily by not exposing itself to the ignorance, or to investigate better and deliver a more credible execution. Like a short circuit in a ride, the moment we are hit with the unnecessary harem undertones and the lack of knowledge get us out of the whole experience, if you are thinking while watching this, of course. The almost pathetic dialogues and exposition, the childish solutions to everything, violates the clear principle of making something believable. It is an interference.The most frustrating aspect is that it could have been prevented by focusing itself in the relationships between the characters, to obviate the boring aspects of the show and create a setting that leaves us in a scenario full of life and humanity. The most frustrating aspect is that there is a clear lack of love and interest towards creating a beautiful setting with an insight of the frontiers of human craft, and instead shows a superficial otaku perspective to just play forward into its intended message.Bokutachi no Remake is nothing but a watered down downright pandering anime that leaves a trail of delusion and lack of real touch, the plastic feeling mixed with the pathetic intents to appeal the lower common denominator leaves the whole message in the dark after a boring set of events that are downright absurd to watch at.

As long as you approach it from that mindset and not one of an anime being about actually relevant and deep messages. In fact, I’d probably give it a 3-4 if it was just that: a tropey, fanservice-heavy rom-com. If you wanted to watch this series to learn about how we shouldn’t take the opportunities we have now for granted, you’ve come to the wrong anime.While Bokutachi no Remake sets out with a strong first episode that aligns with what you think the core theme would be, it quickly flips...to a rom-com instead. We have been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amok, and flat-out deceived by this show.To keep it as short as possible, Bokutachi no Remake is a plastic attempt at its message about redemptions and seizing opportunities in life. Romance is randomly brought up and then dropped and ignored in the next episode with no further explanation. Every instance of drama we get isn’t natural but rather forced into the story for the sake of ticking off a box about “deep themes”. And the reason is that all the characters are so shallow and underdeveloped, it’s hard to find yourself genuinely rooting for them.Potential spoilers ahead.Let’s take Nanako’s singing arc for example. We get no background exposure to Nanako, hell, we don’t even know shit about her past or her character outside of a monologued backstory, having big boobs and going on a karaoke date once with Kyouya. But all of a sudden, we’re supposed to sympathize with and cheer for her decision to fearlessly confront her talent and get serious about it, even if it means she might have to swallow the bitter pill of failing despite putting in her best effort. Don’t get me wrong, this is a great message to preach and something I’ve been trying to fix myself for god knows how long. But hamfisting it into a story in the form of a character with 0 development until now is not the way to do it.Also, after EP 5, I thought we’d be getting a generic romance drama arc but instead, that was a blue ball too and everything that happened at the end of EP 5 and beginning of EP 6 just seemed to vanish from all the characters’ minds. Only for this problem to return in EP 7. Double-sike. It’s as if the writer can’t decide between making this an anime about the work behind creating commercial media or a harem rom-com with over-the-top fanservice.Outside of Nanako, the other characters are as shallow as you’ll get. You have the Mr. Perfect MC who can do no wrong and pulls all the chicks (self-insert), the big-boobed outgoing lady, the big-boobed tsundere, the big-boobed imouto template, the big-boobed childhood friend… Hmm, is it me or is there a weird trend going on with these female characters? I thought this was going to be a series about how we should get our act together now and pursue our goals but instead, I’m attending Booba Harem Girls 101. It’s quite ironic how an anime that’s supposed to be about the trials and challenges of creating critically acclaimed artistic media falls so short of the very teachings it preaches, that it has to resort to waifus and heavy fanservice for content.Honestly, I wouldn’t mind as much if this was a harem rom-com type anime since I could write off the poor character development (50% due to bad writing and 50% due to poor pacing) as typical of harem rom-coms. All things considered, it’s hard to even say this show did well for a completely different genre than what it was advertised as and what many were expecting.

The MC's made wrong life decisions and is suffering because of that but one afternoon, he makes an unexplained time-leap 10 years in the past. This gives him a second chance in his life to make the right decisions as he's just gonna start his university life. This is a good start for the show but here are the problems, the 'characters' of this show and their...stories.All the characters in this show feels one dimensional to me. Sure they've got their dreams, ambitions and personality traits but they are really predictable, like they just do not feel human and feels like they are following a script. It's a 'Slice of life' and I do expect realistic characters from this show but that is not the case. The main character seems to just fix others problems like he's a 'Messiah'. This is very unrealistic and just makes the show very bland and predictable like you already know in your head that he's gonna fix this particular character's issue with his talks and actions. I am pretty sure this show is gonna revolve around the main character fixing other character's lives and then he will end up in a problem of his own that he will overcome with the help and support from his friends, that will be his redemption arc.Also, the fanservice, it was really unnecessary to put all those cliché scenes. I mean, the whole direction of this show is based on clichés. It really is disappointing. stories.All the characters in this show feels one dimensional to me.

That is, to millennials and Gen Z-ers who are all regretting their life/career choices amid a global pandemic, and social upheaval and wishing they can go back in time and have a redo.It\'s not the first anime or *sigh* light novel of its premise and it certainly won\'t be the last so, what makes Remake so special? Well... not a lot. After being down on his luck Kyouya Hashiba somehow manages to go back 10 years into the past to attend a fancy...arts university instead of acquiring the actual useful degree that he achieved so he can more easily break into the game industry. Whilst there he discovers that he will be house-sharing with 3 (yet to be) famous artists in their field, one of which is his favourite artist from his period.Now the first episode is a lengthy 50 minutes long which put me off watching for a while, but I will say that the time was much better utilised than something like \'The Detective is Already Dead\' which came out in the same season (and was worse). After that you will settle into the normal 20 minutes of slice-of-life, university anime shenanigans.The characters are... fine. Honestly, there is nothing to them that you haven\'t seen before. Kyouya is a boring, flat, harem protagonist (which he really shouldn\'t be considering he is mentally 28), but has enough going for him to not be a total audience insert character. Aki Shino is a moé blob, Nanako Kogure is a ganki girl and Tsurayuki Rokuonji is the brash, but cool best friend type character.

University is a completely different experience compared to high school, but these characters simply do not reflect that kind of maturity. The wish fulfilment is strong in this one, but unlike thrash harem or good, horny parody which knows what it is and isn\'t taking itself too seriously as a show, Remake My Life takes itself VERY seriously with its premise and these pandering, wish fulfilment moments start to ruin our view of the characters and actively takes away from the good moments the show has to offer.When Kyouya wakes up in his room to find Aki asleep with her face in his crotch (they hadn\'t even met yet) and then wakes up to drink day-old yoghurt out of the fridge or when Nanako walks into the room to shout at her friends only to say ""What do you mean I\'m not wearing clothes? *looks down* AhAHHH!""(she\'s 18 -20 by the way) it comes off as the author wants to eat his cake and fuck it too with one hand holding his pen and the other holding his cock.Overall Remake My Life is Mediocre/fine. There are some great moments which did keep me coming back week after week, but eventually, it just felt like another high school, slice-of-life, wish fulfilment anime which I\'ve watched a million times before with the caveat being that it\'s set in a university. Now apparently a huge twist has happened towards the end of the season, but I\'m not particularly invested enough to go back and see what it is. I can see why people are raving about this anime, but for me, there are better things to watch.... look all I\'m saying is Aki should know what a blowjob is.5/10 Mediocre arts university instead of acquiring the actual useful degree that he achieved so he can more easily break into the game industry. Whilst there he discovers that he will be house-sharing with 3 (yet to be) famous artists in their field, one of which is his favourite artist from his period.Now the first episode is a lengthy 50 minutes long which put me off watching for a while, but I will say that the time was much better utilised than something like \'The Detective is Already Dead\' which came out in the same season (and was worse). After that you will settle into the normal 20 minutes of slice-of-life, university anime shenanigans.The characters are... fine. Honestly, there is nothing to them that you haven\'t seen before. Kyouya is a boring, flat, harem protagonist (which he really shouldn\'t be considering he is mentally 28), but has enough going for him to not be a total audience insert character. Aki Shino is a moé blob, Nanako Kogure is a ganki girl and Tsurayuki Rokuonji is the brash, but cool best friend type character.

If you don't go in expecting any surprises in the story or nuanced characters, there is some fun to be had.  That said, if you can afford to be picky, it's probably worth looking somewhere else for better quality story telling.Now, as for in-depth discussion, I'm going to focus solely on the characters and their actions/motivations as that's where the series gains its hopelessly average badge.  The art style and sound design are both...standard fare, being serviceable enough to not be a distraction when viewing.  As with the plot, there's really nothing worth discussing as it's your run of the mill isekai/reborn/redo storyline.  While its nothing new, it's not something that will inherently make or break the anime.  My frustration (or rather indifference) lies with the characters and their bland/trope filled adventures.One of the main issues with the show thus far is that at no point does the MC Kyouya do or say anything to distinguish himself as a character beyond being 'nice' and 'trying really hard', which isn't a problem unique to this series alone (there's a massive pile of shows that suffer from boring MC syndrome) but it still needs to be pointed out as this is the character through which we experience the narrative.  We are presented someone who has been given, by some act of divinity, a second chance at life, yet by the second episode he is nearly indistinguishable from any other ordinary college student.  Our MC has zero reaction nor any thoughts regarding his miraculous new lease on life.  No questions are raised as to how or why this has taken place.  There is no shock, chaos, or disarray as he experiences this.  Kyouya simply accepts the situation unquestionably and slides into his new role as a positive, bubbling college freshmen who attends every lecture and acts as a model friend/support for his new roommates.  Were the story not explicitly shown, we as viewers would have no idea as to the nature of this character and the fact that his mind is actually that of a 28 year old man.  There is nothing interesting here; this character is completely devoid of any trait that might make him stand out despite undergoing such a shockingly profound event.Similar anime have at least had the foresight to have their MCs take risks, make bold moves on potential love interests, or possibly exploit their knowledge of the future for personal gain - it doesn't matter what but it has to be something, anything to make the character stand out and memorable.  Bokutachi no Remake offers none of this in the actions of its MC.  It actually leaves one wondering why the plot device was even used in the first place as by episode 2 the entire redo plot point is entirely irrelevant to what is happening on-screen.  Take that central setup away and what you're left with is another average to below-average slice of life college anime.It goes without saying that the other main ensemble cast of characters are similarly boring and one-dimensional.  Each one can be summarized with at most two to three adjectives that describe their entire being and subsequently outlines their entire character arc.  The three housemates that our MC meets early are only distinguishable in their respective area of talent and their archetype.  Nanako is the upbeat singer, Aki the cutesy artist, and the other dude in the house is the lazy-genius writer.  Again, nothing new nor surprising here.  Even less surprising is that after a few episodes it's blatantly obvious that every on screen female character we've spent time with has a crush on the MC.  There is not a single SOUL out there that would have glimpsed the preview featuring three cute girls and not figured this out beforehand, though that doesn't make it any less groan-worthy when it plays out as expected.As initially said, there is some enjoyment to be had here.  I myself am a sucker for most isekai and redo-type storylines even after admitting the plot actually plays very little part in the later story.

The story is very similar to ReLIFE, in that the main protagonist is at a bad point in his life. In fact, it\'s almost a direct rip off of ReLIFE. He\'s lost a career he didn\'t particularly enjoy and is filled with regret that he didn\'t pick the art school he got into instead of going into business. He\'s somehow (it\'s not explained at this point) able to travel back in time to choose the art school. Honestly, I thought the idea was intriguing, even if I dislike the ""If I just did one think differently, my...life would be perfect with no roadblocks!"" trope.The problems start almost as soon as he travels back. This show is filled with cliche after cliche. The MC has three roommates; one guy and two girls. The guy is almost immediately built up as a somewhat difficult but passionate writer. The girls? One of them is just a ""tsundere"" that wants to be an actress and the other is... an artist that the MC was obsessed with before he travelled back in time with little to no personality other than ""oh, she\'s sleepy.""Then, the MC sees yet another girl who he knew from his past life - his former boss, going to the same school as he is. Again, she\'s given little to no personality other than that she\'s a director.The female characters are almost exclusively used for fanservice that feels incredibly cliche and out of place or for ""comedy"" (which usually amounts to one of the male characters getting hit.) None of this fits the dramatic setup the show seemed to start with.I mentioned that the male characters are built up while the female characters are essentially just... there, but what\'s even more unbelievable is that they\'re somehow all dependent on the male MC. Even in the first 4 episodes, the other male character accidentally grabs a camera that can only take pictures instead of a video camera. The other three are about to give up while the MC has an idea that\'s portrayed as absolutely incredible and out of the box.

I have always been a fan of the romance genre in anime and the fact that college life is actually getting represented is something that I really appreciate. Unfortunately, it falls short it some departments.The story has one major problem, and more and more problems sprout from that. It seems to be a chronic issue when it comes to shows with the ""Oh shoot I am getting to relive my younger years!"" premise. That is of course the way that the main character...acts. Re:life did this well, Erased did it pretty poorly, and Mushoku Tensei (while being a Isekai) actually does it really well. The big problem with this show is the moment that our main character goes back in time, it feels like he almost instantly reverts to acting the age of a younger guy.The supporting cast is great. You really get to see everyone grow and mature in the show in little ways so far. life in College has a huge adjustment period and the whole ""finding yourself"" and learning to be mature aspect for the supporting cast seems to be very solid, but the main character is must less so.If you ask me, this was a big missed opportunity. Even if it was a different type of college, the emotional maturity you gain through your college years really changes you. It would have been appreciative if the character acted more mature in his social interaction and in his relationships with the rest of the cast.The highlight of this is the Ecchi scenes. The guy acts like a child whenever anything remotely sexual happens, be it waking up next to a girl, or accidently touching someone inappropriately. The kind of behavior the MC has is just childish. Handling these scenes in a mature way, such as just shutting down advances or just accepting them and not acting shy would have helped remind us that our main character was actually older. I think we can chalk this up to the studio playing the story too safe and wanting the main character to be a self-insert for younger audiences instead of a fully flushed out character.This wraps back around to my biggest issue with the story. If you were to cut out the first act and all the ""I\'m from the future"" monologues, it would have literally no impact on the story at all. The way the plot has progressed, the time travel has almost no relevance at all. As of writing, episode 6 is out, so the time travel has seemed to help with the latest problem, but even that is tangential, the solution (Of making a game set in a high school) could have easily been reached without it. It all could just be chalked up to the main character being really talented.I don\'t want it to sound like I am all negative about this though. Even with its flaws. The show is still really fun to watch and enjoy. I am definitely a sucker for the love triangle trope and I am very happy to see it here. The fact that relationships are actually developing at a decent pace is also a huge plus. I really don\'t like shows where the characters absolutely refuse to admit their feelings until the very end and it is looking like this show is going against the grain there, we got what is basically a confession from 1 girl already out and I would actually love to see a real relationship, begin, exist, and end in this series, instead of the whole series ending right after a relationship starts. I think that really banks on the show getting a second season to be truly fleshed out, but we can only hope.All in all the show is good, but the use of time travel is basically a gimmick and has no relevance to the actual plot. The relationships are solid and the character building of the supporting cast has been great, even if the main character is lacking. This gets a 6 from me because the show is ""Fine.""

But would we stop to consider the underlying implications of our decisions should we actually indulge in this once in a lifetime opportunity?Bokutachi no Remake does a really good job at outlining and narrating the story of a \'good-natured\' person when given the chance to vie for a different path, the story may not be the...most original or thought-provoking but it shares a unique spot within the anime industry as one that emphasises heavily on ""Time"". Although somewhat similar to that of ReLife, Boku Remake takes a different approach and focuses heavily on the butterfly effect. From a narrative point of view, Bokutachi no Remake may not have the most compelling story but what helps it stand tall amongst many other titles is its emphasis on a very lovable cast.Each character is well-written with their own quirks and issues they need to overcome which is indicative of that of life, we all have our challenges to face and in the face of adversity what do we do?

Confrontation or Avoidance, are two sides of the same coin, without giving too much away that would probably be the best short description I can think of.]The art consists of many cute characters and surprisingly, watching an anime including ""anime characters"" within their own world is pretty cool, and they are all aesthetically pleasing which is always a good thing. The music utilised throughout the series suited the theme of the anime really well. From critical moments, emotional scenes or even just emphasising the situation the sound team really did a fantastic job in setting the mood for the series, having all the components work hand in hand to create a lasting impression is not easy. The musical arrangement was done really well as it complements the progression of the story and the characters which is a very challenging task.Needless to say, I absolutely adored Bokutachi No Remake I\'m just a little bummed out that there isn\'t a season 2, probably a good time to pick up the light novel given how the anime ended. But what really shone brightest to me for this particular title is how great each character was written. It is not a stretch to say that, having 0 unlikeable characters in an anime that focuses heavily on character development and the interactions of said characters is a near-impossible feat. Yet Boku Remake has achieved it, which absolutely blows my mind because through the 12 episodes I was trying to find things that I could nitpick and complain about but from my perspective, there were no major flaws. Although the anime is a little slow, there were 0 wasted episodes as the story progresses logically and fluidly, although I felt like there were moments where the emotional scenes could\'ve been more intensified I have to say that the voice actors did a pretty stellar job from comedic scenes to emotional ones not only were they complementary to the mood and music but it felt very natural. I don\'t always try to factor in realism within animes but whenever they are applicable they add that extra bonus and value to make the work of art that much more enjoyable.Sure the narrative could\'ve been more interesting, the drama could\'ve been more intense or heck even the romance could\'ve taken a notch higher but overall. The depth that Bokutach no Remake brings for its audience is something that will cause many to pause and reflect upon.

However, I thought the anime didn\'t really stay strong from start to finish like ReLife did.Story - 7The story starts out really good. I LOVED the first episode. I really liked the next few episodes. But then things started to go downhill.After the first episode, I was like AWESOME, I like the MC and he gets to go back and retry life. This is gonna be a motivating anime, and I am so excited to see him redo his...life.In the couple episodes following that, I was having fun. I loved seeing our MC go through college classes, interact with his house-mates, deal with slight problems, find motivation, and work hard.From then on, I felt that the anime didn\'t really have a direction. Some episodes felt very out of place, like one where one of MC\'s housemates\' ""fiancé"" comes to visit and distracts that housemate. That is basically one whole episode and it doesn\'t do anything for the plot. It was an excuse for fanservice, but this show already had way too much. I really disliked the sexualization of female characters in this anime. It was completely unnecessary. I don\'t even know why some type of love triangle formed because I don\'t see any romantic chemistry between the characters at all.Going back to MC getting to redo his life, this anime took a bad turn. I thought I would see MC go through hardships and succeed, but instead he encounters problems and then solves them amazingly with no actual struggle. He has not gone through art school before so even though he has 10 more years of life experience, I don\'t think he should be some super smart guy who is able to solve problems. The show tries to frame it as the MC is just not giving up, but it\'s not just that. He doesn\'t give up, AND comes up with super smart and creative solutions, AND these solutions never fail. Also, it seems that when he went back in time he for some reason thought he had to work hard to prevent the people who are famous 10 years in the future from not becoming famous? I don\'t get this at all. He is running around the whole anime trying to make sure that these people, who in 10 years he know will be successful, stay successful, but he doesn\'t need to. Their fates are already fine. This is HIS redo so all MC has to do is work hard on his own, and be happy knowing his friends are going to be super successful in the future.The ending is also bleh. The first half of the last episode is okay, but then the second half doesn\'t feel like the finale of an episode, it feels like something to get you to watch season 2, but there is no season 2, so me sad.Art - 8I think the art is pretty good. I like the style. Everything is bright and nice to look at.Sound - 8The opening is nice, I really like it. Not as good as ReLife opening though. The ending is okay. The general music is calming high-school anime slide of life music, it\'s good but not amazing.Characters - 7I see that some people who rate this anime low do not like the MC. However, I really like the MC as a person. I don\'t understand what he does though, but that has more to do with how is motivation to help keep people he already knows will be successful, successful, comes out of nowhere. But I do just love him. He is so nice and caring and sweet. He is just a loveable guy.The housemates are okay. The guy doesn\'t seem that well written and is a bit confusing. The girls are okay, though they seem to be there more to serve as part of a love triangle which was unnecessary in the first place.I love the Hikawa guy, but he is barely even a supporting character. Everyone else is just kinda meh and doesn\'t have a personality.Enjoyment - 7I had really high hopes for this anime. The first part was really good and super enjoyable. It honestly just made me feel so good and I might watch the first part again if I want a fun, motivating anime. But I think after that the anime just went downhill.Overall - 7Worth the watch? I guess. But don\'t expect the amazingness of Relife. life.In the couple episodes following that, I was having fun. I loved seeing our MC go through college classes, interact with his house-mates, deal with slight problems, find motivation, and work hard.From then on, I felt that the anime didn\'t really have a direction. Some episodes felt very out of place, like one where one of MC\'s housemates\' ""fiancé"" comes to visit and distracts that housemate. That is basically one whole episode and it doesn\'t do anything for the plot. It was an excuse for fanservice, but this show already had way too much. I really disliked the sexualization of female characters in this anime. It was completely unnecessary. I don\'t even know why some type of love triangle formed because I don\'t see any romantic chemistry between the characters at all.Going back to MC getting to redo his life, this anime took a bad turn. I thought I would see MC go through hardships and succeed, but instead he encounters problems and then solves them amazingly with no actual struggle. He has not gone through art school before so even though he has 10 more years of life experience, I don\'t think he should be some super smart guy who is able to solve problems. The show tries to frame it as the MC is just not giving up, but it\'s not just that. He doesn\'t give up, AND comes up with super smart and creative solutions, AND these solutions never fail. Also, it seems that when he went back in time he for some reason thought he had to work hard to prevent the people who are famous 10 years in the future from not becoming famous? I don\'t get this at all. He is running around the whole anime trying to make sure that these people, who in 10 years he know will be successful, stay successful, but he doesn\'t need to. Their fates are already fine. This is HIS redo so all MC has to do is work hard on his own, and be happy knowing his friends are going to be super successful in the future.The ending is also bleh. The first half of the last episode is okay, but then the second half doesn\'t feel like the finale of an episode, it feels like something to get you to watch season 2, but there is no season 2, so me sad.Art - 8I think the art is pretty good. I like the style. Everything is bright and nice to look at.Sound - 8The opening is nice, I really like it. Not as good as ReLife opening though. The ending is okay. The general music is calming high-school anime slide of life music, it\'s good but not amazing.Characters - 7I see that some people who rate this anime low do not like the MC. However, I really like the MC as a person. I don\'t understand what he does though, but that has more to do with how is motivation to help keep people he already knows will be successful, successful, comes out of nowhere. But I do just love him. He is so nice and caring and sweet. He is just a loveable guy.The housemates are okay. The guy doesn\'t seem that well written and is a bit confusing. The girls are okay, though they seem to be there more to serve as part of a love triangle which was unnecessary in the first place.I love the Hikawa guy, but he is barely even a supporting character. Everyone else is just kinda meh and doesn\'t have a personality.Enjoyment - 7I had really high hopes for this anime. The first part was really good and super enjoyable. It honestly just made me feel so good and I might watch the first part again if I want a fun, motivating anime. But I think after that the anime just went downhill.Overall - 7Worth the watch? I guess. But don\'t expect the amazingness of Relife.', 'This slice of live moved 4 steps forwards but also moved 5 steps back, and one of those 5 steps back was a justifies enough reason for anyone to completely drop this anime if they wish to, and yes it has done this before already, because even tho you can\'t accept somethings, when you just ignore common sense your anime is doomed to look stupid, also it still struggles with it\'s core issues even tho it managed to fix some or try something elseSome positives:1. It showed kyouya struggle for the first time ever, and this was lacking so much for a plot based around...a new life and fixing issues2. Even tho we kinda knew already, but showing how Mr Perfect aka kyouya managed to ""destroy"" other people\'s future because he wanted to make his on future better was such a amazing take, tho sadly they didn\'t properly manage it make it truly impactful imo3. Showed how depending on someone else limits other people, he literally destroyed the platinum trio because he forced them to rely on himNow the issues:1. A guy just skipped 12 years into the future and still manages to properly do things, he can work, he can deal with his daily issues, and this was honestly the dumbest thing i ever seen, NOT A SINGLE HUMAN BEING is able to skip his whole university and his studies on the matter+his new social interactions and still manage to properly do everything, except if you\'re kyoua, because how the anime always like to imply, he\'s perfect and everyone likes to depend on him2. Which comes issue 2, even in the future people still are depending on kyouya to solve everything even whe he\'s nothing special, which is even worse, because, if he\'s Mr Perfect how the anime implied, he should\'ve 100% gotten a big job, but this anime loves logic holes for some reason3. His relationship with shinoaki is as bad as a harem romcom, they literally only had 2 screentime moments themed around their relation, being him praising her and making her happy, and the kiss, and boom that\'s enough to justify a marriage (of course we skipped time, stuff likely happened) but that\'s the issue, if you don\'t show to the audience, it will look stupid no matter what, you can\'t just expect people to accept a poorly developed relationship to the point of it turning into a marriage, unless of course you\'re the regular generic to-love ru enjoyer (and being honest even to-love ru does a better job at romance than this anime, while still being mediocre)4. The anime kinda didn\'t care at all about the characters outside of the main 4, it just showed them, and that\'s it, they just exist, we barely know enough about them, only that they\'re there because they\'re plot engines, and that\'s a issue because, if you don\'t wanna care about a character, you shouldn\'t be making said character appear ""constantly"" because you\'re implying that the character should be meaningful, while at the same time giving it no development so it feels meaninglessSo yes even tho im happy this anime managed to properly be something outside of the empty shell of a generic romcom visual novel game, with a generic perfect protagonist, a generic ""harem"" and a generic supporting male character it was going for all those episodes ago, it still is a mediocre-bad anime at best, with kawasegawa being the better developed character and even tho she\'s on the poster of the anime she gets constantly treated as a side character anyways, which is also dumbSo yeah, this SoL can have the best end of the decade, it will still be a awful anime because it doesn\'t know how to properly handle itself and removed essential content of the source material (aka most of their character and relationship development), and everyone who thinks otherwise is solely ignoring factual evidence and rating categories, in benefit of a simplistic analyses and personal preference, yes i\'m talking to all the people who are almost managing to push this into Rating 8, which is just hilarious a new life and fixing issues2.

It elaborated on a story so relatable for all of us, touching many feelings and decisions we have on our teenager/young adult life, while at the end having a great cliffhanger leading to great excitement on the many possibilities this show might have had at that point. It stood out from the other seasonal shows, bringing...similarities with great shows like Sakurasou, one which actually shows struggles we have in our teenager life - I\'ll get through that later -, or even Erased, with the possibility of changing the past. ""This is going to be a great"", is what I thought.We had the second episode. Which, although it wasn\'t as good as the first one, it established what could be a great slice of life with fun characters. And as many anime do nowadays, it brought some knowledge about a particular topic expanding on it. In this case, it was the art college experience and some of the techniques involved around the field. I think this was a nice move that made for a more interesting watching experience. So we had a show about art school, somewhat likeable characters with different sets of skills and a protagonist which had some future knowledge and would try his best with this second chance he had gotten. Done. That alone is a great sinopse and there could’ve been a good anime about it. But unfortunately after that little arc, the show TRIED following through many different paths which I think were all bad decisions that made it for an overall ok anime with a not-so-great-anymore concept.First, it chose romance… with ALLthe girls. Which wasn\'t that bad, as Sakurasou also got some of it, but in what could be an informative slife of life it all happened pretty fast, switching the whole show and focus to this part instead. And also Nanako trying to get his attentiion even though Kyouya and Aki had already announced they were dating made some pretty out of context scenes (at least for an anime with many potential interesting plot points to follow). There was also Kawasegawa, which wasn\'t an important character at all, even though they tried to make her appear as one. She was there all the time and liked him too. She kinda worked as a rival or antagonist at the beggining, but swiftly changed had her purpose changed in the show. He asked for advice to her, but honestly she didn\'t say anything special (probably because he wasn\'t in the wrong to begin with, but we\'ll get on this).Then there was the proably most important part of the show, the game making arc. The one the protagonist makes the so MALEFICENT and DESTRUCTIVE - which the show clearly points and ratifies - mistakes. I consider this to be already a somewhat bad move. To confirm an course of action or philosophy to be right or wrong, specially on a broad topic which brings many ideas and reasons for both sides makes for a less interesting story. Makes for a rather more predictable story and less involvment with the viewer overall with less theories going on. Great shows will usually show both sides of the story without saying who\'s in the right and who\'s in the wrong, letting it for viewer to think and decide on (shiki, code geass, attack on titan, death note). Now the message this show wanted to show was very clear: ""Helping people can make them dependent on always needing your help, so they WILL NOT improve on their own. Don\'t help people"". Now, while I do think this is a possibility, it is NOT up to the guy who helps to be blamed for this, and this turned to be my biggest problem with this show. In any situation, this is a decision up to the one being adviced on to think and struggle by yourself or not, specially on an art\'s course, where you are supposed to learn and improve your creative skills., can\'t you just learn with someone experienced and improve yourself? Instead you choose to turn off your brain and stop creating by thinking you are not good enough (even though Kyouya wasn\'t even in their areas AND those were only uni assignments WHICH HAD DEADLINES SO THERE WERE CHANGES TO BE MADE OTHERWISE NOTHING WOULD EVEN BE PRESENTED). And this all happened so fast, like that was the natural course of events and by him giving them criticism they\'d simply loose their creativity, specially with Tsurayuki. In his case, after some reviewal on his writing in order for them to publish a whole commercial product because he was LATE on his job he just left, like are you dumb?? Do you rather submit an unfinished project instead of curtting off some parts for something actually completed? Like, it doesn\'t even make sense to blame yourself at this point. This is literally some kind of pride with a jealousy involved of these people that instead of making them learn from the experience this guy has present, they preffer to think they are not good enough and thus not progressing and creating.And at this point we may also already connect this great experience the protagonist has with his social skills and even success with girls, bringing back to the beggining to think ""This protagonist isn\'t even relatable anymore"" lol. And it also affects how the story moves as usually when a protagonist struggles, he\'ll learn through it and develop, but in this case was the opposite: the protagonist basically already had everything. We can even question how didn\'t he have a successful career even though although not having an arts degree he still managed to be a great on what he did.And finally the last and over drama exxagerated arc. Which basically kept showing how him helping them in the past brought only disgrace to the world and then demonstrated that exhibiting an art to someone who doesn\'t want to draw will make them want to draw again. Couldn\'t have gone more boring and uninteresting. similarities with great shows like Sakurasou, one which actually shows struggles we have in our teenager life - I\'ll get through that later -, or even Erased, with the possibility of changing the past.

Couldn\'t have gone more boring and uninteresting.', '""The Embodiment of stupidity and idolization"", ""How to make OP isekai MCs look like properly written characters, ""How to fail at the romance genre"", ""How to fail at the drama genre"", ""How to fail at time traveling"", honestly you can call this anime many things but Good.Bokutachi no remake is the most souless anime i ever watched in my life. An anime about robots (Casshern Sins) manages to feel more humanized than this.Bokutachi no remake is an anime about a dude that gets a second chance to live his past and take another decision so he could change his life, yes it\'s those generic types...of time traveling animes. Funny enough the first episode manages to make you somewhat interested in the anime, but then you ask ""what\'s so bad about it"" well lemme explain through MAL rating system.Story: Starts showing Kyouya as a hardworker otaku that did a bad career choice but get\'s a second chance at working at his ""dream career"", and yes we haven\'t even reached the time travel part yet, he then properly does his job at a game industry even overworking himself to try to guarantee his chance of being accepted (it was a intership), but sadly the project fails because of reasons outside of his reach, and he gets fired, now enters the time traveling, he went back 10 years so he could do the right career choice and this is where the Good Bokutachi (episode 1) starts to fade away for the awful bokutachi (episodes from 3 to 12), even tho he changed his university choice, it doesn\'t even feel like it, kyouya can easily solve any challenge that\'s presented to him, but you could ask ""well he has 10 years of experience makes sense"" except that it doesn\'t, because it was never shown that kyouya had experience dealing with thoses challenges, it only shows like twice him using future knowledge to help with decision making and it never uses his degree on economic university as a advantage for his decisions, only showed that he\'s a hardworked, and he doesn\'t solve anything through hardwork he just knows what to do in any situation, oh i forgot to talk about that he partners with the younger version of the platinum trio, do they matter ? not really, as the anime potrays kyouya as their god saviour that carries them through any issue, making them underdeveloped and making their relataionship artificial, skipping ahead as the anime is just a replay of ""Issue>Kyouya solves it>Kyouya gets praised for it in some way"" kyouya manages to make the platinum trio never be a thing because he\'s just better than them in every way and we are forced to go to the new future, kyouya (that was praised by the platinum trio) manages to be a random worker at a game industry, because that makes sense, a guy better than a legendary trio didn\'t manage to get a relevant hierarchy but let\'s procceed, then he skipped 12 years including most of his university life and now has to work, do you think he struggled at a new job without having full knowledge on it (yes he doesn\'t have any memories of the 12 years he skipped) ? Nope, he managed to work so well that he repeated the old cycle, everyone always asked for his help, he solved the problems of all his co-workers, he even manages to do a better job than the company president itself, while skipping 12 years of knowledge on the matter, sounds dumb right? well because it is, this anime is just a huge stupid adventure of a OP MC solving all the issues the story provides without any struggle whatsoever, oh yeah and you know the whole university envyronment ? Do you think it was properly used in the story ? Nope, it got put aside around episode 5 or 6 we do not see the characters developing their skill through challenges provided by the university, as kyouya is already perfect and solves everything and all the others just ask kyouya to solve their issues, oh yeah lemme point out something else, this anime has 3 tags, slice of life, romance and drama, do you think he properly utilizes any of them? No, the slice of life tag is there for obvious reasons, its his life and we see slices of it, there\'s no ""oh yes seeing moments of his life matters for character depth/development"" no it doesn\'t, we just see his life because we are forced to, oh romance, i wanna talk about this tag, its gonna be a short talk tho, romance in bokutachi is pretty short, there\'s a episode for 2 of the girls getting interested in him because he did a single cool thing to them, like a compliment (i\'m not even joking, a girl falls in love with him because he says he likes her art, that\'s it), and you\'re curious why i mean 2 with 3 FMC? Well that\'s because kawasegawa get\'s treated as a side character through 90% of the anime, and funny enough still manages to be better written than anyone else in this series, going back to the romance, one of the girls kisses him, we enter a single episode harem romcom style with the 2 girls ""fighting"" for him, he says he has no feelings for the girl that kissed him, we skip 12 years he\'s married with that girl, done, yes, i\'m done, that\'s all the romance this anime has, it\'s like 2 episodes max focusing on some form of romance theme, and he\'s married, but you could argue ""well a lot of things could\'ve happened on 12 years"" yes you\'re right, but that\'s a issue, you can\'t do something, not show it to the public, then force the public to accept/understand the result of it, it\'s like starting a romcom, and on episode 2 making both characters marry by skipping all their romance development, and wanting your view to feel the love that couple feels towards each other, you know what\'s funnier ? people voted a lot for this couple as the best of the season, a couple that went: Compliments her art, falls in love with him but doesn\'t show development on it, kiss him, marry him, that\'s all we see, nothing else, and has the romance tag, about the drama i don\'t need to say a lot, one episode they start arguing because of a decision kyouya made, 2 minutes later the guy just goes ""well i\'ll believe in you since it\'s you kyouya"" i\'m not joking, that\'s how the discussions ends, and that\'s how most of the drama goes, issue happens>kyouya quickly solves it with the logic of being kyouya>everyone praises him>repeat.To conclude my rating, the story of bokutachi no remake is superficial, artificial, poorly written, with childish/godly solutions to any problem presented, that does nothing towards progressing its characters, with no positive traits as everything you see on it you probably seen somewhere else. Oh yeah and most of the things you see on the opening/ending never happen in the actual anime, like they wanted to show to you ""yes we skipped content wanna quickly see it?""Additional final episode critic: 40 seconds into the episode and Keiko goes ""Why do you wanna go back to that hard time"", bro which hard time, Kyouya was a fricking prodigy back then, hard time lol nice jokeAdditional final episode critic 2: 1 minute into the episode and Kyouya pulls  a ""i wanted to struggle"", yeah, you wanted, because you didn\'t and won\'t lmao ( i loved his speech btw, should\'ve been made by another character on a whole another story tho)Additional final episode critic 3: FINNALY HE SHOWED SOME AFFECTION TOWARDS SHINOAKI AFTER 12 EPISODES AND 1 TIME TRAVEL, you know i\'ll be mad if this episodes ends up being goodAdditional final episode critic 4: Kyouya actually used future knowledge to help him do some decisions in the past (it wasn\'t anything big or world changing but he did), the God Loli saying he didn\'t was a lie, also is he stupid ""they trusted in me ?"" the whole anime was about them repeating ""if kyouya says so its right""Additional final episode critic 5: ""Welcome back main character"", how to acknowledge your issues 101Additional final episode critic 6: Says he won\'t use future knowledge to do stuff but knows that if people rely on him that\'s their downfall, honestly this anime says something and does the opposite ""congrats on not taking advantage, now go take advantage this time you stupid""Additional final episode critic 7: cliffhanger ? seriously jeezAdditional final episode conclusion: Fixed some small problems, managed to create even bigger ones, Keiko is god ? Why god is a loli ? Why god choose kyouya of every other human being on earth ? He was just a unemployed hadworking dude lol, that\'s not merit for a second chance in life, so yeah that\'s a new plothole, good job remake creating a problem on your last episode, also it\'s funny how this anime is so sure it\'s getting a second season it straight up ends with a cliffhanger, if it doesn\'t get one i\'ll laughSo my rating is 1, it\'s easily the worst story i ever seen, also another reason, the anime butchered the source material and rushed it a lot, which means yes, most of those issues above could\'ve been avoided or better developed to not be seen as issues, but the anime just decided to go dumb mode and just present the problem at minute 5 and solve it at minute 7, same goes for the love development which was extremely better and wasn\'t one-sided like it was in the anime, if you wanna write you own story avoid everything remake does with hisArt: It\'s a generic art style with no amazing scenarie, copy pasted faces mostly on the female side, you can just remove their hair, replace with the hair of another female character and it would look just like her, with simplistic animation (not as a positive trait) and lack of details all over it.So my rating on art is 2, it\'s bad and generic, like the studio didn\'t even try to pull something unique or good to look at, just searched ""how to make appealing simple faces 10 minute tutorial"" and did it.Sound: The opening is mediocre, the ending is mediocre, simple lyrics and the music itself wasn\'t catchy like other OSTs, the sound on the overall anime was either ""generic city noises.mp4"" or ""generic loop of a beat.mp4"", shonoaki voice was so high pitched you could go deaf and it hurts my ears everytime the VA opened her mouth, i don\'t think it\'s the VA\'s fault on this but i didn\'t research or her other works, oh yeah and there\'s the ep where they sing a Suzumiya Haruhi OST, because this anime enjoys reciclying content so why not, they could\'ve at least made a reference on the manga like they did with other IPs but nope.In conclusion my rating is 5, it\'s mediocre because it never mattered or just annoyed, but not bad enough to make me want to watch on mute and only read the subtitles.Character: This one is gonna be as big as the story one because oh god there\'s A LOT of issues, so prepare your popcorn, Kyouya, the MC, i think i told you enough about the character issues on the story (since sadly the story 99% focus on kyouya and everyone else feels like a side character, so you\'re forced to judge kyouya when juding the story as it\'s driven by him mostly), but as you know, he\'s the perfect MC, solving any issue, having no development as he already starts by being to do anything, expressionless he literally reacts the same way through 90% of the anime, only showing some emotion near the end when he starts regretting that he\'s the perfect MC, we barely know his feelings and he barely portrays them, he\'s unidimensional, he\'s always working the same way, even when its on a subject unrelated to him he still solves it the same way he does with the others, and how perfection is a issue you might ask, well, if your character does everything, why would you care about the others, which is what happens on remake, kyouya makes everyone feels like a side character, barely having enough screentime for them and their personal issues, always relying on him to solve even their personal issues that got lucky enough to be brought up, and that\'s also how the plot goes, since he\'s perfect, they end up failing because they couldn\'t rely forever on him, is that a interesting message? yes, but kyouya portrayed it on such a artificial way that we barely got to feel their downfall, Shinoaki feels like i\'m watching a 5 year old on the body of a 20 year old, she\'s overall dumb doing silly childish things, her voice is extremely annoying, her character is only about looks, she\'s even sexualized right on episode 1, she has no depth, she\'s also unidimensional always relying on kyouya and barely showing what\'s special about the character shinoaki, we barely see her doing what\'s she\'s known for, which is being a artist, which was supposed to be a big thing based on how much hyped kyouya created on her but it didn\'t live up, and the romance she has with kyouya feels so artificial that you don\'t even think they\'re 2 human beings, Nanako is the love rival, even tho this isn\'t a harem anime it has cringe harem moments with the other girls, which funny enough has some depth to her character that sadly gets outshined by kyouya being the saviour of all the burden she carried and making her emotionally dependant on him to the point of ruining her characterization, she\'s not interesting the drama related to her is a pretty simple and common subject that gets easily solved by kyouya and the character has no depth outside of said drama i mentioned, Tsurayuki starts of as smart guy, get\'s outshined by kyouya, starts relying on him for everything, and gives up because of that, his backstory is boring just saying he\'s the son of a rich family and has a arranged marriage that\'s it, his drama is solved without we even going in depth into it, by guess who, yes kyouya the savior of everyone, he feels like a side male character just so the author didn\'t get forced to add a harem tag to his work, because shinoaki and nanako get way more attention than him as characters and he\'s mostly a side kick for kyouya, Kawasegawa is a amazing example of wasted potential, the only character with development, the only character with depth and we see her on kyouya first future, on his second future (they work together) and on his new past, giving the best advices, being interested on him, smart, feels like a actual human being whenever her dialogue is playing, and what the anime did ? Treated her as a side character, and i mean it on this one, she BARELY appears on the past, we go through like 4 episodes forgetting she\'s a character, and there\'s 0 attempt on developing her or her relation with kyouya even as friends, then we skip to the new future, which shows kawasegawa as a ruined character that relies on kyouya to save her, that doesn\'t follow what she believed in and that went from a character that scolded kyouya for always finding easy way outs to everything into a character that created a weird love on him by praising him and saying its not his fault that he ruined the future of all the other 4 main characters (including hers), easily the most interesting character that got ignored on the series and ruined near it\'s end and has the best chemic with kyouya out of all the FMC, about the supporting characters, outside of Keiko being Hoouma Kyouin (steins gate joke) Loli version which is appearing as a relevant plot point all the other support characters appeared like thrice and got completely ignored around episode 6 or 7, the teacher which gave amazing advice never appeared again even tho it was still the school arc, the actual side kick they planned for kyouya also gone, the club members of the weird club they joined also gone, they barely do anything toegther with the other 4 MC, the new support characters on his other future also barely matter, like i don\'t judge support characters being just ""whatever who cares"" but i think it\'s offensive when a anime gives said characters a decent amount of screen time but doesn\'t properly develop them outside of the bubble of ""im still appearing because kyouya will need me at some moment, after he stops needing me i\'ll never appear again"" (not joking that\'s what happened with the teacher after she gave a advice to kyouya, she was constantly appearing, advice, gone), also i wanna point out something hilarious which is the character of sayuri aka tsurayuki arranged marriage wife thingy, she appears, she sexually assault tsurayuki, she gets sexualized, and on the other episode she\'s gone, thats it, thats ALL she does, like my god is this anime retarded, how can you introduce someone for NO REASON, literally his arranged marriage HAD NO REASON TO EXIST, same goes for Kyouya sister, she appears twice for 10 seconds, and that\'s it, why she\'s even a character related to the MC if she\'s not even going to matter at all like why just spam random characters that won\'t do anything for the sake of faking that you have a big cast when you don\'t, 90% of the support characters could be removed and no one would miss them that\'s how irrelevant they are. In conclusion every single character in this is superficial and forgetable because of kyouya stealing the spotlight on every situation, kyouya is the issue everyone is under developed and himself is also under developed and funny enough the intention of the anime was to show that kyouya made them worse, but if you intentionally make your characters worse in the benefit of your generic MC that\'s also bad, you\'ll still be ruining your characters no matter what logic you follow, it\'s like, ""ill intentionally make my story bad, so people see that was my intention, and consider it good"" like thats so bizarre and nonsensical it barely feels like it was made by someone that knows what he\'s doing, when it comes to looks everyone is generic there\'s no remarkable or special trais, to the point of the daughter of shinoaki and kyouya being a loli copy paste of shinoaki, A LITERAL COPY PASTE, how can someone be so lazy to not even try to give a child a little bit of character design, the characters are awfu, generic, unidimensional, poorly developed and written, forgetable, and all the other bad things you can consider about a character, that you literally do not care about them, even whenever there\'s drama, whenever they cry because of said drama you don\'t feel a thing, you don\'t care, because there isn\'t enough development and there isn\'t enough content for you to care about that character.Additional final episode critic: Kyouya finnally feels like a real human being, took him the whole anime but ok, any + is welcoming, i won\'t be changing my score on this tho, lol imagine ignoring 90% of the anime with him being a perfect robot to give this a extra point.Additional final episode critic 2: Kyouya recognizes his ego as a perfect dude is a bad thing, character development at the end of the anime folks.Additional final episode critic 3: Cool the side characters are back, that still didn\'t address the issue i mentioned above tbh, this was more of a second season promotional episode than the end of a seasonIn conclusion my rating on character is 1, a door has more character development than 90% of the characters in this anime, because at least doors can be different unlike shinoaki and her daughter.I won\'t rate enjoyment as it\'s a subjective rating unrelated to actual quality of the producting, but if you think i\'m biased towards enjoyment you can check my Kanojo mo Kanojo review which i gave it a 4 called it bad for a number of reasons and still gave it a 8 on enjoymentOverall don\'t watch bokutachi no remake, learn from all the mistakes that this anime made from the source material issues to removing pieces of the source material and creating even more issues, this doesn\'t deserve the high rating it currently has and i honestly don\'t get how you people manage to blind yourself to the inumerous flaws this has and forcing into reality inexistant qualities of it, if you wanna watch a anime that\'s somewhat better on the exact same topic go watch ReLIFE, if you still want to watch remake i reccomend doing so on 2x speed, AND IM NOT EVEN JOKING when i say it get\'s more enjoyable for some unknown reason, the pacing is just all over the place on the episodes themselves.My overall score is 2, my eyes didn\'t deserve going through 12 episodes, but i did it so you don\'t have to if that\'s how the saying goes. of time traveling animes. Funny enough the first episode manages to make you somewhat interested in the anime, but then you ask ""what\'s so bad about it"" well lemme explain through MAL rating system.Story: Starts showing Kyouya as a hardworker otaku that did a bad career choice but get\'s a second chance at working at his ""dream career"", and yes we haven\'t even reached the time travel part yet, he then properly does his job at a game industry even overworking himself to try to guarantee his chance of being accepted (it was a intership), but sadly the project fails because of reasons outside of his reach, and he gets fired, now enters the time traveling, he went back 10 years so he could do the right career choice and this is where the Good Bokutachi (episode 1) starts to fade away for the awful bokutachi (episodes from 3 to 12), even tho he changed his university choice, it doesn\'t even feel like it, kyouya can easily solve any challenge that\'s presented to him, but you could ask ""well he has 10 years of experience makes sense"" except that it doesn\'t, because it was never shown that kyouya had experience dealing with thoses challenges, it only shows like twice him using future knowledge to help with decision making and it never uses his degree on economic university as a advantage for his decisions, only showed that he\'s a hardworked, and he doesn\'t solve anything through hardwork he just knows what to do in any situation, oh i forgot to talk about that he partners with the younger version of the platinum trio, do they matter ? not really, as the anime potrays kyouya as their god saviour that carries them through any issue, making them underdeveloped and making their relataionship artificial, skipping ahead as the anime is just a replay of ""Issue>Kyouya solves it>Kyouya gets praised for it in some way"" kyouya manages to make the platinum trio never be a thing because he\'s just better than them in every way and we are forced to go to the new future, kyouya (that was praised by the platinum trio) manages to be a random worker at a game industry, because that makes sense, a guy better than a legendary trio didn\'t manage to get a relevant hierarchy but let\'s procceed, then he skipped 12 years including most of his university life and now has to work, do you think he struggled at a new job without having full knowledge on it (yes he doesn\'t have any memories of the 12 years he skipped) ? Nope, he managed to work so well that he repeated the old cycle, everyone always asked for his help, he solved the problems of all his co-workers, he even manages to do a better job than the company president itself, while skipping 12 years of knowledge on the matter, sounds dumb right? well because it is, this anime is just a huge stupid adventure of a OP MC solving all the issues the story provides without any struggle whatsoever, oh yeah and you know the whole university envyronment ? Do you think it was properly used in the story ? Nope, it got put aside around episode 5 or 6 we do not see the characters developing their skill through challenges provided by the university, as kyouya is already perfect and solves everything and all the others just ask kyouya to solve their issues, oh yeah lemme point out something else, this anime has 3 tags, slice of life, romance and drama, do you think he properly utilizes any of them? No, the slice of life tag is there for obvious reasons, its his life and we see slices of it, there\'s no ""oh yes seeing moments of his life matters for character depth/development"" no it doesn\'t, we just see his life because we are forced to, oh romance, i wanna talk about this tag, its gonna be a short talk tho, romance in bokutachi is pretty short, there\'s a episode for 2 of the girls getting interested in him because he did a single cool thing to them, like a compliment (i\'m not even joking, a girl falls in love with him because he says he likes her art, that\'s it), and you\'re curious why i mean 2 with 3 FMC? Well that\'s because kawasegawa get\'s treated as a side character through 90% of the anime, and funny enough still manages to be better written than anyone else in this series, going back to the romance, one of the girls kisses him, we enter a single episode harem romcom style with the 2 girls ""fighting"" for him, he says he has no feelings for the girl that kissed him, we skip 12 years he\'s married with that girl, done, yes, i\'m done, that\'s all the romance this anime has, it\'s like 2 episodes max focusing on some form of romance theme, and he\'s married, but you could argue ""well a lot of things could\'ve happened on 12 years"" yes you\'re right, but that\'s a issue, you can\'t do something, not show it to the public, then force the public to accept/understand the result of it, it\'s like starting a romcom, and on episode 2 making both characters marry by skipping all their romance development, and wanting your view to feel the love that couple feels towards each other, you know what\'s funnier ? people voted a lot for this couple as the best of the season, a couple that went: Compliments her art, falls in love with him but doesn\'t show development on it, kiss him, marry him, that\'s all we see, nothing else, and has the romance tag, about the drama i don\'t need to say a lot, one episode they start arguing because of a decision kyouya made, 2 minutes later the guy just goes ""well i\'ll believe in you since it\'s you kyouya"" i\'m not joking, that\'s how the discussions ends, and that\'s how most of the drama goes, issue happens>kyouya quickly solves it with the logic of being kyouya>everyone praises him>repeat.To conclude my rating, the story of bokutachi no remake is superficial, artificial, poorly written, with childish/godly solutions to any problem presented, that does nothing towards progressing its characters, with no positive traits as everything you see on it you probably seen somewhere else. Oh yeah and most of the things you see on the opening/ending never happen in the actual anime, like they wanted to show to you ""yes we skipped content wanna quickly see it?""Additional final episode critic: 40 seconds into the episode and Keiko goes ""Why do you wanna go back to that hard time"", bro which hard time, Kyouya was a fricking prodigy back then, hard time lol nice jokeAdditional final episode critic 2: 1 minute into the episode and Kyouya pulls  a ""i wanted to struggle"", yeah, you wanted, because you didn\'t and won\'t lmao ( i loved his speech btw, should\'ve been made by another character on a whole another story tho)Additional final episode critic 3: FINNALY HE SHOWED SOME AFFECTION TOWARDS SHINOAKI AFTER 12 EPISODES AND 1 TIME TRAVEL, you know i\'ll be mad if this episodes ends up being goodAdditional final episode critic 4: Kyouya actually used future knowledge to help him do some decisions in the past (it wasn\'t anything big or world changing but he did), the God Loli saying he didn\'t was a lie, also is he stupid ""they trusted in me ?"" the whole anime was about them repeating ""if kyouya says so its right""Additional final episode critic 5: ""Welcome back main character"", how to acknowledge your issues 101Additional final episode critic 6: Says he won\'t use future knowledge to do stuff but knows that if people rely on him that\'s their downfall, honestly this anime says something and does the opposite ""congrats on not taking advantage, now go take advantage this time you stupid""Additional final episode critic 7: cliffhanger ? seriously jeezAdditional final episode conclusion: Fixed some small problems, managed to create even bigger ones, Keiko is god ? Why god is a loli ? Why god choose kyouya of every other human being on earth ? He was just a unemployed hadworking dude lol, that\'s not merit for a second chance in life, so yeah that\'s a new plothole, good job remake creating a problem on your last episode, also it\'s funny how this anime is so sure it\'s getting a second season it straight up ends with a cliffhanger, if it doesn\'t get one i\'ll laughSo my rating is 1, it\'s easily the worst story i ever seen, also another reason, the anime butchered the source material and rushed it a lot, which means yes, most of those issues above could\'ve been avoided or better developed to not be seen as issues, but the anime just decided to go dumb mode and just present the problem at minute 5 and solve it at minute 7, same goes for the love development which was extremely better and wasn\'t one-sided like it was in the anime, if you wanna write you own story avoid everything remake does with hisArt: It\'s a generic art style with no amazing scenarie, copy pasted faces mostly on the female side, you can just remove their hair, replace with the hair of another female character and it would look just like her, with simplistic animation (not as a positive trait) and lack of details all over it.So my rating on art is 2, it\'s bad and generic, like the studio didn\'t even try to pull something unique or good to look at, just searched ""how to make appealing simple faces 10 minute tutorial"" and did it.Sound: The opening is mediocre, the ending is mediocre, simple lyrics and the music itself wasn\'t catchy like other OSTs, the sound on the overall anime was either ""generic city noises.mp4"" or ""generic loop of a beat.mp4"", shonoaki voice was so high pitched you could go deaf and it hurts my ears everytime the VA opened her mouth, i don\'t think it\'s the VA\'s fault on this but i didn\'t research or her other works, oh yeah and there\'s the ep where they sing a Suzumiya Haruhi OST, because this anime enjoys reciclying content so why not, they could\'ve at least made a reference on the manga like they did with other IPs but nope.In conclusion my rating is 5, it\'s mediocre because it never mattered or just annoyed, but not bad enough to make me want to watch on mute and only read the subtitles.Character: This one is gonna be as big as the story one because oh god there\'s A LOT of issues, so prepare your popcorn, Kyouya, the MC, i think i told you enough about the character issues on the story (since sadly the story 99% focus on kyouya and everyone else feels like a side character, so you\'re forced to judge kyouya when juding the story as it\'s driven by him mostly), but as you know, he\'s the perfect MC, solving any issue, having no development as he already starts by being to do anything, expressionless he literally reacts the same way through 90% of the anime, only showing some emotion near the end when he starts regretting that he\'s the perfect MC, we barely know his feelings and he barely portrays them, he\'s unidimensional, he\'s always working the same way, even when its on a subject unrelated to him he still solves it the same way he does with the others, and how perfection is a issue you might ask, well, if your character does everything, why would you care about the others, which is what happens on remake, kyouya makes everyone feels like a side character, barely having enough screentime for them and their personal issues, always relying on him to solve even their personal issues that got lucky enough to be brought up, and that\'s also how the plot goes, since he\'s perfect, they end up failing because they couldn\'t rely forever on him, is that a interesting message? yes, but kyouya portrayed it on such a artificial way that we barely got to feel their downfall, Shinoaki feels like i\'m watching a 5 year old on the body of a 20 year old, she\'s overall dumb doing silly childish things, her voice is extremely annoying, her character is only about looks, she\'s even sexualized right on episode 1, she has no depth, she\'s also unidimensional always relying on kyouya and barely showing what\'s special about the character shinoaki, we barely see her doing what\'s she\'s known for, which is being a artist, which was supposed to be a big thing based on how much hyped kyouya created on her but it didn\'t live up, and the romance she has with kyouya feels so artificial that you don\'t even think they\'re 2 human beings, Nanako is the love rival, even tho this isn\'t a harem anime it has cringe harem moments with the other girls, which funny enough has some depth to her character that sadly gets outshined by kyouya being the saviour of all the burden she carried and making her emotionally dependant on him to the point of ruining her characterization, she\'s not interesting the drama related to her is a pretty simple and common subject that gets easily solved by kyouya and the character has no depth outside of said drama i mentioned, Tsurayuki starts of as smart guy, get\'s outshined by kyouya, starts relying on him for everything, and gives up because of that, his backstory is boring just saying he\'s the son of a rich family and has a arranged marriage that\'s it, his drama is solved without we even going in depth into it, by guess who, yes kyouya the savior of everyone, he feels like a side male character just so the author didn\'t get forced to add a harem tag to his work, because shinoaki and nanako get way more attention than him as characters and he\'s mostly a side kick for kyouya, Kawasegawa is a amazing example of wasted potential, the only character with development, the only character with depth and we see her on kyouya first future, on his second future (they work together) and on his new past, giving the best advices, being interested on him, smart, feels like a actual human being whenever her dialogue is playing, and what the anime did ?

The pacing is terrible. There are moments where the anime basically loses all its momentum by jumping from scene to scene.Some characters aren\'t developed enough when some are pushed way too much. This i feel is caused because they don\'t make the decision of what to focus on in an arc and instead jumping around to the most generic plot development ideas they have. Technically you can say they do have arcs, but it\'s handled really poorly...it\'s as if they mashed 2 arcs together to save time. This anime feels fake, the characters feels forced and the pacing is basically pushing the bounds of what this anime wants to be.The protagonist is in a state of no regrets, where he is pushing what is possible however i think he is a bit too ""competent"" as that there is literally nothing he could not do, the typical generic overly strong characterThis anime feels less about remaking someone\'s life and more akin of being the most generic Isekai with a plot twist ""its now in the real world without magic!""There is literally no reason why the anime is set in a university for art, hell you can place the entire plot outside of the art school, like ""a bunch of starving film crew"" or ""a bunch of game directors"", or ""a bunch of starving idols"" and it would work just as well.In short if you want to watch this anime, sure go on ahead, the pacing maybe terrible and the character is as generic as it can get and there\'s no reason for the plot to take place in an ""art school"" but if you like a generic ""this guy fixes life by being the most competent person ever"" to turn off your brain to sure go on ahead.HOWEVER if you are here expecting a smart and clever show about art, the industry, and taking the route least traveled by, go watch imouto sae ireba ii. its better in every way. it\'s as if they mashed 2 arcs together to save time.

It was a refreshing time travel anime.The story is good. It has a nice pacing and an interesting plot. It started very strong, introducing a well-beloved introduction to the story. The middle part is also quite exciting with the ongoing plot threads and the introduction of the problem that the protagonist brings to the table. Though the ending was quite anticlimactic. Ending on a cliffhanger is pretty much a kick to the balls. Other than that, there's nothing for me to complain about.The characters are great. They are...a strong main cast with interesting quirks and personality. The side characters... well, not so much. The focus of the anime is clearly only the pov of the protagonist. We're basically on his shoes, which is why we don't get much flesh-out scenes on other characters. And there's also the problem of this essentially being Act 1 for the entire story, so it leaves out a lot of character development for certain characters, hence why I'm not too crazy with my rating yet.The animation is alright. It's pretty limited with a lot of cuts and limited animation. But the composition of each scenes are great, wonderful even. It definitely elevates itself with how the framing works in certain scenes. The art is also not too bad with little to no off-models for the characters. Great stuff.The music is alright. The ost is okay, and the opening and ending is catchy enough.Overall, it's a really great anime. One of the better ones not only in this season but also for this year.

The general issue the protaganist deals with is of being too involved and relied upon by his peers. This is devolped throughout with all characters failing at some point and using him to resolve the conflict. As the ending comes along our mc dials back his involvement and the anime hints that he manages to resolve all the creative writer blocks he...made over time.Writer Blocks: Throughout the anime our mc takes on the role of producer, telling people what to do, giving them time frames, organising work schedules, all normal stuff a producer would do. Yet him doing this role uninspires and prevents the other characters wanting to be artists which is a stupid anime plot. People of course loose motivation when they have to budge on work ideas but the anime implys any budge/compromise leads to quiting the job...what?! All our mc wanted to do is be creative like the cool gen he looked upto but is unable to be a happy creator as everyone else looses all happiness from him doing just a normal director job. It baffles me beyond belef.Romance: The romantic side of the anime is severerly lacking as our potential ships dont get any love from our mc.

But as you move ahead in the story, you\'ll see what I mean by ""Tatami Galaxy vibes"". Tatami Galaxy is an anime covering the topic ""life choices"". This is exactly what Remake our life does.

The story starts as another re-life 10y into the past of not fulfilled bankrupt game developer/producer, who is given another career chance. From working professional perspective I would prefer to see longer time jump as 10y is really short and while one is 30y old one can still consider his career open and full of opportunities. The university settings and story focused on exploring your best options for future career is very welcomed. This makes this anime something more than entertaining escapism. Characters are reasonable and slowly develop as series progresses. Our protagonist armed...with his past work experiences and bitter disappointments is placed by divine powers in the pole-position to team up with the future stars of art creators.

Even the show itself, being a romcom, does harken back to the early to mid 2010s when shows like these were more prominent. However, BokuRema does fall into the standard trappings commonly associated with this genre in spite of its unique concept.BokuRema feels like a Visual Novel, where you\'re watching Kyouya making choices and reaching Bad Ends. The problem is that Kyouya himself isn\'t a very interesting character. He is your typical doormat nice guy who\'s loved by everyone. There is nothing special he brings to the table and he sucks out a lot of the...fun with his passiveness. The rest of the cast don\'t fare any better, they are your typical romcom archetypes, again with nothing special brought to the table. Nothing terrible, just nothing special.I do like the moments where the gang starts making their doujin game, as well as Kyouya\'s stunt in the gaming companies. But apart from that the show didn\'t draw me in with the usual character building scenes. You\'re just going through the motions at this point, especially if you\'re like me and read a ton of VNs with a similar premise. It\'s charming to see in anime form in 2021 yes, but it still feels so generic regardless. The special collaboration cameo from episode 6 was really cute though.The time travel plot is interesting, but by the end of the show you\'re not given any answers beyond a ""Read the LN for more!"" cliffhanger. It does feel irresponsible to resolve your show with such a blatant ad, and it certainly dampers the entire experience of the show.All in all, the show was a nice throwback albeit a generic one.5/10 fun with his passiveness.

The comedy is very good and very dynamic, every moment in its timing, made me laugh. The premise kept me going until the end of each episode.The animation of the anime, is very well done, the art of the characters and the environment, are very...comforting and pleasant.The voices are good and some are extremely cute (ShinoAki says so). The songs are very comforting to my ears and make me happy watching.The characters are well introduced, and have a great development, up to the current moment of the anime. I have created a fondness for each character and their unique characteristics. The mc makes very good use of his back in time to help his classmates. I feel as if each character there, complete each other, to achieve their goals and grow during the course of the anime.Overall, I like this kind of anime a lot (even more so because it was well done), I may have gone a little overboard in the review, but that's what I think.

But well, what is played in this anime is always the relation that the MC has with the others which evolves and influences his entourage.

Yes it has a synopsis that outlines the general plot, but you don\'t *really* get a feel of what the show will be from it.I\'m happy to say I started watching, because my lord what a fantastic series. Right from the start you get introduced to multiple people that have a lot of regrets about their lives, and one of them actually gets to redo part of it.While this may sound incredibly generic and kind of boring for a plot these days, the execution is what brings it...to life. The ""Initial"" Kyouya Hashiba and Eiko Kawasegawa we meet are already very endearing because of the hardships they face in their current lives. When Kyouya gets sent back into the past, we get to meet the people he would look up to in his ""Initial"" life, but instead of them already being at their peak, they are struggling with their own lives and have their own challenges and obstacles to overcome, just like Kyouya has. This makes it very easy to want to keep watching, because you want to see how these characters are going to develop, and *if* they\'re gonna grow into the people Kyouya looks up so much or not.This, along with the great art and AMAZING voice acting from the INCREDIBLE cast (Koga Aoi, Nao Touyama and Rie Takahashi, just to name a few) makes it already difficult to stop watching, but the inclusion of some very well-timed cliffhangers, actually decent to good drama and sprinkles of mystery makes Remake Our Lives a must-watch.

How this series plays with your mind is absolutely brilliant and amazed me.Characters: Her characters well and not too amazed me so much apart from Kyouya, he was my favorite character because he thought of everyone around him and sacrificed himself to help everyone, then Shinoaki because he likes to draw and I would like to become a professional illustrator like her.Animation: Animation and I have nothing to say about it, it's great brother, brilliant. This style is so colorful, more vivid, that's how I adore it, at least I adore it.

How this series plays with your mind is absolutely brilliant and amazed me.Characters: Her characters well and not too amazed me so much apart from Kyouya, he was my favorite character because he thought of everyone around him and sacrificed himself to help everyone, then Shinoaki because he likes to draw and I would like to become a professional illustrator like her.Animation: Animation and I have nothing to say about it, it's great brother, brilliant. This style is so colorful, more vivid, that's how I adore it, at least I adore it.

I liked the take on the time travel genre a lot as well, it was constantly focused on and didn't just feel like a cheap plot device.The story was pretty reality-bound aside from the time travel, I liked all of the routes the characters took and how Kyouya was mostly present for all of them and I think the school setting was actually really cool and interesting despite it being literally just a...school.Speaking of the characters I absolutely loved all of them, the girls were all perfect and I loved the main 2 guys as well, everyone's interactions were great. The dialogue was pretty good and it felt like they all just genuinely got along and understood each other even during the conflicts. Kyouya's main conflict with himself throughout was pretty interesting and I think it's a really interesting problem to focus on.Overall I think this show was great, it did pretty much all I wanted it to do (at least all that would fit in 12 episodes) and I had a lot of fun watching! school.Speaking of the characters I absolutely loved all of them, the girls were all perfect and I loved the main 2 guys as well, everyone's interactions were great.

Definitely. It\'s a time travel anime, but like really good because its not as chaotic like Stein\'s Gate or something grim or serious such as Mirai Nikki or Erased. There is no hero in time, or butterfly effect. It is just a normal guy, trying to interact with what he knew were extraordinary lives.The theme? Creatives. I\'ve watched some anime tackling the...lives of creators, but they\'ve been slices of life so far, so having one with an actual plot where the character\'s drive to create something new drives the plot forward, which is a good thing. The plot is dependent on the ""passion"" of the characters, and goes at a standstill when it\'s not. This is very good, you get to think ""This isn\'t good"", and then the story shows realizations that your thought was the correct one.There is a bunch of stuff I don\'t get, like certain plot points, but it feels like it\'s guaranteed to have an explanation for what\'s happening later in a natural manner. It doesn\'t have that cliffhanger effect that ""Damn I want to see the next episode"", but it piques your interest that you absolutely want to watch the next episode the moment it comes out.Sound and Art are good, it is self explanatory since it is an anime about creatives.Story is relatively good, I definitely would be able to imagine being in the protagonist\'s shoes, but he is around middle-aged, so it might not be as relatable to younger audience. No complains, however, since this part is an anchor and constant that is relevant to the story. Although having the ""it\'s a small world"" effect is kinda redundant at times.In terms of enjoyment, I found myself enjoying the twists and turns of youth. Every calm and chaotic moment I enjoyed. Although it goes boring at times, and sometimes finding myself forgetting side characters.

Now, how these dilemmas are overcome vary in realism and intrigue, yet each main character has a challenge in front of or within themselves that will put you in their corner. Another highlight has to be character development. Specifically this animes use of different timelines to show other aspects of the cast. Unfortunately I can't say much on this point without spoiling the show.Onto the negatives: Remake Our Life will grab you with interest then...shove harem troupes down your throat. Plenty of time I feel the tone of this show is ruined by its wanting to play out typical high school romance scenes. Fortunately a plot twist in the second half sends the show to a sprint till its finish and leaves no room for the kind of scenes I'm complaining about.

For some, they don’t mind wasting opportunities. After all, they will come again when it’s “the right time”, right?Unfortunately, second chances don’t come very often. For some, this is a privilege they don’t get to experience their whole life. Most of whom will have to go through their life forced to accept what has been and just look forward to whatever’s next.Hashiba Kyouya had the chance (or power, perhaps) of a lifetime: Go back 10 years and re-do your life.If you were Kyouya, would you...have done it? How would you have done things differently?For Kyouya, it was all about chasing his dream.By going back, he got to team up with the very same persons who had served as his inspirations and found himself in a situation where he can take advantage of this opportunity to make sure he does things right. He wanted to make sure that success is not just a possibility, but the only option; not just for him, but for his new-found group of friends as well.Here, we arrive at the two most important lessons / thoughts I got from this anime:1. Helping isn’t always helpful.2. Great works are never forced.For some, our desire to help comes innately. Helping surely is a great thing to do. But I realized in this anime that the kind of help we provide is as important as helping itself. Our constant strive for success could bring us to think that we must do whatever we can for the people we care about. Sadly, this doesn’t always translate to positives.!!!MAJOR PLOT SPOILER UPCOMING!!!Kyouya tried to do everything he can to make sure his team succeeds, even if it means handling what he can by himself and compromising standards to reach targets. This is where we realize that following a certain set of rules can bring good things, but great things can only be achieved when it is created naturally. By compromising, Shino Aki’s and Rokuonji Tsurayuki’s works were not of themselves, at least not totally. And that’s enough for them to question their own abilities. Kogure Nanako’s desire to go after her dreams were eventually slashed as well. Following a set of guidelines could restrict the creativity of a person. What should have been a great piece of work could be nothing but a failed attempt to success if our standards are based simply on following such guidelines.In the end, Kyouya’s attempt at success did bring him just that in the future, but even he realized that success, at least in how many of us defined it, doesn’t always feel right; not if the others whom he wanted to help ended up nowhere. After all, how can you find happiness on being successful if it costed the success of those who had inspired you?***END OF MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS***Indeed, helping doesn’t always help people. Kyouya’s intentions were admirable. But much like all of us, whether you’re a professional or a student, a parent or a sibling, we have these urges to help people we care about. But keep in mind that if helping others only makes them more and more dependent on what you can do for them instead of what they can create themselves, then all you did was shoulder the burden of unintentionally stealing their success.

Not only that but the story has major issues that begs belief.In order for this to be enjoyable, you simply have to accept that the premises are flawed and that it suffers from contrivances.Imagine you're sent back ten years to change your life, what would you do?For our protagonist this results in choosing a...different education, rather than the safe bet he goes to art school, this time with the knowledge and experiences of his past decade, determined to be a game creator who is part of the 'platinum generation' of talent, the names of people who were famous artists in the future he's from. A dear wish of his is to make things with these people.That's a solid premise. That's something a lot of adults can relate to and would like to see play out as a  wish fulfillment fantasy.And here's where things start to derail.Project stories of getting together to make something are their own mini genre, instead of having a band of adventurers tackle a boss, you have creatives tackling a project. But then the show tries to be a romance anime and then a harem anime and then it goes back to time slips and the consequences of the actions taken.Our protagonist doesn't actually do anything wrong, in fact he has some serious skill in production, management and enough all-round knowledge to work with creatives from their perspective, that he succeeds far better than any 18 year old in existence. He is a legitimate talent himself.But... The show punishes him for it.The consequences of his great work and effort are not realistic, the surrounding characters mindlessly give up instead of being proud of their achievements and things fall apart for the implied reason that he didn't take their wishes into account, except that's exactly what he did and the experiences the team got should not have been discouraging but rather help them define themselves and how they would want to move forwards.This lesson that the show spends an entire new arc dragging out in another timeline is painful to watch and the morals aren't clear.What's worse is that it is clear that this new future is something he can return from and the show doesn't address the implications or the consequences of this.That's a hard pill to swallow and instead of making the protagonist look like he's learned his lesson, it makes him look like someone who just erased people from existence so he can go back to play with his friends in college. An unintended view of the character that I don't think the author considered.The final issue is the time mechanic itself which brings up some uncomfortable questions that aren't answered.The show sets up for a second season which I doubt will happen. If the same themes surrounding time leaps happen then it invalidates the first season. If it continues to be a project anime then what was the point of the time leaps in the first place?

This is how I feel about Bokutachi no Remake.There\'s a reason why the three female leads are front and center in the promotional art. They\'re the best part of the show. Shinoaki is adorable  (and I\'ve been a sucker for blue-haired girls with short hair since Sailor Mercury).The ""main"" character, Kyouya, is both relatable and unforgiveable. He became a failure because he was afraid to try. He gets a second chance and is determined to give it everything. He\'s just too good at everything to believe that he could have failed so...spectacularly in life the first time. He also loses a lot of points for letting the girls swoon over him because it\'s better for the project and somehow he ends up with one of them anyway. I give him credit for not leaving his new future without saying goodbye to the family he had, but it seems too easy a decision for him to throw it all away to try again.Tsurayuki is just a plot device. He\'s the stumbling block that Kyouya has to convince every time and then he just gives up because Kyouya has to realize what his second chance cost the Platinum Generation. And his handling of his relationship with Sayuri is just gutless. Is it a clever nod when in their first class together he essentially explains what his role in the story will be?The show would have been better served to show the Platinum Generation from the original timeline. They were incredibly talented but were they happy? We\'re not shown because each reveal is meant to be a surprise. Why then do they make it so blatantly obvious who each one of them is? Kawasegawa is more relatable because we get to see who she was, how she got there and how she changed because of Kyouya\'s second chance.Only having twelve episodes is a blessing and a curse. It\'s not a huge time investment, but everything feels rushed. Plot points get introduced and then dropped too quickly.If you can overlook plot holes and enjoy a show for the individual moments it provides then I think there is enough good here to be worth a watch. Critically, it\'s a generous 6. For personal enjoyment it was a 7. Fun disposable entertainment. spectacularly in life the first time.

I give him credit for not leaving his new future without saying goodbye to the family he had, but it seems too easy a decision for him to throw it all away to try again.Tsurayuki is just a plot device. He\'s the stumbling block that Kyouya has to convince every time and then he just gives up because Kyouya has to realize what his second chance cost the Platinum Generation. And his handling of his relationship with Sayuri is just gutless. Is it a clever nod when in their first class together he essentially explains what his role in the story will be?The show would have been better served to show the Platinum Generation from the original timeline. They were incredibly talented but were they happy? We\'re not shown because each reveal is meant to be a surprise. Why then do they make it so blatantly obvious who each one of them is? Kawasegawa is more relatable because we get to see who she was, how she got there and how she changed because of Kyouya\'s second chance.Only having twelve episodes is a blessing and a curse. It\'s not a huge time investment, but everything feels rushed. Plot points get introduced and then dropped too quickly.If you can overlook plot holes and enjoy a show for the individual moments it provides then I think there is enough good here to be worth a watch. Critically, it\'s a generous 6. For personal enjoyment it was a 7. Fun disposable entertainment.', 'From the studio that brought you Oregairu comes ReLife with a mix of Sakurasou and a pinch of Ecchi because why not.That\'s honestly the best way I can describe this show. Given that it\'s only been 4 episodes I can\'t judge this show too much yet not too mention I haven\'t read the source material.The plot is interesting, you see ReLife occured in High School, Bokutachi no Remake occurs in college, this allows for more mature themes and content to be explored.Kyouya the mc, is a video game designer well he wanted to be anyway. Despite how big video games are nowadays, it is still...a niche and small part of the overall job market. Kyouya got the short end of the stick, as a result he has bounced around from company to company never finding a stable role, eventually like most humans do he goes back to his hometown to get a ""fresh"" start.Things happen and boom he is 10 years back in the past, Freshman college year as well. He decides to choose a different course than what he originally took and this is where the story begins.I like Kyouya, I don\'t know why but his story along with his thinking as to why his life went down the path it took hits hard, I think it more or less has to do with just how realistic he feels, a man who just wanted to get a job doing what he likes brought down by poor career choices. It\'s only natural to think that if you took a different path or in this case college course you\'re life might\'ve turned out better. That\'s the Relife aspect of the show.This show is like Sakurasou on the other hand because the main cast of characters live with each other, all have their own unique talents, they have good chemistry with one another and the plot involves them most of the time.This sounds good and all but I do have a few problems mainly the Ecchi and Cliches the show usesI like ecchi after all I\'m a degen just like most of you but the Ecchi scenes are poorly planned out, they just appear randomly for some reason.And of course the Cliches and tropes, no anime is safe from this especially Sol shows as there\'s no way to keep the plot interesting without them.Anyway that\'s my take so far, It\'s probably a 7 for me. Since studio feel did the animation and art, it has that Oregairu vibe to it and I dig it, though the plot could use touches that\'s why it\'s a 7 for me a niche and small part of the overall job market.

This anime gave me so much despair in the initial episodes, as I was also thinking along the lines of ""if only I could go back in time"". all the past regrets and the things that I could do better came rushing to mind as I started watching this.The last few episodes also made me realize that it is never too late to start changing our/my future. To all the weebs out there who wish to escape from reality and just immerse in other world just to forget pain, this anime gives soo much hope...and motivation to \'remake\' our lives. and motivation to \'remake\' our lives.', 'Come, come. Join me on a ride through what we call, “Remake Our Life”. A weird, generic,  entertaining and future-setting and aiding story where we have our main character, by the name of Kyouya struggle consistently with being too reliable for everyone around him. A perfect Main Character that suffers majorly from his sheer perfections.========{Spoilers Warning}=======This anime, it was... really good. Surprisingly good. From the cover it seems so generic, but in actual fact it feels so refreshing to watch. It’s such a weird, clear masterpiece placed in front of us with so much to unfold and understand. It’s- like- how do you even...explain something this good. It’s just, enjoyable. It’s entirely enjoyable, that it’s so hard to find faults with it. I love this anime and I love this formula. The only comparable anime is of course Re:Life, where they too also have the MC go back 10+ years and relive their life. But this anime, it improves on the concept by SOOO MUCH MORE. IT MAKES IT SO ENTERTAINING AND FUN. I can’t- even emphasise how almost every single aspect of this anime masters it’s angles and techniques. They constantly make 4th wall references to themselves particularly during the game making arc and even before, they establish the “hand-clench” action in the game, where Kyouya does the same hand-clench multiple times before AND after the arc. It’s just- so incredibly they set up their own techniques and then make it clear.Then the characters, NONE OF THE CHARACTERS ARE HATEABLE. They all have this good aspect with them, they’re all 3D in an emotional way, none of them are plain and clear with nothing about them. Even the side characters have some form of detail to them, emotion and clarity. Kyouya man- he’s literally such a “Chad” of a main character, he’s so fricking- how- I can’t even. He’s like the perfect MC with just the right amount of flaws, just the right amount of independence and caringness. He suffers because he tries too hard, he learns the error of his mistakes towards the end- he rectifies them and makes do with the crap he screws up with. He doesn’t give up, but he keeps trying, trying and trying, at first with too much consideration for others, then realising that he takes away all the hard work for others because he can handle it, but then they don’t learn. Doing everything for others simply makes them unprepared for anything ahead of them. It’s just- ITS INCREDIBLE HOW WELL ITS BUILT AND LED UP TO. THEY MAKE IT SO BEAUTIFUL IN SUCH A WEIRD WAY. I love the characters so much, and obviously Kawasegawa had- I can’t. She’s a sort of side character in and of herself, partly main character, yet- somehow she had so so so much developement, so much detail and emotion to herself despite being a character with less focus than the others.It’s- I love this anime man. It executes things and so many aspects of itself so perfectly, and you can tell even with the end, it’s prepared for a second season, where more detail of everything can be unfolded, the questions left unanswered will be discovered. How does his time travel even work? What does Keiko have to do with all of this? Why is a loli so proud of herself and how old is she supposed to be considering she’s friends with their teacher? And you can just FEEL that most of it is going to be answered in the next season. I want to give this a 10. I really do, maybe I will, maybe I’ll change my mind. I think it makes scenes so powerful yet making it feel beyond realistic and clear about the reality of everything around. The scene at the airport with Kyouya and Kawasegawa, that scene was by far a fricking perfect scene. It was so, sooo, soooo good. The emotions, the power, the thoughts, the troubles, the instant depression-filled thoughts with our MC, Kyouya as he slowly folds over himself, Kawasegawa confessing her love by sheer accident and brushing it under the rug as best as she could, not making a giant scene out of it as if “love” was the primary aspect of their lives, their future was, their lives, their happiness and their mental states is what mattered to each other. They were being simply realistic in that single scene that was flowing with so many emotions and importance in mere seconds. This anime feels so casual, normal and clear. It’s no AOT, it’s no FMA or Re:Zero, but it’s a master of its own genre. It’s a master of redoing life and making each and every character feel like they have some sort of cog. The whole concept of the story, the creation of games, was executed as one of the best I’ve ever seen it done in the anime industry, of course excluding New Game!. It- felt like creativity was constantly abundant, the lives and dreams of so many, compressed and shown in an animated format, the world building of an area with developers, a single sneak peak into the chaos of game makers and artists, the pains and struggles to get there and live throughout it.However broken a format like this can be, I think this anime executed so many aspects correctly and right. It feels so ordinary yet peculiar in the way it attempts and shows things. I can’t obviously forget to mention, the music and sounds, while it was by 100% FRICKING AMAZING. It gives off the vibes of a really old anime, like it jumped back from the past of 2000s and 2010s to the future- and what’s more- it’s by POPPIN PARTY. I loved playing BanG Dream- and its incredible to think that Nanako, the actual singer in the anime, sings the OP, and is also from Poppin Party. And the ED, of all things is sung by the same VA who voices Kyouya. Like-. Lord. The OP quite literally corresponds with being set in the time the story was set in, 2006 and 2007. And that’s in a modern time of all places. The attention to detail to so many things impresses me. The art style, while it’s probably the most generic you could find in any day anime, it makes so much use of it with the subtle details of emotions and physical expressions. The small movements that are expressed and capitalised on, the minor fanservice that even somehow incorporates into the future plot. Shinoaki is obviously a big part of the story too. In the future when Kyouya jumps to meet his now wife, Shinoaki, she always had that despondent feeling and look to herself, and it was clear in the first moment he met her. But even then, she was so pretty and his daughter, Maki was honestly so fricking cute I thought I was going to die of a heart attack on the spot. Obviously, a majority of everyone that watched this series fell in love with Shinoaki as Kyouya nearly did, but he prioritised his life and everyone’s future, including his own. It was just- the aspects and tools used. The cuteness and life of being a father of such a fussy and cute daughter with such a caring wife troubled with her own struggles and complaints that she worries about with silence. The End- when Kyouya decided to go back, the entire afternoon and night where he stayed and loved his family, talking about Shinoaki’s drawing and how her love had slowly been revitalised by his own efforts in a game that had a butterfly effect from years ago. I love Shinoaki with her subtle cuteness and choosiness, she knows what she wants and she tries to get it. She doesn’t fuss with it too much, she’s clear, to the point and explanatory. She has a weirdly unique character to herself, beneath that Kansai/ country accent she’s so loving and wholesome it melts people’s hearts that her obliviousness causes few problems in reality. Nanako’s love going unrequited and her carrying on in the future, a plot arc and story where so much can happen and unfold. There’s so many open paths that can go so many ways and it feels completely natural and normal, like, “This is life, it’s what it is and can be. No more.”I can’t wait for a season 2. I can’t wait to see more of these characters. They’re interesting, charming and incapsulating. So many aspects, so many characters, whatever others think of the plot, it’s only one of the many strong points of this anime. The open time concept left with so many questions to be asked, and it makes that clear, it knows there are those questions and it leaves it open for the future. I can only assume that it will be explained. Maybe Roselia will jump in on the next OP. explain something this good. It’s just, enjoyable.

And even though it sounds like such an obvious point, many people, including myself, actually tend to...forget about the reason why that happens to be so important, often just as we would have needed to hear it the most. Maybe a person is doubting themselves and their abilities, or maybe they are just having pressure from the outside to be choosing a certain path, whatever the reason might be, the story in this anime will try to prove it otherwise.I can only highly recommend the show to anyone, who might be experiencing some doubts at a crossroads in their lives.Thank you for reading my review, and I hope that it was at least a little interesting. And also- not to forget, sorry Eiko and Aki, but Nanako has won best girl for me.. better luck next time hopefully in the second season.

Of course, achieving that is arduous and certainly, not everyone is lucky enough to have a life like that since youth. For those unlucky enough, living a life with regrets of youthful days, this anime surely hits home hard.The story revolves around a guy who regretted his life due to a choice he made in the past. Somewhat somehow he got time traveled into the past, 10 years ago,...where he can fix his mistakes hoping he could redo his life and live a life without regrets. But, this anime actually surprised me near the end, since I thought this going to be another mainstream cliche good for nothing anime.It turned out there's a twist to this anime. It's a very simple thing. Although our guy is given a 2nd chance in life, he learned something very important in life that would cost him a lot later down the road. It is that not everything can go that smoothly as one might think, despite having a 10 years experience advantage.The moral of the story, which I like the most, is that sometimes in life you just gotta do something that you want to do (by heart) despite it is not necessarily what you think or is good (by brain). This would be shown throughout the series, but it appears that no spoilers are preferred by the guidelines. The MC learned it the hard way, and finally found the key to living a life without regrets. And this applies not only to creators or artists. But it is applied to everyone.I particularly like profound ideas in anime, especially the ones that explore multiple possibilities and deal with regret. And for people who are feeling down in their not so youthful days, or are still in their youthful days but want to live a life without regrets, I think this anime is a good watch for you. This would of course especially appeal to the younger audience. where he can fix his mistakes hoping he could redo his life and live a life without regrets.

It draws you in and gets you invested with the characters, then throws a wrench into things.  The time travel mechanic is very similar to Erased (take that as you will, I like Erased) and the main character has great depth.  The main character has an opportunity to use his knowledge of the future to cheat the system and get a head in life, but he is more focused on helping his friends...and improving himself.At the end of episode 8 is where the story takes a major turn and shows the flaws of the MC and how he comes to terms with his past decisions.However, the decision MC makes in episode 12 kind of hurt his progression.  He was coming to terms on how he should interact with and support others, and when signs that his new approach is working he decides to (can;t say what he does, just watch it to understand this part).  I am mainly upset by how a specific character is effected by this decision.  I hope this character will return later in the series, but this depends on MCs decisions moving forward.If you are looking for a solid slice of life drama anime with some romance, this is a good watch.

What if I had taken path B rather than path A? Part of the reason why we find this such a compelling device for storytelling is because our own lives are fueled by the numerous decisions we make, both in and outside our control. So, when a narrative presents its characters with the opportunity to go back in time and take a new approach, or try to fix something, it plays upon that nagging question that has lingered in our minds every once in...a while when we’ve reflected on something. After all, we cannot rewind the clock in reality, so fiction affords us the chance to see the possibility exercised for dramatic purposes.""Remake Our Life!"" was the summer 2021 anime season’s newest take on the do-over story. Considering that it relies on the old cliché I spoke of, it already has a lot that it needs to accomplish. The time travel needs to feel justified, and the ensuing drama that happens from the resulting changes needs to come across the same way. But the overall setting and premise caught my attention more than anything else; especially as someone who teaches in the arts, I wanted to see what the series could potentially bring as far as working in the arts was concerned.Hashiba Kyouya is a former salaryman turned video game development worker who thoroughly hates his job, regretful of his decision not to attend an arts college like the so-called Platinum Generation creators he looks up to. He one evening chances upon a woman who also works in game development, Kawasegawa Eiko, and lands himself a new job. Despite getting off to a good start, their project is cancelled and he once again enters a melancholy. He awakens shortly thereafter ten years in the past, taking the opportunity to attend arts college instead of what he did before. While taking his life in this new direction, he becomes classmates and sharehouse mates with Shino Aki, Kogure Nanako, and Rokuonji Tsurayuki, the three Platinum Generation artists he adored. Kawasegawa herself is also a student at the school during this period of time. The artists face an uncertain future, but Kyouya comes armed with the foreknowledge of what each of them is capable of.While Kyouya may be the main focus of the narrative, the other three members of the house, as well as the group of four as a whole, need to function together well in order to carry the story. Kyouya is unfortunately the most uninteresting of the main characters, in part because there aren’t any particularly-noteworthy aspects to his character, be it through quirks or some other element that gives his personality some kind of spice. As the de facto leader of the four during the college years, he ironically is the one who has least amount of fleshing out. To an extent, this is slightly understandable; since his entire perspective zeroes in on idolizing the Platinum Generation-to-be members, he stands as a kind of everyman in their wake. There’s nothing noteworthy about him, but he’s not intended to be the noteworthy focus of the narrative. That said, the fact that he comes from the future, in essence, IS his trait, but as a quality that makes him stand out on his own, it does not contribute much in the way of endearing himself to us.But where Kyouya’s characterization falters, the other three manage to develop more effectively. Working on an artistic project is a form of sharing, but as a result, having your work be cut down or told that it’s not good enough because of various constraints can be absolutely brutal to handle. ""Remake Our Life!"" shows each of the main characters having their artistic pursuits getting questioned, flat-out rejected, or their moods demoralized, and does so in ways that are believably practical; the entire premise is set up on Kyouya’s ambitions to work in game development getting crushed, and the other three Platinum Generation characters all have moments in the show where they find themselves up against the wall. Whether that wall be their own hang-ups, mistakes, or whatever needs the project they’re working on calls for, it makes for good drama. Seeing them pick themselves back up after getting knocked down is cathartic. And when their endeavors do get completed, there is a satisfaction that comes with it.  One such event includes an overt nod to one of the most-famous musical sequences in all of anime, which feels appropriate given that the past segments of the show take place in the mid-2000s.Kyouya’s knowledge of the future that he brings with him, both who the Platinum Generation members will eventually become and his own expertise in his area, also contributes a fascinating aspect to the group’s dynamic. Since he is working with years of organizational experience, he intuitively is able to think on his feet and evaluate the numerous properties that go into artistic endeavors. So, when problems begin to manifest that the other members of the group aren’t prepared for or anticipate, he often acts as the idea house or lifeboat that keeps whatever it was they were working on afloat. It also gives his interactions with the other group members, along with others at the college, a kind of relentlessness that one could find quite admirable.But it is because of that relentlessness that makes the show get a little too close to harem territory, which intrudes itself into the show’s strengths. It’s not necessarily because it’s unreasonable; the romance element develops through the characters working and living together, and Kyouya’s seemingly-boundless belief in them acts as a beacon of light in the Platinum Generation’s crisis moments. Getting attracted to someone who has that kind of faith in you is, naturally, something one could expect. The problem rests in the fact that it begins to come at the price of focusing on the art creation aspect of the story. The drama works most effectively when we ourselves see and hear what it is that made Kyouya look up to the Platinum Generation, being given an “as it happened” glimpse into the fruits of their labor. That’s not to say the series cannot have romance, but that given how short the show is, it oversteps itself. By putting too much stock into romance, and especially among the women, it takes away from those creative opportunities. The show is divided between two paths and struggles to unite them.Those opportunities are only possible thanks to the time jump to the past. While they are one of the primary vehicles for setting up the drama within the show, they’re also part of a weakness with ""Remake Our Life!"" Because the time jumps themselves span upwards of ten years or more, it means there’s a lot of history of the characters, events, and dialogues that we are not privy to. It is appropriately disorienting for Kyouya as he tries to get his bearings each time it happens, it unfortunately means that certain events that should have transpired on-screen ultimately don’t, not even in flashback. Even though Kyouya is the main character that the drama follows, allowing the audience to see flashbacks through the eyes of the other characters could have helped tremendously. Especially considering that they are seemingly not aware of any time-travel shenanigans that have taken place, possibly having some gaps filled in, even if Kyouya himself would not be privy to witnessing or remembering them, was certainly possible.This problem of not showing particular events is also true for one of the show’s final pushes towards the end; the day of release for a product is not shown. At a moment where Kyouya is at his lowest, he witnesses a video from Nanako that ultimately gives him the inner motivation and fire to try and rectify the overarching problem he’s facing. Although this is framed as a moment where the momentum of the drama turns, we don’t actually get to see or listen to the video in full. It didn’t have to be a full-fledged three-minute masterpiece, but even listening to the provided song for, say, 30 seconds could have made the affect of the moment land with more panache. These pacing issues ultimately make ""Remake Our Life!"" feel like the latest victim of the single-season curse, of trying to get as much as possible into the twelve episodes that it comes at the cost of dramatic or thematic coherence.""Remake Our Life!"" has vestiges of being a particularly-good series, but cannot quite capitalize upon what’s there. The exploration of pursuing an artistic endeavor, especially in the wake of business or school, unfortunately gets a little too bogged down by the romantic element with all of the female characters. It’s well-animated and well voice-acted, and the Platinum Generation characters were a lot of fun, even if the pacing tends to move too disjointedly. If it had been perhaps sixteen episodes instead of twelve, I think quite a number of these issues could have been minimized, or happened more organically. For what we actually got, I still somewhat liked it even though it had flaws. The story managed to get the job done – just not as cleanly as it aspired to. If it ever does get a second season, and there has been no announcement about that at the time of this recording, I’ll give it a consideration. a while when we’ve reflected on something. After all, we cannot rewind the clock in reality, so fiction affords us the chance to see the possibility exercised for dramatic purposes.""Remake Our Life!"" was the summer 2021 anime season’s newest take on the do-over story. Considering that it relies on the old cliché I spoke of, it already has a lot that it needs to accomplish. The time travel needs to feel justified, and the ensuing drama that happens from the resulting changes needs to come across the same way. But the overall setting and premise caught my attention more than anything else; especially as someone who teaches in the arts, I wanted to see what the series could potentially bring as far as working in the arts was concerned.Hashiba Kyouya is a former salaryman turned video game development worker who thoroughly hates his job, regretful of his decision not to attend an arts college like the so-called Platinum Generation creators he looks up to. He one evening chances upon a woman who also works in game development, Kawasegawa Eiko, and lands himself a new job. Despite getting off to a good start, their project is cancelled and he once again enters a melancholy. He awakens shortly thereafter ten years in the past, taking the opportunity to attend arts college instead of what he did before. While taking his life in this new direction, he becomes classmates and sharehouse mates with Shino Aki, Kogure Nanako, and Rokuonji Tsurayuki, the three Platinum Generation artists he adored. Kawasegawa herself is also a student at the school during this period of time. The artists face an uncertain future, but Kyouya comes armed with the foreknowledge of what each of them is capable of.While Kyouya may be the main focus of the narrative, the other three members of the house, as well as the group of four as a whole, need to function together well in order to carry the story. Kyouya is unfortunately the most uninteresting of the main characters, in part because there aren’t any particularly-noteworthy aspects to his character, be it through quirks or some other element that gives his personality some kind of spice. As the de facto leader of the four during the college years, he ironically is the one who has least amount of fleshing out. To an extent, this is slightly understandable; since his entire perspective zeroes in on idolizing the Platinum Generation-to-be members, he stands as a kind of everyman in their wake. There’s nothing noteworthy about him, but he’s not intended to be the noteworthy focus of the narrative. That said, the fact that he comes from the future, in essence, IS his trait, but as a quality that makes him stand out on his own, it does not contribute much in the way of endearing himself to us.But where Kyouya’s characterization falters, the other three manage to develop more effectively. Working on an artistic project is a form of sharing, but as a result, having your work be cut down or told that it’s not good enough because of various constraints can be absolutely brutal to handle. ""Remake Our Life!"" shows each of the main characters having their artistic pursuits getting questioned, flat-out rejected, or their moods demoralized, and does so in ways that are believably practical; the entire premise is set up on Kyouya’s ambitions to work in game development getting crushed, and the other three Platinum Generation characters all have moments in the show where they find themselves up against the wall. Whether that wall be their own hang-ups, mistakes, or whatever needs the project they’re working on calls for, it makes for good drama. Seeing them pick themselves back up after getting knocked down is cathartic. And when their endeavors do get completed, there is a satisfaction that comes with it.

Kinda generic but its not offensive to watch. I actually sympathize with the MC and the ""depression spiral"" (my own term for it) that he goes through where he pessimistically thinks nothing good will happen to him. Its pretty relatable. The characters are fun and cute albeit some are a little too one-dimensional so far, I was really curious of how Aoi Koga will sound here and I think she\'s done a great job at not sounding like Kaguya-sama. Nao Toyama being the cool-headed beauty freaks me out a little bit lol because she has always been typecast as loud...or really cute girls like Chitoge or Karen.Overall pretty good, the first episode in particular being really great in establishing the characters and the motivation of the MC. All in a shockingly 55 minute opener. I predict this will be the next trend in isekai: men hitting their late twenties or mid thirties looking for a re-do of life and they get to live out their dreams.

When we have a big blunder or a situation that we regret, we naturally want to amend those mistakes, but sometimes, it’s just not possible, because time only goes forward. Time travelling, combined with school life, is a pretty interesting concept, and it makes me wonder, are youthful days truly better than adult days?Remake our Life, even though it’s unoriginal, was probably one of the better shows this season. I haven’t personally watched ReLIFE so I can’t compare the two, but here we go. This show provides us with some kinda sorta relatable...things people experience in college, combined with some time travel magic (because that’s very cool). Halfway through the show, I thought it got pretty terrible, but it rebounded in the final few episodes, once they started caring about the time travel!!!My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Comedic/Romance themes /20*Slight spoilers aheadSTORY: 18.5/25Yes, they redeemed themselves after Kyoya jumped back ahead 10 years. If they didn’t even address the time skip (which I was worried about), that would have make this show below a 5 for sure. After the second time skip was where the story took off a bit and the character development happened a bit more. When Kyoya thought he ruined the careers of the his friends from college, the pain he went through was definitely an interesting and decently executed part of the story. Otherwise, the middle of the show was not the best because it was all smooth sailing with not much of a conflict, and that wasn’t all that engaging. The finale left a few unanswered plot points, and unless there is a Season 2 coming, there were definitely some pacing issues.ART: 8.8/10Solid art, nothing out of the ordinary, but it’s a decent art style.MUSIC: 8.0/10Opening and ending are ok. Nothing to complain about for the sound.CHARACTERS: 14.0/20The downside of the character development was that it wasn’t balanced. Obviously, there are important, and less important characters in the story, but the amount of screen time Nanako and Tsurayuki had in the first half versus the latter half was definitely a stark difference. Kyoya’s development was executed decently, Kawasegawa’s as well, otherwise, Shinoaki, Nanako (kinda), and Tsurayuki could have had a bit more depth to them. Rather surface level in some aspects. I love Maki though!!!ENJOYMENT: 13.0/15Definitely an enjoyable show, especially in the second half.COMEDIC/ROMANTIC THEMES: 12.0/20Yes, the relationships are cute, but the problem with the romantic aspect of this show is that once again, there’s not much of a push factor behind it. Why does Shinoaki like Kyoya, why does Nanako like Kyoya, why does Kawasegawa like Kyoya? Because he’s hard working and smart? There has gotta be more of a spelling out of the romance in these types of shows. For me, I didn’t really care much for the romance aspect of the show. Not a lot of comedic moments stand out either.OVERALL: 7.43/10In a rather weaker anime season, yes, Remake our Life is one of the better ones this season with some good aspects, but some generic aspects. It had its moments, but I do wish they happened throughout the show.With all that said, there are many relatable moments in the show, that tells us to cherish life, at the high times, and the low, to be passionate and not lazy, because your goals all get achieved by your own work, not luck. Build friendships, have fun times, work hard, play hard, and most of all, be happy in every single thing you do, to live a life with little regret, because in this world, there’s no second chance, now is there? things people experience in college, combined with some time travel magic (because that’s very cool).

From the OP/ED to the sounds that simply play during any scene.The OP is good but I grew tired of it by the last few episodes. And the ED was all cool.Character:The best part about the anime, for me, is the main 5 characters. You have a good protagonist, the cute girl that is cute and has some Feels Moments, the great tsundere that ain't annoying and has charisma, the clumsy insecure girl that has is very cool and talented, and the lazy dude that is really cool and stuff. Their interactions are so good and real that it just is the best part for me.Enjoyment:It's a quite simple show that you can get involved with. I'd recommend this to anyone that likes time traveling to the past, university life, and adulthood thematics.

So maybe some emotions that the show tries to present didn't affect me as much as they would if I was more into it.

Some people may find it confusing because of the time skip and some lack of context in the first episode, but its not ruining the whole story and ruin the atmosphere. The dialogue and the story is well suited with each other,...with couple of well placed line in the scene.*Sound""Every well placed backround sound will bring impact to scene in every anime"". Its same with bokutachi no remake, it have well created song in some of the scene  and didnt oversaturated the atmosphere, just enough to bring impact to the scene.Lets talk about the op for the anime, its bland and didnt bring meexcitement when i hear it THE END.*ArtThe background art is enough to pleasing the eye with the color, the contrast and the lighting, also for the background character its kinda funny when they take close up shot their face is detail complete with eyes, nose and mouth, but for the long shot their face is just gone.The art for main character sometime i notice some inconsistent with the scale of the body but its a subtle changes of mistake*CharaterWhen we get to introduce to the character, we may found it cliche to have2 tsundere girls, this weird girl that doesnt know common sense and do what she only desire, typical i must become better and catch up with other, and a man that seem can be reliable and have a cool aura, but every charater have a reason for why they come to Osaka University of Arts and their goal to reach in the future.The characters have interesting relationship one to another creating good dynamic the one that doesnt end up dry.*OverallIts good, this anime is the kind that doesnt make me want to puke and ended up enjoying the journey. there is some set back in the story, art, sound and the characther but its minor and it didnt ruin the whole thing. with couple of well placed line in the scene.*Sound""Every well placed backround sound will bring impact to scene in every anime"".

I realize that when presented with the option to time travel, it feels like an appropriate response, but what would probably make for a better story would actually be sticking with his decision and dealing with the consequences. It kept me going until I realized that it would most likely end in a very confusing, disappointing way, which it did. Also, just a really awful cliffhanger with not a lot of stuff explained.Sound: 6Honestly,...the sound in this series wasn\'t really memorable.Character: 5The side characters were incredible. I really liked the passion, and the ups and downs of the side characters. I liked that their trust, their pain, and their success/failures felt palpable.What I didn\'t like is how the main character acted like his plan was to help them, when he just didn\'t get the future he wanted. All of his goals were incredibly specific, and he did everything with blinders on. It\'s like everything he did was counter productive to his actual ""goal"". He totally screws them over once, and then when that\'s not enough, he screws them over a couple more times unbeknownst to them.Enjoyment: 6I really liked this show up til probably about episode 9. I loved the ship choice he woke up with, but then I realized that this incredibly dynamic child and relationship he had with my character of choice were going to be used as a plot device, never to be revisited again. Looking at his relationship through the anime with Shinoaki, I felt that the two together really made the most sense, but unfortunately it doesn\'t appear that the end game has this in mind.Overall: 6The fact that it ended at a cliffhanger, the fact that my choice in ship was used as a very specific, heart-wrenching plot device, and the choice to retcon his consequences and delete a child (because lol) made me unable to enjoy the ending of this. I think that had the pacing been better, there had been a better reason to go back, or there hadn\'t been a lot of development right before that choice, I would have enjoyed this more. But the very last episode absolutely destroyed me, and not in a good way. the sound in this series wasn\'t really memorable.Character: 5The side characters were incredible.

With such a high average score and a kinda promising (if yet non-original) premiss I had high hopes for this one. Not _quite_ a complete waste of time but there definitely wasn\'t anything special about the story, whoever wrote this really could\'ve done something more with the whole remake-theme, and I got a renewed hope about halfway into the season that there _would_ be some interesting consequences or twist or whatnot to it! But no. Might\'ve as well just been a regular, plain slice-of-life school-series. Passes just above ""meh"" in my book. Wouldn\'t be surprised if...the novel is way more interesting. the novel is way more interesting.', 'tl;dr: An anime about trying to become a creator with a surprisingly overpowered protagonist and surprisingly more depth than expected.Bokurema is about the protagonist, Hashiba Kyouya, waking up and discovering he’s been sent ten years into the past, right when he was choosing which college to go to. This was a major turning point in his life, where he had to choose between becoming a generic salaryman, or choosing the riskier option and pursuing a career as a creator. He originally chose the safer option, but came to deeply regret it. Thus when given the option to retry, he of course chooses to go to...an arts college. Furthermore, it turns out the share house that he begins living at is full of creators that he admired in the future. Working with them, he hopes to grow to become an amazing creator as well.This anime has a big emphasis on media creation, primarily from the lens of an otaku. It reminds me a lot of Saekano, which is similarly a light novel series penned by an author famous for their work in visual novels. The story in Bokurema has a lot more variety than Saekano though, in that while in Saekano the focus is entirely on making a visual novel, here it shows the development of a short film, a visual novel, and a gacha game. Still, a lot of it is the same in that the protagonist is the producer and has to manage an artist, writer, and musician, and in the process the viewer gets a look a the various aspects of media creation. Some parts definitely felt kind of wrong through, such as the part where they just swap game engines effortlessly, which was beyond my suspension of disbelief threshold. I will also note that both are full of references to other otaku media, including each having a cover of a song from a classic anime.Another similarity between Bokurema and Saekano and is that it seems that the entire main cast is in love with the protagonist. The rest of the main cast in Bokurema is composed of: Shino Aki, an airheaded artist that very clearly falls in love with Kyouya; Kogure Nanako, a hesitant and easily embarrassed singer that very clearly falls in love with Kyouya; Kawasegawa Eiko, a cool honors student type that turns out later to secretly have fallen in love with Kyouya; and Rokuonji Tsurayuki, a talented writer and a guy that trusts and respects Kyouya so much that his fiancé gets worried that they’re secretly having a homosexual affair (they are not). The dynamic is very different from Saekano though in that most everyone is much more open about how much they love the protagonist, which gives it a very different from most school rom-com harem. If I had to say, I’d say it reminds me of an isekai harem. I think it does a great job at that, though you’ll have to be someone that can enjoy harem genre stories to appreciate it.Another way this anime resembles an isekai is that the protagonist has very strong gary stu energy. Kyouya is able to push through and solve problems effortlessly to an absurd degree. It honestly gives the same sort of vibes you get from overpowered protagonists in isekai at times so if you enjoy that sort of thing you’ll definitely find those moments really satisfying. However, what I was really impressed by was that in the last arc of the anime, it uses Kyouya being so competent to add quite a lot of depth to the narrative. It explores some pretty interesting themes, such as how people can have impact well beyond their intentions or how facing adversity and making mistakes is a core aspect in the development of creativity. It went in directions I really didn’t expect it to go in but I really enjoyed. Thus overall, I felt the final arc was a fantastic arc. However, it leaves a lot unresolved and ends on a cliffhanger so I can’t say I was entirely satisfied, but it’s a partial adaptation of a much larger story so I don’t really hold that against it.The art and animation in this are pretty solid. The character designs are pretty great and varied for the setting. The OP has a pretty good song and the ED song is decent, but what really stood out was that they have great visuals that show off the characters really well. The soundtrack worked well enough but was not particularly memorable. an arts college.

Any reviews from before that are really missing a lot of what the show is.Let\'s not bury the lead. This show starts off fairly standard but executed very intelligently and slowly it starts to become something very unique. The romance and relationships are mature and complex. We only start out looking trope-y but use that to evolve character, while the plot is something that plays beautiful homage to the time period of \'06-\'07....This is a show about creatives made by creatives. If you are yourself someone creative I think you\'ll identify and relate hardcore to the whole thing.That said, I felt from very early on that there is a lot of thought and emotion put into the story here. By episode 3 you hit the first emotional high that had me nearly crying. It\'s the kind of thing were you\'re just so taken by the passion the main characters bring that makes you feel right with them, the same kind of rush as something like a sports anime.But the show hides it\'s maturity and it\'s one of the few anime that will let some real relationships develop. Not like a shonnen where they just keep blushing thinking ""I hope they like me."" NO there\'s way more respect than that here.The time travel mechanic is, I think, done in a really smart way here. It only reminds you of it to forward the motivation of the main character and occasionally arms him with some insight. But the fact the this is 2006 is really used here and you may have extra appreciation for this if you\'ve seen Haruhi Suzumiya which debuted in \'06.Character designs are okay but the other dude, Tsurayuki, looks plain as a background character and the MC is pretty generic looking.I also want to note I really like the sound mixing. When something goes off screen and the audio pans with them it\'s done exceptionally well.Hopefully I wasn\'t too all over the place. My first review on MAL because I wanted to really shout out this show that I think is going under the radar. I was close to passing on it but I\'m so incredibly glad I didn\'t.The opening line was written after seeing episode 7 (wow) the rest til now was from after watching just five episodes. Having finished now I can say all the praise I gave it is true and the show only gets more impactful and interesting.I highly recommend this show and is my Anime of the Season.This is especially great for those in creative fields, they\'re making a video game here but I think anyone who CREATES can relate heavily. After all games are made by passionate people, and artists, writers, programmers, editors. Highly relatable show. This is a show about creatives made by creatives.

The theme is regret, like most time travel stories. However, the theme really isn't present in most of the episodes. The half of the show is basically living with people and building a harem.The show starts with mc feeling regret, so he finds himself back in time. He choose the other path in life, in hope to be successful and live a happy life. You'd think this show is about struggling in school because he lack talent, or focusing on the time travel aspect, but no it's just mc flexing his skills in everything. The plot...isn't that bad, I just thought there could be more potential to this show.For the first half, characters are introduced, harem is being built and their doing something as creators (oh yeah the show is set in a creator collage). They each have different talents and mc nurtures them so they can grow. However, he overstepped and now they depend on him too much, this is a really good plot point imo. His friend quit, which led him to feel regret once more, so time travel again, but to the future.The second half of the season happened, which explored the theme, the world he's living in is worse that the initial world, no one is as successful as they were before. So, he lives with it, bearing the responsibility of the downfall of his peers. Then, he flexes his skills some more, we get wife and kid, and a new mindset. Which was really good imo, he thought he was some hero, saving people, lifting them up and developing their talents, but he only made their lives worse. This is something that isn't explored much in anime, because typically, mc's presence makes everyone's lives better, so this was pretty good writing. However this show is no short of problems.So the problems, like I said, the show doesn't focus on the theme. Next,is pretty bland characters, the mc being good at everything and the 2 girls depending on him. Also some parts are kinda pointless, Tsurayuki's fiancée was pointless and didn't add to the over all plot, and it only took 1 1/2eps. But you know what pointless plot took 3 eps, the future arc, sure he saved the game and did amazing things, but for what? It's pointless of you're just gonna throw it an go back in time. So yeah.Basically, this show just another dorm life anime, which has harem elements and is pretty decent. isn't that bad, I just thought there could be more potential to this show.For the first half, characters are introduced, harem is being built and their doing something as creators (oh yeah the show is set in a creator collage).

A good series that\'s worth your time, even if harems aren\'t usually your thing.Story: Kyoya is a struggling and unhappy video game developer who wakes up one day 10 years in the past, allowing him to change a crucial turning point in his life, that he decided to play it safe and get a boring office job instead of going to art school and following...his passion.  He immediately connects with the writer, singer and artist that formed the so-called ""Platinum Generation"" that he admired so much in the future, as well as his now college-aged former boss.  This all starts out as pure wish fulfillment.  Kyoya is getting to act out his dream, creating movies and games with the people he respects when they first started out.  And furthermore, he\'s frighteningly competent as the director and leader of the group, even without the benefit of future knowledge and experience.  He always knows exactly how to guide the team to success.  But this gives way to a darker side in the second half of the series, where the other characters become dependent on him and he\'s forced to confront the fact that he\'s living out his dream at the expense of their futures as superstar creatives.  It\'s a very interesting turn, and one that elevates this series tremendously.  The more philosophical second half that deals with questions of agency and dependence is very well written and more complex in the ideas it presents than you typically see from anime.  It\'s fair to say that it\'s a slow starting series, but the slow start is necessary for the direction that it takes things.  If you 3 episode rule it, you\'ll probably wonder why it\'s being praised so much, but you\'ll understand if you stick with it.  I was also impressed with how it didn\'t tie things up neatly, with everything going right for the protagonists in the end.  Mistakes were made, and there\'s no easy fix to some of them.  The ending emphasizes that it\'s what we do after making those mistakes that counts.Audio/Visual: It has a nice visual style and the character designs are attractive and have a somewhat unique look.  The VA work is mostly strong, though Shinoaki\'s voice is a bit too childlike for her.  It makes up for what it lacks with a strong OP and good use of music overall.  In particular, there\'s an excellent scene of Nanako singing a cover of God Knows from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya that went viral for good reason during the airing of the series.Characters: The main character Kyoya carries things in a lot of ways.  The anime does a good job of highlighting his introspection and internal thoughts, which are often difficult for a series to translate from light novel to anime.  His struggles with whether and how much it\'s okay for him to interfere with other people\'s lives during this second attempt at his own life are compelling and he\'s easy to like and root for.  The other main characters are Shinoaki, Nanako, Eiko and Tsurayuki.  Nanako gets the most development and has the best romantic chemistry with Kyoya, especially during the mini-arc where she tries to become more confident as a singer, culminating in the previously mentioned musical number.  Eiko, his boss from the future, is a strong second place, though her tsundere act feels a bit forced at times.  Shinoaki and Tsurayuki get the least attention, which feels odd considering how strongly the series pushes the romance angle between Kyoya and Shinoaki.  Tsurayuki feels like an afterthought too often, though he is ultimately pivotal to the plot and one of the main drivers of ending of the series, so it\'s not like he\'s totally forgotten.  Overall it\'s a bit of a mixed bag, but there are enough strong and memorable characters to make up for the ones that are lacking. his passion.

Eiko, his boss from the future, is a strong second place, though her tsundere act feels a bit forced at times.  Shinoaki and Tsurayuki get the least attention, which feels odd considering how strongly the series pushes the romance angle between Kyoya and Shinoaki.  Tsurayuki feels like an afterthought too often, though he is ultimately pivotal to the plot and one of the main drivers of ending of the series, so it\'s not like he\'s totally forgotten.  Overall it\'s a bit of a mixed bag, but there are enough strong and memorable characters to make up for the ones that are lacking.', 'Fundamentally, the desire to go back and redo your past is something that resonates with everyone. As a current STEM student who regrets not pursuing their artistic tendencies more and is looking at a boring life of work ahead like Kyoya, and who knows a lot of others in the same position, Bokutachi no Remake hit home for me.Fundamentally, BnR is the generic ""time travel slice of life"" anime with all its associated tropes, but that doesn\'t make it bad. It actually executes said tropes well. It has all your typical coming of age, maturing themes and does them all well. Kyoya is rewarded...and punished for his mistakes despite his knowledge of the future, and his future knowledge is just an advantage and not the ""win at life"" cheat that you might think it is.That said, a few things stopped me giving this series a 10.1. The romance.Boy oh boy.Fundamentally, the characters are good characters. Most of them are fairly fleshed out, decently developed, and have fun interactions that make sense in the context of their art work together. Kyoya has 3 love interests: Shino, Nanako, and Kawasegawa.I said ""most of them are fairly fleshed out"". Well, guess which one has the fewest meaningful interactions with Kyoya? Yup, spoilers, the girl he\'s revealed to end up with in the time jump forward to 2020.Let\'s recap shall we?Kawasegawa: the most ""meta"" choice in that she was the only one that gave him a chance when he was a jobless bum, his role model and mentor. The one who he arguably ""works"" the most to win the affection of and who has the biggest impact on his new future self.Nanako: Someone he works alongside of both at university and at work. Who reveals her weakness to, only for the two of them to work through it together.Shino: Uh, he likes her art I guess.Don\'t get me wrong. Shino isn\'t a *bad* character. I\'d even say she\'s a good character. But in terms of her development with Kyoya and her own personal development as a character? Nope. She\'s blown out the water. Little internal struggle compared to the other two (beyond what Kyoya\'s wrought through his OP hacks). Few interactions before the big ""I like you"". Nada.It would\'ve been far, far better to have kept the ending to the romantic subplot a secret or suggest its fluid (that whoever he ends up with is still subject to his actions rather than being set in stone). As it is, it\'s a half baked tease of a harem anime stuffed into the background where 2 brilliant characters suffer.2. The ending.This is going to be much shorter. Despite everything I\'ve written above this, I was going to give it a 10 instead of a 9 right up until I saw the last episode. It was just... ok?Here\'s the long and short of it. It\'s out of place. It feels like a mid-season episode. It would\'ve been fine if it ended on his return to his past after the heartfelt farewell to his wife and child, but no. This is a case of ""don\'t show or tell"", aka, a cliffhanger.The 12th episode gives us 10 minutes of him going round fixing stuff as he did the entire season, except stuffed in 10 minutes, culminating with his meeting with the other guy. It\'s simply unsatisfying given that we aren\'t given a major cliffhanger, nor a resolution. Maybe it was envisioned as a 13 episode season, I don\'t know.All in all, good anime overall. Hit me *hard*. But there were just a couple of things that BnR didn\'t hit its stride in when looking at it up close. Nevertheless, extremely enjoyable in any case, for a genre that gets little love (anime/manga about university students and young adult workers).

Would recommend.', 'Remake Our Life focuses on a struggling video game developer named Kyouya Hashiba finding himself whisked 10 years back into the past when he was enrolled as a college student. This event leads him to encounter and befriend three creative talents whom served as his inspiration in his efforts from the present to become a successful game developer.Remake Our Life offers focus on both the challenges involved with creative projects like movies and video games, as well as the developments of Kyouya and his friends. While focus on creative developments isn’t new with an anime series, Remake Our Life still does a great job...believably delving into the challenges involved with planning and development of creative works as Kyouya’s projects often have him in challenging situations that compromise the quality of a project. This leads him to have to plan out how to overcome the present crisis through any available means to meet deadlines and ensure a quality work is provided, demonstrating his project management skills. This rings true for creative projects in real life as challenging situations with the development of a creative work can lead plans to have to be changed or removed all together to meet any expected deadlines for the project development’s timeline, especially in regards to TV shows, movies, and video games.The series also explores Kyouya and his friends in their developments as Remake Our Life takes the time to flesh them out and explore whatever issues they are dealing with in their personal lives. Outside of Kyouya using his time leap to attempt improving his future, his friends each have their varying issues to deal with for the creative careers they are aiming for. This shows Kyouya that in spite of how talented each of them are in their different creative outlets, they are still individuals with their own personal struggles they have to learn to overcome in their endeavors in spite of how much he idolizes them. The time travel gimmick also comes into play when the series later explores how each of Kyouya’s friends are impacted from his involvement in their lives while in college and how this affects Kyouya’s future aspirations. Unfortunately, the series does end inconclusively during a major point in its storyline due to the usual culprit of the title’s light novel source material still being ongoing during the time of its airing.Besides the lack of a proper ending, I also took issue with the title’s occasional milking of fanservice with members of the female cast usually seen in states of undress. For a slice-of-life drama, it felt out of place to add this to the series and would take time away from the serious focus it provided on its characters and the various projects that Kyouya and his friends were involved in.Despite some hiccups, I’ll admit that I was engaged with Remake Our Life thanks to its believable exploration of the developments of Kyouya and his friends, as well as the various challenges that each undergo with the different creative outlets they aspire to be in and the various projects they take on together. If you have interest in a series exploring the challenges involved with developing a creative work you aspire to work on, I’d recommend this as a solid series to dabble into. believably delving into the challenges involved with planning and development of creative works as Kyouya’s projects often have him in challenging situations that compromise the quality of a project.

The word “isesaki” will either inspire or infuriate anime fans depending on who really enjoyed 2012’s Sword Art Online or Re:Zero or are just tired of half of each anime season being another trip to a distant fantasy land.  As the fantasy side of this genre has had its towel ringed of every drop of originality, what about the drama and shenanigans of using a second...chance to re-do things in your own world?  Alright, I’ll bite, Remake Our Life.Kyouya Hashiba is a late 20s man on the arduous trail of becoming one of the covetous cogs in the video game development machine.  His internship with a popular game studio has his hopes high before the opportunity ends to budget cuts.  Feeling like he’s not only wasted his traditional degree but most of his life on chasing a dream that he cut short by not going to the arts college he had an acceptance letter to, Kyouya moves back in with his parents.  After overlooking one of his favorite game development groups, Platinum Generation, he succumbs to sleep after a long bus ride home.  When he awakes, he’s 10 years in the past, right before his pivotal decision on which college to go to.  With the knowledge of the future and what it foretold, he embarks to an Arts College to shape his current timeline into the life he always wanted and maybe finding his way closer to the developers he envied so much.In most situations where someone would travel back to the past with years of knowledge ahead of their cohorts, one might play the game and become rich quickly, or play out scenarios to better themselves, or save someone or something that will eventually be in trouble.  And well, you’re right on two occasions.  Kyouya goes into his new world looking to take the trials and tribulations of cutting his teeth in the game industry and using that drive to quickly garner experience and work his way to a Platinum-like position in the industry.  During one of his classes, he spots his old boss, Eiko Kawasegawa, now just a budding art student like himself.  When Kyouya enters his shared living quarters, he finds himself over the course of a few episodes and a-ha moments to be with the not-quite-yet members of Platinum Generation: underachieving artist Aki Shino, aspiring singer and actress Nanako Kogure, and naturally-gifted writer Tsurayuki Rokuonji.  Seeing possibilities piling up like the amount of cute college girls in this anime: Kyouya now spends his time working into the group to become an integral part of the team’s initial success, leading to the life he dreamed about.The first few episodes lay down the groundwork of what will be no surprise, a run-of-the-mill high school-but-not-really slice of life filled with various whatabouts around the arts and designs of what goes into making multimedia projects.  Various tidbits of photography, music, art, and film get an anime “Consider the Following” Bill Nye session showing specific doodads of each moniker with behind-the-scenes like montages and what each medium can bring to the table.  If you ever had an interest in this field, and if you’re watching Anime I gotta figure you do, it’s a neat little info dump here and there.  But where Remake Our Life grabs your wrist and keeps you in the shot is the individual drama co-signed to each of the main characters and how Kyouya finds himself in the middle of it all.Kyouya in his past life was a fixer, shown with his countless nights at his intern position working to fix and coordinate problems when others couldn’t, and uses this to a ridiculous degree in the current college run.  Kyouya, armed with years of previous knowledge, has the drive and info to tackle nearly every issue thrown in his lap, becoming not only a lifesaver for each roommate but a good friend in the process.  Each student comes to terms with a pressing issue: self-doubt towards their chosen career, the stress of becoming better, the crippling weight of financial burdens, and Kyouya comes swooping in like an answer sheet swiped from the teacher’s desk.  These moments shine brightest with Remake’s stout writing for each character.  The issues cut deep and are immediately relatable, and the moments in between and the payoffs are heart-warming and outstanding.  But the amount of luck and success rate Kyouya has is almost comical.  He almost never misfires, eventually lifting the spirits of all around him and even courting feelings and romantic interests with a few of the girls he frequents being around, even if he himself is not trying down that path.Kyouya is doing everything right, he’s in the driver’s seat of his life, he’s the fucking man.But if you remember anything from Ashton Kutcher’s 2004 epic saga The Butterfly Effect (you really shouldn’t.), you’ll know that going back in time and messing with stuff is a no-no, and there are consequences to those actions.  And as quickly as the highs got their highest, the lows got their lowest and the shitstorm hits quick.  Which brings me to Remake’s weirdest but most necessary inclusion: where everything started to go almost too well for Kyouya, the fork in the road hits hard, and as he comes to realize his want to fix everyone’s problems eventually will shake how his remembrance of his late 20s plays out, we’re introduced to a character who just...whoompfs Kyouya 10 years farther into the future.  Who is this character?  Why do they have this power?  No idea.  Not explained.  ...Kinda frustrating.What it DOES do, is very swiftly shifts Remake Our Life from a slice-of-life re-doer story into a more layered supernatural yet possibly psychological dramedy, and it does it in the span of about 10 minutes in one of the season’s later episodes.  It’s a crazy tonal shift that revitalizes what was becoming a very stale success story and injects just a whole bunch of interesting possibilities as to what happened and why it happened.The future paints a very detailed picture of Kyouya’s use of his knowledge in a past not his own.  Each character's celebrated ups and diminished downs are correlated to Kyouya and his constant grip on their future, as noticeable as fingerprints smudged on a film reel.  And while Kyouya’s perceived future isn’t classified as a bad one per se, the day-to-day interactions with Kyouya and a significant other are very heartwarming and cause a very realistic rift in wanting to leave, the differences in what he has to what he wanted is very evident and the mental deterioration of his actions forces his hand to fix what he broke rather than leaving his new future as, and this you’ll hear a lot, “nothing else we can do here.”For better or worse, Season 1 of Remake Our Life feels like an elongated introduction to the real part of the story it wants to tell.  But as of this writing, there is no Season 2 announced and the author has publicly detoured needy watchers to the light novel to continue the story.  A lot of the major plot lines: the introduction and understanding of the supernatural being that is taking Kyouya for this ride, the continued puzzle piece matching of keeping Platinum Generation on its desired course, and all the glorious glorious docking of potential character ships, are left entirely unanswered.  The pacing issues may cause whiplash and without a real payoff the ride may feel a little unwarranted.  But I really enjoyed what I watched!  The characters are fleshed out well, the emotion is very real and the moments of jubilation and despair feel well-constructed.  Above all, it was an interesting and enjoyable journey through a well-used and established genre.  Here’s to hoping for a Season 2 in a reasonable timeframe (here’s looking at you SNAFU Season 3), and some answers to some very interesting plot points for Kyouya and his journey through self-reflection and acceptance. chance to re-do things in your own world?

WTFIsshhThe character name Hashiba Kyoya have difficulty in their life like regular people in the company game.He travel back to the past where he can choose to be in Art Course in University. If I had the chance. I also want to remake my life and change everything.This anime shown the happiness, love story,...sadness, difiiculty in slice of life anime.

Do not mistake this for it being bad. However, this is compared to ReLife a lot. The two are different.ReLife actually has an anime ending that follows the manga somewhat. This is like the introduction to how the world will be fleshed out and leaves it open for a season 2. If it gets one.So we got Hashiba Protag-Kun man who is out here living his worst life when he gets hit by... NOTHING! He just wakes up 10 years in the past and decides to change his course of life...to live with out regrets. Simple and Clean - Utada HikaruWhen he was older he idolized this group of people called the Platinum Generation and wanted to be like them. Well guess what happens when he goes back in time to his new college and settles into his new share house... HE MEETS THE IDOL OF HIS DREAM! The artist Shinoaki who was behind much of the art that inspired him. It is not a spoiler, trust me. They overly spell it out and then reveal it by Episode 1. He will go through his new life meeting new people and becoming the best version of himself. How will his meddling in the lives of others truly affect what happens from now on? That is what this anime is about.ReLife was about taking drugs to look younger in order to get your groove back and trying not to fall for or bang a highschool girl should she fall in love with your teenage body. The message behind that anime was better than I worded it. Also, It was more interesting than this. Time travel is nothing new and something unique needs to be done to set it apart.Is Murder involved? No. That would be Erased. Is there a time loop effect in play? No. That would be Re:Zero. Is this an experiment to save some one? No. That would be Steins;Gate. This is more... If you go back in time, it will alter the future! Spooky! Oooooo! So... The usual time travel plot. It isn't bad. The story is good and characters serviceable and Shinoaki is freaking adorable but... It won't stand out. If there are more seasons to flesh it out, then that can change everything. Stand alone. Nah. Glad I watched it though.Story: 8 - It is very good in spite of the meh time travel plot. You will enjoy it, unless protag-kun bothers you. Then it is a hard sell.Art: 10 - Art is amazing. Enough said.Sound: 8 - Forgettable OST but a banger Opening. The OST is inoffensive but still has some solid songs. Forgettable though sadly. You will like em when you hear em, but don't expect to hum them with out listening to the OST frequently.Character: 7 - Protag-kun is basic as most basic brown hair romcom slice of life anime are. So... Either you love him or Don't care. The others are great enough. Shinoaki is best girl. I said it. Fight me.Enjoyment: There are times I felt it was a slog to sit through but 85% of the anime run time was a blast and held my attention. So. Good job.Overall: An awkward yet well paced anime with a basic premise and a good take on it. The characters will win you over, even if the MC doesn't. Great opening that is catchy as hell and I do love the character designs. I just think it is great that Ichigo found her way into a new anime after Darling in the FranXX. to live with out regrets.

You will like em when you hear em, but don't expect to hum them with out listening to the OST frequently.Character: 7 - Protag-kun is basic as most basic brown hair romcom slice of life anime are. So... Either you love him or Don't care. The others are great enough. Shinoaki is best girl. I said it. Fight me.Enjoyment: There are times I felt it was a slog to sit through but 85% of the anime run time was a blast and held my attention. So. Good job.Overall: An awkward yet well paced anime with a basic premise and a good take on it. The characters will win you over, even if the MC doesn't. Great opening that is catchy as hell and I do love the character designs. I just think it is great that Ichigo found her way into a new anime after Darling in the FranXX."", '*minimal to no spoilers* I honestly have never written a review before on this site, but this show meant a lot to me, and I feel like it is grossly underrated. The plot to this show is sure, nothing special if you look at it. Where the show excels is telling a rather basic story of a failed adult who gets a second chance in life. The characters feel real, even when you look at the narrative of the group that surrounds the main are very talented individuals. This show does a lot better than shows rated much higher in the same genre, and even...in a rather boring season was rather overlooked.I would love to see season two, and in fact that is what I am really hoping for, and would suggest any slice of life fans to give this show a chance. in a rather boring season was rather overlooked.I would love to see season two, and in fact that is what I am really hoping for, and would suggest any slice of life fans to give this show a chance.', ""This is an insult to life.

He even seems to stop and consider this, crying while hugging his daughter seeing her and his wife lovingly send him off to work, there's no real reason why he should do this, no point or purpose.

A desire to go back and get involved with the heroes you look up to, chase dreams you were too scared to before. In that sense, it seems pretty clear that this series fills something of a power fantasy.The first few episodes do very little to challenge that notion. The main character comes off as a pretty typical visual novel type of protag, from his calm demeanor to his slightly shaggy brown hair, to his somewhat non-specific character flaw of pessimism in the first episode, he\'s very easy to...project onto. In the early episodes, it seems like he\'s just making everything better for the people he meets after travelling back in time, but the seeds are planted and cracks show every here and there.The character interactions lead to a number of really poignant scenes, and I think the English Dub cast did a really good job (Although, Kyouya\'s VA doesn\'t seem like he\'s used to cussing, the ""damn it""s come off like a child swearing for the first time). However, in between a lot of the important scenes, the show kinda feels like it\'s just playing the tropes. Kyouya gets smacked for being in the sightline of boobs more than once, and every woman seems magnetically attracted to him for some reason. if you are the type to roll your eyes at corny, B-tier Visual Novel dialogue, these scenes will make you cringe out of your skin, but I think it\'s intentional.

in the future the plot is much worse, the new characters are boring and uninteresting and there is no those great student life vibes that were in the first half of the series.The only thing that is good there is an adult Kawasegawa with a cute new hairstyle.But when in the last episode the action returns to the past everything seems to fall into place again and its suddenly interesting to watch again.But, despite all the disadvantages, its good anime to watch if there is no better option.I would rate it 5/10 What else i liked: how the main character does not give up and always tries to find a way out so that there are no regrets in the future -

Nevertheless, it\'s always risky to write that kind of protagonist because the character itself will become an unlikeable one to several readers who views the protagonist as a ridiculous being despite the realistic stuff happening around the said protagonist.Kyoya, being an obvious self-insert protagonist, has become one of the most condescending characters I\'ve ever watched. Regardless of the contriving message on him evading a quarter-life crisis that\'s just been easily resolved with a time travel ability from one of the characters he meets later on, I see Kyoya being an actual villain at the end of the series. I know I sound ridiculous, but all I see from this adaptation are his words not matching up with his actions. Whatever Kyoya does in his ""Reset Past"" is somewhat patronising that makes him a hypocrite. The final episode has take the cake for he says he regrets doing this, but he still does the most despicable thing he has ever done: erasing someone\'s life from existence even though she didn\'t do anything wrong.Also, the fanservice in the first half seems out of place that it somewhat makes it more obvious that there\'s a reason why self-insert protagonists, especially the male ones, are frowned upon in the writing department. Though I\'m satisfied with the second half not having random fanservice scenes, the execution of a serious story that revolves around making/creating all kinds of mediums of the entertainment industry has been watered down, leaving me feel dull on how it\'s presented.Its presentation of how each ""creation of entertainment stuff"" is explained with 90% of all the runtime made up of heavy exposition dump via the protagonist\'s narration. I don\'t understand how this kind of presentation can be making a valuable message be memorable in many viewers\' minds feel fresh as long as it can be. Now I know why Japanese viewers\' thoughts on this anime adaptation is poorly received because the storytelling elements are weak to deliver any emotional impact due to knowing Kyoya is a selfish protagonist with a savior complex despite in the final few episodes, he was saying out loud that he won\'t be that anymore. Nevertheless, I\'m planning to read the LN someday just to know whether this adaptation is a very compressed one.Still, having a one cour doesn\'t excuse poor execution of the intended storytelling for I\'ve seen some one-cour series that has managed to get a high score from myself. In the end, I feel like ROL reminds me of that okay K-drama called ""Start-up"", but the former score being half of the latter one.I can only recommend this if you don\'t care about the heavy exposition dumps that has led to 10% ""action louder than words"" frames feel unfulfilling, if you just like the female characters being cute waifus and/or if you just want an anime adaptation where the storytelling elements are very easy on your mind.

A key problem is that both of those shows were about 25 episodes long and this had 12 episodes, including the most worthless recap in anime history. So let's start with the first problem, it felt rushed. The writing, the weird recap, certain characters. Even the moving emotional scenes felt fast paced, despite being well done in certain areas.The rushed factor is only part of the problem with the story. The whole thing loses confidence as...time goes on. It's really tough to explain without spoilers but I, at least, found myself wondering what kind of story they were telling. Are they telling a story of regret & nostalgia, or are we just following around this guy during his life? The central time travel mechanic is a REAL problem that I can't go into as well. There's even dialogue which alludes to chunks of story being axed from the final version. Don't worry though, the story makes sure there's enough time for every girl (and potentially the other dude to) to fall completely in love with the protagonist. This annoys me both as a human and as an asexual.Let's move onto the characters themselves. Honestly they were all really well rounded and had real potential, you could put them as the protagonist of their own series with little fleshing out and it'd work, very few characters are there to server the purposes of the protagonist, or feel 2 dimensional. I have a minor issue with the fact that everyone felt a little too beautiful, but that's a weird complaint, I realise that.The art and sound are great, but it feels like it's borrowing a lot from other anime's. Credit where credit is due though, they helped keep me watching.I came out of this feeling frustration as my primary emotion. There's such potential here, and with a longer run it could have fleshed out each part a bit more. Maybe a second season would help, and despite my reservations I would watch a second season. I never read the LN or Manga so I can't comment on it as an adaptation, but as an anime it disappointed me. At least it seemed to be trying to do something though, not another soulless isekai money machine. That's a separate rant though. time goes on.

Thanks to his help, in an unintended way, his friends lost their passion for what they used to do. this causes big changes in the future.I will be honest with you, at the end of episode five I almost dropped the show.

Basically this very competent dude made the wrong choices in his life like most of us but he gets to redo it. And now knowing what he did wrong he does everything right helps everyone and has all the anwsers just by repeating his motto ""there\'s always a way"". How such a talented, diligent and competent person failed in his previuous life? He was still young. And now we get to watch he being a regular good worker, that\'s one of the worst idead i\'ve ever...seen. I dont dislike the main protagonist as a person, great for him being such a flawless perfected person but its not entertaining at all to watch how smooth his normal life goes without any real struggles because again his previous life somehow gave him all the answers. I\'m 26 and i know much more than i knew 10 years ago but that is going way to far... Anyway this show is boring af seen.

For some reason author decided to screw it all up in the last two episodes.Warning: plot spoilers ahead. I can\'t really explain what I didn\'t like without them.The MC works in game industry. He had a couple bad projects and wondered if his life would be better if he went to art school instead of university. It\'s not that he has any passion for art or anything, it just seems to him that it would be more fun/easier.So, for no apparent reason, he goes back in time, gets into art...school and spends couple years there.

His fourth friend, Kawasegawa, is in worse position than before and about to get fired for mistakes of her boss.Any half decent person would try to fix it - undo the whole thing and solve his own problems with his own efforts.

Him ""being with everyone"" badly screwed up ""everyone\'s"" lives.So, the guy got a time leap, screwed up the past, jumped ahead, looked at horrifying results and wants to continue? Why? How many more time leaps it would take for him to make something of himself? How many more lives he is willing to screw up in the process? Why on Earth he even given an option?Before the last two episodes it was just a usual escapist SoL anime with MC reaping undeserved benefits of time travel gifted to him for no reason. He is just a normal guy who got lucky. And then he turns into a complete scumbag. I suppose author decided that SoL anime needs a message of some sort.

Chobits,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59/Chobits,"[""As you might have noticed already, almost all the reviewers give this series a 10 on everything. This is offcourse not without reason. It performs top notch in every aspect. Chobits kept me entertained from the first milisecond to the last.Story:The story is simply amazing. It has a bit of everything going from romance to suspense. Although the story is quite slow it doesnt feel like it. Every episode shows the devolopment of the characters in a serious but also a funny way. The first episodes will give you a big laugh, but the mood swings over to a more romantic view the more it...develops.This show is probably something you haven't seen before, the characters evolution is something quite special. To prevent spoilers you'll have to find that out for yourself.The fact remains that the evolution of Chii is the most funny thing in the whole show. It's like she starts off like a 3 year old child knowing hardly anything about the world and needs to learn everything. And without commen sense she does alot of things a normal person would reconsider.Art:The style of the picture in this anime is great, they don't overdo it with drawing to much details but it is simply amazing. Everything you see will draw out the correct emotion that goes with it. The characters are made really well.Sound:Same as the art it is great, going from the intro to the story. The music fits the parts in the story really well.Character:As I said in the story, the characters develop really good. Sometimes you do feel how something is going to develop but you're not really sure. The show really does show a few unexpected things but after you see them they are explained thouroughly with a background of &quot;how&quot;. This really adds a + to the show.Enjoyment:This show kept me entertained from the start till the end. I finished the show in 1 day because I just couldn't stop watching it.Overall:If you like a romance with lots of humour but also serious parts, then this is the anime for you.

Then it learns to talk to him, so he can tell it all sorts of loser things and perv out on it because real girls won't touch his shorts with a ten-foot pole. The End.What a load of crock this was.The...characters were DUMB. SERIOUSLY! Hideki has to be the most unexceptional guy ever to be animated. His one talent is being disgusting and bland but so stupid that everyone goes, 'Aw, he's so sweet.' He reminds me of a dog that keeps running into the door--aw, it's so cute. And Chii had NO PERSONALITY. I am sure moe fans loved her because all she did was stay half-naked and go 'Chii~' Right. I can't understand why any girl would like this. What lesson is this teaching? Girls, the only way a guy would like you is you stay in your underwear and say only one word to him! Preferably that one word will be 'Panty'.The only fabulous thing about this was the music. The OP rocks. Other than that, this was an unfabulous trash pile of an anime. characters were DUMB. SERIOUSLY! Hideki has to be the most unexceptional guy ever to be animated.

Let me step back for a moment and say above all else I like anime with good stories and interesting characters.  Chobits fails for me due to weak characters, in particular Hideki and Chii.Hideki is way too flat and lack sufficient depth.  In addition, he is a joke character, we don&rsquo;t laugh with him, we laugh at him.  Because of this it makes it hard to empathize/engage with a character like Hideki.  This is why we have token male side...characters who take the joke character role.  Shinbo, Hideki&rsquo;s male friend clearly doesn&rsquo;t take this role, in fact they should have made him the main character as his story is far more interesting than Hideki and Chii&rsquo;s.  In addition, to Hideki, Chii&rsquo;s character is no better.  There is nothing to her, memory erased and the mentality of a child.  She is the default love interest for Hideki and its beyond me as to how Hideki falls in love with Chii.  Maybe because she cute? maybe for most, but I dislike the character design for Chii.  The blank eyes are what killed it for me.  Male designs were fine as well as the rest of the cast.Much of the praise for Chobits is in the comedy, well at least that&rsquo;s what I hear.  For me the jokes were way too repetitive, in particular the jokes at the expense at Hideki.  For example, Hideki is a pervert with too much porn/gravure that Chii finds.  Hideki thinks perverted thoughts again and is an idiot that over reacts to everything.  This extreme lightheartedness and extremely repetitive comedy was made it hard for me to finish the first half of the series.As for the story itself, I didn&rsquo;t think there was sufficient foreshadowing.  So when the story starts going in the second half it feels a bit tacked on.  In addition, they failed to keep up the momentum by jumping from thread to thread.  Simply put the plot structure was a bit messy and Hideki and Chii aren&rsquo;t strong enough characters.  I guess if Chobits were to be considered a slice-of-life anime the structures would had worked, however that would require more complex characters.There were parts I did like, in particular, Shinbo/Shimizu&rsquo;s and Ueda&rsquo;s stories.  Both showed the sadder side of the theme of the show &ldquo;love for a robot.&rdquo;  The relationship between Yuzuki and Minoru was touching, albeit not as interesting as the above characters.  However, there is something seriously wrong when the side character are far more interesting that the main characters.Chobits had quite a bit of potential, dealing with interesting and complex themes.  Sadly they didn&rsquo;t use these ideas enough and the Hideki and Chii characters were too weak to carry the show.

Its quite hard to get engaged in an anime when you can&rsquo;t empathize with the characters.', 'Romance is my favorite genre of anime, so naturally when my friends told me Chobits was a good classic anime of that genre, I watched it. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed, which isn\'t saying that Chobits was terrible. It just didn\'t live up to my expectations. Who knows, maybe I had too high of expectations. The anime was overall kind of sort of cute and funny but it didn\'t have a ""good"" plot, and the drama in it was very dull. I thought the plot was original in it\'s unique way because of the introduction of a Persocom, a machine that resembles a female...human. But the romance between a robotic human and a real flesh and blood human was a bit disturbing to me, because I just don\'t see how they can fall in love.The story revolves around the penniless, perverted, cram school student Hideki Motosuwa who desperately wants a computer, but not just any computer; he wants the new Persocom. Fortunately for him, he found an abandoned one in a trashcan and decides to keep it and replenish it. When Hideki first activates the Persocom, the only thing it is able to say is “Chi”. Our of nowhere, Hideki immediately falls in love with his robotic girl and devotes much of his time to teaching his Persocom all sorts of human behaviors/knowledge, to the point where she even develops a personality of her own. There were some good moments here and there in the story but overall although it was heart-warming to see a man be so kind to a ""lost"" knowledgeable robot, it wasn\'t so pleasing to see a perverted boy hit on a robotic girl. Don’t ask me how the series ended. I just don’t know. I mean, it wasn\'t confusing but it was plain dumb, and there was no climax. The ending seemed forced and nothing made sense to me.As for the characters, The women in the series were just plain depressing. Persocoms show up, men become aroused, women start questioning their sexuality and self-worth, well endowed high school girls go emo, it’s all just... bad. The men are just as bad too. They all seem to fall in love with robotic girls, over real flesh and blood girls. I just don\'t understand. The only thing that Chobits did with characteristic development was how Chi, Hideki\'s Persocom went from the start at the story from a piece of trash, to a loved robot that actually metaphorically had a heart and feelings.The opening of Chobits was kind of disturbing personally for me to listen to because it sounded like a little baby was trying to seduce an older man. The endings were decent, but I wasn\'t particularly fond of any soundtrack in Chobits, which is saying something because I love most soundtracks in anime. The voicing of Chi fit in with her personality, but nonetheless it was kind of annoying to listen to all the time. Especially when she just squeaks out ""chi"" repetitively.Well that\'s all I really have to say for Chobits, I didn\'t enjoy it that much even though I\'m a huge fan of romantic stories. But I just want to say this again because I really was confused, would guys really fall in love with robotic girls over real life girls?... *sigh* I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to most people, unless you\'re obsessed with romance with a hint of comedy here and there.

Thanks for reading!', 'I first saw Chobits very soon after I got into anime and something about it really grabbed me. In retrospect I can kind of see why. That was back when I was a horny teenager who deliberately searched out anime with the tags \'harem\' and \'ecchi\'. Most of them were utterly terrible dribble, but then came Chobits which managed to blow me away because it actually had depth. In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man etc. But it\'s 2013 now, and I\'ve changed.The story, for those uninitiated, is set in a world where everyone owns humanoid computers called persecoms. That is, apart...from our shmuck lead Hideki because he\'s  a poor farmboy who failed to get into college and now has to live on peanuts while taking cram school to retry the entrance exams. On his first day in Tokyo he finds a persecom in the trash who he names Chi. Chi turns out to be a ~magical persecom~ called Chobits. It\'s a ~magical persecom~ because it\'s capable of ~love~ and shit. It\'s rather important here to note that the story isn\'t really about Chi falling in love, or debating whether persecoms can fall in love. She\'s just programmed that way. It\'s a fairly handwavy explanation. The main focus of the story is whether people can fall in love with persecoms. Or to break it down a bit further, is our romantic love for non-humans worth as much as romantic love for actual humans. Or to break it down further again, do you really love your 2D waifu, like really?Chi is a perfect moeblob, programmed to be as such. Her cuteness and innocence are really played up, and those are the parts of her personality that draw Hideki towards her. She has no purpose beyond to fall in love and serve that one person. She spends most of the anime waiting at Hideki\'s apartment so she can greet him when he comes home, and spends her time when he\'s away thinking of what to do when he gets home. Even when Chi gets a job, the only thing she can think to spend the money on is things to buy for Hideki to make him happy. She is the quintessential stay-at-home wife whose job it is to look cute and make the husband feel relaxed when he comes home from a hard days work. Even Hideki responds to Chi\'s cuteness by promising he\'ll work hard and buy Chi the software she needs. Chi literally cannot learn anything without input from Hideki.The actual human women in the show have things like aspirations and jobs and real life stuff, which gets in the way of them being the perfect waifu. One of the guys literally forgets his wife even exists because he\'s too absorbed with his persecom. I don\'t think it\'s accidental that all the persecoms are made to look like women. They represent the old view of the ideal wife who stays at home and does anything for their husband, while also maintaining the innocence and cuteness and loyalty that make up the idea of moe. The guy who forgets his wife exists because he\'s too absorbed with his persecom has many similarities with the stories of break ups happening because the boyfriend was too absorbed with his Love Plus girlfriend. In Chobits, the people spend their time walking around the streets with their persecoms, rarely interacting with other people. The show really likes to drill that point into your head with the whole ""this town is empty, everyone is inside with It"" meta-story that it had going on.So why would you want to spend time with a real woman with their own lives when you could spend your life with a persecom instead? They are the perfect waifus with all the benefits of real women without any of the drawbacks. The ultimate evolution of this is the Chobits model, who are literally built solely to fall in love with you. The women in the show are rather depressed at their total inability to ever live up to what a persecom can do for the men. Clamp have a running theme of the Powah of Lurve in all their stories, so obviously it comes up in Chobits by saying that yes, your love for this non-human object is just as real as any love. So continue to love your precious 2D moe waifu for your love is as real as anyone\'s love. Which is kind of a ballsy statement to make, and I kinda dig it for going that far.Which is all fascinating and everything, but it\'s rather overshadowed by the fact that Chobits is really fucking boring.Because Chobits approach to providing a critical eye to this genre is positive rather than destructive criticism in the vein of Madoka or Evangelion, it means you have to sit through scenes of this stuff actually taking place. Chi tries to buy underwear. Chi learns how to cook. Chi tries on different dresses. It\'s just as tedious as it sounds. Some of this can be attributed to the anime having a bunch of filler, but the actual manga content isn\'t much better. Chi is not a character. She has nothing interesting to say and has no personality beyond acting like a shy toddler. That doesn\'t change whether you\'re watching her in plot related episodes or not. It\'s much the same problem I have with Jun Maeda moeblobs in that their dedication to being brainless and cute means they have no actual depth and are too stupid to say anything of worth. While what Chi is supposed to represent may be fascinating on a deeper level, the show still tries to make her carry entire episodes on the force of her personality which, as I said, is non-existent anyway.None of the other characters are engaging either because their dialogue is so stilted and wooden. God bless you Clamp, I love your power of love stories because I am a hopeless romantic at heart. But you guys can\'t write dialogue for shit. Their vocabulary is so limited it forces the characters into having limited personalities and limited ways their interactions can play out. Because the show takes forever to get anywhere, the characters have to prop up scenes by themselves and they get very repetitive very quickly. That\'s not just the persecoms either. The humans in the show have such bland samey dialogue that I just zoned out over their chit chat for the most part. Hideki is nothing more than a \'Nice Guy\'. His flatmate is nothing more than a \'Nice Guy\'. All the women in the show aren\'t much more than \'Nice Girls\' either. And while I wouldn\'t call the show misogynistic because it\'s not presenting persecoms as how women should be or anything, watching the persecoms be so blankly subservient and unthinking and lacking in goals of their own make them just as boring to watch as if they were real humans anyway.I can see why it was I used to like this anime so much. I too used to think I was a nice guy who liked cute girls because I was a teenager and could actually watch this inane dialogue and find it charming. To provide on top of that a message about the power of love added on top of the base level enjoyment. Now that I find that sort of writing tedious and irritating, I struggle to even sit through Chobits. There is something genuinely fascinating at the core of Chobits, but to make that point you have to sit through a dull magical girlfriend comedy about how you can be the perfect hard working husband for your cute mentally deficient waifu. Even if it is making a point with that set up, it\'s still as tedious to watch as a show that\'s doing that set up un-ironically. from our shmuck lead Hideki because he\'s  a poor farmboy who failed to get into college and now has to live on peanuts while taking cram school to retry the entrance exams. On his first day in Tokyo he finds a persecom in the trash who he names Chi. Chi turns out to be a ~magical persecom~ called Chobits.

Which is kind of a ballsy statement to make, and I kinda dig it for going that far.Which is all fascinating and everything, but it\'s rather overshadowed by the fact that Chobits is really fucking boring.Because Chobits approach to providing a critical eye to this genre is positive rather than destructive criticism in the vein of Madoka or Evangelion, it means you have to sit through scenes of this stuff actually taking place. Chi tries to buy underwear. Chi learns how to cook. Chi tries on different dresses. It\'s just as tedious as it sounds. Some of this can be attributed to the anime having a bunch of filler, but the actual manga content isn\'t much better. Chi is not a character. She has nothing interesting to say and has no personality beyond acting like a shy toddler. That doesn\'t change whether you\'re watching her in plot related episodes or not. It\'s much the same problem I have with Jun Maeda moeblobs in that their dedication to being brainless and cute means they have no actual depth and are too stupid to say anything of worth. While what Chi is supposed to represent may be fascinating on a deeper level, the show still tries to make her carry entire episodes on the force of her personality which, as I said, is non-existent anyway.None of the other characters are engaging either because their dialogue is so stilted and wooden. God bless you Clamp, I love your power of love stories because I am a hopeless romantic at heart. But you guys can\'t write dialogue for shit. Their vocabulary is so limited it forces the characters into having limited personalities and limited ways their interactions can play out. Because the show takes forever to get anywhere, the characters have to prop up scenes by themselves and they get very repetitive very quickly. That\'s not just the persecoms either. The humans in the show have such bland samey dialogue that I just zoned out over their chit chat for the most part. Hideki is nothing more than a \'Nice Guy\'. His flatmate is nothing more than a \'Nice Guy\'. All the women in the show aren\'t much more than \'Nice Girls\' either. And while I wouldn\'t call the show misogynistic because it\'s not presenting persecoms as how women should be or anything, watching the persecoms be so blankly subservient and unthinking and lacking in goals of their own make them just as boring to watch as if they were real humans anyway.I can see why it was I used to like this anime so much. I too used to think I was a nice guy who liked cute girls because I was a teenager and could actually watch this inane dialogue and find it charming. To provide on top of that a message about the power of love added on top of the base level enjoyment. Now that I find that sort of writing tedious and irritating, I struggle to even sit through Chobits. There is something genuinely fascinating at the core of Chobits, but to make that point you have to sit through a dull magical girlfriend comedy about how you can be the perfect hard working husband for your cute mentally deficient waifu. Even if it is making a point with that set up, it\'s still as tedious to watch as a show that\'s doing that set up un-ironically.', ""The typical perverted boy meets beautiful innocent girl but with a twist the girl is a robot! As much as I loved this anime the story really wasn't too original or inspiring. Many places where is is just a fan service but the detailed gothic lolita styled dresses give it an up in the art category.As for the characters they are typical and not liable to change much throughout the series. The robot twist does add a little points in this category though.The theme song and the two ending songs were wonderfully chosen and the voices where well done as well.Watching it was pleasant because...it was just a funny uplifting with some dark plot behind it. It was a nice little anime that really just kinda made your day and just asked you to keep watching it.Overall I would have to give it an 8 because even though it is very good it really isn't near the best animes I have watched but still deserves to be mentioned because it is still really well done. n_n it was just a funny uplifting with some dark plot behind it.

Everybody seems to LOVE IT, and I feel like I missed the bus, so to speak.In the first place, I'm a CLAMP fan. I love their old stuff--Tokyo Babylon, X, Rayearth, even Cardcaptor Sakura and Angelic Layer--but Chobits feels like the beginning of an era of relative mediocrity to me, especially compared to their earlier works. I know that Chii is supposed to be a perpetually-confused Robot Girl Who Needs to Learn To Love (R), but after a while her doe-eyed moe persona starts to get annoying.In the second place, I'm also a cyberpunk fan. The question...of what makes us 'human' and whether or not androids dream of electric sheep is not new to me. Robot sentience and 'emotions', or lack thereof, is old ground. This does not mean it cannot still be explored and is not still a legitimate question. Chobits does not do this question the justice I have seen done to it. I know the anime is trying to steer away from hardened cyberpunk-philosophy and speculation and keep to the cutsy-moe vein, and Hideki is not much of a philosopher, but this aspect could have been better-handled. The slice-of-life aspect that glosses over the cyberpunk lacks the charm it needs.That being said, it's the side-details and side-characters that steal the show. The book series &quot;A City With No People&quot; is beautiful and charming in much the same vein as &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. Sumomo and Shinbo are a hoot. Minoru and Yuzuki are adorable. Ueda is fascinating. Hideki and Chii--yeah, whatever.And foregoing any spoilers, my favorite character is already DEAD, so there goes that angle.If you're a sucker for moe or anything sickeningly cute, you would probably like this. If you want an intelligent, compassionate anime about cyborg sentience and the ethics of cyberization, watch &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand-Alone Complex&quot; instead. of what makes us 'human' and whether or not androids dream of electric sheep is not new to me.

Well, despite the close-up of said disk lying unnoticed on the ground, we\'re never told.Once having managed to get Chi back to his apartment, Hideki struggles with trying to revive her, and, having exhausted all reasonable avenues, finds that her ""On Switch"" is located in her vagina.Yikes....Once awakened, it becomes apparent that Chi has no operating software installed, and is essentially a blank slate, but thanks to having a ""learning"" program she can be taught, so Hideki takes it upon himself to teach her the things she will need to know in order to be fully functional.As the series progresses, additional characters are introduced; the attractive building manager, Chitose Hibiya, the neighbour and school chum, Shinbo, and the cute girl, and possible love interest, Yumi, among others, all of whom have distinct roles to play in the story and who play them well. While I have issues with Chobits, surprisingly enough, character development is not one of them. The series gave itself ample time to explore and define each of the main supporting characters, and each of them play a prominent role.Time passes and Chi learns more and more, ultimately becoming able to work part time and earn an income of her own, and we are introduced to more supporting characters, the majority of whom are also well written and play important roles in the story line.There are laughs (most of which follow the same juvenile pattern that was established out of the gate) as well as tears along the way, and we become aware that Chi may not be your average Persocom, but rather a product of the (urban) legendary ""Chobits"" line, which was rumoured to be a line of Persocoms possessed of actual Artificial Intelligence and capable of being as human as a Persocom could possibly be.We\'re also informed that somewhere in Chi\'s heavily protected core programming may be a protocol which could potentially change the way humans and Persocoms interact forever afterwards, should it be activated.At it\'s core, Chobits attempts to deal with love and relationships between individuals. It deals with issues of infidelity and loss, and asks the viewer to question the very nature of love and where it can exist. We are offered the possibility of a person having genuine feelings for a Persocom, and presented with the potential fallout from that love, whether it be marital breakdown or simply a growing dependence on one\'s computerized companion for all things, including emotional engagement, that gradually leads to an ever increasing isolation of those who sought a connection with another being.Chobits also succeeds to a large extent in this, and the issue is investigated in a surprisingly mature and compassionate fashion. We are ultimately left with the feeling that love may not always be kind, can exist in many forms, and may not always be found where we would expect it, and all of these are good messages.So why it it, with Chobits having strong, well written characters, decent artwork and a solid core message, that I found it to be such a disappointment?I think it\'s because Chobits could have been so much more.Questions about the very nature of love and our deep seated need to find and nurture basic personal relationships are weighed down under such a burden of childish humour and fanservice that the seriousness of the core discussion is tainted and loses much of its power.Add to that, the seemingly important plot threads that are left unaddressed, and Chobits ends up falling short of its potential, and because that potential was so well laid out and seemed so good, it\'s failure to be realised is bothersome.In the end, I did enjoy Chobits, despite its flaws, and I wouldn\'t hesitate in recommending it, but for those who have seen the series\' high ratings and read its many glowing reviews, I\'d say ""be prepared to be let down"".Chobits is good. Perhaps better than much of what\'s out there, but its flaws are enough to make it more an example of unrealised potential than one of anime classic in my opinion. are cute (the vast majority of Persocoms seen throughout the series are built to resemble attractive young women) and will enable him to pursue many interests, chief among which would seem to be surfing the Net for Porn.If the opening theme, which immediately made me think of such cheesy 70\'s shows such as ""Love American Style"" or the equally cheesy ""Three\'s Company"" from a decade later, hadn\'t already labelled this series, Hideki\'s obsession with porn, inexplicable, yet complete lack of understanding of technology and juvenile behaviour certainly did.But I digress...On his way home to his new apartment, Hideki continues to bemoan his inability to afford a Persocom of his own, and muses how nice it would be to find one lying around somewhere, when lo and behold, what should he pass by, but the titular character, ""Chi"", lying atop a stack of garbage in the alleyway behind his home.Stricken by how cute she is, and amazed by his good fortune, Hideki brings Chi home, failing to notice the computer disk that has fallen to the ground as he laboured to pick her up.Exactly what was on this disk?

Let\'s get some (but not much) detail into this horribly sucky series. Will I tell all? No, I\'m not Oprah. If you want to know the full details, you\'ll have to suffer as well. Now, on to the review.Where oh where to begin.About a month ago I suffered a heart attack. Compared to watching this horrid series, that was enjoyable. The incredible pain I was put through as a catheter was rammed into my leg and threaded into my heart was pleasant...compared to the agony of sitting through this absolutely horrid anime.There was a plot... somewhere. At times, I honestly think the writers even forgot what the plot was. First, we have horny redneck trying to get into the big city. I was honestly waiting for him to screw that cow in the first episode. I would\'ve gotten a good laugh if he\'d introduced himself as ""Name\'s Hideki ma\'am"" and then spit between his shoes. Nope, he doesn\'t even have that much personality. I think I\'ve left more personality in a tissue after blowing my nose.Ok... oh and yeah, he\'s a complete and total dork. Not even in a good way. More along the lines of having to remember to breathe kind of retarded dork. Who wants a human shaped computer (that\'s cute, don\'t forget cute! big time keyword here) to look up... porn.And he never does! The moron continues to buy skin rags while supporting this irritating contraption.And not to be outdone by the fact that every single character looks like it suffers from some form of extreme downs syndrome (really, sloped foreheads, extremely wide spaced eyes, almost inhuman shaped chins) but the computers are these weird basically android like constructs called... wait for it... wait for it... Persocoms. Great name eh? Freaking amazing. I remember when I had first come across this series I thought that it was one that had been done back in the 80\'s (I could\'ve forgiven it if it had been. a lot of really weird things came out in the 80\'s) but no... it\'s a fairly recent anime. In fact, it was done in 2002. 2002! Did the clamp group really have absolutely no experience with computers at all?! just how far does artistic license go?So, boy genius (Hideki) winds up picking up a ""persocom"" out of a trash heap and eventually names her Chi. Hey, I\'m a geek... and I used to dumpster dive. Got some really great parts that way! But somehow, this guy comes across the most advanced of all persocoms... in the trash.So that brings us to Chi. Poor little incredibly retarded Chi. Someone really should\'ve shot her and put her down. It would have saved so much time and money that was wasted on the production of this horrid series. Anyway, poor retarded Chi goes from useless retard to somehow becoming the uber grail of computers. She goes from not knowing anything at all to having some kind of amazing ""learning"" software installed. Wow! I know some A.I. groups that would just absolutely kill for that! Just a taste of how it was done would keep them happy for decades. And this amazing, hideously disfigured retard comes standard with it.So, I guess to mock microsoft, she\'s not retarded, she\'s advanced! (yes, blatantly ripping off the ""It\'s not a bug, it\'s an undocumented feature"" legend) So advanced in fact that her creator\'s wife (another exceptionally ugly woman) just somehow winds up managing (and later you find out, owning) the apartment that Hideki and Chi live in. Holy cow, can we say contrived?And then... he meets more dorks. Who spout the stupidest things. I spent 27 episodes just telling myself I\'ll finish this. It\'ll be worth it. I\'ll give you a hint.It wasn\'t.However, you do get to eventually meet an odd underage bimbo who\'s proud of her breasts (and well she should be, since she\'s not got a damn thing else going for her), a pair of micro/mini persocoms that are actually just loaded with personality. Sumomo was actually a bit fun to watch, and Kotoko was very funny. However, they are fairly minor characters, who wind up around Hideki and Chi in exceptionally contrived circumstances.It took me almost two weeks to get through this lousy series. I was constantly finding better things to do, but still trying my damnedest not to watch something else until I finished it.But hey, if boring as all hell, repetitive, flash back ridden, loosely mangled plot lines (yeah bull crap that the entire plot was developed before a single image was drawn. If you believe that one, yet can sit through this entire series AND still think the plot was well developed... well... something tells me you ate a lot of wall candy as a kid. Maybe even still do.) lousy animation, occasional special effects (that oddly are better drawn than the characters(?!)) then this anime was made just for you. compared to the agony of sitting through this absolutely horrid anime.There was a plot... somewhere.

I enjoy sitting down and letting my brain melt over these silly little animu relationships.Chobits is not a romance.Chobits is not some sort of intellectual look into if robots were real and sentient.Chobits disappointed me. Chobits is a fetish show. A rip off of a fetish show.Story: 2If you enjoy watching a brain dead girl walking around saying underpants over and over again, this show is for you. If you enjoy ecchi and porn, this show is for you. If you were told, like me, that this show discusses how robots and humans would become in a...futuristic society, you were deceived. The plot likes to shove morals in your face constantly and then in the end basically says the morals apply to everyone but Chi because Chi is Chi.Yeah. Also, two random recap episodes. Or maybe three, I honestly don\'t care enough to go back and look. There are bits and pieces of promising plot, but sadly it\'s overshadowed by ecchi and fan service. I\'d say a good 95% of the show is a perverts dream and the last 5% is plot progression. Then it just kinda gives you the middle finger in the end.Art: 6I mean, it isn\'t horrible. It\'s pretty a lot of the times. But it can also be kinda lazy at times. It\'s weird.Sound:Other than the opening song, which literally became a joke between me and my cousin through our slow decent into insanity as we watched this show, the music isn\'t terrible. It typically fits the mood.The English voice cast was in and out. Some characters did well, and others made you cringe at the sheer inability to read a line. From what I remember the Japanese voice cast is okay.Now here\'s the thing, and this is probably going to be a bit of a spoiler but honestly it doesn\'t matter you probably will guess what\'s going on by the second episode. Chi\'s personality, even by the end of the show when she ""fully blossoms"" is robotic in nature. She speaks, acts, and is just obviously a robot. DESPITE supposedly being the only robot that has emotions. But then you look at the little robot that follow Hideki around that was his neighbors robot (Again I honestly don\'t care enough to google it\'s name) Has WAAAAAAAAAY more personality than her. She was the only character I liked and I don\'t even remember her name. Speaking of which...Character: 1I don\'t think I\'ve ever thought that characters could get this cardboard cutout and predictable. There are no round characters. No one learns anything. Hideki has morals shoved in his face but he igores them anyway and does the exact opposite, despite being told it will only bring despair. ""But DellaDellsies,"" You say, ""It was for LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE!""... NO. IT WAS NOOOOT FOR LOVE. IT WAS FOR HIS LUST. THERE IS NOOOOTHING ABOUT CHI TO LOVE. HER PERSONALITY IS LITERALLY SHAPED BY HIDEKI. EVERYTHING she knows is what HIDEKI told her. He does not love Chi, he loves what he made her out to be. Because she is a ROBOT and can DOOO THAAAT. This was not a story about love, it was a story about an idiot not listening to any of his friends and choosing a man made, perfect girl over any other human girl. THAT\'S IT.AND DON\'T GET ME STARTED ON CHI. ""Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants! Underpants!"" I\'m going to leave it at that because I honestly don\'t know how to put it without making even worse spoilers than I have already put.Enjoyment: 3There were some side characters and side plots that were interesting, but it never stuck around and was over shadowed by the bland, boring Hideki and the annoying, sexual Chi. I got nothing but anger and disappointment from this show.Overall: 3If you want to experience this for yourself, go ahead and do it. But honestly I believe it\'s a waste of time. It has sooooo much potential and it just fell flat on its face. Literally there were times when my cousin and I were just like ""Okay THIS will be the scene that wows us!"" and it just falls flat into a boob or fingering joke. The comedy was flat, the plot just went in circles until the last episode where it literally shoved the whole plot into your face then continued to suffocate you with giant tits and a moral that is tossed into the garbage. By the end of it you just kinda break.Or at least my cousin and I did.Her ringtone on my phone is now Let Me Be With You out of sheer spite of making me watch that show. futuristic society, you were deceived.

I\'m going to leave it at that because I honestly don\'t know how to put it without making even worse spoilers than I have already put.Enjoyment: 3There were some side characters and side plots that were interesting, but it never stuck around and was over shadowed by the bland, boring Hideki and the annoying, sexual Chi. I got nothing but anger and disappointment from this show.Overall: 3If you want to experience this for yourself, go ahead and do it. But honestly I believe it\'s a waste of time. It has sooooo much potential and it just fell flat on its face. Literally there were times when my cousin and I were just like ""Okay THIS will be the scene that wows us!"" and it just falls flat into a boob or fingering joke. The comedy was flat, the plot just went in circles until the last episode where it literally shoved the whole plot into your face then continued to suffocate you with giant tits and a moral that is tossed into the garbage. By the end of it you just kinda break.Or at least my cousin and I did.Her ringtone on my phone is now Let Me Be With You out of sheer spite of making me watch that show.', ""ChobitsI remember liking this show a whole lot back in the day, and unfortunately it hasn't lived up to what I remember. Chobits starts off well enough, but by the end it gets lost in trying to be profound.The animation is good. It was consistent and fluid throughout the show, so no complaints there. The artwork.....I'm hesitant to say it was bad, because I don't think it was, but much of the character designs are all pretty much the same with different hair plonked on to distinguish them, and even there.....they all had the same sort of scraggy haircut. The only ones who are unique...in design are Chii and Sumomo. Chii's design is extraordinarily cute, and all the various lolita outfits she get dressed up in enhance her cute factor, by quite a lot.As for the characters, our main leads were disappointing. I found Chii to be mostly bland, and Hideki was a colossal idiot. He really did get on my nerves at times with his ludicrous outbursts. I just couldn't feel the chemistry between Hideki and Chii, it felt somewhat forced. The side characters were more interesting than those two. Sumomo was easily the best character there, she was energetic and unique. Consequently the side characters  had more interesting stories as well. They did have some themes about the relationship between technology, society and people and while they weren't outstanding they were interesting to watch. The better episodes are the fillers, but even they wear down after a while because the same jokes are recycled over and over.Now the bigger problem is the main plot. It starts out well enough, with the usual 'what is Chii?' stuff, and I was actually interested by how it was presented. But as it moves along it just gets confusing. By the end we had some new and important characters pop out of nowhere and I thought some of the plot points were outright contradictory, and the entire ending left me with that bitter 'wait, what?' feeling. I honestly have no idea what was suppose to happen in the end, the show just doesn't tell us.On a good point, I really do like the soundtrack. It's got a wonderful retro sound to it, and it fits the show very well. There's nary a track out of place throughout Chobits, it's been timed quite well. The OP is quite a catchy pop song, and the EDs are a good listen. Though I do prefer the first ED to the second one.The dub was alright. The actors did a good job (though, no offense to Monica Rial, but there wasn't much to Chii in the first place), a couple of the guys were a little bland at times, but there's nothing really more to comment on it, there's nothing wrong with it. Oh, Sandy Fox did a fabulous job as Sumomo, she does the squeaky voice exceptionally well.I'm finding it hard to say that it simply sucks, because despite it's flaws I was at the least entertained most of the time. Chobits isn't a terrible show, it's cute, and quite a few of the episodes are fun but it gets tangled up and ends up confusing itself which drags the show down as a whole.

I\'ll try the best I can.Chobits isn\'t revolutionary with its female android protagonist. There are, of course, a great many other anime that have the same idea. Although, from what I can see, a lot of them are somewhat perverted and contain a sundry of fan service. I think Chobits did a good job with the android cliché. It\'s not as simple as the others. In my opinion, Chobits is my favorite anime of this type.Story 8/10:Some time in the future, our protagonist, Hideki Motosuwa, goes to a city to prepare for college....Once he arrives there, he notices the abundance of ""Persocoms"", a personal android that have become hackneyed to the city residents and other urban dwellers. To him, it seems as though everyone who is anyone owns these android servants. The only problem is: he\'s downright poor and bucolic, he doesn\'t know anything about computers or anything fancy like that. Being the protagonist, lo and behold, he finds a discarded Persocom. This Persocom isn\'t like any other private household Persocom, this Persocom is a Chobit! Chobits are a special kind of Persocoms (I won\'t go into detail in order to avoid spoiling). Upon finding each other, Hideki and his Persocom, Chii (Or Chi), go on an adventure of self discovery, love, forbidden love, and tragedy. Forbidden love is the conflict in the story. It certainly is a philosophical discussion; is love between a human and an android... right? Well, Chobits is here to put a foot in the door of that argument.Art 9/10:Art and animation is very important for anime. For some, it\'s sometimes a hit or miss for the show. The style is definitely different than today\'s, since it\'s made in 2002. The art, in my opinion, perfectly fits with the story, setting, comedic sequences, characters, etc.. It has that \'kawaii\' feel and it\'s not too complex. To put it bluntly, it just FEELS right. Animation is well done. There are, at times, moments where you can spot awkward placement of characters and their movement throughout the scenes and where it\'s not smooth, but those can be easily disregarded.Sound 9/10:First, I\'d like to highlight the fabulous intro. ""Let Me Be With You"" by ROUND TABLE is the perfect intro for Chobits. It\'s also really catchy and a good song overall. I also like the little bit after the intro. The voice acting was well done and they definitely fit their characters. Good work, voice actors! Background music was very fitting, I almost didn\'t notice them at times and I can get in with the music\'s mood. As for sound effects, I don\'t have any problems with it. They worked well with the setting. Although, we all know that computers nowadays can be quite silent. The hard-drive reading sound will be quite nostalgic.Character 8/10:The characters in this show certainly aren\'t overused but they also aren\'t revolutionary. The characters fits the story and did their jobs perfectly. Hideki is a student getting ready for college and is happily fuelled with porn magazines. In fact, he wanted a Persocom in the first place to access porn on the internet, among other useful things. Hideki has a family that owns a farm and he grew up with a rural livestyle. Hideki later meets Chitose Hibiya, his landlady, Hiromu Shinbo, his neighbour, and more lively supporting characters that are related to Persocoms (usually in the form of a traumatic event). None of the characters aggravated me or made me wish they would go die in a whole somewhere. They all have a story to tell and help Hideki and Chi with their life.From the first episode of Chobits, I was already hooked. Humour is always a good way to get attention. Through the entire show, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. All the happy and sad moments are lessons to be learned. Chobits gave good reason for both sides of the argument, though mostly for the right to love. The problem, ""Loving an inanimate object is forbidden"", is thoroughly displayed, argued, and ultimately answered. Overall, I give this show a 9/10. This is truly one of my favourites.

This is truly one of my favourites.', 'Today, I\'m actually going to review something that doesn\'t suck!Warning! the following review contains spoilers and extrapolates on an allegorical interpretation of the plot that you may or may not agree with.Overview:Chobits is a romance anime that centers around a couple named Hideki and Chii. They have an unconventional relationship that is criticized by many in their society as unnatural and a slight against God. They can\'t have ""real"" sex that produces children. However, they overcome these criticisms and show that 2 consenting adults in a loving relationship is a beautiful union that should be respected by society. I am of course talking about man...and girl robot relations. What? You thought I was talking about something else? Chobits does an excellent job of showing that a writer can deliver a moral or social message without senselessly beating the viewer over the head with it and getting obnoxiously preachy. The use of allegory and some sense of subtlety can go a long way. Fuck you Glee! Chobits was there preaching tolerance long before you showed your ugly face! If you thought this was just another forgettable Etchii series, think again. Chobits is often surprisingly well written and and has some intelligence along with plenty of heart.Plot 9/10Hideki grew up on a farm in a rural part of Japan and is technologically inept. When he moves to the city in order to attend college cram school, he is amazed by the prevalence of humanoid robots called persocoms. Persocoms, which is short for personal computer, are essentially robots that can act as computers, servants, and can even work many jobs. However, persocoms lack true artificial intelligence and are incapable of true emotion, feelings, or decision making independent of how they were programmed. There is a legend about a small number of true AI having been built called ""chobits"", but this is mostly dismissed as a mere rumor. Hideki is far too poor to afford a persocom and can only witness this oddity with jealousy. He fantasizes about what he would use a computer for...mostly looking up porn. I mean hey, the man\'s never had a computer before, give him a break! One day Hideki finds a mysterious persocom abandoned in the garbage behind his apartment and decides to take it home. This persocom is in the shape of a beautiful girl and at first can only say the nonsense word ""Chii"". Hideki decides to keep Chi and soon discovers she is very different from other persocoms. Perhaps even one of the legendary Chobits!Characters 9/10The 2 main characters as already mentioned are Hideki and Chii. Hideki is a typical, lovable loser type character. He is not exactly revolutionary as a character, but generally comes across as a pretty realistic young college student. He is rather shy and introverted, but desires love and has never really had a girlfriend before. Despite his awkwardness and slight obsession with porn, Hideki is a genuinely nice guy and gets along well with pretty much everyone in the series. Chii starts out a virtual blank slate and learns from Hideki\'s actions and words. Eventually she starts to develop her own personality and proves to be a caring and kindhearted soul. Chii adores Hideki and doesn\'t seem to mind his flaws. It is also hinted that she wasn\'t born a blank slate and had a past before being tossed away. Chii seems to have a deep connection to series of mysterious picture books that she finds at the local book store. There are a number of secondary characters introduced as well, with my favorite being the child prodigy Mr. Kokobunji. Along with being a billionaire computer genius, Kokobunji takes a keen interest in artificial intelligence and raises many of the series deepest questions and thoughts.Art 8/10Despite being a slightly older title from the early 2000s, Chobits\' art has held up well over time and looks quite good. The character designs are well done, the background scenery is gorgeous, and the animation is fairly fluid and smooth.Soundtrack 9/10Chobits not only has excellent opening and closing themes, but very catchy and upbeat music throughout the show that will probably put a smile on your face. The soundtrack also has more somber and mysterious music that plays when Chii reads her special picture books. I have heard some viewers, mostly younger viewers, comment that they found this music creepy. I personally found it more mysterious than anything else.Enjoyment 9/10Chobits is rather funny, but also at times can be thought provoking and heart warming. It offers the best of all worlds. It does have a few filler episodes and strays a bit from the original manga at times, but that is only to be expected for a 26 episode anime based on a fairly short manga. I found it to be quite enjoyable, but be warned that the first few episodes are a little slow. I would at least watch the first 7-8 or so episodes before making a decision to continue or not. If after 8 episodes you are still hating every minute of it, it clearly just isn\'t your cup of tea so feel free to try another series.Overall 9/10Chobits isn\'t a perfect series or a work of art so fine that I would personally fight a duel if someone insulted it to my face. However, it is a very good series and breaks the mold of traditional echii comedies. It is the kind of quality one would expect from the fine ladies of Clamp. I would recommend this one to men and women at least 13 and up. This is a seinen genre anime, so younger viewers might not really appreciate the finer points. Not to mention Hideki\'s porn obsession would be a bit awkward to explain to a 9 year old. and girl robot relations. What? You thought I was talking about something else?

Then write even better reviews =3 (any sort of criticism is okay, harsh, useless, or constructive I accept it all!)Story: Well, it seems cliche when you first look at it, but thinking back at that time, that might have been the way it would have been. It has it\'s own unique twists and such but it\'s really a pretty ""straight-forward"" storyline. It has it\'s own paced established and you\'ll get used it in no time. Not bad, but pretty goodArt: Clamp this I have to say, is really the...starting point of which I started watching your other shows. The animation is smooth and the drawing style is somewhat unique. Though there are just some times where I think the animation and the colouring just don\'t suit the mood. Wherever Chii is the mood for me changes way too much. A dark atmosphere adding Chii in is just bad I have to say. Overall the Art is very hard to comment, it\'s good but not absolutely excellent. It\'s also hard to criticize.Sound: This is one of the few animes where the background music and opening really suit the current scenes. The opening is the typical casual J-Pop with a bit of a twist with Chii in the animation it really suits the main mood of the anime. The background music is really where I appreciate the work put in. It\'s very light, with very few parts being dark, a perfect match for Chobits! Every scene felt like it was carefully worked out to match the animation, a silly animation with silly mood and music. A happy one with happy music and so on. There was really only one problem. The opening didn\'t change as most twenty episode animes I have seem, but the ending did, so overall I was pretty happy about the music and sound.Character: This is like the reason I watch it basically, the character development is simply amazing. Well besides Chii learning words. The characters are also VERY interesting to watch. All their actions really explains a lot of their personal feelings and attributes. Hideki is very shy going despite being a ""perverted"" boy. It\'s as almost he\'s trying to avoid contact with Chii as much as possible. Always the shy one he is. Chii is somewhat annoying to watch. Even sometimes painful. That never lasts too long because the scene and the music perk you right back up for more. Chii\'s development throughout the story is very crucial (though I can\'t say too much).Enjoyment: The enjoyment level for Chobits is good but not perfect. Since most of the enjoyment comes from comedy It might get boring sometimes. The roller-coaster of a storyline and music really make you very emotional at some points. It also leaves a very big impression on you. It\'s a hell of a ride that you\'ll enjoy very much.Overall: Chobits is very good. The story line is unique, characters interesting, sound very good, and just for the hell of it it\'s plain great! I highly suggest it. The main thing you should really think about is, how society sees relationships and judges them. That is the main theme I THINK you should look upon and reflect. Though the previous one I said before would also make sense, this is the more ""general theme"".

I read about two volumes of it and thought it was pretty intriguing so I thought well why not watch the anime?Let me say this, I am generally fairly easy to please. I\'m one of those people that has learned that what is a good anime/manga is not necessarily the same as what anime/manga you enjoying watching/reading. That being said, I though Chobits failed on both accounts.Hideki made me want to run my head through a cheese grater. He was incredibly dull and annoying as a character. He is completely and entirely forgettable. Chii was...cute, but there wasn\'t much depth to her. She is slow at learning the human ways and while sometimes her antics are funny, most of the time it comes off as irritating.I did like some of the art, particularly Chii\'s outfit designs. But there is nothing to distinguish Hideki from the next guy.I will say that Sumomo was probably my favorite character. Her ""wakey wakey"" exercises had me cracking up! And Shinbo was interesting as well. I\'m pretty much certain they\'re the only reason I actually managed to watch all 26 episodes. They keep my rating from being even lower, but are not enough to save the show.It was slow, most of the characters were boring, and it was repetitive. I have no desire to watch it again. People that are interested in the storyline are better off reading the manga instead. cute, but there wasn\'t much depth to her.

People that are interested in the storyline are better off reading the manga instead.', 'Chobits is a romance oriented anime that presents the viewer with a futuristic world inhabited by humans and android-like beings called ""persocoms"" who are a much more advanced humanoid versions of the PCs you and I use today. It is a very engrossing anime because it portrays a number of themes like morality, spirituality and even sexuality from a number of different viewpoints - those of humans, those of \'persocoms\' and a neutral one.The setting and story are very simple. We have the male lead, a village boy by the name of Motosuwa Hideki who aspires to go to a University and also happens...to be the complete inverse of a pick-up artist, as his lack of experience with women and people in general is the unfortunate result of milking cows in seclusion for way too long.One day he decides to move out of his home to study at a cram school in Tokyo. Needless to say this drastic change of scenery brings about a lot of interesting situations, one of which is his discovery of an abandoned persocom, named ""Chi"", who then sets out to accompany her new master through life. This event marks the true beginning of the story.Hideki\'s aforementioned difficulty when it comes to interpersonal relationships and how he struggles to understand a rapid and evolving world alongside his persocom counterpart is the hallmark of this series. I liked the fact that a lot of themes presented here, especially romance, were painfully serious and not afraid to anger its watchers. For example, some of us may think that being nice and unassuming are definitively good traits that potential partners might look for. In Chobits however, Hideki is constantly ridiculed by the rest of the characters for being a naive ""nice guy"" who doesn\'t have the spine to aggressively pursue women. What\'s interesting is that \'Chobits\' doesn\'t show him as a victim of society but rather as a failure of mankind. Chobits wants us to see him as a loser who needs to man up, rather than making us feel sorry for him.The drama here shows us characters that are depressed and self-derogatory, angering you to the point of making you want to chew through a pallet of cinder blocks. You know that what these characters are doing isn\'t helping and perhaps you even know what the solution to their trouble is but this is how some people are and this is how real life works.In short, you know a series is good when it starts drawing out strong emotions from you that normally only real life would. Emotions of anger, disappointment and perhaps even resentment.Secondary characters in this show have been presented very well. Minoru Kokubunji, a young genius whom Hideki befriends early on in the show, is a staple of stability and resilience. I liked this character for his diligent nature and the way in which he adds more seriousness to the series.Yumi Omura is a perplexing character to say the least. She\'s Hideki\'s air-headed workmate. Her purpose in the show was mainly to show just how fragile human relations can be. One day friends - the next one strangers. What we take for granted may be taken from us the very next day.Shinbo Hiromu has got to be my favourite though. As Hideki\'s classmate, this character serves as an example that sometimes in life assertiveness is extremely important and desirable, even if it means doing something stupid that may offend others. This would be the strongest character in the entire cast.There are plenty more of course but I felt these ones were worth describing the most.The only issue I have with this anime would be the confusing and unsatisfying ending. I cannot reveal why that is without spoiling stuff but what I can say is that it was very anti-climactic and largely ruined the entire build up the series was working on.All in all though, chobits was a very enjoyable experience. Enjoyable in the sense that even though fictional, one can learn many things from this particular anime. It is, without exaggeration, a snippet of real life packed into a well made 26 episode series.Chobits is quite literally a critical thinker\'s wet dream.Thank you for reading.8 points. to be the complete inverse of a pick-up artist, as his lack of experience with women and people in general is the unfortunate result of milking cows in seclusion for way too long.One day he decides to move out of his home to study at a cram school in Tokyo. Needless to say this drastic change of scenery brings about a lot of interesting situations, one of which is his discovery of an abandoned persocom, named ""Chi"", who then sets out to accompany her new master through life. This event marks the true beginning of the story.Hideki\'s aforementioned difficulty when it comes to interpersonal relationships and how he struggles to understand a rapid and evolving world alongside his persocom counterpart is the hallmark of this series. I liked the fact that a lot of themes presented here, especially romance, were painfully serious and not afraid to anger its watchers.

It has a cute background love story and is filled with funny moments, and of course with a little bit of sexual jokes. So why only the rating of an overall 7??? Personally I think the ending was not the best. I felt it lacked tying things together, and made things even more confusing.  They built up everything for a rushed ending. With the story that they had, and the characters that were created I feel the ending could have been stronger. I ignore the last couple episodes after episode 24 “Chi...Wears And Takes Off"" and adopted my own ending because I feel the actual one brought down the rest of the show. Wears And Takes Off"" and adopted my own ending because I feel the actual one brought down the rest of the show.', ""I'm...*sniff*...speechless. I'm not sure what to really say! The animation is gorgeous, the characters are deep and interesting, the story has some really nice plot twists, the music and voices are fantastic (in Japanese...of course), and the ending really hits the mark.Perhaps the closest comparison I can make (and it's still a fairly loose association) is to a modern re-telling of Pinocchio. No, it's not the same story...but you'll understand why I say that when you watch it.I think what I love most about this series is the lessons it teaches about love, sacrifice, and what it really means to be human. It's definitely not...a series for kids. Although nothing truly graphic happens, there are a few ecchi moments that some (American) parents would definitely object to. We have a much stricter culture here about such things...but I digress.I found I really connected with Hideki. He reminds me a lot of myself in many ways...although I have MUCH better control over myself in public. ;pI've found that the stories that stick with me the most are the ones that really make you think. If you allow yourself to become immersed in the world and the characters, you come out of it with a new appreciation for other perspectives. Even if you, in the end, don't agree with the philosophies explored, one can at least have the understanding of why they might think that way. Chobits definitely fits into this category.

Characters are interesting and dynamic, but art and animation is kept to a minimum. English dub is pretty good, and the music is fun but not remarkable. The anime is well executed, and I did enjoy watching it.Loooooooong review:Story: (This is going to be long...)The first half-or-so of Chobits is rather lighthearted and comedic, with Hideki adjusting to city life, school, and teaching Chi new things. This is where you mostly see the slice-of-life part of this anime.Within the middle part, there are...a few rather pointless episodes, such as a beach episode or the ""haunted"" apartment episode. However, darker themes are introduced past the first four episodes, getting darker and more mysterious as the show progresses. The second half has a lot of great character moments and backstories that will really force you to question what are emotions and how close computers/robots/AI will be to humans, and if they will ever replace us. A lot of the plot is driven forward by new revelations of the mystery of Chi, and seeing everyone\'s past experiences and relationships with persocoms.But contrasting all the drama and tragedy in the second half, the fourth episode of Chobits is funnier than ANY episode in School Rumble, which is supposed to be a straight-up comedy anime. The style of humor in Chobits is a mix of gag/slapstick comedy and sexual humor. The use of the two-tone patterns running across the screen along with English words in the background added to the gag/slapstick part of the comedy, while the voice acting in the English dub makes the rest of the humor more believable and funnier in general. I know this kind of comedy isn\'t for everyone (Trust me, I did find Hideki\'s somewhat perverted antics to be annoying at times), but it doesn’t really take away from the experience. If anything, it almost enhances it. The Seinen elements and fanservice in this show may also make some people (particularly a female audience) uncomfortable. Most of the persocoms in this anime are female (looking), and the ones we actually get to know are usually dressed in elaborate lolita or costumes. I don\'t exactly perceive this as sexist, because I know the four authors that make up CLAMP are all women. My theory as to why CLAMP decided to create this story is because Chobits is a sort of analogy, where (in Japan, the gender disparity problem seems worse) this could be our reality, and in a sense, we already do this. It\'s sort of like a slap in the face, saying, ""Do we really want our society to change like this?"" And it seems to me that if anyone\'s going to create a persocom, they will probably be from Japan. Just a hunch.Also, I suggest skipping the recap episodes (10, 20, and 27). The pacing of the show is fine, if you\'re okay with a few filler episodes. It keeps the mystery somewhat suspenseful in the first half, then the pacing does pick up in the second half, with more and more information given to the audience until the last two plot episodes where everything is revealed. And it\'s this that makes the ending to Chobits satisfying.Characters:Chobits does introduce quite a few characters, both human and persocom, in a rather even fashion throughout the series. The characters aren\'t that memorable in the long run, but I think you\'ll remember the humans because of their experiences with persocoms, and the persocoms themselves, for their motivations to do what they do. I don\'t think there is one character I hated, although I can understand how they may not be likeable or if a character is annoying at times. A lot of the characters (mostly humans) do develop throughout the show in different realizations of themselves or their relationships, whether those relationships be with another human or persocom. And it\'s these relationships and developments that are the show\'s best parts and drive the plot forward.Now, let\'s run down some characters. Although Hideki is a pervert, he really is a nice guy (as he is told many, many times throughout the anime) who has shown himself to be very caring and empathetic. *Sigh* I swear, there\'s a character archetype for the nice guy who\'s also a huge pervert (Akihisa Yoshii, Tsukune Aono, Shigure Sohma). Chi fills the role of main female character and ""Miss Fanservice"". Not necessarily the T&A fanservice (this is CLAMP we\'re talking about, here), but by doing cute things and just being sweet and innocent. Yes, I did think it was a bit cute, but the pandering male otakus may think so otherwise...The rest of the characters serve as adding to the mystery, trying to solve the mystery, or has a dark past relating to persocoms. Not a single character in this anime is entirely useless, nor do I think any one of them were wasted. Each of them contribute to the plot in varying degrees or frequencies. and you usually see the characters develop after seeing them realize something about persocoms or relationships.Art:Chobits is an anime from 2002, when digital animation was getting started in the anime industry but quickly becoming mainstream. It has a similar style of art as, say, Love Hina. Yes, the art is a bit dated, but it\'s age does add a bit of charm, instead of style to this anime. The nature backgrounds that are shown in about two of the show\'s episodes are actually very nice and look as if they were painted with very neat watercolors. The art was a bit flat, but not to the extent that it was boring. Madhouse did successfully re-create the neatness and style of CLAMP\'s artwork from the original manga. However, the art in the anime looks less...CLAMP-ish.Animation:I will say that the animation in this show is not sloppy. The wind blowing Chi\'s long hair looks natural, and the style of animating the picture book scenes made me feel like I was reading the book. However, in an anime like this, don\'t expect EXCEPTIONAL animation.Voice:Comparing the sub with thew dub, I\'d say go with the dub, because I thought it was funnier and more natural. In a complete contrast to the role Crispin Freeman is most famous for portraying (go look it up if you don\'t know), he does a GREAT job at voicing the fish-out-of-water Hideki. He sounded exasperated, concerned, goofy, hyper, just very good at conveying emotions and making Hideki sound more natural and 3-D. While Chi\'s dialogue is cheesy sometimes, I think it did a good job of conveying innocence and curiosity. And Michelle Ruff did a nice job with her high pitched voice for Chi, and the darker voice for Freya. Almost all the side characters also had great dub performances, such as Minoru, Yumi, Mr. Ueda, and Ms. Shimizu. Minoru did sound like a mature kid, kind of like Ed in the dub of FMA. Yumi sounded perky and sweet when she needed to, but when things got serious, she did sound wistful, sad and depressed. Not many parts were too over-acted, with was also very nice.Music:The opening to this show is very catchy and cute, although repetitive. It almost made me want to dress up in one of Chi\'s outfits and do a cute dance with a bunch of backup dancers dressed exactly the same. That\'s the only way I can describe the opening. I didn\'t think either of the ending themes were exceptional in any way, but the choice of which ending theme to use did fit how the episode ended. The OST is mostly light, cute, fun, but not terribly memorable. However, the music does kick it into high gear whenever something intense happens. And the music box theme that plays whenever Chi is reading a book is actually kind of creepy. Overall, the OST does add to the overall experience of the anime.Execution:Chobits is initially set up as a rom-com, but I think I should have known this show would get darker. While some may have problems with the pacing and the filler, saying it takes away from the good stuff, I think this anime adaptation was set up with an audience enjoyment in mind ahead of the deep story. One episode, you\'re laughing, the next thinking deeply. So don\'t watch this anime for one element or genre, because, as you saw in my pie chart up there, Chobits combines a lot of genres. You may get confused about the atmosphere of this anime, so if you want to check this out, go in with no expectations (even though I just talked about this anime in detail...) If you do so, then this anime will work for you.My Enjoyment:Okay, in my book, there are two kinds of enjoyment for an anime (well, there\'s three, if you want to go there.) The first is having a lot of fun with an anime and really enjoying yourself, see Gurren Lagann. The second is being engrossed in the story and it\'s characters, such as in Death Note. Chobits falls more under the latter, with its overarching mystery and interesting characters. I didn\'t so much have fun with this anime as I did get engaged to the story. That\'s the whole reason I ended up marathoning large portions of this anime over about a week. The suspense was enough to keep me coming back, and the comedy is usually nicely placed, which did make the experience rather positive. And if you want to get all nit-picky about the supposed sexism in this anime, you\'re not going to have a good time.If you liked this review, please check out my anime review blog!

When 3 of the 26 shows -- more than 10% of the series -- are flashback episodes, something isn't being done right. The final episode was a flashback episode, for crying out loud. There was enough filler in this show that occasionally the pacing seemed to crawl and I became rather bored.

The amount of times that I've re-watched Chobits to show a friend has been more than I can count, I've even physically bought the hardcover anniversary books just from how much I enjoyed it.Chobits is a comfy romantic comedy, and one of the first anime series I've ever seen and fell in love with.It's Sci-Fi, comedic, mysterious, and sometimes fanservice-y (if...you're into that, though it definitely doesn't annoyingly interfere.) Its setting/vibe just feels so nostalgic and soothing. One of my favorite parts about this anime is the incredibly relaxing music, from the opening and credits to the transitions, all of it is just so catchy and unforgettable. I even still listen to some of these tracks years after discovering the show. Strongly encourage you to give it a try, it's worth the experience and concludes in a way that leaves you feeling warm, so it doesn't really need a second season even though you'll want more. you're into that, though it definitely doesn't annoyingly interfere.)

There were houses, and lights could be seen from the windows... But nobody was on the streets. I tried peeking in the window. There was someone there, but he was together with ‘it’. I looked in other houses. They all were together with ‘it’. Because it’s fun to be with ‘it’. Because it’s more fun than to be with people. So nobody comes out now. This town is empty. I’m going into a journey. I’m going to another town.”[Atashi Dake no Hito. “A City With no People”. Chobits]If a few months ago someone asked me if I\'d imagine I...was writing this review, I would definitely answer no. My past self could barely imagine that someday I would make space on the list to watch a potential Madhouse romance classic, nearly 20 years after its release. And if I were asked if I would imagine my experience as exactly it was, my present self would also answer no. After all, despite the many caveats I\'ll put into words here, Chobits surprised me with a relatively pertinent discussion for something that started out as just a rom-com embroidered ecchi lace.Chobits begins as a work exactly like what some of its genres and synopsis sell. Hideki Motosuwa is an 18-year-old boy born in a country town. Unfortunate by his failure in the entrance exam, he decides to migrate to a big city and attend a preparatory course. However, contrary to our common sense of what to expect, the culture clash between the two environments is significantly greater than it would be in a real situation, as Hideki\'s world is inhabited not just by people, but by robots with whom they coexist. These, of various sizes, shapes and functionalities, here present themselves by another name: “persocoms”. Don\'t worry, you\'ll soon learn more about them.On one of his walks back home, at nightfall, Hideki finds a persocom abandoned on a pile of rubbish. With difficulties, the young man carries the heavy humanoid to his modest house and is able to restart it. However, what appeared to be a common abandoned model, in reality, shows a much greater complexity when you first come into contact with it. Stripped of her old memory and with vestiges of a much more advanced system compared to others, the persocom, now renamed ""Chii"", her apprenticeship, her relationship with Hideki and her mysterious past become the focal point, and the narrative follows from there.The initial product is the attempt at an anime centered on comedy and that leaves its Sci-Fi in the background, while the element that occupies the most stage is the romance story filled with sexual jokes, involving moe situations, innocence and its heroine principal that exudes submission. The audience is amused by Chii\'s lack of knowledge about things and the mistakes she makes while trying to learn. The audience laughs at the protagonist and at the constant sexual situations, whether coincidental or accidentally created by himself. The public thinks the relationship that is built between the main couple is cute, despite the fact that, in this period of history, the pair is not defined as a couple. And I could have fun with this product too, if I didn\'t find it repetitive, silly and filled with unproductive episodes at times.One criticism I make of the first half of the show and its ecchi atmosphere in general is that the applied jokes constitute a simplistic and time-saturated formula. The vast majority of gags are based on two main elements: sex jokes involving the protagonist\'s behavior, through his young adult virgin nature; and jokes with misunderstandings of sexual meanings, involving Chii\'s innocence and deviations during her apprenticeship.In the early episodes, this serves the purpose of the characterization. However, the show evidently loses its way of humor as the same joke with porn magazines starts to appear in several of the episodes. Or, when any girl who approaches the protagonist induces the same reaction of sexual fantasy and shame (ok, luckily this behavior improves reasonably as the work progresses). In addition, more artificial situations, created solely and specifically to forge the joke, start to jump out, such as the scene where Chii finds a kitten carrying a handkerchief in its mouth and mistakes it for panties.Amidst the application of ecchi, I must say that it is not just harmful in the context of repetition. In some cases, it is also an anticlimactic agent, undermining scenes that should have a more symbolic or dramatic weight. In this department, perhaps the most famous example is in the infamous EP24, when there is a reconciliation between Yumi and Ueda. I mean, the formation of a couple and mutual acceptance here are the key points that seek to move the audience and provoke reflection on the central theme of the work (I\'ll get to it soon). The dialogues and the weight of the lines are purposefully more dramatic, but the climax of the scene is interrupted by the fact that Chii takes off the clothes of Ueda\'s old persocom and offers it to Yumi, while the protagonist blushes.In a certain point of view, the first half of the anime is necessary. The focus of the narrative is centered, above all, on Chii\'s learning and we see the character\'s development, the ability she acquires to communicate and the concepts she barely understood and that, later, she is able to understand. Unlike the protagonist, who squanders less development here, this portion is indeed important for the heroine. But, on the other hand, I must say that I was disappointed with the amount of scenes and episodes that were not very useful for the plot in general. At moments, I really see the story move forward, like when we get in touch with Kokubunji and Yuzuki\'s backstory. In others, I find myself bored and want to drop the work, while in front of my face there are beach episodes, scenes of Chii looking for a panty store and episodes of Hideki terrified by an urban horror legend. It\'s boring, and this last one, in particular, is the one that my humble opinion attributes as the worst of the work.Perhaps because I complained about the predictable and simple structure that follows the first half, I finally found myself satisfied with the work after its change in theme. That\'s because, as soon as the specific milestone of Shinbo\'s revelation hits the plot, Chobits has a shift from its core. The show\'s spotlight is no longer distributed over Chii and Hideki individually, but rather illuminates the entire stage and brings it all together in a central message that becomes more and more evident. Its greatest merit. Its important message aimed at viewers.Chobits is a work that evokes a concept that has already been so explored and used, but that has barely deteriorated in terms of relevance. It\'s as if it were a “tin man”, but it will never rust. Since the human being was conceived as a creator of technologies and holder of the ability to give life to other intelligences, futuristic projections entered the universe of popular imagination and soon spread to paper, where the most diverse authors write fiction. They range from optimistic views that portray the magnitude of electronic resources and their impact on various social spheres, to pessimistic views that choose to point fingers at our own creations as superior and substitute for human beings. I know I\'m about twenty years into the future with regard to Chobits, but several works have touched and will touch this theme even being ambivalent in these views, such as Sword Art Online, Psycho-Pass and Koukaku Kidoutai.Fear of substitution is natural. Everything we create is liable to risk becoming obsolete one day, and the technical-scientific-informational revolution has only accelerated this process even more. As what is around us is always in constant change, it is evident that, at some point, we would ask ourselves if the human being itself would not become obsolete and would be overtaken by evolution. And, as much as its reflections are not philosophical like those in the titles I quoted above, Chobits is right in portraying this uncertainty, projecting a possibility that is not necessarily as romantic as it sounds, nor is it as atrocious as we imagine.You see this duality from the perspective of relationships. While people are thinking creatures, they are also walking contradictions and beings endowed with defects, free wills, and memories that influence our worldview and reactions. On the other side of the coin, a machine or artificial intelligence is theoretically not bound by these fetters. We can put in any features and paint them according to our own individual palettes. Machines are theoretically rational and data driven, which is why artificial intelligences are often portrayed based on their purposes. That is the essence of a creation.But at the same time, this limit also removes the layer that exists in human coexistence. Human beings are constantly looking to define themselves by the other, and the presence of another person, someone who is not you, talking to your ego and giving you the uncertainty of how you will react to each word, represents a glamor in social interaction. See? While we are limited, our creations are also limited existences. There are things we can do and things we can\'t. And there are things that machines can do, but others that only humans can provide, from the most intuitive act of having children to details of the psychological dimension of interaction between a pair.That\'s why Chobits\' message is impactful. The reality of the work, although fictional and somewhat distant, proposes a reflection based on the illustrations of its characters: what would a reality be like in which a relationship between a human being and a robot is possible? And, going further, on both sides, how would the species psychological deal with loneliness, or with substitution?Personcoms represent an extremely important extension in this context. Their existence within society opens up the range of possibilities for different situations that would truly happen. For example, the portrait of Ueda and his stable union with Yumi, the persocom, depicts a pertinent illustration of adaptation during this incorporation of robots into society. Not only the development of human feelings for the machine is portrayed, but also the prejudice that society would potentially have, the inexistence of legalization for a stable union, and, mainly, the impact that this experience would have on those around them. Yumi, the human, and her separation-related drama is proof of that.If that\'s not enough, why not talk about Takako and Shinbo? The illustration that revolves around Takako\'s drama is a great example of how this replacement also has a dark side. Like it or not, the naturalization of the machine as an ideal partner is a possible reality in this science fiction. After all, it is much easier to accept the one you created yourself and be sure of how it will react, that it will always be there for you, than it is to love those who essentially have their faults and accept them. And, little by little, this vision being assimilated into society, abandonment and loneliness are indeed side effects, to the point where we are not even more sensitive to others of our species. Just look at the quote I put at the beginning of this review. The scenario created by it says it all.There are cases where we use this ability to paint our creations for other purposes. Kokubunji, for example, does not necessarily sustain a romantic relationship with his persocom, Yuzuki, but instead draws on the flexibility of technology to immortalize his sister\'s existence. Here, there\'s an overwhelmingly optimistic side to the technology, though his obsession with the memories he once lost represents an unhealthy spot. See the pattern, reader? Chobits deals with this theme with some respect, as the reality of persocoms is not seen solely as negative or positive, but rather as a mixture of the two.Unfortunately, not all characters in the work have relevant illustrations or some more expressive development. In addition to the protagonist, who is often a reason for jokes and whose development is based almost entirely on discovering feelings for Chii and her past, there are others that I would consider shallow in the context of the show. One of the greatest examples is Yoshiyuki Kojima, or, as we know him, ""Dragonfly"". His role in the work is to kidnap Chii to move the foreshadows of the script, his only motive being his interest in that persocom. He later switches sides and, again, his only job is to support the operation of hacking the mysterious syndicate\'s database. Without even a backstory, he\'s a veritable script lever, left and right, that doesn\'t do much for the message and that is forgettable to probably many of us.But of course every story has to come to an end. There is no better way to get your message across than to complete it as an expression. Thus, after ten episodes in a second arc relatively superior to the first, Chobits brings together the confluence of its elements in two climactic episodes, in which Hideki finally realizes his feelings and he and Chii confess to each other. And I must say, my sincere apologies to anyone who was moved by this final part, but I believe that CLAMP made some logical slips in it.Do not misunderstand me. The ending carries a valuable symbology, in fact. Ichirou\'s paternalism reflects the story that the creator himself and his wife attributed to Chii, keeping the hope that one day she will be able to transcend the tragedy Freya went through and find someone to match her. Ichiro instilled a program in Chii, and this program, at the end of its execution, makes it possible for all the persocoms connected to Chii to acquire, just like her, the capacity to love. In the anime, this isn\'t extremely clear, but it\'s interpretive. Persocoms\' eyes become realistic for a while, which brings them closer to human features. After all, feelings are the main difference between machines and people, and here their acquisition would bring them closer to us. Dima blushes when Zima hugs her after the program runs, and that attitude is also a hint.Other symbologies, such as Freya and Chii\'s lines about the button she has in her vagina can only be touched by “the one just for her”, gain a meaning more than the mere presence of ecchi, and that I need to appreciate. But at the same time, it appears that CLAMP has forgotten some of the sci-fi details that lack more tangible explanation. For example, why are Chii and Freya able to move around by jumping gracefully and seem to glide around town in episodes where Freya takes control of the body? Why do Freya\'s movements give the impression that she can fly? And why does this happen to Zima and Dima, too? It is assumed that all three are close models of persocom, and this physical ability may be implied, but as this is never formally explained or said, we only need to accept this “physics” during the robots\' wanderings.The factor that perhaps bothered me the most about this ending is the lack of detail in some of the sci-fi elements. Another example that raises this question is the functioning of the Chii program. How exactly can Chii be able to induce other persocoms to deliberately gain the ability to love? At what point did the acquisition of feelings become something transmissible by electromagnetic waves or a dataset that can be sent from persocom to persocom, without cables? As far as I know, the anime convinces us that Chii was able to learn to love due to her set of experiences plus the complexity of her model. So, the application of this program, despite being symbolic, is difficult to digest. It is difficult to accept that, while for Chii love has been a difficult path, for other artificial intelligences this is such an immediate and easy achievement, since the vast majority of them are not even assembled by their owners.Other solutions the script comes up with, like Chii and Freya\'s ability to control their cables like telekinetic tentacles (yes, I\'m not lying, she literally does that when Dima tries to stop her from running the program) make me question how much of logic was put at the climax of this work. And just like the physics that governs persocoms jumping from pole to pole, I am again forced to just accept and move on.To be fairer, I must emphasize that these details are not always CLAMP\'s fault. I haven\'t read the manga, but in my wanderings around Wikia, I\'ve found that in the source material Chii\'s program doesn\'t have this function, but rather represents a darker version of the heroine\'s journey. Rather than enabling persocoms to be able to love, the program was originally activated not when Chii found her love, but when she didn\'t. And its effect, originally, was not to create conditions for robots to win love, but rather the opposite, permanently turning off their facial recognition capabilities. This means that, in the original story, if Chii wasn\'t able to find ""the one just for her"", Ishiro would assume that none of the other persocoms could do that, and their ability to distinguish humans would forever be erased, dying along with the possibility of falling in love.This ending makes a lot more sense. Deleting facial recognition functions is a much more tangible achievement to be done through the connection Chii has with other persocoms than transferring data that enables them to conquer their own feelings. It\'s a simpler solution, but it doesn\'t bump into the fact that Chii is much more complex than her “sisters”. In addition, it is also more visionary, as Ichiro would leave open to her daughters a future in which persocom models would be more complex and closer to Chii\'s, and evolution would bring this achievement to them. That said, I believe Madhouse has made an unfortunate choice here, overpriced for moving its viewers, but unfortunately sacrificing the logic the authors stabilized in this part.Speaking of foreshadowing, I must say that the clues offered to the spectator in Chobits, although a little obvious in some of the moments, are present and relatively competent. The picture books that Chitose writes help us understand the reality of Chii\'s feelings and make up a “larger interpretation” when connected and related to understanding the end of the work. The phrases in the book are also illustrative of a reality in which behavior such as Ueda\'s would be morally accepted and disseminated, and this projection only adds to the reflection that the work attracts. Other elements such as character phrases that serve as a prelude to their later backstories, such as Yumi\'s comments on Chii and persocoms in general, are also welcome and I value them.Finally, I don\'t feel comfortable commenting on the production on Chobits, as I can\'t use the same molds we\'re currently seeing as a parameter. All I can say is that the art, even dating back twenty years, still plays its role relatively well and is consistent in most paintings. As one of the most influential studios in the industry at that time, Madhouse did a good job in that department if you look at it chronology, and I don\'t think that\'s a surprise to anyone, although there\'s the age shock if, like me, you decide to visit this show in 2022.The soundtrack is competent, from the calmest songs to the sound design of the most tense and sad moments. Despite this, I personally found some of the director\'s choices strange, like the one made in the Ueda and Yumi scene during EP24, which denotes expressively calm music for a moment that should have been more dramatic. I add an afterthought about opening as, contrary to popular opinion, I hated the fact that it was so static and so weak in its density of symbolism. Little happens in the storyboard, there is little fluidity and even less symbology. All that happens are changes in position and expression by Chi and Hideki in step with color, pixelation and music. Personally, I found it uninspiring, aside from giving the impression that the show is solely about romance between the two of them when in reality it isn\'t. As for the ending, although it is close to this archetype, my judgment is lighter. Fluid endings, full of symbologies, image transitions and deeper ones are rare, even more so at that time, so I can\'t charge much more than the reference made to Chitose\'s stories.Watching Chobits, like the message the work tries to convey, was an ambivalent experience. Half of the work is tedious, with some considerations, and the other half is rewarding, with other considerations. Some characters compose valuable illustrations, while others are shallow. Science fiction projects a pertinent universe, but it has its problems of explanation. That\'s why, at the end of this review, as much as it surprised me for a genre I\'m not so interested in, my enjoyment was balanced and I can\'t rate it any other than as balanced and neutral as possible. was writing this review, I would definitely answer no. My past self could barely imagine that someday I would make space on the list to watch a potential Madhouse romance classic, nearly 20 years after its release. And if I were asked if I would imagine my experience as exactly it was, my present self would also answer no. After all, despite the many caveats I\'ll put into words here, Chobits surprised me with a relatively pertinent discussion for something that started out as just a rom-com embroidered ecchi lace.Chobits begins as a work exactly like what some of its genres and synopsis sell. Hideki Motosuwa is an 18-year-old boy born in a country town. Unfortunate by his failure in the entrance exam, he decides to migrate to a big city and attend a preparatory course. However, contrary to our common sense of what to expect, the culture clash between the two environments is significantly greater than it would be in a real situation, as Hideki\'s world is inhabited not just by people, but by robots with whom they coexist. These, of various sizes, shapes and functionalities, here present themselves by another name: “persocoms”. Don\'t worry, you\'ll soon learn more about them.On one of his walks back home, at nightfall, Hideki finds a persocom abandoned on a pile of rubbish. With difficulties, the young man carries the heavy humanoid to his modest house and is able to restart it. However, what appeared to be a common abandoned model, in reality, shows a much greater complexity when you first come into contact with it. Stripped of her old memory and with vestiges of a much more advanced system compared to others, the persocom, now renamed ""Chii"", her apprenticeship, her relationship with Hideki and her mysterious past become the focal point, and the narrative follows from there.The initial product is the attempt at an anime centered on comedy and that leaves its Sci-Fi in the background, while the element that occupies the most stage is the romance story filled with sexual jokes, involving moe situations, innocence and its heroine principal that exudes submission. The audience is amused by Chii\'s lack of knowledge about things and the mistakes she makes while trying to learn. The audience laughs at the protagonist and at the constant sexual situations, whether coincidental or accidentally created by himself. The public thinks the relationship that is built between the main couple is cute, despite the fact that, in this period of history, the pair is not defined as a couple. And I could have fun with this product too, if I didn\'t find it repetitive, silly and filled with unproductive episodes at times.One criticism I make of the first half of the show and its ecchi atmosphere in general is that the applied jokes constitute a simplistic and time-saturated formula. The vast majority of gags are based on two main elements: sex jokes involving the protagonist\'s behavior, through his young adult virgin nature; and jokes with misunderstandings of sexual meanings, involving Chii\'s innocence and deviations during her apprenticeship.In the early episodes, this serves the purpose of the characterization. However, the show evidently loses its way of humor as the same joke with porn magazines starts to appear in several of the episodes. Or, when any girl who approaches the protagonist induces the same reaction of sexual fantasy and shame (ok, luckily this behavior improves reasonably as the work progresses). In addition, more artificial situations, created solely and specifically to forge the joke, start to jump out, such as the scene where Chii finds a kitten carrying a handkerchief in its mouth and mistakes it for panties.Amidst the application of ecchi, I must say that it is not just harmful in the context of repetition. In some cases, it is also an anticlimactic agent, undermining scenes that should have a more symbolic or dramatic weight. In this department, perhaps the most famous example is in the infamous EP24, when there is a reconciliation between Yumi and Ueda. I mean, the formation of a couple and mutual acceptance here are the key points that seek to move the audience and provoke reflection on the central theme of the work (I\'ll get to it soon). The dialogues and the weight of the lines are purposefully more dramatic, but the climax of the scene is interrupted by the fact that Chii takes off the clothes of Ueda\'s old persocom and offers it to Yumi, while the protagonist blushes.In a certain point of view, the first half of the anime is necessary.

But, on the other hand, I must say that I was disappointed with the amount of scenes and episodes that were not very useful for the plot in general. At moments, I really see the story move forward, like when we get in touch with Kokubunji and Yuzuki\'s backstory. In others, I find myself bored and want to drop the work, while in front of my face there are beach episodes, scenes of Chii looking for a panty store and episodes of Hideki terrified by an urban horror legend. It\'s boring, and this last one, in particular, is the one that my humble opinion attributes as the worst of the work.Perhaps because I complained about the predictable and simple structure that follows the first half, I finally found myself satisfied with the work after its change in theme. That\'s because, as soon as the specific milestone of Shinbo\'s revelation hits the plot, Chobits has a shift from its core. The show\'s spotlight is no longer distributed over Chii and Hideki individually, but rather illuminates the entire stage and brings it all together in a central message that becomes more and more evident. Its greatest merit. Its important message aimed at viewers.Chobits is a work that evokes a concept that has already been so explored and used, but that has barely deteriorated in terms of relevance.

That\'s why, at the end of this review, as much as it surprised me for a genre I\'m not so interested in, my enjoyment was balanced and I can\'t rate it any other than as balanced and neutral as possible.', ""oh.. it hurts to give this just a 6 because i genuinely enjoyed this anime in every way, but from a critical standpoint, its just.. okay! lets get the negatives out of the way first;first of all-- hideki sucks. lets get that out of the way. lack of depth, basic perverted male protag, basic design, quite annoying, it seems like the writers weren't being serious when writing him, which of course isnt a problem for a casual watcher such as myself, but when you're criticizing something its important to point out. i feel like theres only one memorable character in this entire series, chii,...which each character should have some sort of depth, especially as the main character you are first introduced to. i also read the visual novel for the gba & the manga and hidekis lack of depth is consistent throughout all forms of this media which is quite.. dissapointing to say the least? the anime had many chances to redeem him but it kinda fell.. flat?now onto the positives, the art style and the concept of persocoms is very charming and creative in general, the idea of having a robot thats meant to be a personal assisant, thats way too expensive to buy brand new, and you just find one in the dumpster? amazing. chii's backstory and arc throughout the anime is all around great aswell. however, i feel like hideki needs to go outside and get some hoes instead of trying to fuck the damn robot. which each character should have some sort of depth, especially as the main character you are first introduced to. i also read the visual novel for the gba & the manga and hidekis lack of depth is consistent throughout all forms of this media which is quite.. dissapointing to say the least? the anime had many chances to redeem him but it kinda fell.. flat?now onto the positives, the art style and the concept of persocoms is very charming and creative in general, the idea of having a robot thats meant to be a personal assisant, thats way too expensive to buy brand new, and you just find one in the dumpster? amazing. chii's backstory and arc throughout the anime is all around great aswell. however, i feel like hideki needs to go outside and get some hoes instead of trying to fuck the damn robot."", 'Often in anime, the really small things can be what makes a show shine, or makes the show absolute crap. A single character may be the focal point in the decision of whether to recommend a show or not. The ending could be sub-par. It could be any little detail that can be overlooked by some people. This sorta happened to me after watching Chobits.STORYThe story takes place in the future, where humans have built personal ‘’humanoid computers’’, basically robots that look like humans. These Persocoms, as they are called, are used for any job their owner wishes.Enter our main male protagonist, Kyon.Er, sorry... Hideki...Motosuwa. I got confused as he’s voiced by both Crispin Freeman AND Tomokasu Sugita. He kinda looks like him too... Hideki is a typical village farmer boy, whose dream is to study in Tokyo, but he fails, and ends up in Tokyo at a cram school. He begins to wish he could buy a Persocom, but due to his lack of IT skills and money, he can’t. Until he sees one thrown in a dumpster, and decides to keep it.As he switches on his persocom, he finds out that all she can say, is “Chii”, so he gives her this name.As the story progresses, Hideki begins to realise that Chii is not like a typical Persocom, but in fact, could be, one of the legendary advanced Persocoms, Chobits.CHARACTERSThe characters are in my opinion where Chobits trips and falls. The main duo, Hideki and Chii are what drives the show on, however it’s the secondary characters that are off. For example, let’s take Hideki’s new friend and neighbour Shinbo, who begins as a normal side character, and Hideki’s school teacher Shimizu Takako. The few episodes that are meant to put them into the spotlight for “character development” are SO stupid,(SPOILER!) I mean, there are so many things you can do, but because the teacher (who is an adult, just as a reminder) is married to guy who prefers spending time with his Persocoms rather than his wife, she runs away with Shinbo, who later proposes to her. WHAT THE F......?!(End of Spoiler)Also, this anime features the most annoying character I have ever seen, Sumomo, Shinbo’s Persocom. Her dialogue at times made me want to put my head through a wall.ANIMATION & SOUNDFor a show that was done in 2002, the animation looks pretty decent. Well, this is Studio Madhouse we’re talking about. This was the time when digital animation was beginning, but the show still managed to pull off the two animation styles for comedic moments, and serious moments.The soundtrack of Chobits is enjoyable, consisting of orchestral strings, with synthesisers for a relaxing atmosphere... The opening song, is one of the best I’ve heard. I didn’t like it as much from the beginning, but after listening to it over and over again, it ended up stuck in my head, because of how catchy it is... The soundtrack is also able to stay with the tempo of the story, so when things get serious, so does the music. The best example is “Dark Chii’s Theme”, which is a mix of upbeat digital synths, a 90’s style dance beat and lyrical strings.I watched this show in English dub, and I really enjoyed the performances, especially by Crispin Freeman, Michelle Ruff, Karen Strassman,  Mona Marshall, Wendee Lee and Tony Oliver... a really enjoyable dub...Evaluation:Overall, Chobits has a great story, which (unfortunately) focuses more on the slice of life/romance rather than the whole “Relationships between Humans and Artifical Intelligence”.  In short, rather bad pacing, which ended up in a fast bucketload of explanations and a confusing ending. Could have been done better, but there are worse examples.

I\'m open for critism!Chobits is romance drama anime with a lot of funny ecchi comedy situations. The plot isn\'t something unique but the idea of Persocoms is great in my opinion. The emotions from the main characters - Chii and Hideki are shown so great,that you even dont pay so much attention on the plot orginality. Sometimes you even can\'t trust that Chii is computer. I don\'t like some side characters,they don\'t look serious to me(for example,Minoru...Persocoms,except Yuzuki of course), but the main characters who creates all the story is perfect,in my opinion.The tehnologies have been changing so much. Personal computers now are ""Persocoms"",computers who looks like human beings.Typical perverted student,Hideki Motosuwa, has moved to the city to study. He sees those Persocoms everywhere,he wants one so bad. But he can\'t afford it.One day he\'s going home and near the trash he founds a Persocom and he tooks it. After he has brought it home,he turns it on and it seems like the Persocom only can say ""Chii!"". Hideki don\'t know anything about Persocoms,he really wants good persocom but he doesn\'t know what to do with Chii. Time is moving forward and Hideki meets more characters who knows things about Persocoms. Seems like there is a fact that Chi might be ""Chobit"",very advanced Persocom. Hideki will try to find out if Chii is one of those advanced persocoms called Chobits.If you want to see good emotional romance anime,then you really should check out Chobits. Also it has a lot of funny moments, what makes it even better. The art is nice for that year i think,also there are no problems with sound. The opening song can confuse a little bit,but you will get used to it,haha!English is not my native language,sorry for so many mistakes,but thank you for reading this!

I don\'t, however, see this point mentioned elsewhere, so I\'ll pitch in my two cents.On first pass, the anime appears to be a fairly close adaptation of the manga.  Yes - there are filler episodes and a lot of ""fan service.""   And, for the latter, the focus is shifted from Hideki to Chii.  She\'s cuter and less hysterical and annoying than he is.   These don\'t, to me, change the story, and its implications fundamentally.Spoiler alert -What does make a big difference, IMO, are the terms of Hideki\'s and...Chii\'s future relationship.  In the manga, I read that, because of Chii\'s (unfortunate) reset switch location, they can never physically consummate their love without sacrificing all of Chii\'s personality.  In the anime, however, the idea seems to be that - being the one ""just for her"" - Hideki will be an exception.  Only he can ""come inside.""  (Was this an intentional pun?)Let\'s set aside, for the moment, issues about sex with a computer (even a very cute one), let alone one with a child-like innocence, and the appearance of a 12-year old.  Carving out this exception for ""the one just for Chii,"" seems to trivialize Hideki\'s final dilemma.  Having accepted the possibility of loving a computer, and Freya\'s assertion that even a Chobit doesn\'t have genuine, organic emotions, but merely programmed responses - his next hurdle is whether he can forgo physical love, eros, for the very strong, if albeit synthetic love, agape, that Chi has shown.Hideki is, after all, a guy.  We\'ve established by his extensive collection of porn that he\'s quite the horndog and, from various comments, eager to shed his virginity. For him, this is no small sacrifice to ask.In the manga, Hideki may have one, or the other, but not both.  Ever.On the other hand, the implication in the anime seems to be that, since they truly love each other - Chi and her personality will, somehow, survive the physical consummation of their love.  Hideki can have his cake....  Hmmm.By this, superfically, slight turn, it seems to me the weight of Hideki\'s Big Decision is changed from a powerful Wife of Bath sort of dilemma, and one that deeply affects, if not defines, their future relationship - to a trivial, after-school special public service-type message: ""Wait to have sex, kids,"" if not until marriage, then at least until you have found ""the one for you.""CLAMP\'s original version puts a very deep and provocative question to the reader, and by extension leaves a lot of threads dangling about the durability of this relationship.  The anime adaptation, however, ties it all up very neatly.  Maybe a bit too neatly.Ultimately, I\'m not clear on why this change was necessary.  It\'s not like they ""cleaned up"" the whole story for a G audience.  So why deviate from the original story in this substantial detail?This niggling issue aside, both versions offer a nice story.  The characters are sweet and endearing.  The art is very good and the music ranges from deep and evocative to silly and fun.  I Dream of Jeannie meets Small Wonder meets SexWorld.

I Dream of Jeannie meets Small Wonder meets SexWorld.', 'Hideaki Motosuwa. Hideaki is a country boy with dreams of being a freshman in college; dreams which are dashed as he is summarily denied entry into the school of his choice. Having decided to go to prep school in Tokyo, he soon finds himself living on his own in a small apartment trying to make ends meet. On his way home after a food run, he encounters what he first assumes is a dead body but what turns out to be a persocom left out on the trash heap wrapped in bandages which just barely cover her body. Amazed at his stroke of luck, Hideaki...takes her home and turns her on. Upon power-up, it’s clear that this persocom, doesn’t have much going on upstairs, but somehow, she knows enough to smile and glomp [Like many fan girls I know…]. Further intrigued, Hideaki decides to keep her, giving her the name “Chi” [as that’s the only word she knows at first]. Upon analysis by resident middle school persocom guru Koushiro “Izzy” Izumi Minoru Kokubunji, it is determined that Chi possesses both highly sophisticated firewalls for protection and learning software which allows Chi to learn much like a human being. Hideaki then decides to take it upon himself to teach Chi about the world around her while he in turn learns about her, all the while managing his part time job at a local pub and his studies to get into college. As the series goes on, questions soon arise about Chi’s origins with the only clue being the legend of the “Chobits” persocoms, who, internet rumor has it, possesses the ability to exercise free will and show emotion. One thing that I liked about “Chobits” is the fact that it can be enjoyed on different levels; it can be enjoyed on a science fiction level, a romance level, or even a slice-of-life level; you get a lot for your money with “Chobits”. The story has a very decent flow to it, and there aren’t any real moments that slow it down or drag it on; each episode has a purpose that lends itself to the whole overall plot.  The little side stories, where the plot deviates from Chi and Hideaki and focuses on the relationships of other characters, are enjoyable and tugs at the heartstrings. The ending would be perfect, were it not for two characters that were thrown into the fray at the last minute only to depart just as quickly. The ending would’ve done WAY better if they were either introduced at one point earlier in the series or omitted entirely. Other than that, “Chobits” is an enjoyable story that anyone can enjoy.The characters of “Chobits” are a very special group. Each character has a unique personality and backstory that makes the story worth watching. Even the persocoms, which are, for the most part, mechanical objects, possess a personality and a character all their own. Our male lead, Hideaki, is pretty much an animated version of yours truly plus or minus a few traits. He’s awkward and a little naïve about the world he finds himself in, different from the farmlands of Hokkaido. He’s dense at times, but overall his heart is in the right place and he cares deeply about those around him, including but not limited to his persocom Chi. Chi is downright adorable and a perfect match with Hideaki. As she has no memory of her past or the current world she lives in, she’s also a little socially awkward and naïve, behaving more like a toddler than a computer, but over time, she grows and matures like Hideaki. Overall, I don’t have a real problem with any of the characters…except Yumi, the daughter of the owner of the bar where Hideaki works. I swear it was like Koishi Herikawa from “Please Teacher” all over again. Okay, let me get this straight: you fall in love with a man who is CLEARLY older than you, and then, when he marries his persocom, you develop a grudge and start fawning over another guy who is younger than the first guy, but still older than you are! What the heck is that about?! Ugh…my head is starting to ache again like it did with Koishi in “Please Teacher”…just take the points, Samurai…“Chobits” doesn’t offer much in terms of musical prowess. Don’t get me wrong, the music is good, but it’s not that memorable. The opening theme song, “Let Me Be With You” by Round Table featuring Nino is bubbly and catchy, going well with the awesome animation. The end themes, “Raison d’être” (Reason to Be) by Rie Tanaka [On episodes 1-13], “Ningyo-Hime” (Mermaid Princess) by Rie Tanaka [Used in Episodes 14-25], and “Katakoto no Koi” (Awkward Love) by Rie Tanaka and Tomokazu Sugita used in the series finale all match perfectly and fit in the respective episodes that they’re used in. The incidental music is good without being overpowering, and its funny how sometimes the music takes on a techno-like feel to it one minute, and then take on a woodwind and strings feeling the next. It does the job and does it well. takes her home and turns her on.

After watching this series from Episode 1-24 and an OVA episode, let me just say, this really made me laugh my butt off. For those who love those animes with those awkward bath house or tripping and falling on top of a girl by mistake moments, this show has plenty of that. Aside from those things, this show has a lot of feel-good moments in it too. As you may have read in the...description, an ordinary guy happens to come across a robot in the trash, but it\'s brand new, so he decides to take it home. He powers her up, and that\'s where the long, yet wonderful story begins.For those of you who have seen those ""boy meets girl"" animes, let me just say it isn\'t anything like that. The story is original as far as I know, and there is one major plot mixed in with other minor plots all throughout the series, so of course they have a fairly good conclusion to the show, only I won\'t be giving any spoilers any time soon, so watch and see. The minor stories range from taking baths, going to underwear stores, and getting trapped in a MMORPG. Lots of randomness, but all good.Artwork was good. I didn\'t particularly find any qualities that girls find in men with the main guy, but Chi and the rest of the characters are a different story. All of the girl protagonists in the show are cute, and you\'ll be able to see why he has all those perverted fantasies about them. Along with the characters, the rest of the scenery is fairly well made.I like all the voice actors in the show, they matched their characters perfectly,  but the only thing that bugged the heck out of me was having to listen to Chi say ""chi"" all the time. It was cute at first, but then episode 2 was like ""Yeah, so does she say anything else?"", and then later on I was all like ""Ok seriously, learn more words, this is really getting annoying."". Luckily it doesn\'t go like that for the whole series, or I really would have thought about muting the sound and switching on the subs, but to take Chi\'s place, Momo came into the picture. THAT\'S when I switched to subs every time she would make an appearance.Setting the artwork aside, the characters are all lovable, funny, and with the exception of Momo, there wasn\'t 1 character that I disliked. Hideki\'s perverted personality was what sealed the deal for me when I started watching this show cause I couldn\'t stop laughing at every awkward moment in the show. Chi is playful, cute, and without her, I have no idea what this show would be like. Rest of the minors fit in well with the story.On a scale of 1-10, I\'d give it a 9 for enjoyment, just because of those few ""I can\'t stand it anymore, here comes the subs"" moments. I liked the show a lot, like seriously, it was the first good anime I had to spend a full night awake watching. Hopefully this review was helpful to most of you. description, an ordinary guy happens to come across a robot in the trash, but it\'s brand new, so he decides to take it home.

The story was the typical, some pervert finds an naked girl somewhere where he would least expect it, brings her home, and she ends up having some amazing power and an dark past that he would have never imagined kind of story, so I was thinking, here we go again when I saw this anime, and even though it is that typical anime, It managed to keep my attention more than any other anime with that story would, I just couldn't get enough of Chi! As the description says it has ecchi which i am...not very fond of, but it was able to keep my attention by having an intresting story line and keeping me wondering what is going to happen next becuase i love Chi's fun personality and cuteness. She got into alot of mature situations which are unexpected becuase she is like an little girl, little common sense, very cute, overly sensitive, the whole lot of the little girl charasitics.But my attention grabber was not just Chi! As I said before, I loved the story line. So if you are 18 or,16 at the least, do not mind ecchiness, and are fine with this kind of typical story, watch Chobits now! You are in for a treat that will keep you coming back for more! not very fond of, but it was able to keep my attention by having an intresting story line and keeping me wondering what is going to happen next becuase i love Chi's fun personality and cuteness.

Well here goes I will tell exactly what I felt while I was watching it and hope it will encourage you to watch this beautiful story of love breaking all boundaries ""because no matter what being happy in life is the most valuable treasure"".(It said that this has echchi comedy moments but there was very less and I wish there was a bit more comedy but it’s just me ok.the story is pure gold)story-the plot starts very simple with lot of questions given from the very beginning so it’s fun because you feel like you...have to find the answers right now just as the lead male character feel in this case ""HIDEKI""this story is a pure definition to what real love is, like how love spouse to feel and what you should look for. it tells the viewer this is what real love is and kind of ask us in a way “have you ever known love like this?” if not then it’s not love. So if you watch it you will have a bigger heart than before to think different and the right way about love. This story contains all kinds of love and different plots for each character and their own happy endings. This was a very brilliant move by the writers.art-was good very fluid like water very smooth and lot of fantastic details on the background but I had a problem (remember only i had a problem) with their eyes (hidekis eye was ok because it suited his character) it wasn\'t that animated (for me) at all it kind looked wired (for me) I mean it wasn\'t beautiful it was dead like in zombis.they didn’t put that much detail in to it (for me).that’s the only this that bugged me. This was an amazing story that’s why. Couldn’t they give them perfect anime eyes i hope you get what I’m saying? But that makes it unique form other anime there so it’s still a plus point.sound-I loved the opening theme and the ending theme songs no problem but they should have at least change the animation of it though, seeing the same thing kind of board me but I got through with it because music was fun and energetic and i love the song and the story was just mind blowing good, there was a plot twist in every corner.background music was so much fun and funny but was dramatic when it needed to be, it was top notch.Characters-this was the main point in my case the characters had so many different but same views in love. it’s like everyone\'s going to the same school using different kind of transportation, sub characters were like “teachers to hideki and chi “in to showing what love actually is.sub characters were like cherry on top, they worked really well together .I felt like they belonged there and nowhere else. Every character was handle perfectly very carefully and it paid off “hands off to the writer”.hideki- I think represented us in this unknown advanced world....he was so much fun to watch also you can feel what he can feel at the moment because he is a normal person like us.i was very touched by his actions and emotion because he did things that I would have done. The way he think, the things he say, the things he go through, I felt everything the same way he felt at that very moment. He was the character that I saw myself in. Chi-was just adorable learning little by little, what she is looking for (she knew it from the begging that she want a special person to love but it was hidden in the past), what love is and when she found out the uneasy feeling that she has deep inside her heart is love, she wasn’t afraid to follow her heart think she was very brave and inspiring to all girls out there to know what they really want and learn to do what your heart tells you. this was a story of love, for all kinds of people, so I invite you to come fall in love like never before ""the story tells being loved by someone, anyone and falling in love with the special someone is the way to be happy “so what are you waiting for go watch it now! have to find the answers right now just as the lead male character feel in this case ""HIDEKI""this story is a pure definition to what real love is, like how love spouse to feel and what you should look for. it tells the viewer this is what real love is and kind of ask us in a way “have you ever known love like this?” if not then it’s not love.

I had been hearing about it for a very long time and out of curiosity decided to try it out, and I&rsquo;m glad that I did.The story was very original. I have never heard of or seen anything like it. I liked the fact that it was romantic but not too over the top. The episodes themselves were very interesting. At times, I had to forcefully pull myself from the screen to stop watching. It had been a while since that last happened. The characters were designed beautifully. Chii, especially Chii, was made into a totally cutie. She had...the right mix of innocence and sensuality. I&rsquo;m glad that she wasn&rsquo;t made into the typical over the top sexy protagonist. Personality wise, I loved the character development. The characters were well rounded and relatable.I first began watching Chobits in Japanese. I think the voices fit every character perfectly. About 10 episodes into the series, I began watching it in English and I was amazed. The voices sounded so familiar to the Japanese ones. I was really impressed.Overall, I recommend this to anybody. I&rsquo;ve heard of some people that refuse to watch it because they think its all ecchi. But that&rsquo;s really not the point of the series. Sure, it has its moments done in good taste for humor, more toward the beginning, but it eventually steps away from that. It&rsquo;s a heartwarming, romantic, funny, and interesting anime. I give it a 9/10. the right mix of innocence and sensuality. I&rsquo;m glad that she wasn&rsquo;t made into the typical over the top sexy protagonist.

Seriously, I really had to force myself to complete the series. A total snooze fest. Also, Hideki and Chii’s relationship made me really uncomfortable, it gave off pedophilic vibes. Chii looks like a pre-teen and acts like a child. Really disturbing. Hideki basically ends up falling in love with a underage looking robot, with the mentality of a child and who has no personality, and that he can’t even have a proper conversation with.Another creepy thing is how her power switch is located in her private parts... And Hideki has to molest her...to turn her on (literally). to turn her on (literally).', ""SynopsisHaving failed to earn admission to a university, Hideki Motosuwa has moved to the big city, determined to study his hardest for next year's exams. However, an unusual distraction presents itself one unsuspecting day in the form of Chii, a robotic young girl that has been discarded in the trash. In a world where an increasing number of people turn to these 'persocons' for company, the bonds and limits of human relationships are tested as flesh manages to fall in love with the machine itself...Story (8/10)Chobits is a charming series which portrays, weirdly enough, a touching relationship between man and his computer. Incidentally, it...also brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘to turn a girl on'.As well as providing excellent comedy moments to enhance the emotional experience, Chobits delivers an intriguing social commentary on the relationship between humans and machines. Sure, watching Chii stumble adorably through simple social situations with hilarious consequences left me feeling warm and cheerful. However, later, as the series introduced the more controversial subplots, I found myself emotionally confused (in a good way) and a touch saddened. I am unsure whether I agree with the possibilities opened up by the story, although I appreciate how important these issues are for the characters. At the least I take this as a sign of the series' complexity.Whilst largely episodic, with the series revolving around Chii's step-by-step development and Hideki's bumbling responses to it, there also exists an overarching sad tone which only comes to the fore towards the end. In this way, it is comparable to series like Fruits Basket and, just like Fruits Basket, the delivery of the last few episodes is great. On the one hand, what happens to the central protagonists is quite melodramatic but, in terms of the wider implications, the series delivers an intriguing, open-ended conclusion.Everything considered, only one question remains: why does it not deserve the full marks available? The problem is that Chobits remains trapped by its genre, with the plot hinging upon the ‘single male with female guest in his apartment' gimmick. Although presented with utmost skill, the fact remains that there are only so many new ideas to be found here. The result is that the bulk of episodes in the middle are stereotypical and wholly skippable with the second viewing.Animation (8/10)Being a typical CLAMP feature, Chobits has a clean, fresh look, with the palette comprised mostly of pleasant pastels. Movement is smooth throughout and the comic expressions hit the spot every time. Because of the combination of simple-yet-elegant design and quality visuals, dating the series is not straightforward; meaning it will continue to look good for a long while yet.Animation-wise, my only problem is with the character designs of Chii and Hideki. I find it discomfiting that this guy who looks twenty-five (although he is nineteen) is supposedly in love with a girl that looks twelve (although, technically, she is ageless). There is a believable reason why she looks that way, but that does not stop me pulling the odd face, particularly at the ecchi scenarios.Characters (8/10)Chii is everything a guy could ever want - docile, loyal as hell, and forever pubescent. Not to mention that she looks great in a towel. Going by past experience with similar characters, I expected nothing substantial from her... which means I was pleasantly surprised at the extent to which she did develop. At first she just does a lot of endearing things like mimic Hideki's actions and act innocent at the most inappropriate times, which only evokes a lot of sentimental gushing. Eventually, her own will and personality start to come across; although, disappointingly, she does not mature to the extent that she could have. By the end, she still seems a lot more victim than heroine, albeit a highly sympathetic one.Just like Chii, but on a different level, Hideki Motozuwa is a fish out of water character. A farm boy trying to make it in cosmopolitan Tokyo, he is shy around girlie things, kind and considerate, and totally lacking in the brain department. Hideki is ninety percent stereotypical - down to the nosebleeds and the virginity - but the ten percent of personality that he has stops him being annoyingly flat. For example, his patience when teaching Chii, how he provides for her at considerable cost to himself, his active concern for her when she is not with him, and his willingness to learn from her in turn, are indicators of a deep and admirable soul. Moreover, the fact that Hideki provides some classic comedy moments makes warming to him very easy.The rest of the cast, including Hideki's best friend Hiromu Shinbo, Yumi the waitress, Minoru Kokubunji the child expert, Mr. Ueda the baker, and Chitose Hibiya the landlady, all have fantastic backgrounds. They provide subplots which are not only emotional in their own right, but feed meaningfully into the central plot as well. Each character's situation is a memorable variation on the same theme and gives a fascinating insight into Chobits's controversy.Overall (8/10)Chobits is enjoyable through and through, just not rewatchable through and through. Barring the formulaic structure, it seems to have no major flaws to speak of; after all, it has characters that are interesting, delivers some truly heart-warming moments, and looks very good. If you are looking for a romance with a mostly-sweet-sometimes-sad feel, then this one comes highly recommended. also brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘to turn a girl on'.As well as providing excellent comedy moments to enhance the emotional experience, Chobits delivers an intriguing social commentary on the relationship between humans and machines.

I think Chobits might be an acception to this.If anybody ever found anybody calling this anime ""perversion with computers"", anybody who says this is wrong.There are no sex scenes in this anime and almost NO nudity.  Sure, there\'s partial nudity in one scene and one scene where a character is seen naked from a distance, but it\'s so brief and undetailed that it doesn\'t really matter and doesn\'t affect the storyline at all.In fact, I\'d say most of this series...is quite funny.  The antics of the innocent and clueless Chi brought a smile to my face and brigtened my mood.  Of course, the gangly and easily-excitable Hideki Motosuwa also contributed to my enjoyment of this series.The story takes a darker turn closer to the end, and it left me excited and wanted to watch the final episodes one after the other right away.

Chii\'s adorable persona is irresistible and Hideki\'s pervert-like nature adds a a comedic flair to the series. Chii\'s senselessness personality, however, made it a bit difficult and irritating to watch sometimes. I get that her memory was wiped and she didn\'t understand how to function properly, but did she really need to be ""dumbed down"" that much?Even so, it was still a fairly enjoyable series to watch and the supporting characters were just as funny and adorable as the main characters. The story along with Hideki and Chii\'s bond were both strong factors that kept the series...entertaining. entertaining.', ""Honestly, I have no clue why this series is so popular. Many people seem to love it and are gushing over it like its the best thing ever. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I mean, fine the premise seems promising(which is the only reason why i bothered starting it) but thats about it.The series doesn't even have a proper plot or story arcs. The explanation for why chobits exist and why they are able to exhibit human emotions were also very vague. The human brain is a complex thing. It's the only part of the human body that can't be replicated or cloned. And this...series isn't even set THAT far into the future, just a couple of years from now. That means that science couldn't possibly have progressed to a point where you can have robots, oh sorry i mean PERSOCOMMS that can think and feel on their own. I mean, come on. Even sci-fi should be based on what we already know. But i shan't bore you with the scientific inaccuracies of the series. Let's move on to something more fun to mock: the plot. Or shall we say, the NON-EXISTENT plot.Each episode is just random and mundane things happening to chi and hideki in a setting thats small and uninteresting. One can probably argue that thats the appeal of the series, but it didn't work for me. That's just an excuse for filler anyway. When I read the synopsis, i expected the series to be a sci-fi/psychological anime but it took a whole other turn which genuinely surprised me. It would probably have been better if it were done in a darker tone.Another huge problem for me were the characters. Chi was obviously designed to be cute and innocent but she just came off as stupid and annoying. Her mannerisms were slightly irritating in the first couple of episodes but then it just became unbearable. Maybe i just hate these overrated, so-called kawaii female characters. Hideki was just your typical horny teenage boy with a stash of porn mags. He is stupid, pathetic and makes you wonder why the hell he was chosen as the protagonist instead of shindo. By the way, if shindo was the protagonist, the series would probably be called 'the mundane troubles of my perverted neighbour and his insipid robot'. He's also shallow and doesn't give a hoot as long as the chick in front of him is cute and bangable, which was probably the only reasons why he fell for chi, since she doesnt seem to possess any other traits. In the underwear episode, as i like to call it, he insists repeatedly to chi that he isn't a pervert, which totally explains why he leaves he porn mags lying around the apartment and letting his mindless pet robot browse through them whenever she likes. The only thing that surprised me about him was why he didn't just rape the crap out of chi the second he brought her back.The plot(oh wait there wasn't one) was just so mind-numbingly slow moving it kills brain cells, man. And the thing about the book..oh god. come on, what are the chances? she just LOOKS at a random book in a bookstore and coincidentally, it becomes a huge part of the ''plot''.So yeah, this series hovers between average and bad for me, when its not teetering on the edge of hentai.(if there was such a rating) series isn't even set THAT far into the future, just a couple of years from now. That means that science couldn't possibly have progressed to a point where you can have robots, oh sorry i mean PERSOCOMMS that can think and feel on their own. I mean, come on. Even sci-fi should be based on what we already know. But i shan't bore you with the scientific inaccuracies of the series. Let's move on to something more fun to mock: the plot. Or shall we say, the NON-EXISTENT plot.Each episode is just random and mundane things happening to chi and hideki in a setting thats small and uninteresting. One can probably argue that thats the appeal of the series, but it didn't work for me. That's just an excuse for filler anyway. When I read the synopsis, i expected the series to be a sci-fi/psychological anime but it took a whole other turn which genuinely surprised me. It would probably have been better if it were done in a darker tone.Another huge problem for me were the characters. Chi was obviously designed to be cute and innocent but she just came off as stupid and annoying. Her mannerisms were slightly irritating in the first couple of episodes but then it just became unbearable. Maybe i just hate these overrated, so-called kawaii female characters. Hideki was just your typical horny teenage boy with a stash of porn mags. He is stupid, pathetic and makes you wonder why the hell he was chosen as the protagonist instead of shindo. By the way, if shindo was the protagonist, the series would probably be called 'the mundane troubles of my perverted neighbour and his insipid robot'. He's also shallow and doesn't give a hoot as long as the chick in front of him is cute and bangable, which was probably the only reasons why he fell for chi, since she doesnt seem to possess any other traits. In the underwear episode, as i like to call it, he insists repeatedly to chi that he isn't a pervert, which totally explains why he leaves he porn mags lying around the apartment and letting his mindless pet robot browse through them whenever she likes.

As would (I'm sure) someone who is a bit new to anime, as the typical scenario of a male surrounded by females would not seem as overdone to them. But unfortunately I've seen it so much that it started, for me, on a wrong note.The characters are a typical setup, which you will quickly notice. Not all anime can have unqiue and well thought out characters, I know, it's just unfortunate. The actual designs are quite appealing in some cases, as far as visuals are concerned. I really liked Chi's overall...look, in fact, all the persocoms had quite nice designs. Again though, I felt the personality really lacked.Story starts out simple but we know there is something bigger, or some kind of secret behind why Chi was thrown away.  I'll admit a few things, there were some nice plot twists, even though a lot were predictable. And I'll also admit there were some lovely, almost magical scenes in the anime, often involving Chi. The anime is surprisingly pleasing to the eye (considering I personally hate CLAMP's art style, this is a big one for me), and the point of humanxmachine romance is oddly interesting. But I never really felt like there was much more, even with the story, something about it was just weak. Whether it was the typical ecchi/harem setup I mentioned before, the fairly predictable story, or the boring and overused personalities, it simply did not come across as much more than a visual pleaser with some romance. And for me, that's what let it down.Don't get me wrong though, it's definitely good for a light romance with an actual plot leading it on, I just wouldn't personally call it anything of a masterpiece. Nor would I suggest it to anyone watching for the story instead of the romance. It's quite simply, a very typical anime. look, in fact, all the persocoms had quite nice designs.

Years later, I finally got to watch it, and all I can say, it was almost everything I expected it to be. Almost.Chobits takes place in the near future, where Personal Computers (or Persocoms for short) are no longer boxes on desks, but walking talking androids...with inexplicable cat ears. In other words, persocoms are laptops, tablets, smartphones, GPS system and a lot more, in a human-like cybernetic body, with the power of a supercomputer. It\'s a sight straight out of the ""Uncanny Valley"".At the...beginning of the story, we meet our protagonist, Hideki. A plain farmer boy from a rural village, who decides to ditch the pitchfork, leave the family farm, and go to a college in the big city. His ultimate dream is to buy his own persocom. Growing up in the middle of nowhere he only ever seen them (and modern technology in general) in magazines, so he doesn\'t really know what to expect. Imagine his surprise, when the first day walking home from shopping, he finds a seemingly completely intact persocom, with the looks of a hot high-school girl, thrown out in the trash. Seeing it as a divine gift, he lugs the thing back to his apartment and ushers it to life.Enter Chi, our second protagonist and poster girl of the series. She is unmistakably a persocom, but apparently she lost all her programming somehow, so aside from basic motions the only thing she is capable of doing is saying ""chi"" a lot. She does have a learning software, so it seems it\'s up to her new owner Hideki to teach her everything about everything.As far as story goes, we\'ve seen this master-disciple (or senpai-underdog) dynamic in tons of other anime and movies already. But, given this premise, one would expect hilarity and fun times to ensue, as Hideki, the clueless hillbily, tries to teach the oblivious android about life in the big city. It\'s the typical ""blind leading the blind"" formula, which can be a really fun concept when done right. And it also could be a heartwarming coming-of-age story, as Hideki and Chi go on a journey together, to experience and learn about life. Or, more precisely, could\'ve been, since apparently the creators of this series had a wholly different thing in mind.Instead of letting this pretty damn good premise loose to run it\'s course, they forced the story into a quite uncomfortable scaffold of high moralizing and pretentious ""deeper meaning"". In the first half of the series, there is tons of fun to be had, as both Hideki and Chi are struggling to adjust to life in the futuristic big city. But as the series progresses, the story and the tone unapologetically starts to weer off course from the fun hijinks, and shoves a lot of needless drama and hard questions in our faces, like human rights of androids, persocom addiction, dependency on technology and the whole argument about whether or not android could have real feelings or what constitutes being ""alive"" or ""human"". I had flashbacks to the Bicentennial Man from Asimov, since this is the same exact story, sans the cute nekomimi android chick. Don\'t misunderstand me, I was always a proponent of anime having many layers and a meaningful story that deals with real problems. Even in Chobits, there are a number of pretty well made arguments about said things, and it asks a few hard questions to think about. But sadly, it doesn\'t stop there, and goes beyond to the point where it started to feel extremely forced and tacky. Especially the last few episodes, where the anime completely goes off the rails to force in a vapid, self-serving ""big reveal"" about some secret conspiracy and a forced tear-jerker backstory. Add some unnecessary action scenes, a pedantic life lesson about the power of love or something, and it all congeals in an ending that just makes no sense whatsoever. Trying to pull a half-""Elfen Lied"" and half-""Do Androids Dream Of Electic Sheep?"" was the wrong move here.(Honestly, I would\'ve been fine just watching Hideki and Chi learning things together, experiencing many things for the first time and trying to both find their ways in a quasi-unexplored world of high-tech city life, and life in general. Seeing things and situations from both Hideki\'s (human) and Chi\'s (android) point of view would\'ve made for some very interesting moments and things to think about. This duality in their relationship could\'ve been explored way more, and would\'ve made for a really intriguing series. But alas, nothing in life is perfect.)In closing, I would still recommend Chobits, despite all the criticism I just laid on it. It\'s a really fun anime through and through, with laughs, emotions, drama and some hard questions. The art design and animation is top notch, Chi is super cute and the whole story is charming and endearing, despite falling apart in the end. If you want to watch a really good anime with lots of personality, Chobits is the one for you.

Just...try to take the latter half of the series with a grain of salt, and you\'ll have much fun :)', 'Chances are, even if you don’t know what anime is, you’ve seen Chii before. You’ve seen the persocom ‘ears’ before. They’re iconic.Despite being a cloyingly cute, dusted-with-powdered-sugar and raspberries on the side slice of life anime, Chobits actually has much more to offer than what the plot summary would initially have you believe.Technically, Chobits is a good looking show, not great. Slice of life anime often gets the shaft in terms of animation quality, and here it’s very basic. The character models are equally simple and the colors are very sweet, muted pastels; it’s a very cute anime to look at. CLAMP’s unique art style...actually translates from manga to anime pretty seamlessly—something that sometimes works well, like in Rayearth, and sometimes horribly fails, like in xxxHolic. The music is equally precious and poppy, unbelievably catchy, and a perfect fit for the series.The first two thirds of the show are all kinds of adorable, where Hideki and Chii find themselves in different every day situations—a day at the beach, looking for a job, cramming for a final. Unlike most persocoms, Chii doesn’t understand humans or their world, and it’s endearing watching Hideki attempt to teach her how to play an MMORPG as well as impress upon her the importance of wearing underwear.Chobits was good because it finds itself in every position to degenerate into a raunchy ecchi fest—after all, we’re dealing with a 19 year old male and his beautiful, innocent, eager to please computer—but it never does.Given our magical girlfriend and harem genres, we should expect to get the typical character tropes we’re used to seeing: (a) totally average, sexually aroused teenage guy at the harem’s center, (b) innocent, eager to please beautiful girl who is in love with the average guy for seemingly no good reason, and (c) other varied members of the harem, some sweet, some feisty, but all hot and all pining after character (a) also for seemingly no good reason.What CLAMP does is smartly adjust these tropes to make it legitimately work in the story they tell, and not simply pandering for the sake of entertainment. Is Hideki a pervert? Of course he is; he’s a 19 year old male. But at heart, Hideki is really an old fashioned, good guy. Yeah he enters a conversation with any female who will engage him, thinking ’good things’ will come by the end of it, but then he usually finds himself in the position of the guy who sits there listening to her feelings, sincerely offering advice, and talking through the problem. Hideki is also in a perfect position to take advantage of Chii. He is after all her master, and she doesn’t have the human sense or even conventional persocom sense to know any better. The difference is, Hideki ultimately views Chii as a person, not a machine, and no matter how hot and bothered she makes him, he could never bring himself to treat a someone he views as a woman that way.Hideki’s ‘harem’ is similarly adjusted. While he may be lusting after them, his landlady, his cram school professor, and his cute coworker all lead their own lives and have their own set of problems to be dealing with, instead of blindly lusting after a guy just because he happens to be the protagonist. The three of them also actually serve purpose; they all directly tie into the plot and persocoms in some way and contribute to the overall discussion Chobits engages in.And then we have Chii, the innocent girl ready to do whatever Hideki asks of her. But here, it actually makes sense. There’s a reason for Chii to be this sweet and naive; she’s a robot, and one who’s memories were completely wiped from her hard drive. Upon waking up again, Hideki is the only person she has; why wouldn’t Chii like Hideki? He’s kind to her. He takes the time to find her a job and buy her books, when he really should be studying. She should want to reciprocate his kindness. And he other thing that makes us invested in her, is that we, like Hideki, are left to wonder what makes Chii different from other persocoms; who she really is, what she was like before Hideki found her, and why she was abandoned on the side of the street.So characters established, in the first two thirds, among all the cutness and the antics, there’s foreshadowing of an odd sense of foreboding about Chii, and not even she knows what it is or what it means.But it’s the shift in focus for the last third of the series that really made it stand out. Throughout, Hideki has attempted to fall in love with all of the members of his ‘harem’. However, at the end of the day, Hideki always finds himself happiest and most comfortable when he’s with Chii.  But how can he in good confidence fall in love with a cold yet captivating machine?The anime explores the relationship between the persocoms and human beings, and then uses this to explore relationships in general. The issues they cover are complex as these humanoid supercomputers have become fully integrated into daily life. Whether we’re referring to persocoms or people, it gets into themes of perfection, age and economic differences in relationships, and societal norms and stigmas that force people both together and apart. What is it about human beings that separate them from these machines? Or can you program a person’s physical appearance and personality traits into a computer, and synthesize a replacement?I’ve read before that CLAMP are notorious for exploring and manipulating the concept of love from all angles; Chobits does just that.Are these computers are really capable of emotion, or are their owners are just projecting onto their already human like forms—and even if they are, who’s to say it isn’t okay? A lot of stories try to convey the message of true love having no boundaries, but Chobits pushes the idea in a different way that is still translatable to the world we live in now. Decades ago, interracial relationships were considered blasphemous and marriage between different ‘racial’ groups was illegal; today, gender and sexuality identity is under the same debate. Who’s to say that decades from now, the notion of love between humans and humanoid robots won’t parallel these same issues we see today?Overall, there’s good reason to strongly recommend this series. It’s really done a lot to class up our typical magical girl harem style fanfare. Chobits is a great classic because it got us to really think about a simple love story between a hormonally stressed out boy and his computer. actually translates from manga to anime pretty seamlessly—something that sometimes works well, like in Rayearth, and sometimes horribly fails, like in xxxHolic.

They cut so much out and yet seemed to add things to it that were not in the original manga. In that way, it loses a lot of the meaning behind it. The story line isn’t really all that new, something we have seen a lot in media where humanoid robots take over the world, being built to be peoples slaves and sometimes sexually created. Then suddenly one goes crazy.It’s not only in the anime but the manga as well that Chi’s restart and turn on button is...her… privet place. It makes it rather creepy and pretty perverted. This whole show has a lot of fan service that isn’t in the manga which just makes things even worse. Another strange thing that happened to the anime is that the numbers got a bit odd when they brought it over. It happened from the 9th episode up. You see, the 9th episode was supposed to be actually a half episode called 8.5 instead. It was a recap…and the same goes for episode 20 which was supposed to be 18.5. Now I have to ask… why do we need this many recaps for a 26 episode series? I mean, we really aren’t that dumb and it does get really old. And even more bothersome is that there is actually a 27th (24.5) episode that was unaired and is only shown as on the DVD! You can guess what I’m going to say about that… its another bloody RECAP! Like we need one after the last show has aired! And because its on the DVD, it feels very stupid on their part because the person watching was probably marathon the show to begin with…The comical part is actually pretty funny and the only Romance I see is Hideki’s problems with women. It’s rather bothersome sometimes. He just seems really off a lot of the times and though they give him a good reason to be, it just makes him like every other character in a harem anime. It’s a bit annoying because he doesn’t seem to have his own characteristics.Unfortunately, the same goes for Chi and her strange personality. She’s like a little child who doesn’t know anything at all and a lot of times, it just feels really annoying. She just has no real emotions for most of the show and when she does show them, it’s rather sad or really happy. I would have at least liked to show her mad at one point.The art style is beautiful, no duh, it is clamp that first created it and the style matches the manga pretty damn well. Unfortunately, it also has its downsides with how flat the faces look and you don’t really see their noses well when they are looking right at you. The mouths are rather small and every once in a while, you will get a character that has a chibifide expression but otherwise, it’s rather plain. The women’s hair normally is what looks the most beautiful.The voices are alright, some work well and others in both the English and Japanese dub are not that good. Chi is really cute but her voice hurts my ears when I have to listen to her for long periods at a time like when she is walking down the street saying underpants. It’s funny, but ugg… my ears! her… privet place. It makes it rather creepy and pretty perverted. This whole show has a lot of fan service that isn’t in the manga which just makes things even worse.

I realize that it is possible to come of as a complete a- hole through writing so I'll try by best to write my sincere opinion on this anime without going on a rant. I really enjoyed the manga so I always assumed when I got to the anime I would more or less like it too.

The part of me that enjoyed the story wants to cut the show a little slack. My main problem is with the art. There is very little differentiation between the female characters. While it is true that all drawing from the same artist tend to look a like, after years of watching anime you can tell the difference between characters, the subtle differences in bone structure and body style, etc. All immersion into the story falls apart when other characters comment on issues of beauty since the girls really look the same the point is not driven across. Such comments are rare but since this is a conversation driven story, the interactions between characters are quite important. What really 'caused me to stop even trying to watch were the females eyes, they are unsettling. They are all empty and devoid of any emotion, This would work for the perso-coms (the computer people), but even the humans are afflicted by this. If you are able to look past this, then you can enjoy the show. The reason why this is such a deal breaker to me personally is because, when it comes to drawings the eyes are invaluable to perceiving the characters emotions, since you can't see the facial muscles. Overall if it weren't for the art direction I would recommend it, but as it stands... I stick with my previous opinion of skipping it. beings is complex and one of the last true adventures left, to imagine machines going through that territory is a theme I am quite interested in.

He moves to Tokyo just to study at cram school and serves as a preparation on the next university exams. As soon as the story goes on, he encounters unusual events, meeting new people and doing perverted acts. The period of time here can be compared as ours though all of us can access Internet and have invented new technology. In the case of the series they also have great technology that levels the intelligence as humans, they call it ‘persecoms’.The main attraction of the story would be...romance, comedy, drama and a little ecchi. The series also contains sci-fi that serves uniqueness to it. Thinking that a robot and a human can really develop affection to each other is quite a fantastic view to watch. Well it might be in some terms.The romance between them is quite good but it somewhat lacks depth that brings disappointment. They create a good plot but it still needs a lot more than that to be able to bring real romance. The comedy of characters is mediocre though to be able to see them as ignorant in some terms it became hilarious but in the end it’s being repetitive, it became boring and predictable. The drama is a good to see as the feelings and emotions of characters are shown enthusiastically to others. The ecchi, which adds a little funny moment to the story but it’s not that helpful enough to lift excitement.It’s a well-developed anime that lacks on something, which causes downfall effects on the whole series.[Art & Animation]Nothing is bad or great about the art and animation, just as simple as it is. The art is quite beautiful, the background, the scenery, and the people are in its simple way and the concept of different persecoms is quite good and attracting. The animation is executed well. The feelings and emotions are shown the way it was but the depth of it is just another question to it.[Sound]Maybe the best feature in this anime is the sounds. A very catchy tune will come up on every exciting and bizarre scene. A catchy melodic OP song that will hook you up and will push you on seeing the contents of it. Also the ED song gives a catchy tune that serves likely as a continuation of the OP song, surely a wonderful sounds to hear.[Character]Hideki is a pervert who likes hentai magazines, porn sites and thinking unthinkable thoughts. While Chii is a persecom who likes Hideki’s wants, Hideki’s stuff, and most of all Hideki. When you combine it, do you ever think that there will be chemistry between them?

Though we must remember that they are devoid of sentience and feelings...Or is emotion more subjective than that?Chobits is a rather cutesy, heart warming and delicate depiction of this fine grey line between brains and Motherboards. It\'s leisurely-paced (to say the least), and for the most part: a light-hearted slice of...life styledpresentation. This contrasts with the highly philosophical subject matter, which opens the gates to a multitude of hard-hitting emotional struggles. From love and loss, to divorce and death; Chobits is both the salt and the pepper... A balanced anime that subdues pain with a realistic, intimate, and uplifting stance. Some may call it 2-faced, or under powered, but I can appreciate the happy medium that Madhouse have established here.Chobits brings future technology to the familiar present. With a simple and vividly explained premise ofseemingly ordinary urban living; alongside an abundance of highly technologically advanced and life-likeAI personal assistants: personocoms. This remains as a constant throughout, and so the integration here of realism and fantasy technology is sure to keep viewers both engaged, and immersed in the world surrounding our protagonist. Though to reiterate, the slow pacing may deter some viewers...Bearing in mind that context and story are not where Chobits primarily invests its efforts, the anime stillupholds a decent plot. While starting out relatively predictable, the scope of the show is broadens significantly after just a few episodes. It shows us an early transformation from a slice of life rom-com, to a much more flavorsome and emotive drama/romance. The show is a rather curious cohesion between lighthearted SoL aspects, and even the integration of suspense, tragedy, and mystery too. There are therefore plenty of twists of fate stirred into an otherwise uneventful setting. Not to the extent that I would recommend such a show to SoL haters, but there\'s definitely more to Chobits than first meets the eye.This mix of genres is integrated and streamlined efficiently: lots of little story aspects come together duringthe generally episodic progression and make the show emanate conflicting messages...  Though the overriding tone and charming signature style is always retained of course. The story is so subtle and ""belonging"" in the context, that it\'s easy to underestimate how substantial it really is, or forget that there is actually an event-based progression AS WELL as a character-based progression. Not to hot, nor too cold, viewers can expect to go from carefree to suspenseful in a heartbeat, and so you could say that there\'s a certain degree of unpredictability always looming about to keep things fresh: very important alongside such a leisurely progression rate.Filling the screen with vibrant colours, as well as eye-catching nightscapes... Chobits brandishes a particularlyemotive and detailed set of visuals. As an older anime, don\'t expect crystal clear quality; but the artistic intent behind the show is quite prominent.

The soundtrack is upbeat particularly during the first few episodes, and evolves into a varied score that adds more atmosphere and passion particularly to more emotional scenes. Even during the highs, there\'s a very noticeable and fitting sense of fragility and mystery within the audiovisuals: some foreshadowing and abstract presentation methods too at times to invoke the viewer\'s curiosity...

But that\'s what you\'ll come to love her for. On the topic of personal connections, it\'s this very understandable attachment that makes the viewer genuinely care for and want to protect the untainted purity and light that is Chii; from the darkness and corruption of the surrounding world.Hideki\'s typical protagonist build to serve as a blank slate POV was appropriate during the first-person stages, though at times he was also viewed as a personality: obviously a very uninspired one; devoid of anything unique. And so at times the blandness of both Hideki and Shinbo: with a similarly substance-less build, was a bit of a hindrance.In spite of the emotional and slice of life styling, Chobits operates in an ""immediate scope"", so character besides Chii herself weren\'t that comprehensive.

"", 'Y I K E S.Before I go further into detail, let me just say that I enjoy a good romance. Romance frequently happens to overlap with the magical girl genre, which I also happen to enjoy and it was through consuming Cardcaptor Sakura, another CLAMP property, that I was able to find out about Chobits. I won\'t go into the problems I had with Cardcaptor Sakura here since I already wrote a review on the matter, but Chobits turns all of the issues I already had with Cardcaptor Sakura up to eleven.Let\'s start with the fact that Chii is presented as the titular persocom, a...Chobit. Because she isn\'t actually human, it\'s difficult to make the case for her having a character whatsoever. A computer does what a computer is told to do. End of. And to be honest, the writers may have actually benefited from subscribing to the notion (see: episode 24), but they tried to shoehorn a character into Chii anyway, so let\'s start with that.Chii is presented as not being like other persocoms so she is effectively The Chosen One. She has a learning AI, so when Hideki gets her and turns her on (by molesting her), she gets to work learning to navigate the world in such a way that makes Hideki happy similar to how a puppy might. Cute, but also trite and boring.Here, we\'re introduced to our Chobit and already, her entire world revolves around this creepy man who doesn\'t stop fetishizing her.This would be all well and good, except that it\'s passed off as... funny and charming?Without going into too much detail, it\'s worth pointing out that the writers also rub friendly shoulders with incest both in the relationship between a young human boy and a robot he made to look and behave like his sister and a smarter Chii clone spirit thing who was obsessed with Chii losing her virginity and her papa.Uh, okay.If we weren\'t already getting problematic enough, let\'s glide back on over to Hideki. When he\'s not fetishizing Chii, he\'s fetishizing his coworker, fetishizing his teacher, screaming randomly in public, or playing the ""woe is me, I\'m so poor, feel bad"" card.And again, all of this is played up to be funny and charming.As our story carries on, not only do our main characters develop painfully little during the course of the show, but so does their relationship. Like what\'s the major difference between the first episode where Hideki touches Chii and the last episode? That she\'s awake? Much character development, wow.And all the while, we\'re supposed to be bonding with either Hideki or Chii, which means we\'re either bonding with a creep with no redeeming qualities or a computer who ultimately behaves like one despite their desperate attempt to give her a personality. (See: Something more than saying ""Chii"".)In reality, Chii is just a catalyst to other character stories which pan out to be more engaging than the main plot.So what does this all mean?Despite having a lovely art style, this show is much too problematic and mediocre for me to recommend to anyone, so here are my recommendations instead.Are you coming here from Cardcaptor Sakura, hoping against hope that Chobits will be better? Try Princess Tutu or Puella Magi Madoka Magica.Do you want a movie with a cute girl robot who learns things but isn\'t sexualized by creeps? Metropolis.Do you want a half-decent show with a harem romance? Fushigi Yuugi.And if you aren\'t ready to give up on CLAMP just yet, do you want to try another show where the main female lead loses her memory and isn\'t immediately groomed/molested by a creep afterward? Tsubasa. Chobit. Because she isn\'t actually human, it\'s difficult to make the case for her having a character whatsoever. A computer does what a computer is told to do. End of.

Tsubasa.', 'Robert\'s Too Late Reviews has been spotted once again! Today we\'re dealing with, as is my tradition, the dubbed version of this anime. For some reason Chobits seems to have been pretty divisive if review scores are any indication. Personally, the short of it for me is that the show was great, as it included more than just the sum of its parts, offering plot points that push us to consider just how love is defined, and who, or in this case, what, is appropriate to be the recipient of our affections. This exploration is covered through several different, and conflicting, viewpoints, giving the viewer,...I believe, a chance to decide for themselves what they truly think of such a situation. Also, as always, check the synopsis available, as I am writing with the assumption you\'ve read it. So let\'s boot this thing up and run a search!Story: 9Okay the VERY first thing we have to discuss, as it will be a dealbreaker for some of you guys, is Chii and her voice. In the dub she has a very young sounding voice, and speaks in a very simplistic way, to facilitate the fact that she\'s new to everything, and hasn\'t mastered the nuance of speech yet. The problem lies in that with everything the main character teaches her, everything that mystifies her, everything, well just about everything, inspires Chii to respond by saying ""Chii"" over and over and over again. She literally says ""Chii"" likely upwards of a dozen times or more in most episodes. If that\'s the kind of cutesy thing that grates you, you likely will not be able to look past it to enjoy any of the rest of the show. I find the voice actress to be pretty spot on, she sounds young enough and innocent enough to fill the role well, and I think it\'s kind of cute how she repeats ""Chii"" over and over again. But I know some of you just cannot handle that kind of thing, so be fully aware this series is absolutely smothered in ""Chii""s.With that out of the way, let\'s talk about the meat of the subject. The storyline is reminiscent of another show that deals with human/machine interactions, that being Plastic Memories. The basics are the same, humans and androids/robots/walking computers dealing with the idea of romantic involvement. However Chobits takes the theme much farther, as it attempts to address the issues Plastic Memories glosses over. Chobits asks us if such relationships should exist at all, and presents arguments from both sides in regards to this.We have supporting characters that come from a stance that Persocom love is to be vilified as it has caused them great emotional pain. Conversely there are supporting characters that come from the view that love is love, no matter who or what is involved. There\'s even plot points built around the idea of using a Persocom to replace a love one that has been lost, and whether or not that\'s healthy. So we\'re given several different views on the thought of Persocom romance, and whichever one you agree with, there are characters to relate to.I get the feeling that there\'s a point being made, specifically by the characters that are \'anti\' Persocom-human relationships, specifically that they mention that those relationships would cause a disconnect between humans. This to me seems to be a subtext regarding the serious low birthrate issue Japanese society is facing. Persocoms are clearly unable to reproduce, and even if they could, the offspring would not be completely human. This point seems to bring to mind the deep concern they are facing regarding this issue in their lives.Perhaps I\'m reading far too deep into the story, but there\'s also, in my mind, an undercurrent in the storyline dealing with racism. Let me explain. For those characters that support Persocom/human relationships, there seems to be a bit of a societal taboo associated with said pairing. Persocoms are \'different\' from humans, as some have believed (and sadly some that still do) that there are differences between races. Speaking from my own personal experience with racism related to romance, I have felt firsthand how this bias exists. For well over a decade I was in a long term relationship with a Hispanic woman (I\'m your run-of-the-mill white guy). There were many situations, both with my family and with even hers as well where we were treated in a manner that only thinly veiled contempt from both sides over the fact we were different yet still together. Chobits seems to exchange \'race\' for \'robot\' but the stigma seems to remain, and is an issue that even the main character has to confront as he sorts out his feelings.Most of the show is built around slice of life stylings, as the main character teaches Chii about the world around her through experience. He teaches her about social interactions, about what it means to have a job, about how to live a life in the pursuit of happiness. In the end that\'s all he really wants, is to bring Chii happiness. As the series concludes, it spins a bit into more dramatic territory as people close to the main character finally show that they are heavily invested in Chii\'s existence and her capabilities. All this is accompanied by the heavy foreshadowing that Chii is both incredibly powerful, and capable of independent thought and feelings, something that is only supposed to exist in the ultra secretive Chobits models of Persocoms.This brings us to the resolution, which is somewhat predictable, yet is wholly satisfying as well. It is well worth the price of admission to experience the contentment that the characters feel. Even the side characters are given resolutions that firstly fit their motivations, and secondly helps them grow as people. There is a little bit of stumbling in the plot as a pair of Persocoms appear to \'take care\' of Chii\'s final situation. When Chii does the thing they are trying to prevent, the outcome to the particular action didn\'t seem as clear to me as it could have been. Otherwise the ending is well paced, full of surprises, and entertaining.Art: 8The show looks good, though I wish it was a bit more detailed. The Persocoms have solid colored\' eyes, with no irises and such, but that makes sense from the technical perspective that they are machines. Yet the humans portrayed also have this same look to their eyes. If a bit more detail had gone into drawing the human eyes, I think the contrast would have helped the world building in regards to Persocoms being a different \'creature\' than humans. The art seem to be clean and on the simpler side, but in no means is ugly. There\'s a lot of softer colors in the backgrounds and such which fits the overall theme of the show very well, we are dealing with primarily relationships, romance, and love in general. I was satisfied by the art, just would have appreciated a bit more detail.Sound: 8There\'s a sticking point for me in the sound section here. For pretty much the entire run of the series, Chii almost always refers to herself by name, and does not use the pronoun \'I\'. For the most part she tends to use everyone\'s name instead of words like \'you\', \'they\', \'she\', etc. Yet there is an episode in the earlier going, before the halfway mark, where I believe it is twice she says ""I heard that sound again"". Made my head nearly explode because she does not do this for the rest of the show. Now there is a small chance that the story affected her speech pattern, but if so, its a plot point not revealed until the second to last episode. I think it was actually a writing flub that no one caught. Chii does not call Chii \'I\'. Chii\'s name is Chii. That\'s basically how things are. So this once or twice that she uses \'I\' drove me nuts.Otherwise we\'re good. The opening theme is just adorable, fits the feeling of the show just right. The ending is serviceable too, though not as memorable as the opening. Chii\'s voice actress, as I said in the story section, is innocent and young enough sounding to serve Chii\'s character quite well. The main character sounds like a dolt sometimes, but in a convincing way that doesn\'t seem like he\'s bored with his part. The supporting characters all match well too. There\'s only one other exception that stands out, the main character\'s best friend\'s Persocom, a small mobile model named Sumomo. She has a pretty high pitched voice and is constantly hollering at pretty high volumes in her cutesy manner. ""Time to do wakey wakey exercises!"" and the like is her favorite bits. She\'s almost annoyingly bouncy and silly. But, in my mind, not enough to be a deal breaker.There\'s also interesting sound effects, especially with the Persocoms themselves. When they go to access information, you can actually hear the hard drives inside of them grinding. If you\'ve been around computers a while odds are you remember when the older hard drives were noisy as they accessed data. It\'s a grind-y sound that is scorched into my memory just as the dialup \'handshake\' beeps and whistles. The sound effect reinforces the nature of the Persocoms nicely.Character: 9The main character is portrayed as a bit of a loser, having failed college entrance exams twice, and he knows pretty much nothing at all about Persocoms whatsoever. He\'s kind and willing to help Chii through learning by experience, and has all the patience such teaching requires. He\'s also polite and courteous to the manager of his apartment building, and is all around a nice guy. He is even integral in several of the supporting cast member\'s resolutions and decisions regarding their own views of Persocoms. He\'s not dumb as much as he\'s just clueless, but he\'s a good guy at heart, devoted to Chii and willing to help anyone that needs it. Refreshing for a main character to be a stand up guy even when he\'s not sure how to do it.Chii is absolutely adorable, as long as you can handle her constant \'Chii\' remarks. She\'s played off with a level of innocence that is required for her character arc, and seems to have deep feelings for the main character, which is the crux of the story, since Persocoms are only meant to \'feel\' what they\'ve been programmed for. Chii, through the course of the series, gains a growing desire to meet the \'one that is the only one for Chii\' which drives her forward into many of the things she does. This includes her naivety getting her into dangerous and troublesome situations that the main character has to rescue her from. Chii\'s growth follows a line that matches up nicely with where she is for the ending, instead of having a jarring sudden change right before it rolls around. The clues to her ending is there most of the time, but nevertheless her arc is natural and fitting.The supporting characters are interesting, ranging from the main character\'s next door neighbor who quickly becomes his best friend, and helps him learn about the world of Persocoms and how he can help Chii. This friend is Sumomo\'s owner, and loans her for extended time periods to the main character. He\'s a good hearted guy, and when we learn about his overall place in the emotional side of things, he just gets to be even more respectable.There is also a rich kid who that is very interested in Chii, but only as pertaining to her apparent custom built origins. He also helps the main character out in dealing with Chii and the world of technology. He\'s presented as an unflappable genius level child (or very young man) that has an extraordinary talent when it comes to technology in general, not just Persocoms. He too has a wonderful arc, where he learns and grows in a satisfying manner.There is also the landlady that helps the main character understand Chii but is mysterious and seems to know more than she lets on. A cute as a button teen girl works with the main character but carries around a secret pain regarding Persocoms. Throw in with this Chii\'s boss at the job she works, the teacher of the prep school the main character and best friend attend and you get a nicely varied group, of which the views on Persocoms and relationships with them runs the gamut from disapproving to greatly accepting. While the cast might sound busy, they all come together in ways that isn\'t overwhelming or seems too rushed.Enjoyment: 9Chobits made me think about my position on what is right and wrong in the matters of the heart. Could I support someone that falls in love with a machine? Is it no difference than the difficulties interracial couples face even in modern life? Or is it something far deeper, something that as a species we should avoid completely? This kind of examination of my own beliefs brings me a good bit of enjoyment, and to see the answers the show provides is fitting in terms of what conclusion each character reaches. It\'s a sweet little show about love, and the heart wanting what it wants.Best Girl: no doubt here, gotta roll with Chii herself. She\'s just too cute, and I don\'t mind at all her repeating ""Chii"" over and over again. Her lack of experience in the world is endearing, as she learns about life around her. She often says things out of the blue that are funny as hell. One good line, she asks if the main character has energy, he says yes, and then sporting an apparent erection, Chii points to his crotch and asks if he has energy there, of course embarrassing the main character completely. Gotta love Chii.To wrap, I say watch this, as this is a bit of a social commentary on issues that are beginning to become relevant in our world. If technology progresses, and it surely will, to the point we all have robots surrounding us the idea of what is appropriate to feel towards them will become important. We\'re already exploring the concept with movies like \'Her\' and skirting the line on sexual if not romantic pairings between humans and machines with the emergent \'sexbots\' that we\'re seeing coming into play. At least enjoy a nice romantic anime with characters deeper than most, and remember: Chii? Chii! I believe, a chance to decide for themselves what they truly think of such a situation. Also, as always, check the synopsis available, as I am writing with the assumption you\'ve read it. So let\'s boot this thing up and run a search!Story: 9Okay the VERY first thing we have to discuss, as it will be a dealbreaker for some of you guys, is Chii and her voice. In the dub she has a very young sounding voice, and speaks in a very simplistic way, to facilitate the fact that she\'s new to everything, and hasn\'t mastered the nuance of speech yet. The problem lies in that with everything the main character teaches her, everything that mystifies her, everything, well just about everything, inspires Chii to respond by saying ""Chii"" over and over and over again. She literally says ""Chii"" likely upwards of a dozen times or more in most episodes. If that\'s the kind of cutesy thing that grates you, you likely will not be able to look past it to enjoy any of the rest of the show. I find the voice actress to be pretty spot on, she sounds young enough and innocent enough to fill the role well, and I think it\'s kind of cute how she repeats ""Chii"" over and over again. But I know some of you just cannot handle that kind of thing, so be fully aware this series is absolutely smothered in ""Chii""s.With that out of the way, let\'s talk about the meat of the subject. The storyline is reminiscent of another show that deals with human/machine interactions, that being Plastic Memories. The basics are the same, humans and androids/robots/walking computers dealing with the idea of romantic involvement. However Chobits takes the theme much farther, as it attempts to address the issues Plastic Memories glosses over. Chobits asks us if such relationships should exist at all, and presents arguments from both sides in regards to this.We have supporting characters that come from a stance that Persocom love is to be vilified as it has caused them great emotional pain. Conversely there are supporting characters that come from the view that love is love, no matter who or what is involved. There\'s even plot points built around the idea of using a Persocom to replace a love one that has been lost, and whether or not that\'s healthy. So we\'re given several different views on the thought of Persocom romance, and whichever one you agree with, there are characters to relate to.I get the feeling that there\'s a point being made, specifically by the characters that are \'anti\' Persocom-human relationships, specifically that they mention that those relationships would cause a disconnect between humans. This to me seems to be a subtext regarding the serious low birthrate issue Japanese society is facing. Persocoms are clearly unable to reproduce, and even if they could, the offspring would not be completely human. This point seems to bring to mind the deep concern they are facing regarding this issue in their lives.Perhaps I\'m reading far too deep into the story, but there\'s also, in my mind, an undercurrent in the storyline dealing with racism. Let me explain. For those characters that support Persocom/human relationships, there seems to be a bit of a societal taboo associated with said pairing. Persocoms are \'different\' from humans, as some have believed (and sadly some that still do) that there are differences between races. Speaking from my own personal experience with racism related to romance, I have felt firsthand how this bias exists. For well over a decade I was in a long term relationship with a Hispanic woman (I\'m your run-of-the-mill white guy). There were many situations, both with my family and with even hers as well where we were treated in a manner that only thinly veiled contempt from both sides over the fact we were different yet still together. Chobits seems to exchange \'race\' for \'robot\' but the stigma seems to remain, and is an issue that even the main character has to confront as he sorts out his feelings.Most of the show is built around slice of life stylings, as the main character teaches Chii about the world around her through experience. He teaches her about social interactions, about what it means to have a job, about how to live a life in the pursuit of happiness. In the end that\'s all he really wants, is to bring Chii happiness. As the series concludes, it spins a bit into more dramatic territory as people close to the main character finally show that they are heavily invested in Chii\'s existence and her capabilities. All this is accompanied by the heavy foreshadowing that Chii is both incredibly powerful, and capable of independent thought and feelings, something that is only supposed to exist in the ultra secretive Chobits models of Persocoms.This brings us to the resolution, which is somewhat predictable, yet is wholly satisfying as well. It is well worth the price of admission to experience the contentment that the characters feel. Even the side characters are given resolutions that firstly fit their motivations, and secondly helps them grow as people. There is a little bit of stumbling in the plot as a pair of Persocoms appear to \'take care\' of Chii\'s final situation. When Chii does the thing they are trying to prevent, the outcome to the particular action didn\'t seem as clear to me as it could have been. Otherwise the ending is well paced, full of surprises, and entertaining.Art: 8The show looks good, though I wish it was a bit more detailed. The Persocoms have solid colored\' eyes, with no irises and such, but that makes sense from the technical perspective that they are machines. Yet the humans portrayed also have this same look to their eyes. If a bit more detail had gone into drawing the human eyes, I think the contrast would have helped the world building in regards to Persocoms being a different \'creature\' than humans. The art seem to be clean and on the simpler side, but in no means is ugly. There\'s a lot of softer colors in the backgrounds and such which fits the overall theme of the show very well, we are dealing with primarily relationships, romance, and love in general. I was satisfied by the art, just would have appreciated a bit more detail.Sound: 8There\'s a sticking point for me in the sound section here.

It's been so many year's i've seen this anime for the first time. This was my 2nd anime i ever watched. And yeah since i decided to review every anime iv'e seen i should do this one also. So...here we go !StoryThe story is about a guy that ''find's''  a robot. That can't talk. The anime is really ecchi. But the plot is pretty interessting. While this story disturbing image's show up that the robot is hoocked up in some kind of dangerous place-ish lab. The owner want's to know what this all is. And what the origin of the robot is. In this story it's heavy pushed that he  think he like's girl's but turns always differnt then he hope's. So pretty harem but the different way.  In short. The plot is pretty good. But the ecchi part just made it less interessting. I felt like a pervy guy that watches robot ecchi stuff etc. But i'm sure there are allot people that don't mind this. It's pretty good. And the ending was also really well done. I give it a 7.Art.Oh man. when i looked this anime for the first i was amazed how good it look. Ofcourse now many anime's later i noticed that it's not as good as i remembered. But that's no problem. It's a pretty old anime. So i think it deserves atleast a clean 7.SoundThe ending theme was disturbing in my opinion. I understand it try's to be cute. But i wasn't a big fan of it. But as the other ost it's decent. Sometimes a bit goofy. but it's oke. A fair 6 for this.Characters.Yeah. It's actually pretty basic. The perverted guy. That's to shy to be perverted. And like's almost every girl he see's.

', ""When I was 14 years old, I really liked Chobits, granted I'd only seen the first 8 episodes of it. Now 20, I've decided to finish the series off, and it's the only thing that I've been so frustrated over I've felt the need to give a proper review.For the uninitiated, Chobits is what happens when you take the thematic idea behind 'I DATED A ROBOT' short from Futurama and spread it out over 26 episodes, mix in a little harem comedy and then sprinkle with broken sci-fi.It begins pleasantly enough - possibly because of lolrobots and naughty switches - as a fairly entertaining comedy....Hideki Motosuwa is a fairly likeable MC and played brilliantly by Tomokazu Sugita, trying to educate his newly found, mentally underdeveloped robot girl in a robot girl world. This may sound like an entirely cliched premise, and the more you watch of the series the more you realise IT IS, but for the first half it works well enough for you not to notice that you're being entertained by the same masturbation joke time and time again.Where Chobits falls flat is in its attempt at developing the characters and story (in particular, Sumomo's evolution from cheery chibi to insufferable retard). There are too many wall bangers to list in a review without giving away some crucial spoilers, but I can safely say that inconclusive is the best word to describe the series as a whole. Many characters don't even seem to have a viable function, and others by their actions seem to completely contradict any backstory they've been given.However, if you can discard the disjointed ending (I couldn't), there's some fun to be had and some genuinely enjoyable comedy/romance to be sifted out from under the rubble.And plenty of fanservice, if you're into that sort of thing, you sick pervert.

That’s right, at the cusp of my teenagehood, I was introduced to Chobits, a series about basically a boy and his robot. I can still remember how I was introduced to it. It was after watching Cardcaptor Sakura being rebroadcast on TV that I wondered if there were other interesting anime out there that I was unaware of. Through the power of the internet, I figured out about Chobits!Chobits opens with Chii being found in the trash. Chii is a persocom, something of a robot who looks human...and can do all the things a computer does. The one thing special about Chii is that she has been programmed to love. As we find out through the series, it wasn’t because Chii was deemed useless, but because there were other circumstances tearing her away from her original creators despite their deep love for her. The exploration of whether a robot can be sentient and eventually develop feelings for humans and whether it’s creepy or whether a human can reciprocate those feelings is central to the manga.All these exploration of emotions are done in the backdrop, as Chii learn to integrate into human life under the tutelage of Hideki, the main protagonist student who can’t afford a real persocom and felt super lucky at picking Chii up. Chii eventually makes a lot of friends, gets a job and then falls in love with Hideki just like he has for her.What CLAMP, the manga creators, excel at, is artwork and side characters, in my opinion. Their artwork is intricate with a Shoujo asthetic, and yet for this anime you can see the action shots and comedic facial expressions bleeding through to cater to the Seinen demographic. For me, this was the first story I had read which had such a science fiction theme, where robots could think and love just like humans. This anime  ignited a love for science fiction in me which caused me to devour other science fiction books, you might read/watch this and think “What a load of crap. What’s all this airy human and robots falling in love stuff? There’s no science at all. There’s no logic.” But to me that was one of the anime's strengths as well. I’m sure that if the manga had gone into hardcore explanations of neurotransmitters my brain wouldn’t have been able to handle it.Instead, we have a compelling story with an over arcing plot, with side characters that support the narrative question: Can robots love?The only weak side of the story is… the fucking ending. That ending that starts in chapter 87 and makes me want to bash my head on a wall, It left me with a really unsatisfied feeling I was when I first read it, even though I couldn’t really explain why until now. Everything else about the story, from the premise, to the plot, to the art, to the detailed side characters was perfect. ALL PERFECT. And then the ending… and can do all the things a computer does. The one thing special about Chii is that she has been programmed to love. As we find out through the series, it wasn’t because Chii was deemed useless, but because there were other circumstances tearing her away from her original creators despite their deep love for her. The exploration of whether a robot can be sentient and eventually develop feelings for humans and whether it’s creepy or whether a human can reciprocate those feelings is central to the manga.All these exploration of emotions are done in the backdrop, as Chii learn to integrate into human life under the tutelage of Hideki, the main protagonist student who can’t afford a real persocom and felt super lucky at picking Chii up. Chii eventually makes a lot of friends, gets a job and then falls in love with Hideki just like he has for her.What CLAMP, the manga creators, excel at, is artwork and side characters, in my opinion. Their artwork is intricate with a Shoujo asthetic, and yet for this anime you can see the action shots and comedic facial expressions bleeding through to cater to the Seinen demographic.

I will focus my review mainly on the anime because I haven't read the manga yet.Story: A typical anime wherein there is an unlucky and poor guy named Hideki who dreams about entering a school having a normal life. The story somewhat became twisted when he accidentally found a persocom (he later named Chii) in the lying the trash. The story evolves around Hideki teaching Chii the way of living in an everyday life with a major touch of comedy on its special ways because Chii does...not have any idea of her actions. The romance of the story can be strongly felt starting from later episodes as Hideki and Chii develops a bond with each other.Art: The animation was quite good but for me somewhat it looks a little bit dated mainly because of the date it was made and aired, but the story and characters makes Chobits an anime that must be watched.Sound: The opening song is what really makes me to be filled with joy before watching the actual anime because of its child-like melody and cuteness. The sound played well during certain scenes and were fluidly played with the characters' emotions and actions.Enjoyment: The comedy, romance and drama throughout the story is unique that made this a great anime to be watched and enjoyed by many anime lovers.Overall: This anime is so great that I can recommend it everyone who loves comedy and with a touch of a appropriate romance and drama. Having many episodes, some episodes might not entertain others while most the it are enjoyable that it will surely keep you entertained and ending up watching the whole anime. not have any idea of her actions.

It definitely surpasses them all!I'm not a real fan of ecchi but despite it popping up a bit, the plot, the romance, the desperate wanting to know what will happen next, it all kept me on Chobits. I loved and thoroughly enjoyed watching this series, after all, it does have two of my main genres in anime....Comedy and Romance. I also liked the slight mystery in it too.I'm sorry if this review isn't helpful(it is my first) but I have watched Chobits to the end and I highly recommend. Comedy and Romance. I also liked the slight mystery in it too.I'm sorry if this review isn't helpful(it is my first) but I have watched Chobits to the end and I highly recommend."", 'Chobits is a pretty great anime but it starts out as a regular and normal anime. Something that should be noted though is that this anime is a seinen. The romance on this anime sometimes borders on shoujo.  You have this boy from a farm that goes to Tokyo I order to attend cram school.  He wants to pass his entrance exams so that he can go to college.  On his first day he finds a persocom ling in the trash. Pesocoms are computers made out to look like people but they just look like people. He decides to name her chi...and he later finds out that chi has been formatted and because of this she has lost her memories. From this point on a special bond starts to develop between Hideki and Chi.I gave this story an 8/10. This is because the story starts out without much of a plot. The idea of chi being a Chobits is implanted in the view but it’s not explained for a while. The first 8 episodes or so are about chi learning about the world. But later on in the story the plot gets really good. You have several stories developing at the same time.  You have Shinbo and Kokubunji dealing with their own lives and problems while Hideki tries to figure his feeling for Chi. The story also gives us a chance to see what would happen on persocom/human relationships. How we could react both in a positive and negative way. This was well portrayed on the books chi read called “A town with no people.”I gave art an 8/10. The art itself was nothing really special. The main difference from other anime is the eye style. Unlike most mangas and anime the eyes are drawn different but it goes really well with everything else. This includes the story.I gave the sound a 7/ 10.  Again nothing special. The sound really fit in with the whole anime. I especially love the intro to the anime.The characters get a 9/10. The main character Hideki himself is an ordinary guy. He is a nice guy who has an active imagination and because for this has no girlfriend (his friend point out this fact a lot). The rest of the cast is also pretty interesting. Whether is Yumi with her dislike of persocoms or Kokubunji with his infatuation of persocoms. All the characters pull together a great story.  The author did a good use of his characters to get his point across which is human/persocom relations.Enjoyment was an 8.  Whether it’s in the beginning when you get to see Chi doing ecchi things or the romance later on between the many characters.Overall I think this story was great. During no point while I was watching did I think this is a waste of time.  This should be a must for the romance reader who wants a change from the usual boy girl relationships and he later finds out that chi has been formatted and because of this she has lost her memories.

"", 'Classic Underrated Anime!Chobits story is kinda weird. The MC leaves in a rural area and goes to the city to study and prepare for the college entrance exam. Every people living in the City have their own robot called ""persocoms"" to assist them in their daily life. There are 2 types of Persocoms: the mobile type and the human type, and they are very expensive. Since the MC only lives in a rural area, he can\'t afford to buy an expensive robot. Luckily while he was walking home from the convenience store, he found a female human-type ""persocoms"" in the trash. The ""persocoms"" name is...""Chi-chan"" named by MC.

Although the story seems like a typical ecchi anime mainly being the fact that Chii has her on switch on her privates and an entire episode dedicated to PANTSU, it\'s more than meets the eye.The anime focuses entirely on the relationship between Hideki and Chii with the emphasis on...the question if Hideki can really love a machine like Chii, or can a special persocom like Chii discover love and become one step closer to being a human. The majority of the cast is there to share their own experience with how they\'ve dealt with those questions.Throughout the story, the character development is directed heavily to Chii as she begins to learn about the world through Hideki\'s guidance, her social interactions with the cast and mainly from the picture book ""The City with No People"". As her character slowly develops from a child to a young woman, the plot begins to move on to answer the questions presented above.The characters are all lovable and some are quite sad. The supporting cast, all suffered emotional damage due to their pasts with their relationship to persocoms, serve as pioneers to show what might happen if Hideki begins to love Chii.The social interactions between all the characters makes this show very enjoyable to me. To this day, I still have the Chobits opening song on my playlist and always makes me remember how great this anime is. The character designs are wonderful and stay true to the original designs by CLAMP.Overall, this is a must watch for those who have not seen it by now which is very surprising for any veteran anime enthusiasts. The only problem that keeps me from giving it a perfect 10 has to be the involvement of the duo of government persocoms that were there to make it feel like a battle anime which it is not. Other than that, this will be one of my all-time favorites so if you didn\'t watch it, I definitely recommend you to watch this ASAP. the question if Hideki can really love a machine like Chii, or can a special persocom like Chii discover love and become one step closer to being a human.

Robots are robots, they do what they programmed. But what if they were capable of emotion and love upon their own free will? Would the world accept them as people or still regard them as automatons?The story of chobits is one of an ever expanding but god awfully slow, romance. Even with 26 episodes, 2 of which being recaps, it takes forever get anywhere and when something does happen it ends far too quickly to make up for it. In the beginning it just focuses on the life of the main character but as it goes on, you learn and...it expands on the relation and feelings of the people closest to the protagonist which in the end revolt back to the main two characters and their relationship.Art is despite its older release, is something ahead of its time. A style seen still in anime made 5 and 8 years after it so it is certainly one of an interesting make. Shading and tones in the bulk of the scenery with cell shading shadows and neat glow effects during major points. However with this, it does have a few parts where the animation is lacking in its transition frames.Music is one thing other than the opening and ending themes, that is rarely in each episode. Its only used in either a quick change of mood or a highly emotional scene. Otherwise it remains absent throughout the bulk of the anime.Character is the biggest part of this anime as is expected with a romance. But its not just romantic character development of just two people. It eventually expands and shows secondary characters finding romance with the ones that love which comes back around and help the main characters relationship. I does make a habit of taking its sweet time to progress anywhere major though.Overall enjoyment was very half and half. As mentioned, it's slow to get anywhere, leaving large gaps of boredom. But it does many times add instances of spontaneous humor that grab your attention in-midst of the boredom and get you interested in it again. At least until the next string of boring events. It had light feels in one of the side characters relations and a little more towards the ending of the main story but nothing that really tugs at your heart which is a little disappointing considering all the lead up the anime does. it expands on the relation and feelings of the people closest to the protagonist which in the end revolt back to the main two characters and their relationship.Art is despite its older release, is something ahead of its time.

I see why so many people like this anime. It has a very good plot and even though you try your hardest, you can never predict whats next. That's what I like about this anime. There are so really cute characters and some strange ones but what gets me is the silly things the main character gets into. I recommend this for 12+. If your watching the English version, some times the voiceovers don't fit in with the original Japanese version but thats not such a big problem. If you...keep getting annoyed, watch it in Japanese with subtitles! Overall, I give this anime a 10/10 and recommend it to both gender and anyone who likes a good laugh.-Danfonii keep getting annoyed, watch it in Japanese with subtitles! Overall, I give this anime a 10/10 and recommend it to both gender and anyone who likes a good laugh.-Danfonii"", ""This is my first review i am writing for any anime, so please bear with me and correct me if i have done anything wrong.So first off, i have only seen 14 episodes out of the 26. I had really high hopes watching the trailer, and even listening to the opening song gave me such joy into considering watching the anime all the more. However, if you are a human being with decent morals and is very perspective on life, this anime is not the right choice for you. I gave this anime 3 strikes before i decided to drop the anime into my...very rare and empty DROPPED list.The anime with a troubled farmer boy who recently got rejected from college, and decides to go to a prep school to increase his chances of getting into college.It is also noted that he is a huge pervert who can't take his mind off porn or lustful thoughts every 5 minutes. When he first finds Chii (a persocom--> a human looking computer with multiple functions such as phone calling and web browsing), this is where the whole thing starts to get out of hand for me. ME not being a fan of ecchi, my biggest fear came true when Hideki(main character) activated Chii by touching her cooties. This was the first strike, but i found Chii adorable, mimicking and doing some very rediculous gestures of Hideki. So i gave this anime some more hope.Now, remember that prep school that hideki is attending to? Well it turns out that the his class is instructed by a smoking hot young female teacher. This chick was awesome at first, since i thought she had a sick vibe and personality and was fine. Not even gonna bother wiritng her name, since it disgusts me everytime i even think about her. Now Chobits seems like the anime where everything is lovey dovey and happy anime that you can watch without any stress. WRONG. As you continue watching, you will notice that every character has a dark past, which is alluded to when they are all dealing with something. Now back to the teacher, she one day acts different from her to usual happy self. She even takes it to the level where she is drinking and spending the night at HIdeki's place. Hideki best friend has been acting weirdly towards him as well, especially when Hideki mentioned that the teacher spent the night at his place, which his friend immediatly gave him a death stare and cold shoulder. It is then shown that his friend and the teacher are having a secret affair. This immediuatly pissed me off since the teacher is married and this goes against all my beliefs and morals. It made me uncomfortable watching the rest of the episode so that i just raged quit on the browser. You will find out the reason to why a troubled teacher would seek comfort from her student (WHICH IM NOT SAYING), but whether you agree with it or deem it reasonable enough to run and cheat is up to you. I didn't find the reason strong enough, but this is my opinion and everyone is raised and believes in different things, so i am not judging anyone opinion. This was the second strike, which i almost didn't want to continue watching, but since i like saying SUMOMO so much that i gave its last and final chance.Finally, i stopped watching the anime after episode 14, since it was getting to the student teacher relationship crap which i highly disagree and felt uncomfortable watching. So i decided to read the manga. Until i found out the the other girl i liked, also had a dark past. Turns out that this chick is 17years of age, and ends up with an old 39yr old man. Again, i don't agree with this and i immediatly gave Chobits its last strike regardless of Chii cuteness and what not. Im not even going to get into detail why and how this happened, for all i know this made me sick.Overall, this anime had such high potential with the design of the characters and how adorable it was. However, the morality and situational items are what screwed up the story for me. I really wanted to continue watching the anime for Chii and sumomo, but i really couldn't stand another minute of the anime. I technically watched up to episode 15, but i only watched the opening song, then i dropped anime for good :D. I would not recommend to those who have suffered a similar situation and can relate as it can be nostalgic and painful to bear with, or those with thick skulls and stuborn, since you would be thinking about why does this have to happen for a very long time. However, if you enjoy cuteness, ecchi, and funny crude humor, this anime is for you, as lopng as you don't take it too seriously. I enjoyed the humor, just not the story.Now to get into a deeper thought, if society has truely accepted robots into their daily lives, the big question is would we be able to tell the difference from reality and our desired fantasies. These persocoms are the main reason to MOST(not all) of the troubled women in this anime. If we are not able to control our fantasy urges, how are we able to classify ourselfs as regular human beings. A person who loves a persocom so much, that he denies the attention and love his wife yearns for, is considered a freak and should consider pschological help. This fears me all the more, because when that day comes, will i be able to control my urges? Priorities always comes first, and i hate to see women cry... regardless of the situation or trouble they go through. it pains me when i was watching how many women were hurt and went through BS so called solutions to patch things up.Anyway thanks to those for taking the time to read this review, i gave it 3 strikes and it struck out. You gotta be mentally and emotionally strong to watch something like this on a serious note lol. Something that i am not capable of. Til my next review!I didn't finish the anime, but i read the manga and read summary to the anime.. so don't argue that i don't know what i am talking about since i didn't finish (WATCHING) the anime. very rare and empty DROPPED list.The anime with a troubled farmer boy who recently got rejected from college, and decides to go to a prep school to increase his chances of getting into college.It is also noted that he is a huge pervert who can't take his mind off porn or lustful thoughts every 5 minutes.

Again, i don't agree with this and i immediatly gave Chobits its last strike regardless of Chii cuteness and what not. Im not even going to get into detail why and how this happened, for all i know this made me sick.Overall, this anime had such high potential with the design of the characters and how adorable it was. However, the morality and situational items are what screwed up the story for me. I really wanted to continue watching the anime for Chii and sumomo, but i really couldn't stand another minute of the anime. I technically watched up to episode 15, but i only watched the opening song, then i dropped anime for good :D. I would not recommend to those who have suffered a similar situation and can relate as it can be nostalgic and painful to bear with, or those with thick skulls and stuborn, since you would be thinking about why does this have to happen for a very long time. However, if you enjoy cuteness, ecchi, and funny crude humor, this anime is for you, as lopng as you don't take it too seriously. I enjoyed the humor, just not the story.Now to get into a deeper thought, if society has truely accepted robots into their daily lives, the big question is would we be able to tell the difference from reality and our desired fantasies. These persocoms are the main reason to MOST(not all) of the troubled women in this anime. If we are not able to control our fantasy urges, how are we able to classify ourselfs as regular human beings. A person who loves a persocom so much, that he denies the attention and love his wife yearns for, is considered a freak and should consider pschological help. This fears me all the more, because when that day comes, will i be able to control my urges? Priorities always comes first, and i hate to see women cry... regardless of the situation or trouble they go through. it pains me when i was watching how many women were hurt and went through BS so called solutions to patch things up.Anyway thanks to those for taking the time to read this review, i gave it 3 strikes and it struck out. You gotta be mentally and emotionally strong to watch something like this on a serious note lol. Something that i am not capable of. Til my next review!I didn't finish the anime, but i read the manga and read summary to the anime.. so don't argue that i don't know what i am talking about since i didn't finish (WATCHING) the anime."", ""Can a machine love? This delightfully charming yet also semi-thought provoking Anime is one of my favorites. Now, on to the analysis.Story: At the time, the idea of a sentient computer was not a big and new idea, but the computers themselves are what makes this series very interesting. Human in appearance and designed to hep with the day to day, it is not hard to believe that some people have found themselves in an emotional relationship with something that mimics a human so well. One that can love back is quiet the other story. Chi is the embodiment of true innocence and knows little...to nothing when found. Her journey to learn to love is lead with Hideki, the protagonist. Her mishaps and the situations caused by Chi's lack of human knowledge is the most adorable thing ever. It also tackles different loves that are affected by the new relationships.Art: I found the style of art and animations fit through and throughSound: Its Happy and uplifting songs help the situations feel brighter and more emotional, and the contrasting darker and more dreadful helps add to the suspense.  It does get a little repetitive, but not overly so.Character: The character desing was one of my favorite things about Chobits. All but one character had a great deal of growth or helps for the growth very well, leading to true relationships between the characters as well as to the viewers.This is one to go back and enjoy in one sitting, with tissue and popcorn in hand.

Enjoy"", 'I would never presume to write a review that one could consider to be a calumny of the Chobits brand, but I will admit this review will not be glowing.Chobits follows the life of Hideki Motosuwa after he chances upon a discarded and beautiful amnesiac of a persecom (human computer, person computer, persecom? Incorrect spelling likely: urge to google = 0) in the trash one unlikely day. He dubs her Chi, as that\'s the only word she can say, and the pair embark on a slough of high jinks and hilarity, har har hoo ha.Now, you may initially view this as a perfect set...up for an intelligent deconstruction of typical human romance stories along with a creative sci-fi story based in a world rich with lore. What you\'re going to get in place of that is your nearly standard rom-com slice of life anime wherein a naive girl and a bumbling idiot fall in love in the first episode but dance around each other in a will-they-won\'t-they tease routine for all the lonely souls out there to enjoy and cuddle over.Please don\'t misunderstand: the show has great potential! Especially during the segments when viewers are actually treated to a little of the reasoning behind all the mysterious and spooky techno-bull that\'s going on. Unfortunately, most of the real plot is literally brushed aside 90% of the time with a ""Oh well, let\'s chase that shiny over there, tee hee"" from the oblivious and obtuse main characters. Why explain the purpose when you can watch this little pink thing spin in circles and squeak? Trick question - always watch the pink thing.Most of the slice of life gravy that the directors poured all over their teaspoon of potato is meant to elucidate the main conflict. This creates a problem, as we end up with a show that\'s attempting to be two clashing genres at once instead of a graceful meld. The reasoning behind the sci-fi ends up being lame because it was set up by the rom-com aspect, and vice versa. Chobits tries to grapple with the definition of humanity while forcing its main characters to hunt for underpants in an oh-so-entertaining 22 minute shenanigan filled episode.There were times when I enjoyed this show, and there were many more times where I slapped myself on the forehead solely because I enjoyed it. I also slapped myself from cringing too much. Most of the show\'s charm is eclipsed by its unsuccessful attempt to be two things at once instead of its own thing. However, if you enjoy most Romantic Comedies that you watch, you\'ll probably find this one is worth checking out. up for an intelligent deconstruction of typical human romance stories along with a creative sci-fi story based in a world rich with lore.

It's like this, the main character finds friends who he seem normal and innocent but the truth is... they connect to other people. In short, the story is exciting but the ending well.. i would say for me is a little predictable. The art is kinda...good, It kind of reminds me of Hunter X Hunter cause the art is alike. I like how they make the characters cute, charming and funny. It made me believe that even though the anime was created a long time ago it still remains its creative artworks and drawings. Especially the eyes they are very charming and tantalizing. The music and sound effects suits the anime very well. It's funny how great the characters show their emotions so well despite the fact that they're not REAL. Nevertheless they make people cry, laugh, smile, suspense, and red cheeks whenever the scene is getting hot. The percentage of enjoyment when watching this is 80%. They lack the mysteries, the awesomeness, and the worst part is.. there are no awesome fights. It's just not for grownups.. well some of it.. but the truth is they need to make interesting scenes. Like I said the ending is way predictable but for some reasons i still enjoyed the comedy/funny moments and the cuteness of Chii (one of the characters in Chobits).

Had to get that off my chest, seriously what was up with the first 2 episodes, can someone give me a count on the number of times they said porn.now to get down to the review. i believe many people would like to start off with something that seems insightful by bringing up the shows obvious theme of is it possible to love a machine. to be straightforward i say no, first off we're not going to be comming up with persocoms for a while now, the best A.I...we can give a robot is the mental capacity of an insect, and granted there will be future people that will want to be with their android companion but still most of these relations will be based off of lust, you can't replace a human with a robot, if you say you can than based on your logic you should also be able to fall in love with an animal, woof. To relate the anime to the real world i like to point out the growing number of addicts to games, electronics, and computers, people will have absolutely no relationships with real people because they prefer life behind their screens, while it is fun, you need to get out of the 21st century and embrace nature and cherish human contact every so often. The one just for you is a human being.the first 13 episodes are all fillers with no important information, they'll wear you down and make you beg for them to get to the main theme already but sadly they finish the season with only introductions. next we are introduced to some drama which brings in the shows main theme and does a good job at making you question it. we see someone who has loved a persocom, someone who's been pushed out by a persocom, and someone that fears persocoms and how perfect they seem. you get opinions from both sides but what it really comes down to is what hideki decides.the show isn't without it's flaws, it's a little too pervy in the beginning, some things don't make sense, and some are just wrong. They never explain why chi was thrown away. Why was sumomo still with hideki even after shinbo came back, we know takako doesn't have a problem with her since shinbo was able to watch her later on. Chi was designed by a man to be him and his wife's daughters yet he put the activation switches where class? That's right, in the...special area. Like all shows it's gonna have some loose ends but most of these could've been fixed if they weren't such pervs.art and sound were standard, the theme song was pretty catchy and i liked it, also some of the music that played during the show was good too. other than that i can't point much else out.most of the characters were average but some stood out. shinbo was pretty interesting, he was always upbeat and joking around, he was the levelheaded one when things went wrong, yet we still get to see the more sensative and insightful side which is hard to find from a main character's friend in an anime because most of them are either pervs or show up for 2 episodes. hideki was also a little different, while he was a perv, and a lot of stereotypical things happen to him, there was something slightly different about him than your typical lead. the most interesting to watch was chi, we slowly get to watch how someone who doesn't understand emotion slowly builds a knowledge of them and discovers the vast range of them. like i said before, one shouldn't be able to fall in love with a robot, but this is fiction and chi was a robot that was basically a human with memory loss in the show and doesn't portray what one would find in reality if we had the tech to create persocoms.overall it was a good anime with some regular holes. it does try to make you think which is good. it does fall victim to some ecchi moments which i find embarassing as a guy because it's like the writters think i can be won over with some cheap moments that are boring, overused, and only take away from the show and i'm supposed to like it because they show some extra cleavage. the last thing i'd like to point out is the books that chi would buy were a nice touch, they add a little extra to it, but they get confusing but if you enjoy them i'd suggest clannad because they have an amazing sidestory even though they end up screwing it up in the end.Until my next review, bye we can give a robot is the mental capacity of an insect, and granted there will be future people that will want to be with their android companion but still most of these relations will be based off of lust, you can't replace a human with a robot, if you say you can than based on your logic you should also be able to fall in love with an animal, woof.

I used to defend Naruto to the death, and go on about how it was the greatest anime of all time, and nothing could ever come close to it.That was -until 2009, when i heard about an anime that i had known very little of, and had never seen before; that anime was called Chobits.When i heard about it, it somehow managed to catch my attention, and became curious in checking it out.Right...from the opening, the song ""Let me be with you"" managed to grab me in; making me want to continue watching.This all leads to my review...Review:The story of Chobits stars Hideki Motosuwa; who -after being rejected from getting into college- decides to move to Toyko to attend a Prep School.While in Tokyo, he checks out these highly advanced machines called Persocoms; which are -to put it simply- computers who look, talk, and even move like Humans. Unfortunately, Persocoms are expensive, and Hideki isn\'t able to afford one.However, as he is walking home from a convenience store, one night, he discovers a blonde-haired female Persocom in the trash. He decides to take it home; where he not only activates her, but also names her Chii, due to being the only thing she could say (at the time, at least).I found the story elements of Chobits to not only be engaging; but also managed to strike my fancy- i.e. with it\'s Science Fiction element; questioning relationships between humans, and human-like machines.The story introduces questions like:- Can a Human fall in love with a Persocom?- Can a Persocom fall in love with a Human?- Can a Human be in love with a Persocom, instead of another Human?- Can a Human ever love again, after the person they loved abandoned them for a Persocom?- What will it be like if everybody fell in love with Persocoms?- How deep can a person\'s love for a Persocom be?This is probably the first anime I\'ve watched, that not only made me think; but managed to grab me on an emotional level.I\'m not going to go to deep into that; but let\'s just say that Chii was a deeper character than i thought she was when they first introduced her; as her dilemma throughout the story, was one that i could relate to on a personal level.HOWEVER. That isn\'t to say that Chobits doesn\'t have it\'s own share of humor; in fact, it has a lot of it.Although Chobits\' humor mainly revolves around sexual innuendo, it isn\'t too overdone, and can actually be quite funny.I love how shy and embarrassed Hideki can get; whether it\'s him being nervous when seeing a woman half-clothed (or naked), or gets embarrassed when he makes a scene for himself. In the end, though; he\'s just trying to be a cool guy.The characters are -Overall- probably the most memorable part of Chobits. Aside from Hideki and Chii, the other characters are a fantastic cast, that are not only very likable, but can also be cared for.The characters aren\'t ""Throw away characters"" or characters who are ""Just there""; each character has their own place in the Plot, and even have certain relationships with one another. Even a few minor characters have a place to be, and -in one particular case- one of them even affected one of the main characters (But I\'m not going to tell how).Overall, Chobits is Upbeat. Funny. But has a great, engaging, and emotional science fiction plot, and a fantastic cast of characters; that all combine to create my favorite anime.Chobits EXPANDED my horizons, and made me realize that there are different animes to experience, and made me want to watch them.I wish i watched Chobits sooner. from the opening, the song ""Let me be with you"" managed to grab me in; making me want to continue watching.This all leads to my review...Review:The story of Chobits stars Hideki Motosuwa; who -after being rejected from getting into college- decides to move to Toyko to attend a Prep School.While in Tokyo, he checks out these highly advanced machines called Persocoms; which are -to put it simply- computers who look, talk, and even move like Humans.

Hideki's behavior got on my nerves instantly, and i honestly cant understand how anyone is supposed to root for him. he acts like a complete moron all the time, and isn't even cute or thoughtful to balance that out. i can get behind a good, kind-hearted idiot, but Hideki is pretty gross- he spends the majority of the show sexually frustrated because he wants to fuck his computer, and interacts with Chi in a pretty predatory way. because Chi is a reformatted computer with no language software or memories, she acts as if she has the brain of a toddler, and it makes for some uncomfortable scenes where Hideki is pretty much just getting off on Chi not knowing anything about sexuality or what porn is. Chi is absolutely adorable, but has next to no personality, and although i thought she was endearing, she barely gets any character development outside of her feelings for Hideki. having the main couple be a total pervert and a robot sex doll with Born Yesterday Syndrome and no personality makes for a weird relationship dynamic, and i found myself liking all of the side characters 10x better than i liked Hideki. the best moments of the show are the moments that feature other characters- drama between minoru and yuzuki, as well as ueda and yumi, explores the themes better in one or two episodes than Hideki and Chi do throughout the entirety of the show.the ending of Chobits is a total mess and feels so thrown together. midway through the series, they start packing in plot to try and wrap the show up by episode 26, and the last episode is so confusing and stupid that it made me regret deciding to go ahead and finish it up. originally, i wanted to give this series a 5, as it was stupid, but had its moments. after seeing the last episode, i decided to knock it down to a 4. i can't say that i recommend this show to anyone, even if you're really into romance or slice of life. the romance is the only part that i could understand being remotely into, but even that is done badly. there are so many other great romances out there that you could occupy your time with instead. the comedic moments land sometimes, but it's not worth trekking through 26 episodes for a couple jokes that barely elicit a chuckle. i don't understand why the score for this show is as high as it is on here.if you were interested in this series because of the persocom aspect and want a show with interesting themes on morality regarding human-robot hybrids, check out Gunslinger Girl. there's no romance or slice of life, but it has something interesting to say about what makes someone a human, with well-developed characters and writing that far surpasses what this show has to offer. as bad as it ended up being.the first half of the show is pretty okay as far as romance-y slice of life anime goes- if a gross, ugly man wooing a cuter-than-life robot with literally 2 braincells is your thing. the most intriguing part of the show is the small bits of lore surrounding persocoms and their role in society, and the drama exploring human relationships with their persocoms. i think that Chobits is the most entertaining when it is exploring this theme through other characters, and the occasional cutesy, slice of life sequences are pretty comfy. chi is pretty adorable despite her flaws, and i especially loved Sumomo. also, the opening is great. unfortunately, this is about all of the good i can say about this show.i'll be honest, one of the most annoying things about Chobits hands down was Hideki's character.

I was expecting so much more here based on the score of this series, what a disappointment and a huge waste of my time. Some very very minor spoilers to give you an idea about the anime without giving away anything important to the unfolding of the story.This anime came out in 2002. It looks like it was produced in 1992. The animation is disgustingly bad. The second reason the year is important is because this is a series based on technology. Imagine the movie, ""I, Robots"" with Will Smith. The robots are kind of like that except they look...like young girls and their jobs in society is to provide sex and dates to men.

Emails are like the giant technology thing at that time. Basically really primitive stuff. Anyone under 30 will not understand this at all. It\'s embarrassing.I won\'t go off on too many tangents on why this is such a crap anime. I\'ll mostly just describe the protagonist, Hideki, because he takes up about 95% of the screen time in the series. First of all, he is really stupid. I\'m guessing his IQ is in the 60-80 range. He\'s not a funny stupid; he\'s a complete moron that also talks to himself in front of others loudly without realizing it. He grew up on a farm with hopes of going to Tokyo to go to college. He got rejected. He goes to Tokyo anyway with no savings and no job to go to a prep school to get into college. Mind you, it\'s a prep school for very stupid people as it is. Throughout the series he ends up failing all his subjects in the prep school.He\'s also a sexual assailant and possible pedophile and just has some bad morals. He sexually assaults the robot that looks like a really cute 13 year old girl, and basically traumatizes this robot. He pimps out this robot to be a stripper because he doesn\'t have any money or savings to pay for food or his rent. He also nearly rapes his boss\'s young high school daughter and attempts to prey upon the young girl by taking her out on multiple dates. He also attempts to seduce his prep school teacher. He also steals electricity from his landlord to charge the robot. None of the things that I mentioned above are anything that affects the story so don\'t be concerned about spoilers. Those are basically examples of the main character.So many other stupid things about this anime, but don\'t want to make this any longer than necessary. In short, don\'t watch it. Or at least definitely pirate it rather than purchase it. like young girls and their jobs in society is to provide sex and dates to men.

I knew I was going to like it. What I didn't know was how much I would.From start to finish I enjoyed the series, even though it was a little slow, it never felt like it was and I quickly found myself watching episode after episode with no intention of stopping...any time soon. The story was excellent and as it matured, there were even moments that brought tears to my eyes.Romance did not always feel like the sole focus. In fact, the majoirty of the Anime felt like a very interesting slice of life with Drama therefore; I can understand...if people were a little annoyed at that; coming to the series expecting only Romance. But, there is really no reason to be. The show has amazing themes and concepts it explores rather well such as: love, relationships and how they develop and tragicly fall apart. The show subtlely somehow manages to introduce these ideas in a smooth manor, that does not seem out of place but, instead a welcome addition. How you interpret these ideas is up to you.Some of the soundtracks were also amazing and were so well done, delivered at such perfect moments, that it would bring me to the heights of euphoria! so, when I say I truly enjoyed this Anime. I cannot begin to convey how much that is honestly the case. As a result, I could not believe. There were some reviewers that gave this series such an unfair review, that showed. Very! little regard for the series; to say the very least.Chobits was a phenomenal work of art and even now I can feel its beauty in my heart. The side characters felt like main characters and the actual main characters tied the whole series together.I am not saying this Anime is perfect, neither am I saying you will want to sing its praises to the heavens themselves. however, what I am saying is, you will definitely enjoy it.Is that not enough? if people were a little annoyed at that; coming to the series expecting only Romance.

I personally didn't enjoy the anime as much as the next guy, and wouldn't rush to recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime genre's that are related to Chobits.I personally find that Chobits is very weak in its genre; Sci-fi, Comedy, Drama, Romance, Ecchi, Seinen.Sci-fi~ There isn't much relation to this genre in Chobits apart from the fact that the main character, Chii is a  Persocom, and the fact that Persocom's are seen as a normal part of society. I personally didn't thnk that this genre was explored and given the...right stance in the anime.Comdey~ The comedy in Chobits consist of Hideki being shy of the female body and scared to buy 'Panties' for Chii. The humor is mostly sexual and is overused in the anime to the point where it became cringy and far from the point.Drama~ In Chobits I couldn't really wrap my head around why this genre was tied to the anime. The anime itself is not dramatic and issues in each episode were mostly tied to comedy related issues and the only time the show proved dramatic was when Chii was in trouble, missing or kidnapped which would be rather dragged out.Romance~ Chobits proves to be, in a sense, romantic especially considering the relationship between Chii and Hideki, but the romance between the two was only brought out in the final episodes. It could also be tied to the relationship between Hideki's best friend, Shinbo and their teacher Takako Shimizu, who ended up together in the series about half way through the series. All in all, the romance was used in the series quite a bit even between Hideki and Yumi. But again, I personally didn't find myself cheering for the couples in the show.Ecchi~ It is very obvious since episode one that this anime will have a lot of ecchi content and the anime sticks to this genre the most.All in all the story itself was a 5/10 because it proved entertaining half of the time.Art in this anime was a 6/10 considering that it was released in 2002.The sound was a 4/10 due to the opening being pleasant but not the best. (I often sound myself skipping the opening) the voice acting was ok but not my favorite and I believe that the characters could have been given more character with just a little more effort in voice acting.Enjoyment gets an overall 3/10 because I personally did not relate to the characters and couldn't tie my interest to the character story or the overall plot of the anime.My overall score for this anime is a 5/10. This is an anime for a particular taste and I believe that for some people this could be one of their favorites and I respect their opinion.This was just my opinion on the series considering all of the strengths and weaknesses of this anime.Some might love the characters, plot, art and the paste of the show, but I personally believe this anime did not require a 26 episode airtime. right stance in the anime.Comdey~ The comedy in Chobits consist of Hideki being shy of the female body and scared to buy 'Panties' for Chii.

It was also one of the first anime I had ever seen, period. I was sufficiently impressed, being that the only other anime I had watched was Sailor Moon and InuYasha. Chobits had depth and themes, and it was so sweet!Then I just sat down to rewatch it. After everything I\'ve seen and read, I don\'t know. I think I was expecting more from my memories and was sadly disappointed.STORY: Chobits is one of those essential anime. It\'s the essential robot-human love show. Unfortunately, there\'s quite a bit more to it that seems to pale...in comparison to how it\'s depectied in the manga of the same name.First off, it is sooo different from the manga. The manga has a more elegant feel to it, and seems more mature. It seems like they really toned the anime down, which is weird considering how Hideki is always looking at porn. That\'s another thing. How is this guy poor? He\'s failing in cram school, has a job, and yet seems to never have money. The only things he spends money on are porn and his little apartment. I don\'t get it! Anyway, they leave a lot out of the anime, which is sad. There seem to be a lot of filler episodes or ""character development"" arcs (gag, because there\'s little to the character development in the anime).So after you watch the anime and think it\'s just great go read the manga. I don\'t even understand the last episode of the anime. It honestly makes no sense; there\'s not even a reference to the disk she lost in the first episode and you\'re led to believe the ""other me"" is Freya. It\'s ridiculous. Book 8 of the manga is fantastic.Also, if you want to watch more CLAMP anime you need to watch Chobits first. Different versions of the characters come into almost all of the CLAMP anime. Kobato and Tsubasa for example.SOUND: Crispin ""Alucard"" Freeman as Hideki and Stephen J ""Everyone"" Blum as Uedo? It just sits wrong with me. The woman voicing Chi is decent, at least. And the opening song is great, in addition to most of the theme music.ART: Definitely a downgrade from the manga. I hate to keep comparing the two, but I\'ve never seen a manga that was so much better than the anime. Hideki\'s tiny eyes bother me. And the sketchy, no nose, thing just isn\'t pulled off well in animation.CHARACTER: Again, a lot of attempt at character development. Hideki is a failing porn obsessed farm boy until the latter half of the anime in which he becomes obsessed with everyone else\'s relationship with persocoms (although he rarely thinks about his own). I thought to myself ""There\'s no way this can work out tactfully by the end of the show. I mean, he leaves Chi (who he\'s supposed to love) in his room alone from dawn till dusk every frickin day and thinks nothing of it!"" Oh but then there\'s ONE episode when he stops for a minute and says ""Hey Chi, want to come with me?"" Which of course means he\'s in love with her. Ugh.ENJOYMENT: Manga > Anime. It\'s a great show just... not as great as I had remembered. It seems very episodic with maybe 2 episode arcs. It seemed to me like the producers just weren\'t that vested in it. But hey. Heaven forbid I give it anything less than an 8 else I risk hate mail. in comparison to how it\'s depectied in the manga of the same name.First off, it is sooo different from the manga.

That is why since ancient times, love stories are always a sure hit for any kind of people.There’s a long review coming…………About the STORYAs popular and cliché love stories are, the romance between humans and non-humans are always a big hit. Why? Because love as we all know is something that is exclusive for human beings only but sometimes we tend to forget how great and wonderful it is to love and be loved. And as we know as well, non-humans doesn’t have such...feelings and so because of them, it reminds us how extremely lucky we are as human beings to have such emotion. What I really love about this particular series despite having a very typical plot is that, it is able to express the drama of that kind of plot magnificently and not too simple nor too dramatic. It is able to convey in details how would a person feel when they fall in love with a robot and how a robot as well would feel when they are able to finally know how it feels to love. It is shown that human beings despite knowing the risks of being so hurt because of falling in love, they would still do it. Which only shows how strong we are. Even after failing with love over and over again, we would still love. That is the proof just how it is still so wonderful to love. I also love that they used, “The one only for me” because that is the very definition of love. Whether it is human or not, you will love them for who and what they are. Like what they always say that love comes with different forms. Plus it also has the element of comedy in it. Both the drama and the comedy are not overly done. They are well-balanced and so the result is one amazing series.About the CHARACTERSThere are lots of likeable characters in the series and there are almost none irritating ones. Each of them has their own stories with regards to the plot of the series which is about persocoms. And as always, CLAMP characters are always kind-hearted and very honest people. It is very rare nowadays to have almost every character to be nice or have likeable characters because most of the times there are some non-existent or very irritating characters in the story. I really like the character of Hideki. Usually his character is very cliché because you would always encounter characters like him; a very perverted character but at the same time very kind. But usually they tend to become so irritating because they are almost all the time indecisive characters. Hideki is very different. He is not that smart in academics and in life. However, he let himself properly digest the situation in his own time before making a decision as not to hurt somebody. That is why he never does things half-heartedly and would surely protect his decision until the end because he thought about it properly. There are lots of characters nowadays who do things half-heartedly or become so hypocrite that they become so irritating even if they are protagonists. Hideki is simple and the epitome of just pure kindness.About CHII believe Chi is one of the very few non-human characters who is genuinely so cute and honest. Not only she is cute physically but her naivety to the world brings out her cuteness even more. Her actions and gestures are just so damn cute that I end up watching her scenes over and over again. I just so love it whenever she would copy Hideki while using only the “CHI” words. Plus her way of speaking in a robotic fashion is probably the cutest. And because she is a robot and learning a lot of things, she is so honest with what she feels. I am glad that at the end, she is able to realize that what makes human beings humans is that they are still able choose to love despite the pain and sufferings that comes with it. It serves as like a sign that at the end being a persocom doesn’t matter any longer.About the ANIMATIONAs this is a CLAMP work, you can definitely see their signature work on it. The illustrations and artworks might be somewhat different but you can still feel their touch on it. I am just puzzled on why all the characters’ eyes are the same whether they are humans or persocoms. The only exception is Hideki. Chi’s character is the most wonderfully made. You can very well notice not only physically that she is a persocom but she is the most human looking among all the characters. She is so cute and gorgeous at the same time. Well, I guess that would be because she is supposedly the best persocom made in the story. I also love how the seiyu delivers Chi’s voice. It is very convincing that she is a robot. It is very robotic like but at the same time it is made so cute.Indeed, CLAMP has done it again. I can’t explain it well how they create such amazing works considering I’ve been watching and reading CLAMP works for many years now. It is always heart-warming, touching and amazing. You won’t have dull moment or even irritating moments in their works. Plus, CLAMP always creates one of the best love stories of all time. They have this signature way of expressing love stories that you won’t see in others. Something that you know is a CLAMP trademark.

I also like that it does not exactly fit in a stereotypical genre. It combines several genres, and even makes fun of some cliches. The biggest thing I did not like were some overly ecchi moments that were sometimes funny but overused and sometimes uncomfortable to watch. I know if you are an adult, you can handle this, butfor me the ecchi scenes sometimes out of place with the otherwise charming and sweet tone of the show.Story: 8I found the story and idea unique. The pacing was...decent, but there could have been fewer fillers and the ending felt a little rushed. I liked how there was some mystery at the beginning that slowly developed as the story unfolded. The twists were believable and not too confusing as sometimes happens.Art: 6The art style was not my favorite, but it was unique. I did not like how many of the characters looked the same, however, and Hideki's eyes were annoying to me.Sound 8:Chobits had a nice soundtrack, though not the most memorable. The opening got on my nerves after a while, but I the endings were nice.Character: 9The characters as a whole were enjoyable. No particular character stood out, but I liked how they were diverse and even the minor characters had their own back stories. The two main characters, Hideki and Chii are also both charming and seem to avoid the annoying pitfalls that main characters seem prone to. Hideki is a normal guy that we can relate to, but at the same time he is not boring.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed this anime a lot because it seemed to evoke the correct emotions at appropriate times. It knew how to make me laugh and cry according to the situation. The series started out with many funny and ecchi moments, but as it progressed things became more sober and sad. This change did not seem out of place, however, because the story hinted at the sad undertones from the beginning. Some fillers and the uncomfortable material are the main things that detracted from my enjoyment of the anime. decent, but there could have been fewer fillers and the ending felt a little rushed.

Seeing that this anime is so popular I was curious to see it, especially after one of my friends highly recommended it to me. I can't say it disappointed me or it was better than I thought: Let's say it was nothing of what I’ve expected it to be, I thought it would be more complex in a lot of ways, but in the end, it wasn’t as bad as it could have been.Story [6]: This is the typical anime where a boy...finds a girl lost and takes her home. They have some problems that lead them to some awkward situations (a lot of them actually) and find something really great about said girl that leads them to some troubles. This is even better because the girl is cute, knows nothing about the world (see “awkward situations” above) and the guy is a pervert (c’mon, have you seen the kind of magazines he reads?).I think they spent a lot of this anime showing Chii learning things, Chii doing cute things, Chii getting in trouble, Chii learning more cute things, Chii… well, you got the idea. It’s not that it’s bad, really I had some kawaii crises all along this series, and laughed a lot too, but I think they should have focused more on the story behind Chii and Chobits, instead of giving us a Chii overdose.They give us some interesting clues, they have moments when they learn new things, but they are very few, leaving us with a weird feeling when the last episodes came, seeing as things suddenly started to get more serious and all. It left me with some questions without answer, and feeling a little rushed too.The story could be better developed and better explained, the idea was good, but the anime was far from being a masterpiece.Animation [7]: I really don’t know what to say here since I’m not an expert… The animation is nothing really special, but it’s not bad (it’s Clamp after all). The characters are well drawn and easily recognisable (not like some animes when you see two characters that look the same), they have some good backgrounds, it’s a nice style and the animation is pretty good too. Nothing very elaborated, you don’t have to force yourself to see all those little details, but it doesn’t hurt your eyes!Sound [6]: I don’t really pay too much attention to the music in anime. Basically, I skip the opening and the ending themes, unless they catch my attention, and I don’t remember well the background music (unless, again, it catches my attention).To be honest, I don’t like the opening theme… It bothered me a lot with all that “let me be with you” and “yeah, yeah” thing… The ending theme was calmer, I liked it better but it wasn’t anything outstanding. As for the background music: good, but nothing special.The voices are something different. The characters had good voices and the seiyuu were good doing their work. No voice was really outstanding, except maybe for Sumomo, her screams were a little annoying at the beginning, but you get used to it.Characters [6]: The characters are nice, but nothing really original, they don’t “grow” during the story, and I think there are some characters and subplots that are completely pointless (like Kotoko… and even Yumi and the others).Hideki is the normal 18 years old guy that’s starting a new life and beginning to learn how to take care of himself now that he’s an adult. All this matters could be better explored if not obfuscated with all those comic scenes. You don’t see too much development in any of the main characters, Hideki looks too plain, and even Chii, after all those events in the last episode, doesn’t seem to be too affected. I think Minoru’s story and Shinbo’s were far more interesting than Hideki’s, still, it was a good thing and it’s not as if they don’t show a thing about their feelings.Enjoyment [7]: Maybe I’m biased, but I actually liked this anime. It’s not a perfect anime, I’ve seen better, but it can put you in a good mood, it’s not very complex, so I did not need to pay too much attention to details, and it was funny and cute.Overall [7]: Even if the characters are not perfect and the story lacks some quality, Chobits is still a good anime if you want to have a good laugh and be entertained during an afternoon with Chii’s cuteness and Hideki’s silliness. You don’t have to think too much for more than a half of episodes. It’s just “sit and enjoy”. Yet, you’re open to disagree with me… finds a girl lost and takes her home.

I kept on hearing this series all the time, recommended by a bunch of people. I was reluctant to watch it because the story seemed a bit childish to me (I\'m a 20 year old guy). Nevertheless, it\'s very popular so i felt there must\'ve been a reason why it\'s so likeable.I gave it a try yesterday, finished the anime in a day and i gotta say.... i loved it! I have yet to watch the manga, but i believe the manga is more enjoyable (Or so i hear). Nevertheless, the anime was very enjoyable. It\'s definitely a very deep anime with lot...of emotions. It ponders the question ""Could i fall in love with a robot""? And i asked myself that when i was watching it. Even though i watched it alone, i wish i could have watched it with my gf.The story was very deep and made you think. The story itself kept me at the edge of the seat from the beginning to the end. There was indeed some dislikes i had about the anime. At some point, it felt really draggy and filler-ish. It went off direction and there little or no signs of Hideki\'s / Chi\'s bonding or the main plot. Also, I felt they cramped the ending a bit.The art was not bad, but not great. None of the characters really ""stood"" out or looked  special. They looked pretty generic, but it was still a sight to see.The music and voice acting, pretty good. The opening and ending theme are really catchy and fun to listen to.Character development..... It started off really well but at some point it halted and sort of became dull and filler-ish. It catches up later at the end though :)The series overall was very enjoyable, i DEFINITELY recommend watching it with somebody special, whether it be family, friend or girlfriend/boyfriend. I rate it a 9/10I recomment this to anyone, but it might be a bit too much for younger kids. There are many instances of adultery and ""perverted"" situations.

While it was all of these, it did not do a good enough job of displaying these genres for me to be able to enjoy it. While it had action, it had no where near enough to be called an action anime. It did have some romance, but only at the very end was this romance truly displayed. It had some ecchi elements, however, it was so restricted that you could almost call it appropriate for the family. While some of it was funny, a...lot of it was just mindless ""entertainment"". It had a serious tone to it, but that was about the only thing that stayed consistent through the show. Nonetheless, I don\'t regret watching this, but I would not re-watch it. lot of it was just mindless ""entertainment"".

The thing that really makes this anime so amazing though, is chi,...while many of the character are enjoyable, chi grows on you in such a fantastic way, and the whole ending to this series really just leaves you happy and content, the story wrapped up so well that you dont really feel disappointed or anything of the sort, the ending just feels right, if a little bit predictable. while many of the character are enjoyable, chi grows on you in such a fantastic way, and the whole ending to this series really just leaves you happy and content, the story wrapped up so well that you dont really feel disappointed or anything of the sort, the ending just feels right, if a little bit predictable.', 'Alright another fantasy we have dreamt to have it in real world.

To answer this question, the word 'alive' would have to be defined. We all know that machines are not alive, but what if one had free will and consciousness? Perhaps being alive requires emotions such as love.Story-In Chobits, it demonstrates the love between man and robot. It's set in a time where the use of Persocoms are widespread like mobile phones and demonstrates a possible scenario where a man falls in love with a robot.

The first few episodes are just an introduction to the real story: the mystery of Chii and finding out whether or not she is a special persocom. When you find out that Chii is not a normal persocom, the story became more interesting for me. Some episodes in between however are just humorous and have little to do with the real storyline, and every nine episodes there is an episode that repeats all the important parts of the serie untill now. The art is nice and there is plenty of...humour in it, although the serie has a very good and serious storyline. There were also some moments in this serie that almost made me cry, because I just got into the story so much, so to me that is a sign that this serie is really good.

There is a need to bring to attention that I was a little girl who was still getting acquainted with anime. I have revisited an episode here and there since then, but it\'s important to note that this review may be skewed by rose-colored glasses and the nostalgia that revolves around it.The art and overall aesthetic of the show has aged well, and I still find it very beautiful. The music is pleasant and sets atmosphere, and emphasizes the mood...if need-be. The main strength of Chobits is its aesthetic appeal, with its great character design, beautiful parallel-story, and scenery. Chii\'s character design in particular has great influence from gothic lolita fashion.My favorite story genre has always been sci-fi, with a focus on AI and utopian societies. While ""Chobits"" falls in to this category, it is truly more of a romance, rebirth (Chii) and a coming-of-age (Hideki) story. ""Chobits"" barely explores the bigger picture and philosophy surrounding AI, which is unlike most other sci-fi stories. Instead, the story is focused on a microverse concept (Chii and Hideki) and creates emphasis around Chii\'s character arc.After revisiting a few episodes as a young adult, I\'ve come to realize that the male MC is a very one-dimensional character. He is not unlikable by any means, but there is nothing particularly interesting about him.Chii embodies the White Goddess archetype, typically fair-haired, good, beautiful, and pure. Because character development and story arc is the show\'s central point (and not Hideki) it allows for more dimension and complexity. Chii\'s inner dialogue, paired with the featured parallel story creates more depth.I enjoyed this anime very much, and recommend it to those who enjoy the AI genre, humor, romance, and exploring the psyche of innocence and self-discovery. if need-be.

Every other scene there is a pullback to sexual appeal. Someone said Elfen Lied was similar to this. Not really, only in basic structure... there are a LOT of animes out there with a girl who is mysterious or doesn't know who she is. At least Elfen Lied wasn't about the sex; the characters were just naked and that was usually the end of it (no one cared really).To be clear, no sex actually...occurs in this show.Everything seems completely random and I found myself thinking, 'that would only ever happen in an ecchi romance', but then things tied themselves together in the end with reasonable explanations. The story tackles a large concept, and executes it fairly well, however it still felt superficial. occurs in this show.Everything seems completely random and I found myself thinking, 'that would only ever happen in an ecchi romance', but then things tied themselves together in the end with reasonable explanations.

Chobits is one of the series (Eve no Jikan, Da Capo 2, To Heart Memories being some other ones) that tackles these potentially realistic philosophical questions.Chobits is a sweet story about an ordinary country boy and the extraordinary humanoid computer/robot that he finds. It plays with the idea of relationships between humans and robots and turns out as a lovely, slightly comedic, slightly romantic, and very deep story. It\'s worth the watch if you\'re willing to give it a chance and if you\'re willing to think a little.Animation:The animation in general was well done...(CLAMP, also behind Kobato). The color palette is a bit dark, which fits the mood of the series and location (middle of the city). Despite the dark look, Hideki\'s room gives off a warm glow for some reason that appears inviting to me. Chi is gorgeous in general, in both personality and appearance. There is a bit of fan service in this seinin anime but it is definitely not the focus of the series. Expect lots of bloody noses nonetheless. The one bothering aspect is Hideki\'s eyes (reminds me of Kenta from Karin).Sound:The OP and EDs (done by Rie Tanaka) all fit the mood of the series very well, and also roll into the BGMs as well. Overall, the soundtrack in this series is outstanding. It isn\'t meant to be as relaxing as that in Air or as mystifying as that in Kanon, but it just gives off a comfortable vibe. I also really liked the ""dark Chi"" theme that played whenever Chi did something extraordinary, though this actually came from another anime (X TV). As for VAs, Rie Tanaka. Enough said. Chi is a drastic change from many of Tanaka\'s other more talkative/bubbly/confident characters and she does an outstanding job of bringing out Chi\'s innocence and eventual growth.Story:The story evolves slowly and so some people may get bored with episodes that seem to be filler. However, I found that these episodes tended to include a great deal of humor, enough so to warrant watching them. There are also summary episodes which contain no new footage and thus can be skipped.As for the actual story line, I think it evolved quite nicely from discovering Chi to teaching her the rudiments of ordinary life to learning about her background. The story does get a little confusing near the end and may warrant a second watch. Be prepared, there is an extremely emotional cliffhanger near the end. The conclusion, though, was beautiful and made it worth it (and made me want more!). Definitely check out the manga if this is the case for you too.Character:Chi is kawaii. Since she has no memories at all (including speech other than ""Chiiii"") she is completely innocent. This allows for cute scenes such as her reading XXX manga and other such acts. It is also a weakness that is exploited by others in the series. Motosuwa is also an interesting character as he has to come to grips with the fact that he is slowly beginning to like someone/something that isn\'t human, something whose memories could possibly be wiped out in an instant. A rehash of this concept was attempted recently in Plastic Memories, but to a much less emotional extent. Most of the supporting characters have something to do with persocoms and help Motosuwa deal with his situation in one way or another. Personally, I think that the really rich kid (Minoru) and his persocom/imitation sister\'s story could have been more interesting but otherwise the other characters were well integrated.Value:This anime deals with many issues that are real and pertinent. Some predict that humanoid robots will be reality within the next two decades, and books have been writwn about falling in love with robots/AI. I find this take on the issue to be fascinating and very enjoyable. I watched this twice through  (as well as reading the manga). It\'s not the funniest or most tear-inducing member of the genre, but it is a heart-warming tale nonetheless and a very good watch. (CLAMP, also behind Kobato). The color palette is a bit dark, which fits the mood of the series and location (middle of the city). Despite the dark look, Hideki\'s room gives off a warm glow for some reason that appears inviting to me. Chi is gorgeous in general, in both personality and appearance. There is a bit of fan service in this seinin anime but it is definitely not the focus of the series. Expect lots of bloody noses nonetheless.

Hideki is a very flat character, and so are many of the side characters. Typical perverted main character who ""accidentally"" molests female deuteragonist.Chi is really the only character I imagined to get attached to, mostly because of her fairly-written backstory. Yumi\'s little sideplot was okay, but it really didn\'t contribute much to the show. If they took it out, the show would be exactly the same.I did not like Chitose at all. Her character was one-dimensional, and she didn\'t contribute much either.Nice soundtrack, nice colors and character design. The story...was okay. Anime overall was decent, despite the lackluster characters. was okay. Anime overall was decent, despite the lackluster characters.', ""Chobits: Wish there was more of itStory: First i thought that the story will be about some random AI and just doing lovey-dovey 24/7. This isnt true, and from the start to the bigger half the characters dont even know what love is and this is really good in gaining trust of the viewer . The slow paced chemistry between the characters is really warm and honest in the final episodes and that is why this anime is beautiful. It really looks most natural in this way for me. I mean , isnt the love in real life that way?Also it has logical...questions what we will ask in the future and what will happen to us if this kind of technology will be irl. I really love this SCI-FI brainstorming of how the humanity will change, how the love could be manipulated just by using Ones and Zeroes in some kind of code. and what our new priorities will be and that we could put the robot in front of our beloved ones.Art: the details are what you would expect from 2002 anime with a little bit of extra expressions in critical scenes to show the viewer what the atmosphere and situation is. Its managable, but dont expect the 2021 quality or fast story like these days.Sound: Soundtrack is banger and i really love it! The songs can be found from YouTube to Spotify, since Rie Takanaka(voice actor of chi) released them to the public! I recommend Happy go lucky, Soshite Sekai ha Kyou mo Hajimaru , Ninhyo Hime, Raison d'etre,Katakoto no Koi, Ningen Dakara, They come and go. If you are interested in the story and want more hints of how we could perceive romance from robots , you can translate the lyrics!Characters:Most of the reviews i see here are really nice and thoughtful. I dont know why but only those with lower rating than 5 are repeating the same argument that there is no rich personality in one of the main characters.  This is even the reason why im writing this review.People dont understand that this is the point of the persocoms and the anime.., Persocom personality is based on the input data they receive from their master. But what happens if the master doesnt know how PCs work or what even persocom is. This is the magic of the anime, that the personality is formed through the whole anime in form of the observing and learning... like a normal AI irl , this is the point and I really loved this aspect of this anime.Enjoyment: I watched it with my friends few times in a row. As i said, the characters are being formed during the show, so if you dont like this slow paced anime i wouldnt recommend it to you and please dont force random people to watch it. If AI or Robots or SCI-FI isnt your thing , you will not find any enjoymentPeople shouldnt search for this anime , let this anime search for them  :}Overall:  i love this anime so much , that I even rewatched it and I dont do that at all.

I had no idea of where to start as to which shows I\'d like or what anime sub-genres I\'d be most into. I had heard of Chobits through word of mouth, found the show on Netflix, and thus decided to give it a watch.As far as the story goes, there is quite a lot of originality. Many romantic stories don\'t highlight the dichotomy and character development of a young man and his robot. Hideki is a typical...adolescent male. He has ambitions of going to college, yet he struggles to thrive in the competitive world of academia. As a result, he goes to Tokyo, where he studies at a nearby prep school in the hopes that he\'ll be able to get into an actual university. In the midst of this school struggle he faces, he is surrounded by ""persecoms,"" which are essentially super computers that bear a human likeness. Hideki wishes he could have a persecom of his own to ease some of his troubles and bring about some personal enjoyment. He, strangely enough stumbles upon a persecom that was lying among a pile of trash bags and takes it back to his apartment flat. This persecom is given the name ""Chi"" because of its inability to say anything other than ""chi..."" Hideki soon discovers that he\'s not dealing with an ordinary persecom, but seemingly a person that acts in their own free will. Chi is, unbeknownst to herself and Hideki, an extremely powerful persecom that has the power to love, act on her own volition and ultimately change the fate of persecom-kind forever... (not going to spoil anything.) As a result of Chi\'s extremely cute looks, endearing personality and love for Hideki... the pair finds themselves falling in love. As one can imagine, this raises questions for Hideki. Are relationships like this okay? Can she really love me? Can I really romantically love a robot? How the show handles these existential and deeper philosophical issues pertaining love is beautiful and plays out layer by layer as the story progresses.All the other components of the show are beautiful as well. The soundtrack is fitting for the genre, and each moment of the show has music that fits the said moment. Not to mention that the theme song is freaking catchy! It\'s not a bombastic extravaganza of color and sound like some theme songs are, but really captures a balance as the climax of the theme is shared between the lovers... Chi and Hideki.The artwork is very good for its time, (2002.) However, after watching a great deal of anime since then, the color scheme hasn\'t aged as well as it could have. Chobits really isn\'t an extremely colorful show and as far as color scheme, its fairly low key and simple. The bright vibrancy of other anime I\'ve seen since Chobits puts the show in a little bit of a weak spot as far as visuals are concerned. However, this isn\'t much of a complaint at all as the nature of the show doesn\'t demand a refined paint palette or cornucopia of color. The artistic design however is beautiful and Chi is absolutely gorgeous, easily one of the most beautiful girls in any anime.Lastly, I\'d like to address the overall entertainment value of this show given not only the elements I\'ve already talked about, but also how it\'s shaped and pioneered the anime preferences I have now. I\'ve always been a sucker for love stories. Whether it\'s the cute and romantic exchanges between a couple, or the extensive plot building and character development that takes them there... I\'ve always loved a story that takes these components and perfects them. Chobits perfects them and then some. It has the romance, the humor, the depth and character development to satisfy any true fan of romantic comedy. This show isn\'t one dimensional in that a young man has a robot fetish and decides to take advantage of it for his own sexual gain. Instead it is a moral crisis spelled out in Hideki\'s relationships with fellow humans and his persecom. Many things are at stake and love isn\'t just something to walk into in the case of this anime. In fact, Hideki could be posed with fear of rejection, disapproval or conflict in the wake of feelings he potentially has for Chi... adding further interest to the story.Overall, Chobits is my favorite anime of all time. And I don\'t think it will be trumped. Not now, nor in the future. A lot of this has to do with the story, characters and the anime itself, but some of it has to do with the nostalgia and the sheer joy it is to go back to this anime over and over again. I HIGHLY recommend Chobits, whether you\'re new to anime or a veteran. It is a masterpiece within the realm of romantic comedy and anime as a whole. adolescent male.

I hope to recap the anime and improve it mightily.', 'What starts out as a charming boy meets robot Rom-Com, Chobits quickly becomes stale. It has a lot of potential early on, but it is utterly wasted with poor writing decisions and repetitive jokes. It feels as if the creators of this story didn’t know if they wanted to write a social commentary on computer/porn addiction and how it effects the victim and their loved ones or just a basic Rom-Com. I feel like the mixture of ideas brought to the table in this show didn’t do the story any favors. If they would’ve committed to the points they were trying to make with better...examples it would’ve benefited the show more. I feel like this show could’ve taken an extra step and gotten a bit more philosophical while still keeping its identity as a Rom-Com by challenging the question of can a man and a machine really fall in love? It feels as if the story dips its feet into that question, but quickly pulls out and takes a more neutral take on the subject. Chobits had potential to be a cute and thought provoking anime, but in the end it ended up a shallow mess. examples it would’ve benefited the show more.

Though not particularly original, it does make you think about the societal implications of the existence of persecoms, and the side characters demonstrate various kinds of relationships and issues that could exist in such a society.The second part regarding the strange secrets regarding Chi is kinda trash. It\'s hard to...talk much about it without spoiling anything, but I can say that they add nothing to the philosophical value of the story, and they add very little enjoyment, and the resolution is so poorly explained or executed that I am wondering why these elements were added to the story at all. Honestly, they could have made Chi a normal persecom or even a high end persecom, and it would have been a better anime overall, but they made her practically ""magic"", with complete nonsense happening behind the scenes. The story would probably be too empty without a plot B, but they could have done a whole lot better.While Hideki\'s character development is decent, his initial character is annoyingly moronic. He\'s brash, loud, stupid, and perverted (though not as perverted as a lot of anime MCs. what is it with Japanese characters?). He is self conscious about appearing perverted, but it doesn\'t help that he speaks his thoughts out loud and gets lost in dreams all the time. I despise loud idiots. There are several potential love interests who all play some role in the story.Chi starts off saying nothing but ""chi"" (hence her name) and not knowing how to do much of anything, and Hideki has to teach her basic things, giving the anime a childcare aspect. But Chi learns to talk at an inhuman rate, and gets to the point where she can care for Hideki, but still doesn\'t understand a lot of things. This is definitely playing into a moe ideal of innocence, as she can love Hideki because it\'s all she knows.Despite the ecchi tag, there really isn\'t much fanservice, other than some in the first episode, and a scattering elsewhere. Despite enjoying his porn (which isn\'t shown clearly), Hideki\'s treatment of Chi is surprisingly innocent. IMO, this should not have an ecchi tag. On the other hand, for Japan reason, Chi\'s on switch is located in her crotch.The animation is fairly mediocre. It definitely looks dated and stiff by 2023 standards, but not too bad for its time.

The music is pretty good, with a luscious OP.', ""If you like cute relationships/slices of lifes featuring robots and humans this is a pretty good pick. It mainly goes into the lives of those around Hideki (MC) who have been drastically affected by persocoms (the human-like robots) in their relationships and it can get emotional at times. Our MC farmboy is a combination of klutz (with just about everything) perv, and a good person which creates a good bit of the anime's comedy. This doubles up when Chii is involved.

It's also one of those shows where supporting characters are far more interesting than main ones even though they are not special in any way themselves.Story is pretty much about nothing.

I have seen different robot/cyborg themed anime before (primarily action super hero ones) yet this was something special. A Slice of Life Romantic Comedy with the right amount of heart, humor and harrowing moments that draw you in wanting to see more. The relationship between Hideki and Chi is so endearing and really hits deep as do the other central characters bonds with persocoms. They make the viewer think about what it means to truly be human and the love that transcends real and artificial lines.Hiroyasu is my favorite...character for much the same reason Hideki is for his helpful and kind self. Yet he had a trauma with persocoms, like Yumi and Takako. His marriage to his persocom Yumi was touching despite it considered unusual, even when she developed a hard disk fault and started to break, his devotion to her was admirable and humbling. Warm, humble and passionate MC's such as Hiroyasu are ones I love and respect most in that they represent there's no shame to love another, regardless of what sets them apart or how others will look at the relationship. This is a dilemma many of the characters find themselves having to face which pushes past its own universe and piques the viewer to put themselves in their situation in reconciling and pondering their feelings for persocoms.As robotics and A.I. continue to advance, it begs the question of how humanity will regard man-made beings. Will we feel for and regard them no different than we do ourselves or will the divide between the two remain constant? A gem of an anime anyone can be impacted by and learn from, as it is the love and friendship others share that matters most and really defines who we are, no matter what sets two individuals apart. Happy to call this one of my favorites and it's just the right feel good anime for when life gets you down and need something uplifting, sweet and relatable to watch. character for much the same reason Hideki is for his helpful and kind self.

With Chobits the first half isn’t bad by any means it’s just ok it’s standard magical girlfriend anime fair with awkward fan service and “wacky” misunderstandings to boot its fine but I wouldn’t blame anyone for dropping...it before it gets good.

It has not aged well. It\'s clear that it\'s the anime style of an era gone by.The sound was alright. I love the OP song, ""Let Me Be With You.""

And I\'m writting it to express my disappointment about this series.This is one of that classic animes that everyone watch in childhood and then takes a lot of time to realize that is pure crap.Story is good, considering that Chobits was aired in 2002. But compared to other CLAMP productions, it feels to be average. Just a romance which includes a guy and a ""persocom"".Art is generic, nothing special. It look like the productors said ""just make one sketch and then move their mouths, no one will realize"". Colours don\'t make you...feel anything special, tho.About the OST, it\'s not that bad. Opening is good, and the musical setting is precisely right.Oh, the characters. This is a point that can not be defensible. Hideki, the main character is just so flat, useless. He does nothing but talk about Chii, who is another ""no personality character"". Shimbo fulfills his role, but when the story progresses he loses everything.Just a waste of time, overall is 4/10 because I can\'t deny i felt some moe moments <3.

Still being crap', ""Warning possible SpoilersMadhouse isn't really known for making many Romances they usually focus on Action, Mystery, Fantasy or even Psychological anime's, but whenever they do make a Romance they always seem to pull through.The story concentrates on Hideki Motosuwa a farm who moved to Japan so he could study to get into College then randomly he finds a Persocom that he called Chii since that's all she could say, but unbeknownst to Hideki Chii has more secrets than he realises.Now the story starts out like your usual Slice of Life type story with random activities that the main characters try to overcome, but interestingly the...story starts to pick up more the further it goes on as we discover more about Chii and the people that were involved with her, the story goes into a lot of depth between the differences of Humans and Persocoms like what they can and can't do when it comes to loving relationships along with the characters in the show that seem to have also had bad experiences when it comes to loving relationships too.You get to see the relationship between Chii and Hideki grow every episode as Chii learns new things from Hideki so that she become used to human society, but we learn that she isn't just some random Persocom and is actually hiding something that could potentially make her very dangerous and Hideki is the only one that stop this from happening.The one problem I have with the story is how some of the supporting characters are used because apparently every character we meet ends up with someone and the way the story makes some of these characters get together was done poorly and didn't even have any build up to it.The characters are a mixed bunch, none of them were dislikeable some just weren't used to the best of their abilities.Hideki is the male MC and has no understanding of Persocom's or technology for that matter so he isn't a bight person, but he makes up for it with an honest and kind personality that makes him likeable by many of the other characters, but he does have a tendency to speak his thoughts out loud which does lead to some awkward moments.Chii is the female MC and is a very interesting character since in the beginning all she could say was Chii, but by the end she really had become a well developed character as the knowledge she had gained helped her out in many situations, however some parts of the knowledge she gained from Hideki wasn't exactly fully explained which made her mistake a lot of things which did lead to some really funny moments of confusion for the other characters, she was also a really adorable character as her expressions were just a cute site to see.Sumomo and Kotoko are the two smaller Persocoms that join Hideki and Chii at later points in the series although they don't get a lot of screentime they are funny characters and complete opposites of each other, Sumomo is very active and is always excited no matter what and Kotoko is pretty much a Persocom Tsundere, but pretty much everything she says is true, these two made for some funny comedy and kept the show pretty lively.Shinbo is Hideki's neighbour and best friend, he usually helps Hideki out whenever he is having problems with Chii or anything technical.Takako is both Hideki and Shinbo's prep school teacher and has had a bad experience with her husband thanks to Persocoms so she and Shinbo have an affair and elope much to Hideki's surprise.Minoru is a technical genius and helps Hideki understand what Chii truly is while also caring for his Persocom called Yuzuki who is modelled and programmed to be like Minoru's deceased sister.Yumi Omura is a waitress at her father's pub, while seeing Hideki as an older brother figure she does tend to flirt with him from time to time, but she has also had a bad experience with relationships in the past and has made her view on Persocoms seem negative.The artstyle seemed pretty for an anime of it's time, but I did like a lot of the outfits that Chii would wear during the course of the show, the way the Persocoms were designed seemed like something you would find in an old Sci-fi series so their design gave off a nostalgic feel for me and it was also interesting how the Persocoms weren't just limited to being human sized as we also got smaller toy sized Persocoms too which showed off the different varieties they can be.The Romance aspect was mostly ok as the relationship between Hideki and Chii was sweet and adorable they just looked like they were made for each other, but the other characters that ended up together was a little different I was completely fine with Shinbo getting together with Takako since Shinbo was helping Takako get over an anxiety where she couldn't trust men anymore. It's the Yumi and Ueda relationship that doesn't make any sense I mean there's little hints, but there wasn't any real build and it just felt a way out from creating a love triangle between Chii and Yumi for Hideki which probably would've worked since the question are Persocom's better than humans was asked a lot and this would have made the plot go to new depths, but other than that the Romance was fine.The comedy was done really well, it was always funny and cute seeing Chii copy everything Hideki did and the arguments that Sumomo and Kotoko had were also funny despite their late introductions into the story. Hideki was able to even add to the comedy as his imaginative mind always lead to a perverted situation and seeing him trying to correct this was really entertaining.Overall this was a fun, but at times mysterious show since there are some deep questions asked, so if you're looking for a cute Romance with some mysterious elements added in then you find some interest in this. story starts to pick up more the further it goes on as we discover more about Chii and the people that were involved with her, the story goes into a lot of depth between the differences of Humans and Persocoms like what they can and can't do when it comes to loving relationships along with the characters in the show that seem to have also had bad experiences when it comes to loving relationships too.You get to see the relationship between Chii and Hideki grow every episode as Chii learns new things from Hideki so that she become used to human society, but we learn that she isn't just some random Persocom and is actually hiding something that could potentially make her very dangerous and Hideki is the only one that stop this from happening.The one problem I have with the story is how some of the supporting characters are used because apparently every character we meet ends up with someone and the way the story makes some of these characters get together was done poorly and didn't even have any build up to it.The characters are a mixed bunch, none of them were dislikeable some just weren't used to the best of their abilities.Hideki is the male MC and has no understanding of Persocom's or technology for that matter so he isn't a bight person, but he makes up for it with an honest and kind personality that makes him likeable by many of the other characters, but he does have a tendency to speak his thoughts out loud which does lead to some awkward moments.Chii is the female MC and is a very interesting character since in the beginning all she could say was Chii, but by the end she really had become a well developed character as the knowledge she had gained helped her out in many situations, however some parts of the knowledge she gained from Hideki wasn't exactly fully explained which made her mistake a lot of things which did lead to some really funny moments of confusion for the other characters, she was also a really adorable character as her expressions were just a cute site to see.Sumomo and Kotoko are the two smaller Persocoms that join Hideki and Chii at later points in the series although they don't get a lot of screentime they are funny characters and complete opposites of each other, Sumomo is very active and is always excited no matter what and Kotoko is pretty much a Persocom Tsundere, but pretty much everything she says is true, these two made for some funny comedy and kept the show pretty lively.Shinbo is Hideki's neighbour and best friend, he usually helps Hideki out whenever he is having problems with Chii or anything technical.Takako is both Hideki and Shinbo's prep school teacher and has had a bad experience with her husband thanks to Persocoms so she and Shinbo have an affair and elope much to Hideki's surprise.Minoru is a technical genius and helps Hideki understand what Chii truly is while also caring for his Persocom called Yuzuki who is modelled and programmed to be like Minoru's deceased sister.Yumi Omura is a waitress at her father's pub, while seeing Hideki as an older brother figure she does tend to flirt with him from time to time, but she has also had a bad experience with relationships in the past and has made her view on Persocoms seem negative.The artstyle seemed pretty for an anime of it's time, but I did like a lot of the outfits that Chii would wear during the course of the show, the way the Persocoms were designed seemed like something you would find in an old Sci-fi series so their design gave off a nostalgic feel for me and it was also interesting how the Persocoms weren't just limited to being human sized as we also got smaller toy sized Persocoms too which showed off the different varieties they can be.The Romance aspect was mostly ok as the relationship between Hideki and Chii was sweet and adorable they just looked like they were made for each other, but the other characters that ended up together was a little different I was completely fine with Shinbo getting together with Takako since Shinbo was helping Takako get over an anxiety where she couldn't trust men anymore.

First off, the anime is about a persocom, a robot, named chi, being found by a man in prep school named Hideki. They then begin to fall in love even though Chi is a robot. This anime, is an older one first being aired in 2002. The art is appropriate for this time period so expect that when jumping into this. Now about the content. This show, I feel, hammered down its themes very hard onto the viewer. Everywhere you look there are hints and symbols that are pushed in your face as if you are in idiot. The...themes aren't bad just generic for this time period. In 2002 this may be an idea that has been relatively new in the anime medium, but now its over done.  The characters and plot are something to behold though. Most, if not all of the cast are related to these robots in some way and display some of the issues the theme of robots looking and acting like humans provide if they would to exist. There are only a few characters that I have issue with, and it could be viewed as a preference problem. I would give the recommendation to watch this anime to those who like taboo love stories.

I can't seem to enjoy the made-to-look-cute European doll-like supercomputers that repeat the same syllable too many times. She was almost the only thing I had a beef with, but the fact that the story centralizes her kind of dragged the whole thing down, BUT all the other characters were VERY likable, (I was personally rooting for Yumi-chan) I really liked that all the romantic subplots were wrapped up before the end, the mystery built up throughout the series pays off well at the end with only slight confusion and nonsense. Also the opening...theme was annoying. theme was annoying."", ""Chobits was recommend by a friend of mine. Going into it I only knew little, (looking over guidelines it says NOT TO INCLUDE SUMMARIES, so refer to the synopsis). At first the opening felt obnoxious and something for a slice of life anime not sci-fi. The sound was good and cheery till you came to the last episodes where the plot kicks into over drive. Characters were good and each with an interesting back story. The character design was great well at least for Chi, and whom every did hair animation had way to much fun at parts. But over all some times I was...dragging my self through the story, due to the episodes that were just summarizing, honestly I didn't like how the last episode was like that as well.

Focused on ronin student Hideki Motosuwa, he is awed at how much of the Tokyo populace owns persocoms, androids that serve as human-sized personal computers for their human owners. While coming home one night from work, Hideki stumbles upon a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl left in the trash. Choosing to take on ownership of the persocom and naming her Chi, Hideki tries to learn more about her origins while teaching her appropriate behavior, concepts, and words. Meanwhile as Chi starts to understand more about the world around...her, she comes to develop feelings for Hideki that other persocoms are incapable of experiencing and it’s believed she may be a legendary persocom known as a Chobit, a persocom capable of sentience and emotions.Before addressing other parts of Chobits, I need to get into one major piece of criticism I have with the series in regards to how its first half is handled. In the original manga, Chobits was mainly explored through Hideki’s perspective as he observed Chi’s growth and interacted with several human characters who are affected by their varying interactions with persocoms in regarding them as more than just tools or feeling inferior compared to what they offer. For the anime, much of its first half is mainly explored through Chi’s perspective. While this could have provided for a unique departure from the manga to show how Chi regards her growing emotions and experiences, the anime instead wastes much of its time pandering to the audience by showing Chi doing cute things due to her naive nature and several episodes do nothing at progressing the plot as they serve as anime-only filler. These alterations do lead to some inconsistency and disregard for moments of foreshadowing dropped at points during the manga’s earlier chapters that hint to problems that several of the human characters have in regards to their experiences with persocoms.The second half of the series improves on things somewhat as it dabbles more into exploring how several of the human characters deal with their experiences with persocoms being viewed as more human. This is perhaps the best element portrayed for the anime adaptation of Chobits as it convincingly shows the emotional pain that several of the human characters go through in regards to their perceptions of persocoms with personal relationships and Hideki finds himself at the center of trying to resolve these problems for those he’s become acquainted with.In regards to Chi’s origins in the second half, the handling of this plot element is more of a mixed bag. Without spoiling too much, the anime gradually drops more hints over Chi’s true nature and she is shown to become more sentient as she develops greater understanding of the world around her. However, the anime does deviate from the manga in some key elements of Chi’s functions and origins, and the final resolution of the series with Hideki and Chi’s relationship does feel a bit rushed in how it was handled. This likely has to do with the manga still being incomplete at the time of the Chobits TV anime’s airing, as the anime had concluded just a few months before the manga did. It also likely explains why the anime added in so much filler within its first half. But these issues with exploring Chi’s origins and developments still greatly hinder the overall quality of the Chobits anime adaptation to a good degree.One other thing I do need to mention about Chobits is its content. Unlike many of CLAMP’s works, the series is aimed toward the seinen demographic and this shows with the good deal of raunchy content depicted in the manga with Chi often being nude or in states of undress due to her naivette and moments depicting Hideki’s perversion with his porn collection and occasional lewd thoughts of several of the human female characters. The anime adaptation does tone this down somewhat with no onscreen nudity depicted, but still retains a good deal of the manga’s raunchy content. Because of this, I wouldn’t recommend younger or more content-sensitive audiences view this series.Overall, this anime adaptation of Chobits is a bit of a disappointment considering what its source material dabbled into with exploring human-persocom relationships. While still retaining the general premise and story structure of the manga, the anime added a good deal of filler to its first half and altered a fair number of major elements concerning Chi’s origins due to its source material still being ongoing at the time of its airing. If you are a fan of the series, I’d strongly recommend checking out the manga as it doesn’t have as much filler and its plot progression and exploration being more smoother as a result. her, she comes to develop feelings for Hideki that other persocoms are incapable of experiencing and it’s believed she may be a legendary persocom known as a Chobit, a persocom capable of sentience and emotions.Before addressing other parts of Chobits, I need to get into one major piece of criticism I have with the series in regards to how its first half is handled.

I make no secret about Chobits being one of my all time favorite anime and I have received quite a lot of flak due to that, being called a person with no taste even by people who watch slice of life. But I disagree,Chobits on the surface might leave you an impression of a boring slice of life, but in fact it manages to handle some really tough existential problems exceptionally well. I would go out as far as saying that it is comparable to Ghost In the Shell series....As I have mentioned previously in my other reviews, Ghost In the Shell dramatically and directly asks questions about the human condition. Chobits asks the same questions, but doesn't make it obvious to the watcher. The fact is that most people mistake this anime for a slice of life, they couldn't be more wrong.In reality , the whole series is a build-up to it's grand finale, the moment where the main character is confronted with a choice that will alter his reality forever. The motivation to make this choice comes from love - here comes in my second thesis about this anime, not only does it try to ask questions about the human condition, it also shows that love is a catalyst for transformation from non-human to human and vice versa.Creator of this story knowingly, from the start prepares you, the reader/watcher, to confront and to question your reality as a human being and your ultimate goal in life. The author really wants to drill home the fact that falling in love with a persocom and accepting the fact is not just a choice you make. To make that choice one has to come in terms with their own mortality and maybe even abandon some aspects that make them human… after all persocoms are made, not born and as a biological entity, one must give up it's goals in life.In short, I would describe Chobits a rare gem that manages to ask questions about the human condition in a wholesome way. - 10/10 As I have mentioned previously in my other reviews, Ghost In the Shell dramatically and directly asks questions about the human condition.

Maybe I have a soft spot for robotic gals (I was also fond of Hand Maid May, Mahoromatic, and A.I. Love You), but this one really tugged at my heart strings. It also doesn't hurt that I am a 19 year old guy, a year out of highschool waiting to go into college, utterly hopeless romantically, and otherwise basically a perfect clone of the main character, Hideki. Some reviewers have said that he lacks in personality, but honestly I'm not sure what they expect. He's shy, earnest,...empathetic, caring... Sure he's not The Most Interesting Man In The World™, but then again neither are you or I in all likelihood, and that's fine.Others (or at least one of the other top reviewers) say that he's perving on/molesting/abusing Chi, which is a blatant lie that never happened even once. The closest he came to anything of the sort was blushing furiously upon seeing her half dressed. Another complaint was that they couldn't empathize with the idea of loving a computer, but if she's sentient and breaks the uncanny valley then I really can't think of any reason not to be OK with that. Heck, one of the main morals of the story is that love can transcend such dreadful barriers. Besides, it's certainly no weirder than yaoi shota (or any yaoi for that matter).As for Chi, what's not to love? She looks like a Goddess (without having the enormous assets all too common these days), she maintains an adorable innocence and purity, she cares deeply for Hideki, and she makes him feel needed and depended upon. (after all, if she were a strong independent woman, why would she need a man at all?The other characters add their own fascinating arcs to the story as well, but I really think you should just discover those as they come.Overall if you want a cute romance story with a bit of suspense and intrigue, you could do a heck of a lot worse than Chobits. empathetic, caring...

This came out when the internet was really just starting out but its consequences could already be felt in society at large. CLAMP knew this and Chobits is their response...to this dilemma, if you will.We have a wife who is abandoned by her husband, who fell in love for his pasocon and is on an emotional quest to find her self-worth again. A baker marries his computer and tries to give her the best life he possibly can. A boy builds an android with the appearance and personality of his deceased sister. Chi, the main character, tries to understand what love is, when she begins to realize her own emotions towards Hideki, the man who found her in the street, deactived. Personal tragedies and how each character deals with it is really what this series is all about and it's never disappointing or condescending, there's a lot of sensitivity and warmth in all of those stories and each one is very enjoyable.The real mystery in Chobits is where exactly being just a machine ends and being human begins. Computers in this universe seem to be machines with human souls and the people living within it, just like us, are not sure where to draw the line. Is it just a machine? Are all those android emotions just programming? Should they be taken seriously? The main characters, each and in their own way end up finding out that in the end those questions are not as important as making sure to approach every situation that happens in life with the uttermost compassion and understanding. to this dilemma, if you will.We have a wife who is abandoned by her husband, who fell in love for his pasocon and is on an emotional quest to find her self-worth again.

While there he sees *persocoms* which are humanoid robots, he really wants one but as a student doesnt really have money. When walking home one night he finds a persocon abandoned in the rubbish, he then takes her home. When turned on this persocom...can only say chii, which then becomes her name. Hideki learns that chii has learning software and starts teaching her all sorts of things. Chii learns about love, life and even gets a job. While all this happens the mystery of chiis true origin deepens and many people help hideki while searching for the answer. Hideki and Chii fall in love without realising it themselves.This Anime has excellent drawings. Also the characters are very easy too get attached too which makes the anime more exciting. The story is beautiful, romantic, and create one of the saddest, happiest, funniest, best anime i have ever seen. Even for people, like me, who do not generally watch this genre or like it, it is an amazing show sure too delight. can only say chii, which then becomes her name.

It has quite a nice borderlands and Chi... Holy shit she is cute. It does have its ecchi moments, but those are few and far between and mostly for comical purposes, so that's not much of a worry.The only downside i find is the ending, not spoiling or anything, it's not sad or anything, but just a little bit disappointing for me. The art also took a while for me to get used to, particular the guy's eyes, like wtf the're like tiny dots. It is also quite funny...at times which really lightens the mood and there is a lot of romance involved. I would highly recommend this to all you people out there. at times which really lightens the mood and there is a lot of romance involved.

Now, with Carcaptor Sakura director Morio Asaka, and computers becoming a major theme, Chobits is interesting to say the least.The story focuses on Hideki moving from the country to the city for a good old college education. Persocoms or better known as personal computers with human form are all the rage in technology. Of course, they are expensive and Hideki doesn’t have one, but low and behold he finds a mysterious abandoned one and takes it home. He names it Chi based on that is the only word it can say along...with the memory wiped (amnesia for robots). The story unfolds behind the origins of Chi and the developments of Hideki’s relationship to it. All with the main question of the anime, “when computers look like a human, does love remain the same?”The theme, plot, and drama have a good idea that is unfortunately poorly executed over 24 episodes (plus 2 recap). As much as the series starts off as interesting, everything seems a bit too much like trying to grasp at romantic comedy straws very similar to Maison Ikkoku, but failing instead. Semi-perverted college guy moves into a new boarding place and ends up falling in love. Comedic elements ensue with romantic developments, and a slow moving plot to say the least. All aspects similar to the formula Maison Ikkoku used in the 80s, but Maison Ikkoku told a story the audience cared about.Chobits misses these elements by instead focusing on the perversions of Hideki and his new robot, and the robotic demeaning of women. This series takes a lot of flak for this. Persocoms are mostly obedient woman and stripped of thinking on their own with only what the man programs into them. This series literally objectifies woman. There are even episodes where there are entire episodes focused on Chi doing cute robot things like getting lost chasing a cat for example.Looking past all of that, the series is animated well, but everything else seems a bit just above average for the time. Characters only develop slightly even though one is a robot with development to program, art has little detail but foreground animation gets emotions across with the character designs, while side characters are more interesting than the main ones. It’s hard to gage an anime where there is just enough to hook an anime fan, but improper fan service and an unsatisfying conclusion just leads a little too much to be desired. Chobits had the potential for something more, which leads to nothing more than an average anime with some extra elements for slightly more entertainment. with the memory wiped (amnesia for robots).

These persocoms or personal computers look like humans and can act as a human as well.I like the story very much, though its not really original. I like Chi because she’s so innocent and curious at the world. Hideki is hardworking and somewhat responsible and patient for teaching Chi. The development of the character was good, too. It showed the relationship that can be attained between a human and a robot, that everyone has their own perception about this bond. The art was soft and nicely...drawn and I can see no major flaw. The artists showed what should be really portrayed by the character, like Chi, who looks like a child because of his innocent face. This anime is recommended for everyone who wants to watch comedy with a mixture of romance and (sort of) drama. drawn and I can see no major flaw.

The anime was made in 2002, but it feels really like it was made in 2012 (IN MY OPINION AGAIN.) The anime was outstanding and has some sort of charm that other animes don't have.

The trajectory towards a 'Chobits' reality feels disconcertingly close.Admittedly, Chobits begins with a lighthearted, slightly lewd tone. However, if one dismisses these initial episodes, they'll miss the profound character depth and the beautiful story the creator weaves.Those seemingly frivolous moments serve a purpose—they contribute to character development and mirror realistic human tendencies.I won't delve into intricate details, as most readers seek a simple verdict: is it worth their time?For those yet...to experience Chobits, seeking a touching tale that resonates deeply, this series delivers on that front. to experience Chobits, seeking a touching tale that resonates deeply, this series delivers on that front."", ""Recommendation: A decent romance overall, but very inconsistent.  I was strongly negative on some aspects of the series but not the series as a whole, so whether you like it or not will ultimately depend on whether those negative parts ruin the show for you or not.  It's worth giving it a shot at least if you like romances.The easiest way to put it is that Chobits is a case of good characters trapped in a bad story.  It's at its best when it decides that it wants to be a lighthearted slice of life romcom, and stumbles badly when it decides...to inject melodrama into things.  Plot developments and twists tend to come completely out of nowhere with little to no foreshadowing or setup, making them surprising but frequently nonsensical, and the abrupt shifts in tone make it hard to treat them with any seriousness.  Without spoiling it, the ending was emblematic of the series' tendency to use cheap drama and emotion to paper over the fact that almost nothing leading up to it made any sense if you think back on it.  It's like it leaves you all these hints about the central mystery of the series (who is Chi?), and ultimately they were all just pointless breadcrumbs scattered about that led to nothing because they were just going to do whatever the hell they wanted with the ending anyway and didn't really care that the dots leading to it didn't end up connecting in the end (apologies for the mixed metaphor).That isn't to say it's all bad though, as you can probably tell by the score I gave it.  It actually is a very pleasant watch when it's doing its slice of life thing, and Chi is very adorable.  Most of the side characters are good and some of the individual stories for them are solid, such as the one with Minoru and his persocom maid Yuzuki that he's strangely attached to.  I also appreciated that many of the relationships were genuinely complex in a way that you rarely see from romance anime that often emphasizes or idealizes purity and devotion in love.  The one character I did not like was Hideki, the main character.  He is stupid and awkward and frustratingly lacking in basic common sense.  The ongoing joke of him narrating his inner thoughts for the viewer without realizing that the characters around him can hear what he's saying wears out its welcome by the second episode, and equally annoying is the bit where he spaces out and gets yelled at by the people nearby that he isn't paying attention to.  These 2 jokes are repeated roughly 20 times an episode so prepare yourself for that.There are two parts of the relationships aspect of the show that I would criticize though.  The first is in the relationship between Hideki and Chi.  The chemistry feels very one sided for most of the series, with Chi noticeably and progressively falling in love with Hideki over the course of the series while Hideki treats her like a curiosity or a pet until the very end when boom he's suddenly in love too.  It undercuts the emotional payoff of their romance when he's so obviously disinterested in her romantically for 24 of the 26 episodes.  The second is (apologies for the vagueness, but I'm trying not to spoil things here) in a certain high school student's relationship with a certain man that's much older than her.  We're meant to find this romance heartwarming, but it comes off as being very uncomfortable and disturbingly close to grooming instead.  All the writers had to do was not have her character be underage and it would have been a fine storyline, but here we are.

It has very comical moments and because of that it passes quickly, although it would be better as a 20 episode anime in my opinion, there are some filler episodes and the worst episodes are the recap ones.

I challenged myself to write this time because I feel that now I have the confidence to criticize beyond the obvious.I don't want to go on too long, I won't do a specific review of each episode or plot facts, I will do an overview addressing and discussing the nuances and ideas discussed, I will also go over the technical aspects, but I will focus on the essence of the thing. Having said that, I will move on to the analysis.Chobits is about love. He talks about many types of love, from fraternal to love complexes, such...as the Eros complex, but the focus and what is most in evidence is the ontology of love, what it is and how it can be born, its limits, its beginning, its form, in other words, its nature. The problem is how he executes it, obviously the plot style paths and direction were not the best for this, the chosen format also did not provide space for this to be worked well. This format, this standard anime formula is not necessarily bad, you can work on complex themes without getting lost, Neon Genesis Evangelion is there to prove it.Chobits take themselves so seriously even though 60% of their episode content is Fan Servise, this is problematic. This fake and offensive appeal becomes more evident when the work has the fateful beach episode, and guess what, Chobits has it. This is not a problem in itself, the problem takes shape when the previous episode launches a discussion, a cue for the viewer, and leaves a dilemma to be developed with the main characters. Seriously, this beach episode killed half the weight that this moral discussion had.Following this line, I will look at the way conflicts are brought to the table and how they develop. I summarize the entire structure as frivolous and lazy. Chobits is a Slice of Life, but that doesn't mean it has to be monotonous and without any conflict, especially when its proposal is a discussion as difficult as what love is, and even worse when it has dramatic elements. I'm a big fan of Slice of Life, but in Chobits this genre just seemed like a lazy excuse for not developing its conflicts in an at least acceptable way. This only intensifies in the crude changes in climate that occur halfway through the work and at the end of it.Despite everything, this work did discuss its themes, and in a courageous move it came to an end, even if it was executed in a strictly lazy way.I recommend Chobits for anyone who has been involved in the world of anime for a long time. I also recommend it for someone looking for something with a different flavor, not caring so much about the work itself, but about its production context and mainly about the influences that its chronotope and its artistic takes influenced what it became.At least in Chobits there is the participation of Round Table in the OST's, I love this group.Text translated from Portuguese to English using Google Translate. as the Eros complex, but the focus and what is most in evidence is the ontology of love, what it is and how it can be born, its limits, its beginning, its form, in other words, its nature.

That said, once the explanations begin, the story surrounding her isn\'t the most intriguing. I enjoy the more slice-of-life aspects of the anime rather than the needlessly convoluted turn in the later episodes. But sadly, even those get bogged down with boring filler material at times. Hideki is your usual ""nice guy"" who falls for every girl, but still gets nosebleeds when he sees side-boob. You know this character, you\'ve seen him in most harem anime.

The picture book series that Chi finds so endearing (which I thought was incredibly precious) was ruined by the explanation behind it (Really? We\'re to believe Hideki\'s landlord writes these books?). It\'s all less than profound. They should have kept things simple instead of shoe-horning more pointless subplots for the sake of it.

The sci-fi elements were sloppily written from that point on, and I was pretty much forcing myself to reach the conclusion.

It struggles with deeper themes: an inexperienced farm boy, ignorant to the ways of all things tech, falling in love with an android. Unfortunately, the show doesn\'t know how to make it compelling. We\'ve seen ""man loves machine"" stories executed pretty well before, right? But \'Chobits\' has no idea how to make us feel for these two characters falling for each other. The ending was lackluster and unsatisfactory, as well. I didn\'t like the idea of Hideki falling in love with Chi, just because every real girl in his life rejected him cold. Their relationship is more touching in the beginning, where it\'s more of a brother/sister love. But that\'s just me. If any anime needs to be rewritten and remade, it\'s this one. The animation is also middle of the road, often static, sometimes choppy, a lot of looping, profile shots make characters look like tired frogs...

Instead of an adventure/mystery/fantasy series like ""Tsubasa Chronicles"" or ""xxxHolic"", ""Chobits"" is instead more of a futuristic slice-of-life romance story about the growing love between humans and robots, though not without its own mysteries to be solved. While it can be rather indecisive at times, it still manages to be a likable, fun and unique series, in no small part thanks to its truly adorable female lead.Story (7/10):The story is set in a world where human-shaped computers called Persocoms have grown into common usage. Hideki...Motosuwa is a young man who lives on a farm in the country and aims to get into college, only to discover that he needs to attend a prep school beforehand due to failing. As such, he moves to Tokyo, where he soon proves himself to be a fish-out-of-water due to having never been there before. Besides getting into college, Hideki also dreams of owning a Persocom, but completely lacks the money to get one. By a sheer stroke of luck, however, he ends up finding one in the trash. He brings her home, awakens her, and ultimately names her Chi after the only thing she is initially able to say, after which the story revolves around the growing relationship between this unlikely couple, and the nature behind Chi\'s mysterious existence.The series starts off rather slow, focusing mainly on Hideki\'s interactions with the various people he meets and Chi\'s continuous growth as a person. Some of these are rather mindless, with one episode being all about getting underpants for Chi (it makes sense in context), and ultimately add very little to the overall plot. Thankfully, things start to pick up a great deal in the second half of the series, which starts delving into the backstories of various supporting characters as well as slowly uncovering the mystery behind what exactly makes Chi so special. Some of these stories are very emotional, though I definitely found myself liking some more than others.So why the not-particularly-high score? If I were to give a main reason, it\'s that I often had trouble figuring out exactly what the writers were trying to say. For a while, they seemed to be saying that technology is no substitute for interaction with real people, with several characters\' backstories aligning with this theme. Unfortunately, this ends up being undermined by the growing romance between Hideki and Chi, as while the latter is not a normal  Persocom, she is one nonetheless. Ultimately, the closest thing to a message I could piece together is that robots are neither objects nor substitutes for humans, but individuals in their own right, a message that sadly has no basis in reality. That said, while the story can have an identity crisis at times, it thankfully isn\'t as severe as some other examples, and does ultimately manage to deliver a decent conclusion.Art & Animation (8/10):""Chobits"" first aired in 2002, which at this point is nearly two decades ago. Even so, while the art is by no means amazing, it still manages to hold up well to this day, which is probably helped by the fact that the animation studio was Madhouse. All the characters are well-drawn and the animations are decent, though the characters designs can be somewhat repetitive, and not just with the Persocoms.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):The soundtrack of ""Chobits"" is best described as strange, but beautiful. It starts off rather lighthearted, especially the opening and first ending theme, but becomes oddly haunting as things start to get more serious, with the second ending theme, ""Ningyo Hime"" and ""Yasashisa no Shouzou"" being particularly standout tracks. The voice acting is fantastic, with Crispin Freeman delivering a performance as Hideki not unlike the one he gave as Kyon, albeit a much less sarcastic one, and Michelle Ruff nailing Chi\'s innocent nature and continued growth over the series. There\'s a strong supporting cast as well, including Wendee Lee, Steve Blum, Bridget Hoffman and Tony Oliver. As a whole, this category is easily the best part of the entire series.Characters (7.5/10):As a young adult who has recently moved from the countryside to the city for the first time, Hideki is very much a fish-out-of-water. This is evident by the fact that he\'s clearly not used to having people around him, to the point that he\'ll often end up saying some really embarrassing things out loud for individual people or even entire crowds to hear, and despite acknowledging he needs to stop thinking out loud, he keeps doing it regardless. This aspect of his character hit a little too close to home for me, as thinking out loud is a problem I\'ve had for as long as I can remember, and one my family constantly calls me out for. Hideki also has a very perverted mind most of the time, though it\'s never to the point where he becomes unlikable, as he refuses to take advantage of the innocent Chi and gets seriously pissed at anyone who does. Additionally, while he is rather dimwitted, especially in early episodes, he can provide some surprising emotional insight at times. All in all, while he can be very annoying at times, I nevertheless found him to be a very likable and relatable lead.Let\'s face it, though, Chi is most definitely the character who steals the show here. As mentioned above, she is initially unable to say anything except her name, and as a result has no real personality. As time goes on, however, she starts to learn more and more words, generally by Hideki teaching her. It helps that she\'s not a normal Persocom, and so doesn\'t have to have any software installed in order to learn anything, making her ideal for a working-class man like Hideki. She struggles at first, but that only adds to both her cuteness and the hilarity of the series. Eventually, she is able to speak fluently, and she even manages to get a job to help out Hideki with his struggling finances. In short, over the series, she gradually develops from a black slate to a much more human and complex being, yet doesn\'t become any less adorable because of it. Exactly what makes her such a special Persocom is also one of the driving mysteries of the series, and the second half is all the more compelling because of it.The supporting cast is quite good, though only a couple of them are relevant at any time. My favourite would probably be Chitose Hibiya, Hideki\'s landlady and a mysterious woman who always seems to know more than she\'s letting on. Her role in the story doesn\'t become apparent until the last quarter of the series, so all I can really say is that she\'s worth keeping an eye on until then, with a sweet, gentle personality to boot. Another character of note is Minoru Kokubunji, a child prodigy and expert on Persocoms with a troubled past, who becomes Hideki\'s main assistance in finding out exactly what Chi is. He also starts off viewing Persocoms as mere objects whose relationships with humans should be strictly professional, but eventually grows to see them as individuals in their own right to be loved if a person chooses to do so, making him one of the more developed characters in the series.There\'s also Hiromu Shinbo, Hideki\'s neighbour and fellow cram school student. Unfortunately, there\'s not much to his character besides being Hideki\'s more tech-savvy best friend, which probably isn\'t helped by the fact that he\'s one of the few characters without some kind of backstory. That\'s not to say he\'s flat, he just isn\'t as developed as some of the other characters. There are some other characters to be mentioned, but I won\'t in order to avoid spoilers, as many of them seem trivial at first before they turn out to be important, though I can say that some of them are definitely better than others.Enjoyment (7.5/10):""Chobits"" starts off very lighthearted and comedic, but gradually gets a lot darker and more drama-based, which comes full circle in the second half o the series, where the cheerful first ending theme is replaced with the much more somber second. The drama can get pretty heavy at times, and it\'s definitely not easy on the feels. There\'s also the fact that, as mentioned above, some of the early episodes are rather mindless, to the point that you skip them and miss nothing noteworthy. That said, the drama does end up paying off in the end, and the series is often very heartwarming.Overall:""Chobits"" is definitely not for everyone, and some people will likely be turned off solely by the idea of romance between machines and people, especially since the series seems to go against this at times. It doesn\'t help that it is unlike anything else CLAMP has worked on, making it hard to know exactly what their target audience was. That said, I myself did end up liking it, thanks to its good art, likable characters (especially Chi) and fantastic soundtrack.Overall:7+8+9+7.5+7.5=39/50=7.8/10 Motosuwa is a young man who lives on a farm in the country and aims to get into college, only to discover that he needs to attend a prep school beforehand due to failing. As such, he moves to Tokyo, where he soon proves himself to be a fish-out-of-water due to having never been there before. Besides getting into college, Hideki also dreams of owning a Persocom, but completely lacks the money to get one. By a sheer stroke of luck, however, he ends up finding one in the trash. He brings her home, awakens her, and ultimately names her Chi after the only thing she is initially able to say, after which the story revolves around the growing relationship between this unlikely couple, and the nature behind Chi\'s mysterious existence.The series starts off rather slow, focusing mainly on Hideki\'s interactions with the various people he meets and Chi\'s continuous growth as a person. Some of these are rather mindless, with one episode being all about getting underpants for Chi (it makes sense in context), and ultimately add very little to the overall plot. Thankfully, things start to pick up a great deal in the second half of the series, which starts delving into the backstories of various supporting characters as well as slowly uncovering the mystery behind what exactly makes Chi so special. Some of these stories are very emotional, though I definitely found myself liking some more than others.So why the not-particularly-high score? If I were to give a main reason, it\'s that I often had trouble figuring out exactly what the writers were trying to say. For a while, they seemed to be saying that technology is no substitute for interaction with real people, with several characters\' backstories aligning with this theme. Unfortunately, this ends up being undermined by the growing romance between Hideki and Chi, as while the latter is not a normal  Persocom, she is one nonetheless. Ultimately, the closest thing to a message I could piece together is that robots are neither objects nor substitutes for humans, but individuals in their own right, a message that sadly has no basis in reality. That said, while the story can have an identity crisis at times, it thankfully isn\'t as severe as some other examples, and does ultimately manage to deliver a decent conclusion.Art & Animation (8/10):""Chobits"" first aired in 2002, which at this point is nearly two decades ago. Even so, while the art is by no means amazing, it still manages to hold up well to this day, which is probably helped by the fact that the animation studio was Madhouse. All the characters are well-drawn and the animations are decent, though the characters designs can be somewhat repetitive, and not just with the Persocoms.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):The soundtrack of ""Chobits"" is best described as strange, but beautiful. It starts off rather lighthearted, especially the opening and first ending theme, but becomes oddly haunting as things start to get more serious, with the second ending theme, ""Ningyo Hime"" and ""Yasashisa no Shouzou"" being particularly standout tracks. The voice acting is fantastic, with Crispin Freeman delivering a performance as Hideki not unlike the one he gave as Kyon, albeit a much less sarcastic one, and Michelle Ruff nailing Chi\'s innocent nature and continued growth over the series. There\'s a strong supporting cast as well, including Wendee Lee, Steve Blum, Bridget Hoffman and Tony Oliver. As a whole, this category is easily the best part of the entire series.Characters (7.5/10):As a young adult who has recently moved from the countryside to the city for the first time, Hideki is very much a fish-out-of-water. This is evident by the fact that he\'s clearly not used to having people around him, to the point that he\'ll often end up saying some really embarrassing things out loud for individual people or even entire crowds to hear, and despite acknowledging he needs to stop thinking out loud, he keeps doing it regardless. This aspect of his character hit a little too close to home for me, as thinking out loud is a problem I\'ve had for as long as I can remember, and one my family constantly calls me out for. Hideki also has a very perverted mind most of the time, though it\'s never to the point where he becomes unlikable, as he refuses to take advantage of the innocent Chi and gets seriously pissed at anyone who does. Additionally, while he is rather dimwitted, especially in early episodes, he can provide some surprising emotional insight at times. All in all, while he can be very annoying at times, I nevertheless found him to be a very likable and relatable lead.Let\'s face it, though, Chi is most definitely the character who steals the show here. As mentioned above, she is initially unable to say anything except her name, and as a result has no real personality. As time goes on, however, she starts to learn more and more words, generally by Hideki teaching her. It helps that she\'s not a normal Persocom, and so doesn\'t have to have any software installed in order to learn anything, making her ideal for a working-class man like Hideki. She struggles at first, but that only adds to both her cuteness and the hilarity of the series. Eventually, she is able to speak fluently, and she even manages to get a job to help out Hideki with his struggling finances. In short, over the series, she gradually develops from a black slate to a much more human and complex being, yet doesn\'t become any less adorable because of it. Exactly what makes her such a special Persocom is also one of the driving mysteries of the series, and the second half is all the more compelling because of it.The supporting cast is quite good, though only a couple of them are relevant at any time. My favourite would probably be Chitose Hibiya, Hideki\'s landlady and a mysterious woman who always seems to know more than she\'s letting on. Her role in the story doesn\'t become apparent until the last quarter of the series, so all I can really say is that she\'s worth keeping an eye on until then, with a sweet, gentle personality to boot. Another character of note is Minoru Kokubunji, a child prodigy and expert on Persocoms with a troubled past, who becomes Hideki\'s main assistance in finding out exactly what Chi is. He also starts off viewing Persocoms as mere objects whose relationships with humans should be strictly professional, but eventually grows to see them as individuals in their own right to be loved if a person chooses to do so, making him one of the more developed characters in the series.There\'s also Hiromu Shinbo, Hideki\'s neighbour and fellow cram school student.

As the series goes along, the story gets more and more interesting and sometimes things get comical. There are also beautiful heartwarming moments. 'Chobits' has very beautiful music, songs and artwork plus has adorable charactors like Chii, Sumomo and Kotoko aswell as comical charactors like Hideki. I give 'Chobits' a 10 out of 10. "", ""I enjoyed Chobits quite a bit, and the story was quite easy to understand. Although I finished it, it was quite hard to sit through. There were to many pointless filler episodes from my point of view (since I read the manga before I watched the anime). I prefer the manga over the anime. Personally, the idea and everything else was adorable, it didn't fit my liking all that much. This anime wasn't exactly right for me, but it might be right for anyone else. "", ""This is an anime i had to write about it's a complete masterpiece this is one i'd re watch just to feel happier . Though at times this anime is a roller coaster well at least for my emotions.It's well worth the watch if you like romance or comedy or both. "", ""Chobits caught my attention very quickly once I became aware of what it was. The premise of a society where androids made to look like humans are existent and common sounded exactly like something I wanted to watch. I didn't expect a whole lot from it, but it was an acceptable enough experience.Story (5/10):The story of Chobits follows an eighteen year-old man named Hideki Motosuwa. Being from a farm, he has no real idea of what city life is like, including such things as persecoms, girls, and non-farm work. He quickly becomes fascinated by persecoms, but they're expensive enough that he can't afford one. Lucky...for him, however, he finds a discarded persecom in the trash while going home one night. The story follows his journey to teach his new persecom, whom he had named 'Chi', about the world, but soon enough delves into other topics as well.It's fairly clear after the first three or so episodes that the story isn't the major point for the first half of the series. While Chi's education remains a relevant plot point, the show otherwise goes down the episodic path, with each episode having very little to do with the last. The episodes also take a more comedic approach, usually involving Hideki's personality quirks or Chi's lack of knowledge about the world. In this case, it generally succeeds. This part of the show got a lot of laughs out of me and made the characters likable.However, the second half of the story starts getting a little more serious. A few subplots show up and get resolved, however I never got the sense that they were truly important to the show. They are set up and resolved in a satisfying way, but that's the last time they are ever mentioned again. Except for a single sentence an episode later or something similar, none of these conflicts are ever mentioned again. The characters involved never seen to change either. These conflicts are just dropped like they never even happened.The main plotline doesn't truly get going again until the last few episodes. While a lot of things were explained very well, the plot feels incomplete. There are a lot of details that are either never explained or just not explained very well.Characters (4/10):The cast of Chobits is fairly simple. There's Hideki and Chi as the main characters, but there's a healthy mix of side characters as well. Minori is a child genius with persecoms, Shinbo is Hideki's neighbor and best friend, Mr. Ueda is the owner of a bakery, Yumi is a girl around Hideki's age and a co-worker, Mrs. Shimizu is Hideki and Shinbo's caring prep school teacher, and Ms. Hibiya is Hideki's helpful landlady.The problem I have with the cast is that they're all fairly difficult to describe. I would describe most of them as caring and considerate individuals. While these are generally good traits to have, it's a bit worrisome when a lot of the characters have close to the same personality.However, I can say that the anime would not have been improved with taking any one of the supporting characters out. One of the biggest pluses about Chobits is that there is no character that feels like they don't belong. Even if their purpose is not made obvious right away, the way they are made purposeful is very well done.There is one big problem with that, though. It does feel that the characters are there for the plot, and not for the characters themselves. Like I stated above, the subplots don't feel like they truly affect the characters that are involved in it. Almost every single character felt exactly the same at end of the anime as when they were first introduced. I feel that a lot of potential was missed here, as even Hideki didn't feel like he truly grew as a result of the story until the last few minutes. Even when something big happened, he always immediately went right back to his old self as soon as the problem was finished. Chi, however, underwent a huge noticeable change over the entire series that felt entirely realistic.One last thing I can point out is that a few decisions were quite questionable and not really explained. The biggest one I never could figure out was Sumomo. Keep an eye on her and Shinbo if you end up watching this; it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what I'm talking about.Art (7/10):The art and animation were impressive. It was simple and animated pretty well; there were no real sections that I felt were low quality compared to the rest of the show. The character's expressions felt real, especially the persecoms. You could tell they were androids, but they still felt like they were human at times. The way they were portrayed was very well done. Their design and how their eyes move as they do various things within their programming in very intuitive and easy to understand.As for the environments, they showed about what they needed to even though they were somewhat bland at times. It didn't truly take away from the experience, but I felt that there could have been more to make it seem lively.Sound (8/10):Note that I have only watched the Subbed version.Chobits' sound was also pretty well done. Chi especially takes the crown for her voice acting. She became much more compelling as a character. The slight bits of emotion in her voice at various situations fits her personality splendidly, and the sound gets a high score just from that alone. For the other characters, almost all of them were done very well. The only one I didn't much care for was Sumomo, who I wish would have just stopped talking a few times.As for the sound effects, none of them truly stood out. They all fit well enough and added to the experience. The opening song was fairly catchy and the ending song worked well enough.Overall, the sound and music just worked. It wasn't perfect, but it was solid enough that nothing really detracted from the experience in any way.Enjoyment (5/10):Chobits was a mixed bag for me. The first half was a blast to watch with all the comedic elements and general interaction between the characters. The story elements, while some of them were fun to watch, overall didn't truly satisfy me. The subplots took away from the experience more than they added and the story felt mostly incomplete.The premise also confused me a liittle as well, as I expected the setting to be a little more futuristic with the addition of advanced androids. However, it feels basically the same as usual with only one particular twist. It's a fairly minor point, but it confused me enough that the experience was altered.Otherwise, I don't regret watching this. While the storyline and characters were enough of a flop that I wasn't particularly impressed, the interactions themselves and the overall style were enjoyable enough that I can't feel I wasted my time with Chobits.Overall (6/10):Chobits takes an interesting premise and develops it into an interesting storyline. While it makes a lot of small blunders, it's still enjoyable to see how persecoms and humans interact with each other on a day to day basis. The comedy elements prevalent in the first half and Chi's change as a persecom over the entire series are two fairly strong elements that I am comfortable using for a recommendation.Overall, this should be a fun watch to anyone who is interested in seeing a show about how androids can change modern society, as well as modern society changing these androids in return. While the story is not quite on par and the characters aren't particularly strong, it's still an enjoyable watch. for him, however, he finds a discarded persecom in the trash while going home one night.

I was expecting a nice. easy-watching slice of life romance which proved correct to some degree. However, what I did not expect, and was shocked to find, was a deeper story with many commentaries on life and love. The story is pretty well done with nice easy episodes usually revolving around the main Persicom (a humanoid computer system) Chi learning how to live life and her owner, Motosua dealing with the many problems that arise due to Chi's innocence...and misunderstandings. The setting is nice with a laid back, lighthearted feel for the most part, although it does get a bit ecchi from time to time. (not all that bad though not H.O.T.D. or Freezing which i do like btw, although sadly they both stop prematurely) The characters are actually one of the most interesting parts. They all start off as typical slice of life characters, the awkward main, the reliable friend, the aloof genius, etc. However, as the story progresses their past problems and personal hangups unravel revealing some pretty deep problems, such as lost loves and broken relationships. The kinda bad part is that the main character, Motosua, doesn't actually develop as much as some of the side characters do. Besides realizing his feelings for Chi his character is not honestly as deep as some of the side characters, although he is still very kind and is still a wonderful character overall. The episodes are interesting enough and all serve a purpose, even if it does not look like anything will come from it. The deepest and best thing the anime does, however, is provide insights into aspects of life and love, some of which I'd never really consider until now. The aspect of living in a dream with Persicoms while the interaction of humans slowly digresses is one such concept as well as what love truly is and even the concept of a soul of identity. The animation was decent enough for its time, but is not on par with say Bleach or One Piece, but still good enough to get the job done. The dialogue is decent although sometimes it does get grating (a certain annoying little pink Navi comes to mind) but the small situations that Chi gets into and her innocent reactions are always a treat. If I do have one hang-up, its the ending. Please don't misunderstand, it was good and everything ends up appropriately but it kinda ends abruptly and without a clear explanation of what truly happened, although it could be that it is to subtle for me to catch. However, the whole series itself covers greatly for any mishaps that may be present. Chobits is a wonderful little series that provides a good feel about life and love as well as surprisingly deep commentaries on the subjects all carried out in a wonderful story. So why not jump in and see the magic of Chobits! and misunderstandings. The setting is nice with a laid back, lighthearted feel for the most part, although it does get a bit ecchi from time to time. (not all that bad though not H.O.T.D. or Freezing which i do like btw, although sadly they both stop prematurely) The characters are actually one of the most interesting parts. They all start off as typical slice of life characters, the awkward main, the reliable friend, the aloof genius, etc. However, as the story progresses their past problems and personal hangups unravel revealing some pretty deep problems, such as lost loves and broken relationships. The kinda bad part is that the main character, Motosua, doesn't actually develop as much as some of the side characters do. Besides realizing his feelings for Chi his character is not honestly as deep as some of the side characters, although he is still very kind and is still a wonderful character overall. The episodes are interesting enough and all serve a purpose, even if it does not look like anything will come from it. The deepest and best thing the anime does, however, is provide insights into aspects of life and love, some of which I'd never really consider until now. The aspect of living in a dream with Persicoms while the interaction of humans slowly digresses is one such concept as well as what love truly is and even the concept of a soul of identity. The animation was decent enough for its time, but is not on par with say Bleach or One Piece, but still good enough to get the job done. The dialogue is decent although sometimes it does get grating (a certain annoying little pink Navi comes to mind) but the small situations that Chi gets into and her innocent reactions are always a treat. If I do have one hang-up, its the ending. Please don't misunderstand, it was good and everything ends up appropriately but it kinda ends abruptly and without a clear explanation of what truly happened, although it could be that it is to subtle for me to catch. However, the whole series itself covers greatly for any mishaps that may be present.

So why not jump in and see the magic of Chobits!"", ""I'm an anime-only viewer, and I've read that the show omitted crucial essential parts and included material not originally from the manga. Nonetheless, I still found the show entertaining, mostly thanks to the amount of fanservice and the sweet and funny moments.Chii possesses all the qualities that a man could desire - she is submissive, fiercely loyal, and maintains a youthful appearance. She also looks stunning when wearing a towel. She surprised me with the extent of her development. Initially, she only displays endearing behavior, such as imitating Hideki and acting naively at inappropriate times, which elicits sentimental reactions. However, her own will and personality...eventually began to manifest, although I was somewhat disappointed that she did not mature as much as she could have. By the end of the story, she remains a victim more than a heroine, albeit a highly sympathetic one. Hideki Motozuwa is a character who is out of place. He is a rural boy attempting to make it in the urban metropolis of Tokyo. He is shy around women, kind-hearted, and not very intelligent. Hideki is mostly a stereotypical character, with the exception of his personality, which is more complex than expected. For instance, his patience when teaching Chii, his sacrifices to provide for her, his concern for her when she is away, and his willingness to learn from her show a deep and admirable soul. Hideki's comedic moments are classic and make him easy to warm up to. The remaining characters, such as Hideki's best friend, Hiromu Shinbo; Yumi, the waitress; Minoru Kokubunji, the child expert; Mr. Ueda, the baker, and Chitose Hibiya, the landlady, all have good backstories. Their subplots are emotionally charged and make meaningful contributions to the central plot. Each character's situation is a unique variation on the same theme, providing insight into Chobits's controversy.The artwork is stunning, as expected, accurately matching the manga's style. However, it has its drawbacks, particularly with the flatness of the faces and the lack of detail in the noses when viewed head-on. The mouths are relatively petite, and there are occasional chibifide expressions, but other than that, it's relatively plain. The women's hair is, without a doubt, the most beautiful aspect of the show.The opening melody is catchy and engaging. The music at the conclusion and in the background is decent but not especially notable. The show's primary appeal is the outstanding voice acting—props to Chii's VA.It bothers me that there are recaps for a 26-episode series. It's unnecessary and ruined my pacing since I was marathoning the show.Overall, Chobits was a pleasant watch. Apart from its predictable format and flaws, it features interesting characters. There were also some genuinely heartwarming scenes, and the visuals were good. This show is recommended if you're searching for a romantic story that's mostly sweet yet sometimes melancholic. eventually began to manifest, although I was somewhat disappointed that she did not mature as much as she could have.

"", ""This show is bad.The characters are for the most part terrible. The main character, Hideki, might possibly be the most unlikeable anime protagonist i've ever seen. The plot is no better than the characters. For that matter, the plot doesn't really start until maybe 15 episodes in, the rest is just a complete waste of time, fanservice and other pointless events. And TWO ENTIRE PLOT RECAP EPISODES. Yes two recaps for a 26 episode show. The actual plot that mostly occurs in the last roughly 10 episodes feels rushed, leaving the ending unsatisfying. There are some interesting themes regarding the relationship between humans and artificial...intelligence, but they aren't fleshed out enough. Overall, don't waste your time with this show. Unless you enjoy detestable brain dead 'nice guy' main characters, personalityless women, fanservice, harem shows. Then go ahead intelligence, but they aren't fleshed out enough. Overall, don't waste your time with this show. Unless you enjoy detestable brain dead 'nice guy' main characters, personalityless women, fanservice, harem shows. Then go ahead""]"
