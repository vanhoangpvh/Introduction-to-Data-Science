Tetsujin 28-gou (2004),https://myanimelist.net/anime/2337/Tetsujin_28-gou_2004,"['Having never seen the original Tetsujin 28/Gigantor, I came into this series not really knowing what to expect. The result was one of the best mecha anime I\'ve ever seen, and I don\'t consider that an exaggeration.The story is a complex and emotionally-charged one, set immediately after the Second World War and focussing on the American occupation of Japan and its reconstruction. This is handled tastefully and without pulling punches - and although the show is heavily supernatural (drawing on Yokoyama\'s original ideas and elements of Imagawa\'s earlier Giant Robo), episodes such as ""The Melancholy of Dr Black"" and ""The Glowing Entity"" have both alternate...history elements and science fiction elements, resulting in some powerful scenes.To mention too much of the overarching plot would ruin the impact of the final arc, but one of the strengths of Tetsujin 28 is the way in which short plot arcs, one-off enemies and a series-long intrigue are all resolved in due time. Similarly, the robot itself is rarely the sole focus of an episode - for a portion of the show, it is not present and does not fight. This allows the series to focus on its characters, a varied and well-developed group from the constantly conflicted protagonists Shotaro and Dr Shikishima to even the more comic figures of Ohtsuka and Ms. Takamizawa. The enemies all have their own tragedies and intrigues, and as a result the show rarely feels like a simplistic rogues\' gallery pitted against an elite heroic group.The art style is a matter of taste - it has the big-eyed, expressive style that evokes early cartoons and animation, a far cry from Giant Robo\'s gritty and dynamic style or G Gundam\'s colourful and madcap designs. This is a strength of the series to my mind, since it really shows what it is - a child\'s eye view of terrifying and moving events. However, it will not appeal to people who prefer the heavy-lined and detailed style of 80s OVA animation.In terms of music and sound, Tetsujin also excels. The opening theme is an upbeat march that puts many super robot theme tunes to shame in its cheerfulness and heroism, and this contrasts starkly with the world the series creates. The incidental music is period-appropriate and provides a good sense of drama without being overbearing.To summarise, Tetsujin 28 is pretty much required viewing to any mecha fan. It draws on the very roots of the genre, and the mind of the great Yokoyama - mixing it with Imagawa\'s own genius. As a simple super robot remake it outdoes Shin Mazinger, but Tetsujin can be considered more than that. It\'s a show which challenges the idea of the super robot genre by setting it against a backdrop of conflicts and tragedies that no robot can easily fix. history elements and science fiction elements, resulting in some powerful scenes.To mention too much of the overarching plot would ruin the impact of the final arc, but one of the strengths of Tetsujin 28 is the way in which short plot arcs, one-off enemies and a series-long intrigue are all resolved in due time.

I’m actually quite glad the OP was so misleading, this is a great series, it’s touching, interesting, well written, and varied. This is how series remakes should be.Plot: 9The plot is divided into clear arcs, the first 5 episode arc being an 10 rating without a doubt to me. There’s only one episode I could call truly throwaway, it’s not bad per se, but just that one episode is rather cliche ridden and unecessary. The rest of the series, while never being quite as good as the first 5...episodes, are still phenomenol in their own right, they all connect to an overall tale while at the same time being interesting in their own right and most of the arcs end shockingly tragically. That’s another thing, this isn’t necessarily a kiddy show, it might be drawn that way, but it takes its audience very seriously and never babies us through or betrays us. I think a few points were a bit made up at times, but when everything else is written this good, just run with it and enjoy yourself. It’s the type of series that will make you think during it when you’re done while never detracting from the entertainment value.Characters: 8Characters aren’t quite as strong, but each contribute to whatever situation they’re in very well. Shotaro Kaneda isn’t exactly convincing as your average 10 year old, but he’s still interesting and well developed as he comes to terms with his feelings about the whole situation involving Tetsujin. The best character is probably Kenji Murasame, who looks exactly like his Giant Robo incarnation does except without a French accent. His problems with Tetsujin are a lot different when compared to Shotaro’s and watching Kenji learn if people can be trusted in certain situations is great. Everyone else is well enough and a lot of the story arc characters are actually very interesting, but Kenji and Shotari own the stage here.Presentation: 8The soundtrack is the first thing I want to mention, it’s really really good, the OP and ED are both old school sounding classic type epic good and the rest just fits so well. The ED is my personal favorite piece without a doubt, it fits the series like a glove as does the rest of the soundtrack. Now, animation and art on the other hand? It’s all solid, but nothing spectacular and is clearly went for a distinctive old-school type look that some series still go for nowadays.Overall: 9The story is such an emotional and deep powerhouse here that I can’t help but give it a 9. The good characters are really good and the not as great ones still help out. Pardoning a single worthless episode, the story is just a masterpiece unto itself, it more than makes this series worth watching, multiple times even. It’s not at all a kiddy series once you’ve gotten past the character designs and the story will prove it to you by being dark and thought provoking. episodes, are still phenomenol in their own right, they all connect to an overall tale while at the same time being interesting in their own right and most of the arcs end shockingly tragically.

It also refers to other works directed by Imagawa.Built to contribute to the Pacific War effort but only completed after the Japanese surrender, the titular robot in Tetsujin 28-go (2004) was left on an island, abandoned now that it was without purpose. Ten years later it is resurrected, but what place does it have in this new era of peace for Japan? More than just a plot device or action scene prop, the nature of the mecha itself is examined in this series: its reason for...existence (or lack thereof), especially as a metaphor for real world technology, and its relationship with both its controller and society. This and much more is explored in this adaptation of Mitsuteru Yokoyama\'s 1950s manga by renowned director Yasuhiro Imagawa.I will be honest: coming into Imagawa\'s Tetsujin adaptation as the last of his mecha projects I viewed, my expectations were mixed. Though I had read some praise for it, it\'s also his least popular mecha series in the west by a decent margin. Can that be explained by the mere fact that Tetsujin 28-go\'s following is almost non-existent? Possibly. Lacking both the popularity of a franchise like Gundam or Mazinger Z, or the high budget epic allure of Giant Robo, that Tetsujin 28-go would slip through the cracks into obscurity is understandable. Nevertheless I thought that if it were truly great it would at least have a little more recognition. That seems to have been a mistake: this is certainly one of the finest mecha anime ever made, and debatably Imagawa\'s best work.It\'s ""debatably"" mostly because I\'ll be the first to defend Giant Robo\'s greatness if it\'s brought into question, but also because if you are familiar with his works, he implements variety while sticking to common elements, making comparing them in the first place a bit of a pointless exercise. Giant Robo, G Gundam, and Shin Mazinger Z may all be mecha series with various stylistic intersections like martial arts but their goals, tone, scale, and more differ wildly from each other. The same is true for Tetsujin 28-go, which I\'m inclined to say separates itself the furthest from any of the previous mentioned. Like the other mecha projects he wrote in addition to directing (all of them except for G Gundam), Imagawa is extremely ambitious here. It\'s not the ambition that led to the seamless blending of characters from multiple works into one bold epic narrative as with Giant Robo, nor the reminagining that centers events around a secondary antagonist from the source while attempting to cram as many plot twists as humanly possible into the story as with Shin Mazinger Z. What Imagawa is going for in Tetsujin 28-go, and I\'m glad to say that he succeeds magnificently, is thematic focus. There are specific ideas here which he wants to explore, and does so extremely effectively. Though I can\'t say how much of it is taken directly from Yokoyama, having not read the manga (which isn\'t available in English at the moment), the auteurist aspects of the direction still solidify this adaptation as Imagawa\'s through and through.There\'s a solid cast of characters here, but two of them deserve the most attention for their importance both narratively and thematically: Shotaro Kaneda, the boy detective and our protagonist who finds himself in charge of operating Tetsujin No. 28, and Kenji Murasame, the ex-intelligence officer.Shotaro is born at the end of the war and, with no parents to guide him, must decide his own morals in this new ""peaceful"" post-occupation era. Fortunately for him, he has some help in the form of Police Chief Otsuka and Professor Shikishima. Kenji, meanwhile, has lived through it, lost friends and family, and during his experience developed a deep disdain for any and all weapons of war. Tetsujin is no exception, and early on his driving motivation is to destroy or otherwise rid Japan of it. But the story has other plans, and the same events that become instrumental to developing Shotaro\'s values simultaneously test Kenji\'s: the post-war era as experienced by both the youngest generation and its predecessor.The series grounds its plot in real historical context, referencing events such as the Mitaka and Matsukawa trail derailment incidents of 1949, the space race, the Ueno zoo animal euthanizations, and of course the war itself. A recurring element of the series is that many of the antagonists Shotaro faces are normal people transformed by their involvement in these events: circumstances forced them to do bad and their lives were irreversibly changed as a result, and they find themselves incompatible with the new era defined by optimism and progress; emblematic of the maturity of the work is the fact that while it may take pity on them, the series never excuses their actions. The past in Tetsujin 28-go has an unavoidable influence on the present, whether it be good or bad, and through the eyes of Shotaro we learn about the nature of the society Yokoyama would have been experiencing firsthand and writing about - notions present on the role of technology and foreign influences in Japan at the time, as well as its place in the world post-war perhaps reflect real anxieties that were in the public consciousness - and we witness too the effects it has on our protagonist.Despite the giant robots this is very much a noir series tonally, and in typical detective noir fashion there are revelations when it becomes clear that the nature of the situations Shotaro faces are more complex than first anticipated, and/or previously unknown information comes to light. These are handled with ample amounts of foreshadowing so while the reveals may be surprising they never come across as unjustified or out of left field. I said I don\'t like to draw comparisons but when it comes to this I can\'t help but comment on (and praise) the level of restraint here compared to the later Shin Mazinger Z.The animation is never spectacular, but Imagawa\'s talent for shot composition is on full display here and with excellent background artists supporting him the series is always visually captivating (here is an album containing a few shots from the first episode, plus others from throughout the series that don\'t spoil anything: https://imgur.com/a/usbqxPi). The setting of 1950s Japan, rarely utilized in anime, provides the opportunity for equally unique locations: the industrial docks and factories, the tram-laden streets of Tokyo, the lower class settlements. Simplistic character designs faithful to the original manga as well as the use of the same opening theme from the 1963 anime give it a retro feel. Being an early digital series it\'s unfortunately stuck in standard resolution, but this is not a complaint I can hold against it.The score is effective and well suited to the noir tone of the series, adding tension to scenes when needed and enhancing dramatic moments, with a few memorable recurring tracks. Supposedly David Bowie\'s song ""Space Oddity"" played during a certain scene in episode 11 during the anime\'s television broadcast but it was replaced on the home media releases, and that version isn\'t available to view anywhere. What a shame.Without spoiling, the ending of the series provides a satisfying and extremely memorable conclusion to the themes it\'s been pondering since the first episode, as well as completing Shotaro\'s coming of age. This is one that will likely stick with the viewer for a good while after finishing, but then, I could say that about the series as a whole. existence (or lack thereof), especially as a metaphor for real world technology, and its relationship with both its controller and society.

Tetsujin is undoubtedly one of the best wicks I have ever seen and not to mention that he is the father of wicks.In addition to the references about the WWll / Cold War, I find it quite interesting that the fact that they explored the topic ""artificial intelligence"" made the story even more interesting.The first part brings us very simple arcs, but the general...work is directed to larger arcs that are explored in much more detail in the second half. As stated earlier, the series is very similar to the film noir - with Shotaro playing the role of the private detective character. The second half of the anime is sensational, the plots are very well written and the way in which they are clarified is very good. Tetsujin\'s most important point is undoubtedly the cast, which is very good, the characters are charismatic and make the viewer more captivated to carefully follow every detail that the anime proposes. The soundtrack composed by Akira Senju is sensational!Animation: Well, I\'m not that demanding when it comes to animation, but I think the most important thing about how the story is executed and Tetsujin\'s is perfect. Director Yasuhiro Imagawa\'s work is impeccable, even without watching the old series it is clear to see how he manages to keep all the essence of the 1963 series.I literally recommend and I think all mecha lovers should take a look at this masterpiece called Tetsujin 28! work is directed to larger arcs that are explored in much more detail in the second half.

Taking place in the 1950s, it draws heavily from the two most famous arcs in the manga to tell its own original story. Like the manga, its one-part mecha story and one part hardboiled detective story. One thing that this adaption adds is emotional depth. Shotarou seems more vulnerable, more flawed, and more human here. The story as a whole is more emotional, with more focus being on the characters compared to the action, and with the characters personal motivations and backstories playing a larger role than usual. Many of the episodes are genuine tearjerkers....The mystery element is also played up, with plenty of twists in the second half of the show. The atmosphere of post-war Japan is played up in this adaption. The atmosphere of a Japan which is rapidly recovering from the war and rapidly changing is central to the story. Change is a major theme, with the old Japan slowly being replaced by the new. And much of the conflict in the story comes from relics of the war which must be discarded in order for the nation to move on, whether those relics be people who refuse to or wartime superweapons which ought to be destroyed.

The Third: Aoi Hitomi no Shoujo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/944/The_Third__Aoi_Hitomi_no_Shoujo,"[""Story: In a world where a being known as The Third rule the land, we have our heroine, Hanoka. Hanoka, as a Jack-of-all-Trades travels the desert land with her tank doing various jobs. Somewhere along the way, she meets a mysterious man named Ikus. We then get to see their travels together and the interaction with the people they meet along with The Third. During the travels we start to learn more about Hanoka and many of the other people they meet and the mystery behind Ikus starts to unravel.Fairly simple concept, but the story telling is well done. It is as if you were...reading a book. What I like about the story is the interaction between the characters. You get to learn much more about the world through the interaction between the characters. Furthermore, while some people might not like it, we have this narrator that narrates the thoughts of the characters and explains the situations at hand. The narration allows you to learn more about each character and how they fell and why they act like the way they do.Animation: I had a lot of mix feeling when deciding whether to give animation a 7 or 8. Overall, the animation was solid and there was a lot of detail. However, there were a few episodes that took a huge nose dive in the animation. Apparently it was because some other group of people worked on the animation for those episodes, but it was too big of change. It really stopped the nice flow that the anime had and at times I felt really disgusted. Think Yoake Mae Yori Ruri Iro Na bad for those who have watched or heard about it. The reason I gave it an 8  however, was because of the awesome use of colors and fighting sequences. I was in awe watching some of the fights.Sound: This is probably the weakest aspect of the anime with the exception of the few bad animation episodes. I really didn't get attached to any of the songs. After the first few episodes I would just skip the op and ed songs. While I wasn't to fond of the songs, I thought the BGM was well done. It really made the anime more exciting.Character: Would it be enough if I said that Hanoka was also the most badass sword-wielding heroine of 2006 and that the tank talked? This anime has a really interesting cast of characters. Not one person seemed to be normal, but thats a good thing. I loved diving into each character and learn more about them. Each character is just very unique.Overall: It was a very good anime. The interesting cast of characters and the great story-telling made it a very fun ride. reading a book.

And while I really don't want to say anything as corny as “It is a visual testament to the trials and endurance of the human spirit” It kinda really is just that. On the surface this may look like a regular shounen anime with swords, guns, and mecha granted the gift of speech by means of A.I., but really this show deals with some heavy hitting topics like: depression, rejection, abandonment and loneliness. That's what makes this anime so great, because it has layers like an onion, where you can enjoy the action, comedy,...the art and mecha or you can look for some deeper meanings like the shows underlying theme of overcoming negativity, sadness and times of self-doubt.~ Art Style ~The art for this show is phenomenal [for the most part]. I love the art style and theme very much! I'm a fan of artworks that depict a lot of nature and natural scenery and with this series you get to see a lot of desert. And I don't mean just boring static hills of grainy yellow sand,no...this art is very organic, it's very alive and in constant motion and there is a soft, flowing and again, poetic aesthetic to it. This is a show that offers a perfect example of what CGI should be used for in anime! Whenever they show a flock of birds in flight or a herd of “Sand Dragons” in motion it can't help but evoke some sort of emotion from you. It seems almost kind of spiritual to see such grace and fluidity in their motions....even the way the clouds are drawn and the way the grains of sand flutter as the wind blows touches you in some 'spiritual' way, at least for me it did. Also the mecha battle scenes were “OUTTA SIGHT” if nothing else you HAVE to see episode 22's battle scene between TANK VS AIRPLANE, that was probably the most memorable mecha battle I've seen to date. One piece of warning though is that the art styles seem to fluctuate a bit throughout the series.~ Audio ~I watched this dubbed and I am not familiar with anyone from this voice cast.  However I still enjoyed this English dubbed version, I think everyone did a good job, everyone's voice fit their characters' appearance perfectly. So I would recommend watching this in the English dub version [unless of course you hate dubs all-together, then feel free to watch the subbed version] However I did watched the subbed version and I was more entertained by the English dub.~ Story ~This show doesn't seem to have that very definitive overall plot that you'd find in most shounen anime [i.e. the underdog/under-achiever who's only dream is to get stronger and kick everyone's ass and then proceeds to do so with each battle getting much grander and wilder and each opponent bragging about how much stronger he was than the last guy who got his ass beat up]. No, the Third is really not about that at all, even though there are some very awesome battle scenes, this is a bit deeper than that but you can still enjoy it on that basic level of Honoka [the main character] and her sidekick talking tank, Bogie, go on these odd-jobs like transporting or hunting for stuff, serving as an escort/protector, rescuing kidnapped people and such....and while on the job she shoots and blows up enemy soldier robots set up by the Third [which are humanoids with a 3rd eye in their foreheads]. You can watch the anime for this reason and still be entertained too.~ Cast/Characters ~If you have a defective brain like I do, then the smaller the cast the better for you to remember them. Plus also with a small cast you get to spend more time with them and get a better understanding as they develop. And with having a narrator present throughout the show, this was even further achieved. All of the characters were likable and if they were not likable then they were either misunderstood or you wind up having sympathy for them. But I definitely like the main characters like Honoka, The Tank/Bogie, Iks and The Teacher because I liked the way they all related and interacted with each other...actually I like all of the characters because of this reason. It was less about shooting and blowing each other up and more about relating and sharing and depending on each other, which makes me wonder if this could really be considered a shounen anime.~ Verdict ~You have to love a show that starts out with a poem. That let's you know right then and there you are in for some deep sh--. I would recommend this show to just about anyone unless they just rather not deal with emo-crap and would rather watch regular shoot-em-up, blow-em-up anime then you can STILL watch this anime, LOL. But really if you are in the mood to be enlightened or feel emotionally connected and find a deeper meaning then you should definitely watch this. the art and mecha or you can look for some deeper meanings like the shows underlying theme of overcoming negativity, sadness and times of self-doubt.~ Art Style ~The art for this show is phenomenal [for the most part].

She will accept any job except human murder. The Third is a race of humans, with a third eye on their forehead, allowing them to interact with machines and turn into semi-computers with huge data-processing abilities. Honoka is accompanied by Bogie, a tank with a bio-brain, or an artificial personality if you want. This is the gist of the plot of The Third (Refered henceforth as...T3rd.).I started watching it, after seeing its cover which seems quite interesting. A katana-wielding girl, followed by a super-armed tank. Quite nice. However, it was quite a deception for me. Maybe I set my standards too high, but I didn\'t find it too interesting. Animation is kind of strange. Sound was ok. Plotline was quite inconsistent. Characters lacked development. And there was not much value. However, it does make a great watch because there are lots of action scenes. To maintain a balance, I will grant it a 7/10.But a word of advice, keep off if you have got better things to watch...- [ Animation = 7 ] -To tell you the truth, I was going to give T3rd a 5/10 or a 6/10 for animation. But considering that it has a fair amount of CGI, i gave it 7/10. Mind you, the CGI is not that great, but it is satisfactory. It truly cannot compare to the likes of Appleseed, but it does give another touch to the animation.Personally, I didn\'t find T3d\'s animation great. The characters are bizarre and not very life-like. Sometimes, they seem to have chibi-like expressions (eg. a simple curved line for a smile). Lower eye-lids are curved upwards and things like that. I could call it traditional animation style.. but here, it\'s more unnatural animation style.However, the action scenes were well done. Fast paced with enough details to make it fun. Otherwise, there is not much scenery. Most of the time, you will see lots and lots of deserts. Yes, deserts, with sand and all. It becomes quite a boring scenery after a while. On the rare occasions you will see cities, they are quite well-done. Overall, there are not much scenes to look at. The CGI does make The Third (the race)\'s vechicles quite good to look at. But even then, the vehicles are not very realistic, nor very pretty or cutting-edge. Even Bogie, the tank that follows Honoka everywhere is quite disproportionate if you ask me. It\'s so very big but we never saw why it was that big! Even The Third\'s vehicles, supposedly highly advanced, are quite undermined. We never get to see much, apart from the blank white interiors. The same applies for their buildings. What I mean to say, don\'t expect lots from the animation, drawings or CGI. It\'s there and it does its job. Nothing more.- [ Sound = 7 ] -As always, sound does not get my attention. In T3rd, it was satisfactory. The action scenes used fast-paced music, and the OP and ED were ok. However, the music variety is kind of limited, if you ask me. Most of the time, you get to hear the same music, over and over. And sometimes, I really believed that I was listening to a loop.I found some solace in the voice actors\' performance which was great. At least, they did their work well, and did well at relaying the various emotions. Even the robotic voices were good.Nothing more to say here.. Except, don\'t expect to find much music here. The OST is not as diverse as Eureka Seven\'s or even Samurai Champloo\'s.- [ Story = 5 ] -Lemme say it here, fair and square: The Third\'s story was bad! I\'ve never seen something so inconsistent and lacking details! The last episode was really really bad! It seems the producers wanted to compress a whole arc inside one episdode! It was really a poor job!Now let me start the real ranting! The story really lacked details. We are not told anything about how The Third race came to Earth. Coming with another character, Iksu, we are not told how or why he came here. We are not told about any of the characters\' pasts, except for Honoka. We do not know why Honoka came in possession of such a huge tank such as Bogie. Ok, we know that Zankan gave it to her. But how the hell did she pay for that? No answer. The other characters seriously lack depth. They are here like puppets, just doing what they want. And sometimes, they look real stupid.But the thing that really got on my nerves is the voice that tells us the story. Or if you want, it elaborates on the scenes! Damn! I really hated that voice. I think I\'m big enough to watch a movie, and understand what\'s happening without having somebody telling me everything. ""Honoka did that, then that happened, then this, then that, then it became really annoying to hear me everytime!"". I really really hated that. If they wanted to give more details about the series, they should have included in the characters\' dialogues, or even the scenes. But using a voice to elaborate on the story is really poor.Another annoying thing. The things that happen in T3rd are really insane. Sometimes, the powers of a character (yes, one) are really really godlike. You\'ve seen Bleach. It\'s even worse! One example? Conquering an army of mechas, with more than 100,000 units, mechas, tanks and everything, with the single swipe of a katana! Now, this was insane! The other people are just there to see, and mind you, nobody is amazed! What kind of world is that! A single swipe! :sTalking about exaggerations.. Things happen way too easily in T3rd! It\'s as if everything is doomed to go well and have a happy ending.. I can\'t say more without spoiling though. You will notice it by yourself. Most of the time, one of the characters (usually Honoka) wants something, and miraculously, it happens after some time and scenes! :DTo finish burying T3d\'s plotline completely, there is *no* plotline. The story is really really jumpy. At one time, the characters are doing that, then the next, they are doing this, with no logical link with the past arc. At episode 22, I really thought that T3rd\'s semblance of a plot was ending, and that we\'ll get to get a good finisher at the characters, polishing things afterwards in 2 episodes. That would be great. How much I was mistaken!!The producers truly compressed the content of a whole arc in 1 episode! There was so much to see that you can easily get lost. Don\'t even try to understand what\'s happening. It\'s so Evangelion style! And what\'s really disgusting is that the arc seems really out of place. Really really badly done. That last episode really grossed me out. And mind you! Even in the credits, they were still trying to explain things! They even wanted to create a mini-episode out of the credits (involving romance)! Now, that\'s what I can call compression! :D- [ Characters = 6 ] -I think I don\'t have to say much here. The main character hogs all the action. The secondary characters just sit there and see. That\'s what you call monopolizing the scene. Honoka here, Honoka there, Honoka does this, Honoka does that. OMG! Is she omnipresent and omnipotent?No character development. We are given very few details about the characters. Take for example, Paifu. We are not told much about her past. Just like her, every character is introduced quickly. Call it, introducing them just to get them up and running just to get on with the series. Really, there was no great elaborations. Just like we are not told why Honoka\'s grandfather was so great of a sword wielder.Now, another thing to hate is the way characters seem to come and vanish. One example is the sporadic appearance of Blue Breaker. It seems the producers tend to forget the characters existed. Again, coming to that 100,000 mecha army, Blue Breaker was nowhere to be seen! And he (it) was supposed to be really really powerful. Where the hell was it? Don\'t know. Perhaps drinking tea somewhere. Oh yeah, it\'s worth noting that Blue Breaker reminds me of the mechas of Gundam Seed Destiny. At least his way of fighting does! :DSimilarly, Joey appeared in the previous-to-last episode, ranting about Technos Taboo. Then, Honoka went single-handedly to challenge the Third for Joey\'s sake. Then? Joey vanished! We are not told what happened! Perhaps an after-effect of compressing a whole arc in one episode!- [ Value and Enjoyment = 7 ] -Frankly, I was annoyed at T3rd\'s defects. So I was not really enjoying it. I really enjoyed the first 10 or so episodes, afterwards, it got really bad. Perhaps a lack of budget?But it does contain some things that are worth a watch. The action scenes are an example. The sword actions, and teamwork were good and deserve a watch. The CGI too deserved a watch.I\'d say it has a rewatch value if you want to understand things better (or at least try to understand). But even then, I think I would skip that last episode!Personally, this much is all I\'ve got to say. If you want to give it a try, go ahead. I don\'t know, maybe you might enjoy it better than I did.- [ Conclusion ] -The truth is, I didn\'t enjoy T3rd on my first watch. I may give it a rewatch, just to see if it\'s worth it. If so, I might consider amending my review. The first 10-15 episodes were fully worth my time. The action were good. And the power of the main character was not that insane. It was pretty well balanced, and characters didn\'t disappear for nothing. That\'s up till the series went off-track.Overall, it\'s not that good. You can watch it if you don\'t have anything better to watch. Or if you are really curious. Or if you\'ve got lots of time and a great internet connection or a good supply of finance.In my opinion, it was not that great. There are better things out there to watch.Sadly, I really had high hopes for the series after seeing the first 10 to 15 episodes. I still have. Maybe it was me. So I\'ll have to go for a rewatch just to see. If anything changes, amend this review... specially after reading that Faust721 found the story fun and interesting...That\'s all. Thanks for reading.

Thanks for reading.', 'When first viewing The Third, I believe I was going into the anime with the wrong attitude. I was thinking that this anime was going to mediocre and bland. I was wrong; what we have here is a anime with great development of characters and a story that ties together throughout the series.The synopsis is given at the top of the page for this anime but I\'ll give a version for you.Earth; years after a war that nearly destroyed all of the humans is now a barren desert. In this desert, Honoka can be found reciting poems by her favorite Poet, ""Dana Myfree."" Honoka is...the ""jack-of-all-trades"" known throughout the land as ""Sword Dancer."" She does jobs for people of cities. Whether it\'s moving stock around town or taking out Stigma Ants in the desert. During one of those jobs, she finds a man in the desert named Iks. After being saved by Honoka, he wishes to accompany her on all of her travels to begin an observation of the The Third controlled Earth.The series is accompanied by a narrator. Which to me, was a welcomed idea. The narration helped explain parts of the story and the emotions of the characters. With the emotions, the narrator goes even deeper into the minds of the characters making you feel ""one"" with the character. This made for some great character development in the story, I felt as if I knew what the characters would do in any situation.The art of the series is great, but nothing that really jumped out at me. Great animation for fights and any other kind of scene. Some episodes we\'re disappointing due to a change of animation and art. It was done by another group as far as I know and it\'s extremely noticeable. Despite the lack of art and animation in about two or three episodes, the rest is superb. The lighting and colors during some scenes really set a mood in some of the story making it some great eye candy.The OP is pretty tasteless. I usually enjoy watching the OPs of all animes because it\'s there to set a tone. The OP does a good job setting the tone but was just seemed long and boring. The EDs I did enjoy, I\'ll throw that in. The BGM was nothing memorable or remarkable; it helps to set a mood for the scenes and does a good job fitting any situation. The OP is played as BGM during some episodes, which is welcomed then.The characters in this show almost make everything. The narration helps you get more in depth with each character. Honoka is a fierce yet humble swordsman but is a spriteful young girl around characters she\'s comfortable with. Not to mention that Honoka is probably one of the most powerful swordsman I have seen in a while. With Honoka there are plenty of other well-developed characters in the story.In conclusion, this anime seems bumpy at first with four different story arcs in the range of 24 episodes. But if you feel down, you have to keep watching until the end where everything is tied up and leaves a brilliant smile on your face. the ""jack-of-all-trades"" known throughout the land as ""Sword Dancer.""

But if you feel down, you have to keep watching until the end where everything is tied up and leaves a brilliant smile on your face.', ""Well, that's the first anime that motivated me to write a fairly negative review.I may be a bit biased, because I was really expecting it to be more interesting, mainly because one of my favorite books is about a guy who drives around the desert in a tank...In any case, here's my $ 0.02Story:Girl drives around in the desert in a tank...That pretty much sums it up.The anime is divided in several substories, each lasting 2-3 episodes.Unfortunately, none of them managed to grab my attention.What annoyed me the most was the one before the last: girl goes in the middle of nowhere,...accompanied by her worst enemy, to rescue a guy who does not need rescuing and fight a woman that doesn't want to fight her... Plausibility was thrown right out the window ( example, last episode's 'battle scene') It think that the idea was that the show was supposed to be more character driven, rather than plot driven, which brings us to theCharacters:That's the weakest point of the series.You are unlikely to dislike them.Most probably you just won't care about them.And why should you?

I say mostly because, inexplicably, there is one episode and one episode only that has a completely different art style, was clearly drawn by different people and just flat out looks terrible. That difference, which was extremely and immediately noticeable for me, was perhaps my single least favorite part of the entire show. I assume...there was some unplanned problem at the studio and they had to really scramble and rush to meet a deadline or make a change or whatever, but this is just inexcusable. That rant aside, other than that episode, the show was artistically beautiful and I really mean that.Sound-The quality of the voice acting here is wildly underrated. I thought it was very, very good overall. There are solid performances all around and not a single bad one and the lead, Honoka, particularly stands out as being performed at a very high level. I don't see how one could objectively view this aspect of the show as less than a 9.The soundtrack here is GORGEOUS! This has to be one of the top three to five most underrated anime soundtracks of all time. It's super hard to find this soundtrack- as of this writing it isn't on YouTube and a generic Google search doesn't get you very far- but if you can get your hands on it, or if you just listen to it in the show itself, you'll be blown away. It's absurdly pretty and atmospheric and is a massive part of the season the show has such an unbelievable sense of beauty, mystery and adventure. 10/10 soundtrack as far as this viewer is concerned.Characters-This is where the show has its biggest high and low points. I found the first third of the show to be absolutely mind-blowing. Easy 10/10. But then after that something just kind of changed... I don't know if they added in filler arcs (it certainly felt that way)/they needed to extend the story to meet a certain number of episodes or if their larger vision got a little too big for their britches, but the show goes from a mystical, deeply poetic and philosophical adventure in a gorgeous and enchanting land to, well... just not. Granted, the two arcs that I perceive as filler were both OKAY (though possibly a bit too drawn out) but they just didn't feel the same as the initial premise.Also, the show gets far less believable as time goes on. At first the lead is special, which is fine, but still vulnerable and not guaranteed to win. By the end of the show she's simply invulnerable, all-powerful and can defeat anyone and anything without breaking a sweat, which I found really lame and disappointing.Overall-While this show is undeniably beautiful and underappreciated, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment with what could have been had they simply stayed the course of the initial third of the show as opposed to taking it the direction they chose to take it. It got more silly, less believable and less philosophical/poetic as time went on and I wish it hadn't deviated from those things.+Visually gorgeous minus one hideous episode+AMAZING soundtrack+Exceptionally beautiful if not outright mystical premise/initial journey-Show gets less believable and less realistic as time goes on-One episode is randomly very ugly and terribly animated-Quality is not consistent throughoutOBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8 there was some unplanned problem at the studio and they had to really scramble and rush to meet a deadline or make a change or whatever, but this is just inexcusable.

But this particular anime was good enough that the viewer can figure this stuff out. Worse, the narration is not merely too much, it often says things that actually contrast with the feelings of the characters, perceived by this viewer.

Each arc explores the young heroine either coming to grips with tasks that challenge the moral resolve of her character or encountering foes with their own tragic developments that Honoka comes to empathize with via her third eye\'s ability to sense the emotions of others. The series does present enough details on many of its prominent characters for you to connect with their problems from female lead Honoka\'s...tragic past as an outcast to her young friend Millie dealing with the death of her grandfather. In addition, the series explores Honoka\'s interactions with beings that wouldn\'t normally be perceived by others to have sentience, in particular robots, AIs and animals. This plays a major role in shaping Honoka\'s perceptions of the world around her, especially as this growth in her character is increasingly emphasized in later plot arcs of the series.While not the prominent focus of the series, The Girl with the Blue Eye does also do some fleshing out of prominent elements to the world of its series, particularly the Technos Taboo. Being the means of which the Third enforces limitations on how much technology man is allowed to use, the series does look into some of the technologies that nearly led to humanity\'s extinction and why the Technos Taboo is strictly enforced out of fear by the Third that too much reliance on it would lead humanity to another global conflict. Yet despite technology being potentially used to destroy humanity, there is also emphasis on the technology having its benefits to aid humanity and learning of ways to improve it for man\'s convenience. This allows the subject concerning man\'s reliance on technology to be explored in both positive and negative lights from the perspectives of humanity and the Third.In terms of visuals, Girl With the Blue Eye\'s presentation is decent sporting a bright color palette with a good amount of visual detail emphasized through scenery. The show often goes to great lengths in showing off landscape scenes with gorgeous shots of scenes such as stargazing and mysterious phenomena. It also does some slick-looking CG renderings of vehicle and mecha designs, particularly Bogie\'s sand tank and the Blue Breaker mech. Moments of animation tend to be mixed at points. Some scenes feature still shots and apparent shortcuts which are shown in some of Honoka\'s sword battles. Others feature fluid and great-looking battle sequences, particularly when said vehicles and mecha get into the action.This show does carry some major flaws for me. The biggest of these flaws I found was the show\'s narrator. Rather than trust viewers to come to their own conclusions over how characters feel in tense situations, the narrator has the annoying habit of expressing these details when they were clear as day to the viewer, making him more intrusive than reliable in detailing on elements of the show\'s story. There are some prominent elements and characters within the series that lack a decent amount of depth, particularly the Third and Iks. In addition while the final arc of the series does shed some more light as to why the Third enforce the Technos Taboo, the pacing and developments to it looked fairly rushed compared to the earlier arcs within the series.Despite some major flaws, The Third: Girl with the Blue Eye was a solid action-drama exploring the growth of Honoka\'s character through her various adventures and focusing on elements of human morality in regards to technology and finding sentience within anything not physically and mentally human in nature. tragic past as an outcast to her young friend Millie dealing with the death of her grandfather.

It looked pretty interesting at first, but instead it did the exact opposite of interesting me and put me to sleep.Story - 4The story was honestly pretty interesting at first. You have this girl Honoka who travels around a desert in some kind of tank. She meets a bunch of people along this journey and also happens to possess a third eye. Only problem is that the story goes absolutely nowhere for what is probably half of the series.Almost every episode is some boring dialogue nobody wants to hear, or a basic fight with no build up or hype.I...would’ve enjoyed this show if it weren’t for the uninteresting and repetitive dialogue for about half of the series, if it weren’t for that I could’ve actually had a fun time watching this.It actually then picks up the pace near the end but delivers a pretty boring and forgettable experience at most.Art - 5The art and animation were alright for 2006. Just really bland though. They didn’t really do much to make the show look that good.They did an alright job on the actual animation. But did nothing to make the show look visually appealing with lighting, backgrounds or anything.It has a boring and generic art style with not much character at all in the art.This show would also have the tendency to add some ugly looking CG and some stock photo looking images as the sky in some parts. Overall though, it has really bland and lazy art but not ugly by any means.Sound - 6The sound in this show was good, just forgettable.The opening and ending were a tad bit good but definitely forgettable and not the kind of song you would listen to on repeat. The voice acting was good and they did a good job at fulfilling their roles.Now the background music on the other hand was as bland as the show. Sometimes there would even be none. Paired with the boring, bland feel of the show and it would be extremely boring to watch and get through.Character - 3The characters were definitely the worst part of the show. That really sounds harsh but they’re some of the most cardboard cutout characters I've ever seen in an anime.They all provided some of the most boring dialogue. And it was hard to care for most characters when they would barely do anything interesting. They all seem to do the same things over and over again until it’s dry. You never see much character development in this show even when they try to develop them.They’ll always be dry characters and I did not feel any attachment to them whatsoever.Enjoyment - 3It’s safe to say I did not enjoy this series that much. It has bland uninteresting dialogue for most of the time you are watching the show. Generic fights with absolutely nothing special about any of them. No buildup to anything, no enjoyment for half of the series and characters drier than the desert they journey through.I know some people could enjoy this show if you can handle repetitive actions and dialogue.

After about six episodes I decided to binge it because I found it boring but my completionist spirit wouldn't allow me to drop it.  After 12, I realized it was a full series and decided to soldier on.  At this point I was hovering around a 5 or 6/10.  The story telling seemed bland and uninspired, the action scenes seemed well done but were few and far between.  The constant exposition and narration I found very annoying and detracting from what became a very enjoyable post-apocalyptic tale.  By episode 20...I was considering bumping up to 7 because everything felt like it was hitting in the sweet spot at that point.  I playfully mused that I would bump it to an 8 if it knocked the ending out of the park and lo and behold, it totally did.  Don't often see that:  A relatively disappointing and mediocre anime turning the tables in the last arc.  Disclaimer, I feel personally connected to the overall message of the show (SPOILER): losing faith in humanity yet still being in awe of life.  And this was extremely well presented in the finale of the show.  The first half of the series only vaguely represents this and honestly seems pretty mundane and poorly executed (though there are exceptions, the humor hits pretty good at times, the animation is pretty good, and the action scenes are often great, though not enough to make the show interesting until the second half.)  This show really brought its A game in the final stretch, enough that I felt compelled to write a review of it.  If anime is your life support in a disappointing reality brought on by human shortcomings as it is for me, I recommend this show.  The dreary first half keeps me from rating this show higher than an 8 but dang it finished like it had a purpose, in a way that few shows do.

The Animatrix,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1303/The_Animatrix,"[""Anthologies of animated shorts based on Western properties have become something a big deal.  In the past two years we've seen both Batman and Halo get this treatment, as well as the videogame Dante's Inferno.  However, the Animatrix is still the gold standard of such works, even going so far as to outshine some of its source material.The secret for the Animatrix's success is the talent that was poured into it.  Some of the creative minds that worked on it include Mahiro Maeda (Gankutsuou), Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), and Shinichirō Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop), in addition to some up-and-coming talents as well.While the...Matrix sequels devolved into mysticism and spectacle, the different pieces of the Animatrix give us new spins on the ideas that first made this world so compelling.  Each segment gives us something completely different while still remaining true to the thematic elements of reality and identity that are at the heart of the Matrix.  And these differing visions are captured in a kaleidoscope of visual styles, making the experience an enriching one for the brain and the eyes.Of course, in an anthology work such as this, everyone will be drawn to different parts.  I certainly have my favorites, but I found that each segment had some to offer - with one exception.  The first segment, The Final Flight of Osiris, made by Square (who you might know from Final Fantasy:Advent Children), features remarkably realistic CG but has such a poor story that any sense of wonder is lost, and the overall effect is rather one of boredom.  Fortunately, this misstep is quickly forgotten as it is eclipsed by the equally pretty and much more interesting works that follow it.

It wouldn&#039;t be able to really stand well on its own because there&#039;s not enough substance. However, in tandem with the rest of the shorts, I think it gives an interesting view into how the Matrix affects &quot;normal&quot; people&#039;s lives. It displays the extent of the Agents&#039; and Machines&#039; control over even the most seemingly innocuous areas of the system.The art and animation were done quite well by Koji Morimoto, who did the art direction for Akira. The characters were a bit...generic, but they&#039;re not really meant to be the main focus of the piece, in my opinion. It&#039;s more of a look at the Matrix itself and how it shapes the lives of its inhabitants. You could&#039;ve inserted different characters and still had the same story, basically. The ending of this piece is what really makes it worthwhile to watch for me. There&#039;s a sense of loss that colors it that is made more striking because of the difference in mood from the beginning of it. generic, but they&#039;re not really meant to be the main focus of the piece, in my opinion.

SQUARE USA)So, this short only really exists to set up Matrix Reloaded as well as Enter the Matrix (greeeaaaattt), and in spite of a well choreographed opening fight scene, it quickly devolves into gray mush with muzzle flashes. It suffers slightly from Star Wars prequel-itis, yes it is tying directly into events of the film I like and yes I do recognise the iconography, but the reason these shorts exist is to expand the universe beyond what was seen before. FFoO meanwhile does very little to expand the universe, stylistically ressembles a Matrix...themed Second Life server, and is a boring slog to begin with. This short should\'ve been called The Blue Pill because it sure as hell put me to sleep.2/10SHORT 2 - The Second Renaissance Parts 1 & 2 (dir. Mahir Maeda and prod. Studio4oC)Now this is where we should have started, detailing the conception and subsequent rise of machines, it\'s an interesting expansion of this world. The visuals are interesting with overall fine designs, the main focus are the machines and they look great, but the humans all look very bland bar a few close up shots with some interesting shots with a portrayal of them being extremely animalistic. It\'s also one of the more intense and mature execution of the robot uprising idea, with neither the message of ""human bad"" nor ""technology bad"" it shows the conflict without bias with both sides being given a part to flesh (or metal) out their motives.7/10SHORT 3 - Kid\'s Story (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe and prod. Studio4oc)Whilst The Second Renaissance showed a larger conflict as whole, this short shows the personal stakes of a Neo-like character living in the Matrix whilst questioning his reality. The sketchy visuals with the fluid almost jittery movements is an amazing portrayal of the characters perception of the Matrix. Although an extremely simple short it\'s effective in its execution with a brilliant soundtrack to couple some interesting animation and it really does a good job at justifying this collection\'s existence as a whole since it and the previous short have already displayed the diversity of Matrix as an IP.9/10SHORT 4 - Program (dir. Yoshiaki Kawajiri and prod. Madhouse)Kid\'s Story was more about animation in motion, meanwhile Program is extremely picturesque and beautiful with a further exploration of small scale conflicts found within the resistance groups, it was extremely effective in both tying familiar iconography with unique ideas, the use  of paper doors as an obstacle was a cool moment, the simulations bleeding code was very nice, and overall the samurai setting is a brilliant set up that gives this short its own identity.8/10SHORT 5 - World Record (dir. Yoshiaki Kawajiri and prod. Madhouse)And it\'s a sports anime now, no but seriously as expected from Madhouse it\'s got some amazing animation, my main description would be ""Redline - except my car broke down"" and you can really see those aesthetics in this short almost 4 years prior. It\'s an interesting addition to this collection and also a very unique spin on a sports story like this, I probably would\'ve preferred if Matrix Reloaded was about this guy instead. My only real complaint is it\'s placement, we just got a Kawajiri/ Madhouse short, so it somewhat nullifies the complete variety displayed prior, that being said the style is still different enough with more exaggerated faces as well as a larger emphasis on  movement and a more naturalistic environment that breaks into some unique visuals in the sequence with the Smiths (Agents, not Morissey).7/10SHORT 6 - Beyond (dir. Kouji Morimoto and prod. Studio4oC)It wasn\'t at all surprising when I checked Morimoto\'s page and spotted Tekkon Kinkreet inhabiting his body of work, this is definitely my second favourite stylistically and in motion it\'s an absolute treat. I see why Thor: Dark World directly ripped this scene into their movie (yeah Marvel, I fucking noticed). There isn\'t really much else to analyse with this short, I adore the aesthetic, it fully utilises it\'s format as a short to tell a concise yet realised story.10/10SHORT 7 - A Detective Story (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe and prod. Studio4oC)Watanabe is back and hey look, it\'s my favourite! I love how it blends the Matrix universe with a film noir/ manga aesthetic, it was definitely a smart choice putting this towards the end seeing as it seems to tie directly into the films somewhat with the appearance of main character (okay, yeah Neo and Trinity showed up in Kid\'s Story, but Trinity is like the central focus). The writing is sharp, the soundtrack is amazing and the mystery while small is still very fun. My only complaint is it seems t be cut a tad short, but when my complaint is that I want more, that\'s not really a complaint. I would love to see Watanabe do a detective series sometime since this style very much suits him.10/10SHORT 8 -Matriculated (dir. Peter Chung and prod. DNA)I was awaiting a short to explore the spirituality of Matrix, sadly they saved it for last, conceptually the short has interesting themes with the humans somewhat reprogramming a machine by making it feel like a human almost. Aesthetically in its backgrounds it is gorgeous and the sequence wherein they explore this weird space within the machine is rife with Buddhist imagery and interesting ways of bending the reality. Aside from that, this short is ugly as sin, the awful proportions, the nauseating use of CGI that just doesn\'t meld well with the rest of the scene and good lord the outside world is so mind-numbingly dull, sadly we visit there often.5/10IN CONCLUSION: If the first and last shorts were cut, this would be amazing, but with those two bad apples I would say this is just pretty great, I still wouldn\'t hesitate to recommend this to just about anyone, but not without a ""skip the first short and the last short, they kinda suck"" prefacing it. Definitely a perfect companion for the Matrix and a much preferable addition to the series than Reloaded or Revolution. themed Second Life server, and is a boring slog to begin with. This short should\'ve been called The Blue Pill because it sure as hell put me to sleep.2/10SHORT 2 - The Second Renaissance Parts 1 & 2 (dir. Mahir Maeda and prod. Studio4oC)Now this is where we should have started, detailing the conception and subsequent rise of machines, it\'s an interesting expansion of this world. The visuals are interesting with overall fine designs, the main focus are the machines and they look great, but the humans all look very bland bar a few close up shots with some interesting shots with a portrayal of them being extremely animalistic. It\'s also one of the more intense and mature execution of the robot uprising idea, with neither the message of ""human bad"" nor ""technology bad"" it shows the conflict without bias with both sides being given a part to flesh (or metal) out their motives.7/10SHORT 3 - Kid\'s Story (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe and prod. Studio4oc)Whilst The Second Renaissance showed a larger conflict as whole, this short shows the personal stakes of a Neo-like character living in the Matrix whilst questioning his reality. The sketchy visuals with the fluid almost jittery movements is an amazing portrayal of the characters perception of the Matrix.

When I was a kid, I loved it. It was my first R-rated movie, it was dark and edgy like any kid is bound to like, and it had neat martial arts action. But as I grew older I finally watched the second and third films and began to hate the series. Anymore, probably thirteen or so years after watching The Matrix for the first time, I think it’s overrated and I can’t see the appeal. It hasn’t aged well and that, on...top of pretty bad storytelling as the movies continued, led me to neglect the series for years…Until now. I never watched the Animatrix, I don’t think I had any intention to after Revolutions. So now, years later, allow me to break down the pieces that comprise the Animatrix and tell you which are good and which are bad.Final Flight of the Osiris-Written by the Wachowski brothers and animated by Square, this nine minute segment looks like the opening cutscene of a PS2 game. It starts with an entirely pointless fight where two characters cut the clothes off each other. They are suddenly pulled out of the simulation as Sentinels are chasing down their ship in the real world. What follows is a six minute sequence ending in a climax that isn’t satisfying, nor really matters. This entire short is nothing more than an introduction to the style of The Matrix rather than pulling us in early on. The writing is lame, the CG is very dated, and you’ll find nothing of value here.The Second Renaissance Part I-The second short details events before The Matrix, namely the divide between humans and machines. What you’ll find here is an interesting background story about humans and machines having a schism that leads to animosity and violence. The machines build their own nation, wind up creating better technologies and having more valuable currency, which doesn’t make humanity happy at all. This is all visualized stunningly, with many disturbing images as well as copies of real life historical moments such as the tank running a robot down a la Tienanmen Square. A fan of the movies will enjoy this history lesson.The Second Renaissance Part II-While containing some of the fantastic visuals of part one, part two is a lot less compelling. The humans put a dome around the Earth so the machines can’t operate on solar power leading to a war that ends with the machines realizing they can harvest energy from human brains. Thus the Matrix was born. This part was pretty stupid. While the first part set up the idea of a smart science fiction story, the second reveals how ridiculous the plot of the series really is and how much the Wachowski’s love to ruin good ideas with nonsense. If you watched the first part, watch the second, but be forewarned, it’s stupid.Kid’s Story-The first visually appealing short from an artistic standpoint, Kid’s Story is directed by my biggest adversary in the directing world, Shinichiro Watanabe. A high school kid realizes he’s inside of the Matrix, leading to agents coming after him while Neo guides him toward escape. While not the most impressive in plot, the animation is gorgeous. For style alone, I’d suggest this segment. It’s the best of the bunch.Program-A shorter piece, this one is another visual feast that concentrates on two people fighting over ideologies in a feudal Japanese setting. The action here is crisp, the dialogue is pretty smart, but it, penultimately, doesn’t matter. I feel that to have a good short here, you need a beginning, middle, and end, not just a singular idea that doesn’t go anywhere. Program is nice, but I still don’t see how this is enriching me any further in the world of The Matrix.World Record-Here is the story of an Olympic racer who runs so fast he breaks the Matrix while some agents go after him to keep him locked within the program. That’s it. The animation isn’t that great, the story isn’t exciting, and I think this may have been the weakest segment so far.Beyond-A pretty good short about a group of kids discovering a glitchy area in their town and exploiting the glitches for fun. While again not telling a compelling story this one does give us an idea of the process that is gone through to repair problems in the Matrix. It has good animation and ideas, but it’s an otherwise unremarkable piece.A Detective Story-Another piece from Shinichiro Watanabe, this one is a noir adventure about a detective who is recruited to track down the hacker known as Trinity. From the outset you can see and hear the style (of course, very typical of Watanabe). This one’s a good short with an actual plot, neat design, and it ties into the movies, making it feel more relevant.Natriculated-This one is made by the people who gave us Aeon Flux and is another eh on my part. It’s got the trademark style of Flux but I wasn’t impressed by the story nor did I find it to be exciting in any regard. As a finale, it’s weak.The Animatrix is a very mixed bag. There are a couple of notable segments but it’s just about as underwhelming as the actual Matrix movies. If you’re a fan of the movie series, then you’ll find some enjoyment here, but if not it’s an  lame grab bag of great talents producing mostly half-assed shorts. top of pretty bad storytelling as the movies continued, led me to neglect the series for years…Until now.

For those not aware you have an animation sequel to the popular film The Matrix. It has 9 stories. Each story is very different from each other.Likes:Like i said among the 9 stories the plot and art differed quite a bit. The artists did a wonderful job in blending the art to a way that best matches the story. For example, if you think of a detective movie. I mean a real good one. what comes to kind other than the trench coat? Black and white. Which is what they did and more. Sure, they matched...the story but they did not drop from character. The ride presented within each story was a virtual roller coaster ride that placed you in the seat of the action. Never once tilted you too far out of your seat.To make matters better even though the stories were different they all came back to the anime's origin. the story but they did not drop from character.

(that 4th one isn't real.)The Matrix itself has a pretty spotty track record. From the masterpiece original, to the flawed, but awesome second, to the forgettable third.The Animatrix cuts all the fat and gives you what the series always should've been. As much as I like all the existential cerebral thinkpiece essays mouthed off in the movies, Animatrix strips itself to the bare essentials of the plot and concept of the Matrix.

They may all contain the Matrix like style but there really isn’t much that connects them. From the story to the animation, each part is different and told in its own way. The movie gets more and more confusing as the stories keep going, making it hard to get what is going on. There isn’t an indication of if you are inside the Matrix or outside it. All I could understand was how pretty the animations were at points and how ‘crappy’ they were in others....The whole mix of samurai to space age, to computer simulations that look so real that it could be live action, all of that just seemed a little overboard.Question, why does it start out with a man and women undressing each other with katanas? Is it just for sexual looks or is there actually a reason for it? Can someone answer this part for me?The animation was all over the place from CG to Cartoon, to whatever. I felt rather bombarded by all the different art styles just as it happened in ‘Dante’s Inferno: An animated epic’. The only thing that saved this a little was that the stories were not all linked to one storyline like Dante. When I say Crappy artwork, I don’t mean bad artwork. I just mean stuff that really doesn’t look right in my eyes. The style that is so loaded with detail that you can see almost every line in the face right next to stuff that is very simplified. I may not be using the right word for it but I have no other idea what to use for it. Now the detail work pretty much is nice in the CG part, but I thought it never worked in the cartoon part of the show.The voices are actually pretty well done and one of the only fluid parts of the show. They have voices that work out rather well for the mood that the ‘scene’ is trying to show. If it’s intense, it sounds intense, if it’s slow, it has that feeling. Some of the characters sound like they were voiced by some of the voice actors that were even in the matrix itself.

They are much closer to what I loved about the first movie than the sequels.To everyone new to the matrix I always use to say: ""Don\'t watch Reloaded and Revolutions. They are bullcrap.

Works like AKIRA and GHOST IN THE SHELL were just the kind of stylish, cool, violent, dystopian, and thoughtful visions of the future that would land them squarely within the favoritism of American pop culture, impressing Hollywood titans like James Cameron. Nowhere are these influences more noticeable than in the Wachowskis\' hit trilogy THE MATRIX. The merging of stylish action, philosophical themes, and a futuristic setting provides a unique cocktail that is heavily indebted to anime. It only makes sense for the Wachowskis to give it back to...the animation their success has been built upon.THE ANIMATRIX is a collection of nine animated shorts set within the universe of THE MATRIX, each with a different director and production studio. Released in the short six month period between RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS, it\'s easy to see this collection as the typical sort of transmedia promotional material for the movies. But a lot of real talent has been brought on board with this project and some of the shorts contain ideas more interesting than anything that was invented for the sequels. Like any collection of stories however, the quality can be mixed. Thankfully, THE ANIMATRIX is more good than bad.First up is ""Flight of the Osiris."" This short, the only one to be done entirely with CG, was directed by Andy Jones, a notable special effects artist who has since gone on to win several Oscars. But it was his work on FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN that probably brought him here, especially considering Square Pictures also get production credits. Written by the Wachowskis and set before the Machines assault on Zion in RELOADED, ""Flight of the Osiris"" is the least inspired short in the collection both visually and narratively and serves as a weak start. It\'s basically an amalgamation of ideas and images familiar to anyone who has seen the original 1999 movie: a simulated dual (with some cringe-inducing eroticism), fighting off Sentinels in a hovercraft, plugging into the Matrix\'s urban landscape, romance, and self-sacrifice. This is more or less a tech demo for the CG work. And while the animation is impressive enough in its photorealism to hold up pretty well today, it just doesn\'t add anything to our understanding of this universe.""The Second Renaissance"" is a step up. This two-parter is a narrated overview of the origins of the Machines, their war with humanity, and their enslavement of humans. Mahiro Maeda (GANGKUTSUOU) and Studio 4°C are up to bat for this one. The mechanical designs and their gradual evolution are great and the scenes of gory violence against both robots and humans is glorious and unnerving its parallels to our own history, giving us the perspective that humanity\'s suffering under the heals of the Machines are a product of its own foolishness. Some CG work was used in the larger-scale moments can be a bit iffy though.The legendary Shinichiro Watanabe (COWBOY BEBOP) directs the next short ""Kid\'s Story,"" also produced by Studio 4°C. However, it\'s Shinya Ohira and Shinji Hashimoto\'s sketchy and expressionist animation that really makes this short a visual treat. Kid\'s gradual awareness about the fictitiousness of his reality culminates in a frantic evasion of Agents inside of his school. The blurry skateboard chase is a favorite in sakuga MADs everywhere.Yoshiaki Kawajiri is an obvious choice to write and direct a short as WICKED CITY and NINJA SCROLL are noted sources of inspiration for the Wachowskis. Like ""Osiris,"" ""Program"" also features a simulated dual, this time with the theme of feudal Japan. It\'s not the strongest short. The colors are great and Madhouse\'s production is solid, but the story and dialogue aren\'t particularly compelling.On the other hand, Madhouse\'s other production ""World Record"" (also written by Kawajiri) is the real deal. Takeshi Koike brings his avant-garde sensibilities to this fantastic segment, an inspiring story about one track athlete\'s final shot for glory and redemption bringing him to awareness about the Matrix. Sweat and muscles have never been rendered in such slow-motion glory. This is definitely the strongest short of the bunch.""Beyond"" gives it a run for its money though. This time, Studio 4°C\'s own co-founder Kōji Morimoto is at the helm exploring a part of the Matrix that was introduced in the trilogy but never saw any elaboration: glitches. Set in a modern Japanese city, several youth investigate an abandoned property subjected to a glitch where the rules of reality begin to break down. Takeshi Honda\'s colorful designs and Morimoto\'s skillful direction result in a gorgeous and playful piece that is dense with atmosphere and an eye for the surreal.""Detective Story"" is an obvious crowd-pleaser. Of course Watanabe would get to direct two shorts. The overtly noir style is much more to his familiarity than his previous short, although perhaps a bit too pastiche. The short more or less parallels ""Kid\'s Story"" with its framing device and focus on individuals engaging with the leads from the trilogy. It\'s attractive, but not as much of a standout compared to some of the other shorts.Unfortunately, THE ANIMATRIX ends on a note that is about as weak as the one it came in on. Peter Chung\'s MTV series ÆON FLUX is enough to justify his inclusion in this project. ""Matriculated"" has an interesting enough conceit as well: Machines getting a taste of their own simulated medicine INCEPTION-style. But the whole thing long overstays its welcome and the trippy visuals during this sequence are too garish to look at for any significant amount of time.

Released in the short six month period between RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS, it\'s easy to see this collection as the typical sort of transmedia promotional material for the movies. But a lot of real talent has been brought on board with this project and some of the shorts contain ideas more interesting than anything that was invented for the sequels. Like any collection of stories however, the quality can be mixed. Thankfully, THE ANIMATRIX is more good than bad.First up is ""Flight of the Osiris."" This short, the only one to be done entirely with CG, was directed by Andy Jones, a notable special effects artist who has since gone on to win several Oscars. But it was his work on FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN that probably brought him here, especially considering Square Pictures also get production credits. Written by the Wachowskis and set before the Machines assault on Zion in RELOADED, ""Flight of the Osiris"" is the least inspired short in the collection both visually and narratively and serves as a weak start. It\'s basically an amalgamation of ideas and images familiar to anyone who has seen the original 1999 movie: a simulated dual (with some cringe-inducing eroticism), fighting off Sentinels in a hovercraft, plugging into the Matrix\'s urban landscape, romance, and self-sacrifice. This is more or less a tech demo for the CG work. And while the animation is impressive enough in its photorealism to hold up pretty well today, it just doesn\'t add anything to our understanding of this universe.""The Second Renaissance"" is a step up. This two-parter is a narrated overview of the origins of the Machines, their war with humanity, and their enslavement of humans. Mahiro Maeda (GANGKUTSUOU) and Studio 4°C are up to bat for this one. The mechanical designs and their gradual evolution are great and the scenes of gory violence against both robots and humans is glorious and unnerving its parallels to our own history, giving us the perspective that humanity\'s suffering under the heals of the Machines are a product of its own foolishness. Some CG work was used in the larger-scale moments can be a bit iffy though.The legendary Shinichiro Watanabe (COWBOY BEBOP) directs the next short ""Kid\'s Story,"" also produced by Studio 4°C. However, it\'s Shinya Ohira and Shinji Hashimoto\'s sketchy and expressionist animation that really makes this short a visual treat. Kid\'s gradual awareness about the fictitiousness of his reality culminates in a frantic evasion of Agents inside of his school. The blurry skateboard chase is a favorite in sakuga MADs everywhere.Yoshiaki Kawajiri is an obvious choice to write and direct a short as WICKED CITY and NINJA SCROLL are noted sources of inspiration for the Wachowskis. Like ""Osiris,"" ""Program"" also features a simulated dual, this time with the theme of feudal Japan. It\'s not the strongest short. The colors are great and Madhouse\'s production is solid, but the story and dialogue aren\'t particularly compelling.On the other hand, Madhouse\'s other production ""World Record"" (also written by Kawajiri) is the real deal. Takeshi Koike brings his avant-garde sensibilities to this fantastic segment, an inspiring story about one track athlete\'s final shot for glory and redemption bringing him to awareness about the Matrix. Sweat and muscles have never been rendered in such slow-motion glory. This is definitely the strongest short of the bunch.""Beyond"" gives it a run for its money though. This time, Studio 4°C\'s own co-founder Kōji Morimoto is at the helm exploring a part of the Matrix that was introduced in the trilogy but never saw any elaboration: glitches. Set in a modern Japanese city, several youth investigate an abandoned property subjected to a glitch where the rules of reality begin to break down. Takeshi Honda\'s colorful designs and Morimoto\'s skillful direction result in a gorgeous and playful piece that is dense with atmosphere and an eye for the surreal.""Detective Story"" is an obvious crowd-pleaser. Of course Watanabe would get to direct two shorts. The overtly noir style is much more to his familiarity than his previous short, although perhaps a bit too pastiche. The short more or less parallels ""Kid\'s Story"" with its framing device and focus on individuals engaging with the leads from the trilogy. It\'s attractive, but not as much of a standout compared to some of the other shorts.Unfortunately, THE ANIMATRIX ends on a note that is about as weak as the one it came in on. Peter Chung\'s MTV series ÆON FLUX is enough to justify his inclusion in this project. ""Matriculated"" has an interesting enough conceit as well: Machines getting a taste of their own simulated medicine INCEPTION-style.

Then you can watch this anime.The show bring us some other stories from the Matrix universe, some of them before the war with the machine (something as a prequel of the Matrix first movie) and other tell parallel stories... but all of them are really interesting.If you liked as least the first movie, then you'll probably like this. But I should warn you: the animation is pretty bad. Really bad, even if you consider the time it was made.So, if you're a Matrix and an anime fan, it will worth the bad...animation, cause the stories are really awesome! animation, cause the stories are really awesome!"", 'I saw this show when I was 8 and the only thing I could remember was the final episode and how abstract and weird the program for the machine looked. Now as I re-watch it 10 years later it leaves a very big impression on me which is the reason I rated it so high as only few anime can bring my mind to life like this.The episodes cover a variety of philosophical scenarios from the Matrix world. The application of most of the episodes leaves you wondering if such phenomena could occur in our reality. Each episode felt like it was teaching you...something emotional about the machines perspective and then they hit you with the final episode where they convince you to feel pity for the machine. All of this adds up to a surreal work of art in my opinion.Overall, super good if your baked. something emotional about the machines perspective and then they hit you with the final episode where they convince you to feel pity for the machine. All of this adds up to a surreal work of art in my opinion.Overall, super good if your baked.', ""Let's be fair with The Animatrix. Some people here are criticizing it without knowing or taking into account that it's a compilation of several different films that were produced independently, and then were packed in the 10 DVD Box Matrix Special. So this was never meant to be a single film.Apart of that, some of the stories bring you some small bits that complement the official Trilogy, for me the most important being the ones about the war between humans and robots, that's great. Also, the guys who message Zion about the attack, that's a very important complement. The rest are of the animations are...more like curiosities, like the fact that exerting extreme physical effort in the matrix may trigger the actual physical body of a person, or how people reprogram the machines.Other than the supportive information that helps you better see the big picture of the matrix, it's overall not very good. The art and animation are pretty terrible in all of the episodes except the first, and due to being separate films the style and production varies wildly, do they don't come together as a whole at all.I still recommend it though, for the sake of knowing more about the matrix universe. You shouldn't watch it expecting it to be a great show, it will suck if you look at it as a proper show instead of a source of supplementary information about The Matrix more like curiosities, like the fact that exerting extreme physical effort in the matrix may trigger the actual physical body of a person, or how people reprogram the machines.Other than the supportive information that helps you better see the big picture of the matrix, it's overall not very good.

You see a two parter explaining how the Matrix dystopia was reached which is cool. It's tragic, but grand, awesome and dark all at the same time. The other movies are fascinating, playing with different art styles from occasionally famous directors. There's a samurai one which is cool.Different themes are explored in the short films, some more emotionally impactful than others. One relates to a runner trying to hard to run that he ends up breaking the Matrix. Cool stuff.There's a badass detective movie as well, alongside a movie which is...more relaxing, showing a young women/teenager with some young boys playing around in a glitched Matrix area.I particularly liked the final short film, it grapples with the idea of empathy and how to get AI to have it. The animation is vibrant and beautiful and it's really cool to see how it plays out. The ending is depressing and kinda shit though in my opinion.The colours and aesthetics are varied, but I always appreciate the neon green that the closing and opening screens in between the movies offers. Matrix colours are sweet.If you like the Matrix this is definitely worth a watch, it fleshes out the universe more in an interesting and creative way.

The quality of the shorts varies heavily from 4/10s to 9/10s, so I\'ll go through them one by one.Don\'t be driven off by the first short because it\'s easily the worst.Final Flight of the Osiris:This one is easily the worst with dated 3D animation. Besides that, the voice acting and the action is all still fine. It\'s just very basic and there\'s not much to say about it. Apparently it\'s supposed to be a prequel to a Matrix video game if that interests you at all. Still better than Resurrections at least lmaoThe Second Renaissance (both parts):From...one of the worst to arguably the best. If you\'re a Matrix fan, this is where you get answers to questions like why the robot uprising happened, why the sky outside seems dark all the time, and why the robots look like weird squid things. And the answer is actually very satisfying. Clean animation and manages to get you pretty invested in seeing the world gradually go to shit.Program: This one was also very solid. Fun action, good animation, and a compelling plot. All you can really ask for.World Record: I like this one less on its actual merits and more just because it\'s insanely cool to watch a guy break the Matrix out of sheer willpower.Kid\'s Story: Possibly my favorite. The action is some of the best and it stays very true to the spirit of the original movie.Beyond: It\'s good but it doesn\'t amount to much more besides wooooah glitch in the Matrix. The definition of ""mid"" imo.A Detective Story: Another short that I enjoyed purely because the MC is cool and it has Trinity in it.Matriculated: This one has a compelling story but it\'s a little less fun to watch.Final verdict: Watch it if the concept interests you. If you don\'t really care, you don\'t have to see it. I think this anthology fits very well in between viewing the first and second movie. one of the worst to arguably the best.

I think this anthology fits very well in between viewing the first and second movie.', 'Before you even watch this anime you should probably at least watch the first Matrix movie or ortherwise this might seem like a confusing movie.Most of the stories were really interesting and were very thematic and had a lot of meanings to them.The sounds were really good especially the music which was unique and different and each one of the epsidoes. The biggest issue was with the consistency of the movie. Some of the episdoes were really good while others were alright but still good.Overall an enjoyable anime that adds some new details to the world of Matrix. So many words to describe it a...mix of emotions for me. mix of emotions for me.', 'I\'ll make a review on every short, just so people can see if they\'re interested in just a part of the anthology, instead of watching everything.Final Flight of the Osiris: 4/10The weird, out of left field sexual energy of the short was so... strange.As an introduction to the animated world of The Matrix, ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" fails on many levels. Choreography is finicky, the voice acting is strangely plain, even if the ideas it presents could be a lot better. Filling the blanks on parts of the films could be okay, as long as you give a good reason for it. Other shorts...explore the origin story of the whole matrix, others interest you in how anomalies are fixed, or how they affect the rules, ways people wake up from the Matrix. This one just tells us how a bad day goes for people destined to die, no feelings for them, no dilemmas or questions about the world, just a bunch of people you won\'t care about.Probably the worst of the bunch, at least comparing with the other ones. However, the others start getting a lot better.The Second Renaissance Part 1: 10/10""The Second Renaissance"" may just be the reason why you should watch ""The Animatrix"".We don\'t really get characters, just sides. The world is something we know, people filled with vanity, and cruelty towards things they label as inferior. If one of such beings decides they had enough, even if they were created based on human\'s good behavior, what does it say about us? A constant destruction and genocide against something that can fight back will only result in the eventual end. It\'s not as if the robots didn\'t do something terrible at the beginning of their uprise, but the rest, is the sad exaggeration that leads to pure suffering.I could see this story being told in a long way; film, series, animated, any way it could be conveyed has the potential to be a favorite of the franchise. The origin of the Matrix being this hard hitting and morally questioning isn\'t something I expected at all. The commentary on humanity, the critique on war itself, the horrors of it; amazing short, being only part 1.The Second Renaissance Part 2: 10/10Part 2 and the single best short of ""The Animatrix"". The horrors of war aren\'t something that\'s easily conveyed with sincerity; usually a realistic depiction of the world is needed for it, but not in ""The Second Renaissance"" ending. You can call it pretentious without meaning, or how it doesn\'t make much sense, but again, leaving some things unexplained, or up to interpretation don\'t detract from the imagery. In contrast to the smaller details of how this situation came to be, the big details of how it ends leaves such an impact. The eldritch horrors of how everything eventually crumbles, humanity being used as a mere battery in a symbiotic relationship with those they tried to enslave, become so meaningful in retrospective.The images that scale aspects that aren\'t bound by live action are something to marvel at. Animation as a medium allows for things like this to exist, and I love it just for it in general. Are the robots doing something horrifying? Yes, absolutely, but this humanity, in this certain reality, brought this upon themselves. With such a context, how would the movies change? I\'ll have to check them out, since this information is great for a new perspective on the hero\'s struggle and how it takes upon a new meaning.In short, this is the reason you should check out ""The Animatrix"".Kid\'s Story: 9/10""Kid\'s Story"" is such a ferocious experience. A frame by frame, and what looks like rotoscope animation. The Matrix hangs on the concept that everything you know is a lie, that the world is simply onto your every move, as well as how everything feels like a dream. Everything breaks loose when everybody knows what\'s going on, and the feeling of the rush perpetuates in every next frame.Running for your life in the brink of uncertainty, that\'s the short\'s intent throughout the rest of the runtime. An accelerated feel of how sloppy everything feels in the presence of adrenaline. Nothing looks quite as it seems, the perception of yourself shifts as nothing matters other than escaping, how would a person feel when everything you knew didn\'t matter? To be met with the reality of paranoia, of not belonging because there never was something to belong in general.A perfectly animated experience that thrives in a feeling, accompanied by a good, simple story. I loved ""Kid\'s Story"", with the only little problem being a bit of stale voice acting.Program: 9.4/10Now, this is a short that works just as its own little thing. The other ones can only work when attached to the franchise, and in contrast, two characters you care about, with a complete build of personality, of likes, dislikes, and love in the middle, as well as the curse of knowledge.Reality can sometimes be cruel, and sometimes fiction, running away from the truth seems to be easier to do, easier to cope with. Offered with the chance to get away from the constant struggle of an apocalypse, it\'s hard not to consider letting oneself get consumed in lies. A creative setting to show this particular duel of ideologies, of questions that motivate each of the personal sides.I love that particular style of animation, with a great choreography, an actual relationship I really care about and ideas that fill me with intrigue. Every element present here shows how the first episode can succeed. No need to fill a gap in an existing narrative, no need for sexuality, just a question with opposing sides.Amazing short, but I wish that ending wasn\'t a cop out, I wanted the stakes and the final answer to make a real difference for the characters.World Record: 8/10A visual experience, even more than most of the other shorts. ""World Record"" is a question in story, nothing more, nothing less. What if the limits of your body, are only in your head? A man breaking The Matrix just because he believed he could go even faster than ever. I adore the visuals of going further beyond, of every muscle contracting, getting destroyed against your own will to be more, to achieve more. Not even for the cost of fame, but because you know you can do more than anybody. Extremely motivational if you think about it.A message, hand in hand with abstract animation that not only needs no words, but shows everything with only visuals. We don\'t need much more than that, we can only wonder, what is actually the condition to break The Matrix? Is it only belief? Only breaking a mental limit renders the hold of a cosmic horror useless, it really says a lot about us as humans and the power of our minds.Lovely short, but too simple to be outstanding.Beyond: 7.5/10""Beyond"" works as a slice of life piece of The Matrix. It feels like a childhood abandoned house, ripe for exploration. Weird rules, the strange feeling of danger, just like a moment of discovery in your own little world. The characters are simple, no complex thinking is needed from them, we just observe how they react to a cool little thing. We see the world with eyes of tranquility, and finally can take a breath from the other high intensity shorts.I loved the animation, it felt like the episode 4 of those anime with a relaxing atmosphere. We got in the middle of a mystery with some fun visuals and an overarching element of interest that doesn\'t get evolved. The short told us: ""It is what it is"" and moved on without much of an impression, but it still felt good to watch it.No story gained, only a fun little experience.A Detective Story: 6.7/10Style over substance; a simple noir story about a simple detective in this weird world. I can\'t say much about this one, since it doesn\'t say anything special or interesting. The atmosphere didn\'t feel intense or relaxing, it was just a middle ground that showed off how they could animate this in black and white, without feeling potentially pretentious, contrary to the other ones that could be seen like so.I did like the ending part a lot, since it feels like this could\'ve been the introduction of a movie, cut short by the sad reality of how the rules impede it from happening.Very nice little short, not impressive, yet, stylish and fun to experience/watch.Matriculated: 6.3/10I feel as if this short had much more potential to say something. The perspective here is more so on the potential humanity of the machines, limited by the runtime, or what they could do with such a concept. We establish new rules with the previous shorts, rules that really change how important this short is by being the ending of the story. I wish they could\'ve asked more about how they\'re programmed, or how does the method they use work.Using the visual medium to inject a psychedelic flair into the story managed to make this a bit more interesting than the other ones, but since it lacks much more than that, it does fall short on what I liked about the rest.I liked the short, but it was the slowest of the bunch, even with the ending in mind. Maybe a bit anticlimactic from the high quality to drop eventually.Overall: 7.9/10Not much of a mixed bag, but a great level of quality around the whole thing. The last two shorts were the most okay of the bunch, leaving it in an anticlimactic way. Doesn\'t detract from how great, astonishing, and beautiful others were; I recommend this anthology to anybody that likes animated beauty. explore the origin story of the whole matrix, others interest you in how anomalies are fixed, or how they affect the rules, ways people wake up from the Matrix.

I love it from the beggining to the end... The cyberpunk visuals, the art direction, the stories.... My personal favorites are The Second Renaissance Part 1 & 2, Beyond, Detective Story and A Kid's Story... There are just soooo much interpretations you can make from it.... Many discussions! So much interesting ideas and philosophy behind it, truly a masterpiece!I highly recommend it for anyone who wants some existencial questions answers, or if you're just a big fan of the first movie, The Matrix. I don't think I've ever saw an anime more cyberpunky than this one....Only the most professional japenese artists involved! The Second Renaissance Part 1 & 2 was definitely the story that most impacted me...Beyond is amazing too, how it shows the girl finding a secret room where all her conversations on her phone are like, recorded... The kids trying to break the bottle, but nothing happens (I noticed the bottle is not even there on the ground, which is a little weird, I think they forgot to draw the bottle).Thank you, Wachowskis, for making such an spectacular experience!

Tales of Zestiria the Cross 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34086/Tales_of_Zestiria_the_Cross_2nd_Season,"['Having said that, I will now analyze the different aspects of ""Tales of Zestiria the X"" as a whole:Story: 3/10Tales of Zestiria’s main issue is that it came out in 2016. For anybody who has experienced a decent amount of fantasy stories, the whole premise of ""a crew with different powers goes on a journey to save the world"" gets old quickly. And while it\'s true that Zestiria might work as a baby\'s first show, this alone doesn\'t make up for its shallowness and lack of originality. ToZ also disappoints when it comes to direction and pacing. The original idea of the show taking liberties...with the plot seen in the game was originally promising (due to it being considered below average by a large portion of the Tales fanbase), but unfortunately, the result proved to be disappointing too. There are several anticlimactic/awkward moments across the show: namely characters who suddenly laugh, cry or scream for no reason. Lastly, the fact they rushed the finale in spite of the slow-paced first cour is unacceptable for a 27-episode show.Animation: 7/10Ufotable is known for providing high quality eye-candy. They deliver where other studios usually fail: smooth fights, good-looking backgrounds and CGI usage. That being said, ToZ\'s animation failed to live up to the high standards set by Ufotable\'s older works (e.g. Kara no Kyoukai and the Fate series). The character designs are charming at first glance, but part of the cast often looks inexpressive or has forced reactions. It is also worth mentioning that ToZ\'s CGI dragons strike as jarring compared to other animated elements. Additionally, Zestiria tends to show off its backgrounds too frequently, taking up screentime that perhaps could have been used to fix pacing issues.Music and voice acting: 6/10Unlike other successful Ufotable works, Tales of Zestiria does not have a memorable OST. However, I felt like the soundtrack was acceptable overall, with FLOW taking the lead. The music used throughout the show wasn\'t mold-breaking and is mostly forgettable. Regarding the voice actors, most of them did a nice job, especially Fukuen Misato as Edna and Ono Daisuke as Dezel. Only a reduced amount of the cast does not have fitting voices.Characters: 2/10Most of the cast is generic, bland and has no real development. Rose and Dezel are two of the few exceptions, but they don\'t get to excel regardless. Besides, dealing with Sorey\'s dull personality is challenging for those who have medium/high standards for main characters. This becomes a serious matter at a certain point of the story, where Sorey\'s mindset should take a turn for the better, but he ultimately decides to keep up his idealistic antics. Truly frustrating.Enjoyment: 4/10This show picked my interest after watching other works by the same studio, but those expectations were slowly crushed on a weekly basis. I didn’t drop it hoping for a great fight scene that never came. Those two promotional Berseria episodes from the first cour were the most interesting part of the show, even though they were only slightly above average. It is safe to say that Ufotable\'s animation and the soundtrack are the only redeeming features of ToZ from an objective point of view.Overall: 4/10In short, Tales of Zestiria is a walking cliché not worth anybody\'s time investment. For those interested in Ufotable’s gorgeous animation, Kara no Kyoukai and the Fate series are far better choices. Most popular titles from the fantasy genre are superior to Tales of Zestiria, and have done everything it does, but better. with the plot seen in the game was originally promising (due to it being considered below average by a large portion of the Tales fanbase), but unfortunately, the result proved to be disappointing too.

And honestly, the skepticism backed itself up very well given the final product.Story: Continuing with its previous season, Tales of Zestiria brings us back to the world plagued by malevolence where we follow our main protagonist, Sorey, as he fully realizes his power as the Shepherd in order to save the world from humanity\'s own faults and wrongdoings.  At least...that\'s what I think the show\'s about?...It\'s not really all that clear.Unfortunately, the muddiness and lack of detail of my own synopsis to me shows just how difficult it is to describe Tales of Zestiria from a story sense.  With the entire game adapted into roughly 25 episodes worth of material, many liberties were taken by Ufotable in order to squeeze it into this tiny, tiny runtime.  But it\'s not just that the show was rushed, rather, the show decides to focus more on specific sections of the game (more specifically, the arc about our newest member, Rose) and run with that as the main brunt of the runtime.  As an end result, the show ends up being extremely choppy and uneven in pacing, as there\'s this huge jarring scene transition in the middle that turns it from a character-based story about our females leads, into an overall journey deciding the fate of the world.The consequences of these actions are both prominent and many in number.  The antagonists of the series ultimately have difficult to understand motivation to the point that there might as well not be any, the amount of world building is both laughable and poorly structured, the pacing is horrendous (especially in the last few episodes), and above all, there\'s no emotional weight or anything to bring us this far.  The last one is the biggest problem of them all because I find that there\'s really no reason for anything the characters do to matter so much.  Sure the ending might be predictable, but at least make me feel SOMETHING for the characters when they struggle.  I just found it very hard for me to even care with what was going on, let alone understand what was even happening half the time since things go from zero to one hundred in the span of an episode.Zestiria makes a difficult case for itself because due to its vast number of problems, it becomes very hard to find anything positive to say about its story.  A show becomes a trial to watch when the plotline has our heroes try and solve some kind of civil war in one episode, then already at the doorstep of the \'main antagonist\' in the next.  If it\'s any consolation, the previews where our characters banter with one another before unveiling the title for the next episode is arguably more entertaining than probably anything else that we get from here.Overview:- Messy writing- Horrendous pacing- Choppy scene transitions- Gives the audience very little reason to careCharacters: Characters fare slightly better than the story mostly because not only is a brunt of the screentime devoted to the characters\' stories, but their interactions are for the most part, quite entertaining.As far as the cast from the first season goes, there\'s not really much to say.  Sorey and his seraphim friends still go about his journey to save the world from malevolence and Alisha is still the princess who\'s dealing with power struggles in her kingdom.  Sure Alisha gets a little bit of expansion to her eventually resolved problems, but the placing of it combined with the lack of the antagonist\'s motivation for doing anything sort of undercuts any and all tension that would\'ve been had.  Sorey however doesn\'t change.  The show doesn\'t focus on him at all in any way shape or form over the course of season two, so trust me.  He\'s still the same dopey MC with good intentions as he was before.Despite it being Sorey\'s journey, the true star of season two is Rose, the spunky merchant girl who literally steals the show by being the only character with ample screentime or devoted story time to.  Sure while her story\'s all well and good, my main gripe with her is the fact that she completely overshadows anything that\'s going on.  The surge of world-ending malevolence is completely ignored in order to devote at least two-thirds of the show\'s overall runtime the personal trials of one character.  While I don\'t think that Rose is a terrible character, the decision to make her the star of the season two was a bad one at best, especially when last season ended with our main characters meeting the big bad guy for the first time.Both side characters and antagonists serve only one purpose: background decorations.  No one aside from the main characters really have any weight on the flow of the story, as everyone that isn\'t an elemental seraphim or one of the three colorfully dressed humans serves only to move the story along.  This becomes painfully obvious with the villains because even with watching the series in its entirety, it\'s not really quite clear what all of the antagonists hoped to achieve with all of this.  Especially with the ""Lord of Calamity"" that keeps being brought up.Overview:+ Entertaining main cast-  Very little screentime for the main protagonist-  Rose takes up too much space-  Everyone who\'s not a main character is background fodderArt: A general consensus for Ufotable is that they have top-tier animation that blends both hand-drawn animation and computer graphics together to form breathtaking scenes.  (This becomes especially clear with their work in the Fate series.)  With Zestiria being given that same treatment, that statement rings true once again as Zestiria has Ufotable\'s signature shine and beautiful animation to make the series a visually pleasing experience to watch.  Alright, what\'s wrong with it?You know, for being a series based on a JRPG, there\'s not that much fighting.  There really isn\'t.  Zestiria might as well not have any fight scenes because it seems like the show just flat out refuses to show any.  Hell, when they show any fight scenes, they\'re always so short and unmemorable that it feels like it never even happened.  The final fight with the last boss lasted THREE MINUTES.  Admittedly, actual movement in Ufotable\'s fights is rare, but at least in other cases, they pad it with the combatants talking to each other to make it seem like the fight goes on longer than it actually is.  Zestiria\'s fights hardly feel like a battle at all.Overview:+ Ufotable-level artwork-  Literally no fight scenes.  (You get maybe 10-12 minutes of total fighting in the entire series.)Sound: Season two sports a brand new OP and ED that in comparison to its season one counterparts, sounds like there\'s a lot more weight to the entire situation.  Both its OP, ""Illuminate"" and its ED, ""Innosense"" have a lot more urgency to them and make it feel like that there\'s a lot more at stake for our protagonists in order to save the world.  While that\'s an utter lie, the tracks give the show that illusion.Personal Enjoyment: I really wanted to enjoy Tales of Zestiria, I really did.  But I for the life of me don\'t understand what is even happening.  One episode there\'s a hostage situation involving Alisha dealing with her power struggles, then Rose wants to take revenge on someone?  And now...they\'re fighting the big bad guy when just two episodes ago, our characters couldn\'t even use the game\'s biggest battle mechanic of armatization like...at all.  It came to a point where I sort of threw my hands up in the air and gave up on making any sense with what was going on because the show just made it that difficult to follow what was going on.Did I like this anime?I enjoyed the first season, not so much this one.  Admittedly, the first season was painfully slow and had its own set of problems, but at least things weren\'t all over the place like season two.What didn\'t I like about this anime?In terms of specifics, the ending felt like a cop-out.  It really feels like a huge cop-out.  I wish it wasn\'t a cop-out.Would I recommend this anime?I don\'t really find much worth in watching Tales of Zestiria.  Sure the visuals are nice, the soundtrack is pretty good, and the characters are entertaining, but the story makes everything so difficult to fully appreciate.  Ufotable\'s attempt at pressing everything down to make it fit does a lot of harm to a story that already a lot of people weren\'t too keen on in the first place.  As such, if you do plan on watching this, I would be sure not to keep expectations to high and just sort of go along with it.  If you\'re not planning on watching this, then it\'s not worth the time.

From what I'm seeing, things can get more serious, and the OP clearly shows that. I will review this as someone who's watched the whole gameplay of the game, since I am clearly too poor to afford it.Fitting 80+ hours of gameplay can prove to be difficult in 24 episodes. But I do like how Ufotable is handling the adaption so far. They keep the key points from the game and they don't tend to rush everything. They do it in a pace that is...fairly satisfactory.Story (8)The story continues as they adventure and travel across the land. They might get stronger so that they can have a chance to beat the Lord of Calamity once and for all. I'm interested on where they'll take the story from here.Character (7)We get to see more of Sorey getting stronger to try and fight Malevolence so that he may gain strength to fight the LOC (Lord of Calamity). The Seraphim are the same, with the same personality. Edna, of course, still being my favourite out of all the seraphim.However, we do get to see more of Dezel and how he stuck with Rose almost his whole life. He admires her, and will not hesitate to kill, if it is for the sake of Rose.Speaking of Rose, we get to see a bit more about her. About her past and the revenge she wanted because of what happened to her Fatherly Figure, Brad. Who has died in Rose's past and is now out for revenge for the one who caused all of it. If she hadn't met Sorey, it was probably a possibility that she may fall into Malevolence. Which I wouldn't have wanted. As we dive more into her past we can see why she is quite the badass with those dual knives. She was taken in as a young child due to her parents being either dead or missing, I don't remember. Brad was kind enough to take her in and raise her, and of course train her. Thus forming the Rose we see today.Art (10)I guess there's no surprise there, It is Ufotable after all.Sound (9)The Soundtracks being used for this anime are definitely the right ones. To the OP and ED (imo the OP and ED should've switched, but I'm guessing they're aiming for a different tone for the 2nd cour, which I'm totally ok with btw.) The nice orchestral soundtracks in the background intensifies each moment which adds a nice touch.Enjoyment (8)I did enjoy this as much as Season 1, heck, maybe even more. The action is quite nice and I do like some conversations between the characters. So I'm satisfied with that.Overall (8)This anime continues to be going at a steady pace. I'm glad that Ufotable took the game adaption with care (Although the game itself wasn't very good imo) But hey I'm liking this a bit more than Season 1 because of how the plot gets more interesting and thickens. Some characters are starting to show their true nature, and more problems begin to occur. I wonder how it'll turn out.And with this, Sorey and his gang continues the adventure. Hoping to take down the cause of all the problems... fairly satisfactory.Story (8)The story continues as they adventure and travel across the land.

No matter how low your expectations you will likely still be disappointed.', 'To clear things up, this is a review of Seasons 1 & 2, or better put ""Tales of Zestiria the X"" as a whole.This review will not follow a typical format, I think everyone already knows that the art is great and that the sound is probably great too. As such I\'ll focus on everything wrong with the show.So lets start by getting this out of the way:Art: 9/10 , it\'s ufotable, I gave Fate/Zero a 10 and rated Garden of Sinners equally as high. Zestiria is still up to scratch, or though at times quality fluctuates slightly and just doesn\'t meet previous standards set...by the studio.Sound: \'Very good\' 8/10, as a guitarist myself I could appreciate the slightly rockier OST parts and Flow is always great.And now for where it goes wrong.Story: 3/10. Honestly this didn\'t come as a surprise to me and nor I should think to anyone else familiar with the Tales Series, specifically Tales of Zestiria, that the story should be a convoluted mess. When I say convoluted, I don\'t mean that in the sense that there\'s so many intricacies that its impossible to follow the narrative, in fact the story is as boringly simple and cliché as you might expect from any run of the mill RPG, or a Tales game rated as low as Zestiria was. Instead the story is convoluted in a far worse sense, the characters are thrown around from place to place, meeting new and underdeveloped characters that are quickly thrown to the roadside for half the season only to return in just an episode or two and do nothing.Minor Spoilers here, after coming to Lady Lake, Soray becomes the Shepherd in a rather underwhelming fashion (though the fight that ensues is fun to look at). After the fight he blacks out, and wakes up later in a palace bedroom. Some mild shipping then ensues with Alisha and then he buggers off to save the world and what have you.That\'s basically the narrative, as from then on Soray migrates from place to place, picking up chicks who don\'t seem to like him like some crappy but extremely mild harem show. As he goes from place to place he also finds malevolence and predictably kills it, or rather purifies it because the Shepherd\'s above killing. I should mention there are plenty of subplots to break up the narrative here, which if handled right could\'ve been a good and refreshing divergence from the narrative, but its not. After they head separate ways, the narrative will chop and change between Soray and his entourage and Alisha and her girl power posse, (which I will return to later). Like I said this could\'ve been good for the show, however the way they do it, spending a few episodes here, cutting from the action to spend yet another few episodes developing unrelated characters you don\'t care about is infuriating. This really isn\'t helped by the fact that Alisha is the worst character in the show, something I\'ll reason out with you later.The other bad thing the show does with the story is the random 2 episode (or maybe three, I struggle to remember) section covering the beginning events of Tales of Berseria. Now, I know what you\'re thinking, \'you stupid ruddy twat, Tales of Berseria is way better than Zestiria! How can it detract from the narrative? Well, quite simply. It\'s totally pointless. The events of the prequel to Zestiria (that\'s Berseria), especially the very beginning of Berseria, don\'t relate at all to what happens in Zestiria, not in a way that needs to give background to all the characters from Berseria. Mild Spoilers here, the end events of Berseria are the cause of the current issues going on in Zestiria, something that\'s all explained in about 10 seconds of exposition from the King of Rolance (Roland? I dunno) half way through season two. Ultimately this 40-60 minute escapade feels either like a cheap excuse not to adapt the infinitely better Tales of Berseria,  or just the studio realising that the story sucked and that maybe if they stuck part of a better story half way through, the show would be improved. Well, it isn\'t. Given that for the story of Berseria to matter at all, you need to develop it waaaaay past the character introductions (of whom the only ones that matter are Mavin (Mayvin?) and Velvet anyway).Without going into too much Season 2\'s plot in particular was rushed, a bit weird at times and diverted from the original plot slightly, sadly not for the better.Enough of the story, lets move on to the greatest disappointment;The Characters: A solid 2/10.Now if I hadn\'t mentioned this earlier, most of you are probably thinking this will now turn into a multi-page bitching session about Soray and his cliché and predictable behaviour, lack of personality and plot armour. Well, you\'d have been wrong.However lets start with Soray anyway.Soray: So, he\'s our protagonist, the Shepherd come to rid the world of evil yadah yadah. Honestly given the premise I already kind of knew exactly what he\'d be like, and once the show confirmed that for me, I in turn knew his every decision and action that he\'d take throughout the whole god damn story. Soray is a goody two shoes through and through, always taking the righteous and perceptibly good path. Now, characters that do this aren\'t always flat, boring and one dimensional characters, however for me to buy into them being like that I have to be given a viable reason for them being like that. To give you an example, Nino Kuni\'s Oliver. Now he is not by any means the most complex and well fleshed out character ever, far from it. However his situation is very similar to Sorays. Put into a new world (I use this term loosely, as for Soray going out of the Seraphim\'s village is essentially like entering a new world) and called the \'Pure-hearted one\', or as Drippy says, the \'Puuuuuuueeeer-hearted one\', Oliver is in a very similar situation to Soray. He is the savior who can mend broken hearts (basically like purifying) and rid the world of this unnatural suffering (basically malevolence). However Oli boy doesn\'t do this just because he\'s good like that. Mild Spoiler Warning- He went to this alternate world to save his mother, who he feels responsible for killing, having lied to her in order to escape her watchful eye and have some somewhat dangerous fun. This is a character drive that makes me believe that someone in Oli\'s position would do as he has done, and the fact that as he develops as a character in the new world, he gains other motivations to fulfilling his duty as the savior only adds to my ability to believe in the narrative. Soray has none of this kind of backstory or motivation. He grew up sheltered in a social paradise, and became the Shepherd because he\'s just that nice. It makes events like when he tries to stop people from killing clearly evil people in revenge for their crimes really freaking annoying. He just seems like an entitled brat that for what ever reason people do what he says and things just go his way.The Seraphs: I\'m treating these guys all as one character because otherwise there isn\'t enough to talk about. To be honest, the Seraphs aren\'t really characters, they\'re just ways in which the narrative can explain where Soray\'s powers come from, as well as acting as exposition dumping machines (especially Lailah). They\'re invisible to all except Soray and a few others and quite frankly could just be voices in Soray\'s head for all the difference they make to the narrative. The only exception might\'ve been Edna with her somewhat more interesting subplot with her brother which may seem to indicate that seraphim are becoming dragons. Only issue is that she never says anything and that subplot goes nowhere, so in the end she\'s just as much as a sockpuppet as the rest of them are.Rose: Rose was at times a more enjoyable character than the rest of the cast. She was developed, had reasons for what she did, and goals she was aiming for. At first I thought she was just meant to be another Alisha-esque token badass female lead to beat up a couple of grunts here and there. But as she was developed she was given viable reasons for her basically super-human skills when compared to others in universe.I was happy with her character, until the end of her character arc when she basically became Soray\'s bitch and was totally uninteresting for the rest of the show, assuming similar ideals to Soray, forsaking her old ones and just basically being an emotional potato for the rest of the show.I feel I should mention, malevolence is a basically a plot tool justifying Soray\'s ideals that all killing is bad no matter what as all it does is spread malice, lines that he shot off to Rose during her infinitely more interesting character arc that eventually collapsed it down to the aforementioned  disappointing end we were left with.No other characters really matter, even the villains (especially the villains), so as I saved the worst for last:Alisha:I really don\'t know whether to keep this short and sweet or just to furiously type words of hate until I get bored. I\'ll settle for something in between.Alisha is one of the worst characters I\'ve seen, ever, and whats worse, I really struggle to tell you why. Maybe there\'s just so much wrong that I gave up trying to decipher it all half way through, who knows.If I were to sum up and list them though, I\'d say;-All of Soray\'s problems, namely goody two shoes, lack of personal motivation and plot armour.-All of Rose\'s problems, without Rose\'s backstory, namely being an irritating token badass girl for the sake of being a female power statement (I\'ll explain myself later, I have no issue with strong/badass females in any media, my issue is with the way in which these characters are implemented as such and why I think they did his in the first place).-Her own crappy backstory, if you can call it that.-And the worst of all, is not actually an issue with Alisha herself, more with how everyone treats her, and how that affects her character development.So, in order, and I\'ll try to be brief here: She shares all of the problems Soray had, self righteous attitude to everything, with no explanation as to why she is as she is. She also inherently has plot armour, so you know nothing life threatening is going to happen to her, at least until the very end (maybe). This includes being attacked by a tornado, then a dragon, then assassins (who by all rights should be far stronger than she is), as well as being stabbed through the stomach, apparently. All of these (and more occurrences later on) honest to God don\'t mean shit to her. She survives everything completely fine, and is up and about a few hours later, as if somebody\'s rusty iron blade hadn\'t just permeated her stomach lining a few hours earlier. Its irritating to say the least, but hey I\'m used to plot armour by now that alone wouldn\'t kill it for me, so lets move on.I\'ll skip what I said about Rose for now as that fits in better later on, so on to her crappy back story.Well, to be blunt, she doesn\'t really have any, she\'s a princess, I guess. She was trained by some Brazilian-looking chick who has a massive rack, I guess. Oh oh, and she\'s not actually noble-blooded. Her mum was a commoner, and hence the court has mistreated her sob-sob fuck off. That\'s about it honestly. This alone is annoying enough, however  the way we were first told about it somehow makes it worse. It was just casually thrown in there as a ""by the way"" kind of statement. Seems like the writers thought she might not be relatable enough, so they just threw that in because you know, from the bottom to the top stories are really relatable and endearing especially if the whole process of going from the bottom to the top was before you were born. This adds nothing to her character and only served to piss me off a little more. The way in which this was added kind of reminds of the way GATE (Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri) added to their protagonist, by listing his bullshit achievements in a totally casual way with absolutely no way of showing how he got them. At least in that show, cliché and PR filled as it may have been, the other characters had the suitable reaction of being pissed off at the bs themselves.-And now the worst one. The way the other characters interact with her, the way everybody just goes along with it. You know what made Louise such an annoying character in Familiar of Zero? It wasn\'t her god awful attitude and bitchy nature, bad as they were. It was the fact that she got away with everything, everything always went her way.The same is true for Alisha, though it isn\'t really her personality that I hate, as she doesn\'t have one. Its her ideals clashing with others, and everyone just going well fuck! She\'s totally right! On top of this the way the show portrayed anyone and anything with a less than perfect, or in-universe, less-than-Alisha way of looking at things is supposed to be totally corrupt and evil.Case and point- Bartlow. Note that there will be spoilers here. For those who don\'t know, Bartlow is basically Alisha\'s antagonist, a somewhat minor villain who is the cause of most of Alisha\'s issues throughout the show. Now, true enough Bartlow\'s motives are clearly revealed to be a struggle for power towards the end of the first season and all through S2, as he is clearly after the throne. However at the very beginning when you are first introduced to him. He and Alisha are at odds. He wants to send soldiers to Rolance\'s(?) border as he is expecting war. Alisha says No! as clearly defending your border only breeds war. The subplot is as follows, Bartlow meets with the Scattered Bones, a group of assassins that only kill evil people and convinces them to off Alisha as she would sacrifice her own people for her ideals. They agree. Now the show presents this as the Bones being used to kill Alisha by the evil Bartlow, but quite frankly I absolutely agree with his motives. As far as I know, Bartlow is a man in position of power charged with defending his country from another powerful country that contains hostile factions. His actions make perfect logical sense, even having Alisha eliminated, as she really does threaten the nation\'s safety with her naivety. Alisha of course survived because of plot armour and dependence of Soray, and story moves on with Bartlow clearly meant to be the bad guy. Let me back up my point. For those that have watched the first season, think about the fight between Hyland and Rolance at the end of the season. Hyland\'s troops, as they approached their border were drawn into battle with Rolance, and then ambushed from behind their own border by another division of Rolance troops. Rolance clearly had planned to attack Hyland regardless of Alisha\'s or Bartlow\'s decision. Now, four things happen here that serve to make me hate Alisha even more. 1. Despite Rolance\'s actions she still goes to the commander in charge to stop the fighting. As a bonus she does deservedly get stabbed, but then 2. Plot armour! She\'s totally fine despite quite literally being gutted. 3. She is ultimately totally useless and needs Soray to save her country and her sorry ass. If you are confused what I mean by this, I\'ll explain. Rolance had successfully ambushed Hyland\'s forces, and Rolance\'s Generals were clearly very confident of victory. Taking that into account we can assume that Hyland would\'ve lost and then next thing Alisha would know is that Rolance is knocking on Lady Lake\'s holier-than thou doors.And 4. Despite all of that, she learns nothing, at all. Because she was saved by Soray she doesn\'t seem to think for even a second that maybe she was in fact wrong and should compromise with Bartlow. Nope, to her this is proof from the Gods above (or Seraphim or whatever) that she is truly righteous.Now, I said I\'d explain myself, and I will. Lets sweep the floor clean first. I am not sexist. Couldn\'t care less if a powerful character is male of female. However Alisha and her posse of overpowered peaches is exactly how you do female empowerment wrong. Add Soray to lord over them all and you\'ve got a winning formula invalidating everything your character is and does, as well as pissing off half the audience.To set it out, this is my issue with Alisha and her posse and why I find them so irritating. Other than them all thinking Alisha is God\'s own gift (I get that she\'s their princess, so I can forgive them that) they all share this certain dynamic in Alisha\'s command structure. All of her second in commands, as well as her \'master\', are chicks who are inexplicably, insanely adept at killing things, as well as being physically stronger than any other trained knight on the battlefield. It doesn\'t make sense and the sheer abundance of it seen in this show is annoying. All of her men are just tools to look stupid and die pointlessly, temporarily making her feel bad until she thinks what would Soray do and then spouts some cheesy one liner. In fact its instances like the ones when a bunch of her men die after she tells them not to kill any of her characters that makes what Bartlow said to the Scattered Bones at the start so true, and the fact that there is never any come-upance or reckoning for Alisha is too hard to swallow.Back to topic, its a difficult thing to explain, but the majority of women in this series don\'t feel like powerful characters in their own right (or even characters in their own right), instead it seems like they are tokens, stuck in there for the sole purpose of putting some strong females in the script, except that they\'re not because Soray is the only one who can get shit done apparently. It\'s annoying, pointless and poorly thought out. Rose is a character done well in this manner, if not done well overall. Alisha and her posse are there to satisfy the modern political correctness in anime that girls have to be powerful, except when they\'re not.In the end its an accumulation of fairly minor details like this that just multiply the effect and  make Alisha such a poor character, in her own right and through the interactions with those she surrounds herself with.Well, I\'m done. Seems like this review turned into more of a messy dump than I thought it would, but I hope by this point you got the gist.Overall this series gets a 5/10, mediocre. The only reason for this being the sound and art. I personally care a lot about animation and sound design in anime, if I didn\'t I\'d read manga or light novels, however as it stands I do care, and that is the only reason this show rates as high as it does for me.Now, this was my first review, so critique is welcome.Cheers. by the studio.Sound: \'Very good\' 8/10, as a guitarist myself I could appreciate the slightly rockier OST parts and Flow is always great.And now for where it goes wrong.Story: 3/10.

Note that there will be spoilers here. For those who don\'t know, Bartlow is basically Alisha\'s antagonist, a somewhat minor villain who is the cause of most of Alisha\'s issues throughout the show. Now, true enough Bartlow\'s motives are clearly revealed to be a struggle for power towards the end of the first season and all through S2, as he is clearly after the throne. However at the very beginning when you are first introduced to him. He and Alisha are at odds. He wants to send soldiers to Rolance\'s(?) border as he is expecting war. Alisha says No! as clearly defending your border only breeds war. The subplot is as follows, Bartlow meets with the Scattered Bones, a group of assassins that only kill evil people and convinces them to off Alisha as she would sacrifice her own people for her ideals. They agree. Now the show presents this as the Bones being used to kill Alisha by the evil Bartlow, but quite frankly I absolutely agree with his motives. As far as I know, Bartlow is a man in position of power charged with defending his country from another powerful country that contains hostile factions. His actions make perfect logical sense, even having Alisha eliminated, as she really does threaten the nation\'s safety with her naivety. Alisha of course survived because of plot armour and dependence of Soray, and story moves on with Bartlow clearly meant to be the bad guy. Let me back up my point. For those that have watched the first season, think about the fight between Hyland and Rolance at the end of the season. Hyland\'s troops, as they approached their border were drawn into battle with Rolance, and then ambushed from behind their own border by another division of Rolance troops. Rolance clearly had planned to attack Hyland regardless of Alisha\'s or Bartlow\'s decision. Now, four things happen here that serve to make me hate Alisha even more. 1. Despite Rolance\'s actions she still goes to the commander in charge to stop the fighting. As a bonus she does deservedly get stabbed, but then 2. Plot armour! She\'s totally fine despite quite literally being gutted. 3. She is ultimately totally useless and needs Soray to save her country and her sorry ass. If you are confused what I mean by this, I\'ll explain. Rolance had successfully ambushed Hyland\'s forces, and Rolance\'s Generals were clearly very confident of victory. Taking that into account we can assume that Hyland would\'ve lost and then next thing Alisha would know is that Rolance is knocking on Lady Lake\'s holier-than thou doors.And 4. Despite all of that, she learns nothing, at all. Because she was saved by Soray she doesn\'t seem to think for even a second that maybe she was in fact wrong and should compromise with Bartlow. Nope, to her this is proof from the Gods above (or Seraphim or whatever) that she is truly righteous.Now, I said I\'d explain myself, and I will. Lets sweep the floor clean first. I am not sexist. Couldn\'t care less if a powerful character is male of female. However Alisha and her posse of overpowered peaches is exactly how you do female empowerment wrong. Add Soray to lord over them all and you\'ve got a winning formula invalidating everything your character is and does, as well as pissing off half the audience.To set it out, this is my issue with Alisha and her posse and why I find them so irritating. Other than them all thinking Alisha is God\'s own gift (I get that she\'s their princess, so I can forgive them that) they all share this certain dynamic in Alisha\'s command structure. All of her second in commands, as well as her \'master\', are chicks who are inexplicably, insanely adept at killing things, as well as being physically stronger than any other trained knight on the battlefield. It doesn\'t make sense and the sheer abundance of it seen in this show is annoying. All of her men are just tools to look stupid and die pointlessly, temporarily making her feel bad until she thinks what would Soray do and then spouts some cheesy one liner. In fact its instances like the ones when a bunch of her men die after she tells them not to kill any of her characters that makes what Bartlow said to the Scattered Bones at the start so true, and the fact that there is never any come-upance or reckoning for Alisha is too hard to swallow.Back to topic, its a difficult thing to explain, but the majority of women in this series don\'t feel like powerful characters in their own right (or even characters in their own right), instead it seems like they are tokens, stuck in there for the sole purpose of putting some strong females in the script, except that they\'re not because Soray is the only one who can get shit done apparently. It\'s annoying, pointless and poorly thought out. Rose is a character done well in this manner, if not done well overall. Alisha and her posse are there to satisfy the modern political correctness in anime that girls have to be powerful, except when they\'re not.In the end its an accumulation of fairly minor details like this that just multiply the effect and  make Alisha such a poor character, in her own right and through the interactions with those she surrounds herself with.Well, I\'m done. Seems like this review turned into more of a messy dump than I thought it would, but I hope by this point you got the gist.Overall this series gets a 5/10, mediocre. The only reason for this being the sound and art. I personally care a lot about animation and sound design in anime, if I didn\'t I\'d read manga or light novels, however as it stands I do care, and that is the only reason this show rates as high as it does for me.Now, this was my first review, so critique is welcome.Cheers.', 'Does doing a necessary evil still make you good?, can you ever eliminate all evil?The second season of Tales of Zestiria the X was for LA a decent improvement from the first season merely since the first season was essentially setting everything and LA does EVERYTHING up, from it\'s characters, settings, major plotlines and slight character developments, the second season more or less gives resolutions to many of those major plotlines that was established in the first season.So this second season is much more character heavy and LA says this in a good way as we focus on two of the major characters that already...established some character arcs from the first season, Rose and Alisha. Rose is up first and is about her revenge to which her beliefs of doing a necessary evil makes her evil or not and obviously this goes in conflict with Sorey\'s beliefs because of it and to be honest, Rose was greatly developed in this second season because of it, not only because she causes conflict to the main protagonist but her beliefs also  make Sorey question his own venture of wanting to purify all malevolence. Rose was given the entire backstory department and to WHY she wants revenge and why you can sympathize with her to root for her revenge as well as helping some characters revolving around her, mainly Dezel voiced by Daisuke Ono and why he\'s pushing Rose to her goal of revenge, like if anything, the second season really devoted half of the second season to Rose and again this isn\'t a bad thing, she was fleshed out and for LA, she was the best developed character in the series because of it, no kidding, now onto one of LA\'s favorite characters, Alisha, well her character arc that was still going on from the first season was due to her ideological and political conflict between the asshole Bartlow and it ends pretty swiftly compared to how fleshed out Rose\'s debacle but nonetheless Alisha\'s resolution to the political struggle was finally ended...even though it was kinda an anticlimax especially to Bartlow\'s demise, just come on, not even a satisfying death!!!, anyways Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season definitely improved in the character department and more or less kept LA""s investment in the series that much better, nonetheless Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season had some flaws, much like it\'s first season.With it\'s character development, Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season definitely added more to it\'s world building, much like it\'s first season did, like Sorey and the rest of the gang though split up, develop their world building, be it a new country and their problems with the malevolence and better yet we at least get more development to Sorey and his powers and how it extends to the seraphims and his new appointed squires and how they operate towards Sorey being the Shepherd and they played around with it and utilized it later on to great effect. Also something that LA criticized the first season about the entire subplotline of Velvet Crowe FINALLY goes full circle in a ways and is something of world building backstory revolving around malevolence in general which GREATLY helped and LA is sure Velvet has her own game to be the main protagonist in so Velvet not getting involved in this second season, LA can see why, but the flavour text helps nonetheless.So this second season has the occasional pacing problems but LA will defend this flaw by at least saying the character arcs developing and fleshing out it\'s characters was much appreciated. Like LA aforementioned from Alisha\'s anticlimax towards Bartlow, well to be honest due to Sorey\'s beliefs causes almost all the anticlimaxes, yes including Rose\'s due to his involvement and heck LA might as well say that Sorey as a character is rather annoying, always holier than thou and pacifistic white knight-like nature deflates ALOT of the character arc climaxes, BUT at least whenever it involves the hellion and dragon fights, those climaxes are at least balances it out, but the anticlimaxes still can\'t be ignored. Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season also felt liked it was almost rushing towards it\'s final arc involving the Lord of Calamity as well but that a bit later. Finally would be since Tales of Zestiria goes into classic RPG style, it\'s villains are also the same, Rose\'s villain to Bartlow were comically the typical royal douchebag villain characters ESPECIALLY BARTLOW for how much of scumbag asshole he is and they are just evil, nothing else, kinda weird since the LORD OF CALAMITY seemed to have less of an ""evil for evil sakes"", than the human villains, yeah even though the villainy department of the anime is cliche and typical...LA REALLY can\'t defend this flaw in any way. The second season\'s flaws don\'t completely cripple the anime as it\'s strengths still hold up for LA at least but it feels a bit more pronounced in this season as well.The animation done once again by ufotable, well it\'s typical, well detailed and extremely blended CGI at it\'s finest, LA really doesn\'t need to say much as it\'s basically the same criticism LA talked about in LA\'s first season, crisp and distinct character designs, awesomely done battles, well executed CGI, utofable consistent quality, what else.Now here\'s something different, LA looked at the English dub by Funimation and yeah there isn\'t much to really say about this dub, LA really liked, it, almost felt seamless from the Japanese, having the inflictions and cadences of the majority of the characters their due, Robbie Daymond as Sorey for LA was a bit hard to used to as his cadence wavered and fluctuated at times but Robbie grew on LA later on. LA watched the dub for about half the second season then switched to the last half to Japanese just to see if it was seamless and it was. LA will give major props to BOTH Mikako Komatsu and Caitlin Glass as Rose as she was the best MVP of this second season due to her character arc and of course LA will give Alexis Tipton and Ai Kayano as Alisha major props as well. BOTH Japanese and English dub casts was great and LA would say to watch on either and especially for dub, they pretty much reprised their video game counterparts so there\'s that too so a decent A rank for the dub.So the finale, or more or less Sorey and the rest of the gang ACTUALLY facing off with the Lord Calamity and we get some backstory to how he came to be and again he was a much more sympathetic villain than the human villains, the fight against him was crazy while still holding to Sorey\'s beliefs and the game\'s beliefs with that fight and though the final fight lead into a ""sorta"" anticlimax the  fight was nonetheless awesome. Now this goes into the ending and it was something of a sombre ending giving us a full conclusions to the main cast as it were, BUT those final moments of the series made it kinda a ""cliched happy ending"" but the ending left on a good note anyways.Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season massively improved from it\'s second season with it\'s greatly fleshed out characters of Rose and Alisha and the conflict of beliefs towards Sorey and just made the investment to watching the anime that much better and engaging, but from this came an onslaught of anticlimaxes and somewhat nearly rushed pacing at times, cliched royal asshole villains but LA can give this second season some grace as it\'s strengths of greatly fleshed out character development, world building and awesome battles and production value typical from ufotable and a decent nicely tied up ending that outweighed it\'s weaknessness.Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season got zestier for sure but gotten it\'s own new set of flaws different from it\'s first season as a result and LA stands by ufotable with this adaptation of Tales of Zestiria as a whole, it was nicely adapted, sure it has flaws but the experience watching the both seasons was still satisfying for someone who\'s never played ANY Tales games left a good impression on LA and LA WANTS to play the games and if that was the mindset of LA after watching a video to anime adaptation was LA wanting to play the games and liked the anime adaptation afterwards, then it did it\'s job and Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season did it\'s job very well. established some character arcs from the first season, Rose and Alisha.

I decided to review this one because i have played the game, both berseria and zestiria, and try to compare it with the game. Without further ado, here it goesStory: 7/10I really like the story in the anime, compared to the game, which i will not spoil. It takes a different route compared to the story which in my opinion is very fresh and great, and no certain someone is booted from anywhere. It goes very steadily at the first 10 episodes. However, when you talk about the pacing in the last 3 episodes, the pacing seems...rushed, forcing you towards the end. Normally i don\'t like taking too long in the episodes, but for Zestiria\'s pacing before the last 3 episodes, it should\'ve take longer. Maybe another season would be nice, but that\'s my opinion. I like the Berseria tie-ins very VERY much, but i feel like ufotable is mocking me with all the reference. Berseria is through and through a prequel to the series, so in my opinion, the events must be explained, at least until i understand what\'s going on. There\'s even a chance in the episodes where everything can be explained by a single person, yet the anime completely ignores it.Art 10/10 Sound 8/10This is an ufotable anime, so this level of quality of art and sound is expected. The art is very detailed and visual effects are superb, a very movie-like quality. The sound, compared to other ufotable works, is good, but not as a good compared as Fate/zero or Kara no Kyoukai.Character 8/10The characterization in this anime is actually better than the game. You can see progress seeping out of each of the main characters. And, no one is just booted out like that from the party, which is nice. Each character is not boring, even the secondary characters gets their chance to shine.Enjoyment 8/10I thoroughly had fun while watching this. I had my moments of ""Holy cow! this is awesome!"" Mainly because of the story goes and the visual effects. Also, the pacing is also one of my main reasons why i enjoyed it. It steadily goes on grabbing your hand and telling the events very nicely. It also steadily tells the story by getting very good build-ups and very calming cooldows in a couple of episodes. Once again, these last 3 episodes did not have a good build up, especially nearing the end, and that decreases the enjoyment in my opinion.Overall score:8/10All in all, this anime is very good, refreshing, and a superb experience to those who like the fantasy series. Ufotable has done this series justice, and the studio has made this anime a superior version of the game, in my opinion. So, overall, i like this anime and has made a good impression for fans of the game such as i.Thank you for readingNote:English is not my primary language, so there may be errors in the review grammar wise.

The visuals were as expected from ufotable, the sound was appropriate, the characters were defined well enough and, most of all, the threats and challenges presented to the characters (specifically the lord of calamity, dragons, and the strain that purifications put on Sorey)  were shown to be something that the new, inexperienced heroes couldn\'t even TRY challenging. The show\'s world, logic, and power differentials between characters were all well established and I was decently excited to watch this...new series. What even happened between then and now? Keep in mind that I will constantly be mentioning the last season, and will not explain anything that that season did, so watch that before this, m\'kay? Mm\'kay.Story: well, i gave it a 4The last season\'s story set up a large, epic adventure that could easily span several seasons beyond this, though it was quite cliched. However, that shouldn\'t have mattered, as the one thing the Tales series is known for above all else is their strong main cast of characters that get better as they get time to develop. Despite this, this series starts off at a slow, boring pace that somehow manages to brush past the setup of last season and ends up with the entire thing being way too rushed and arriving at a conclusion way before it actually earns it. The dragons, malevolence, and Lord of Calamity were all impossibly powerful in comparison to our new Shepard, but in the span of less than a month, he can somehow (DO SOMETHING THAT IS CONSIDERED SPOILER TERRITORY) without any meaningful effort. I\'ll get into Sorey when that section comes. For now, I\'ll just say that I was at least able to force myself through the show, and I have a pretty low tolerance for bull, so do with that as you will.Art: 8. Yeah, ufotable was slackingI was not impressed by the art at all (btw, I consider the visual part of the OP to be art, as well as other things that have to do with directing, as there isn\'t really a section for that on MAL\'s review guidelines).  Of course, it did look good, but it was much more boring bland, and stiff that what I\'ve come to expect from ufotable. The fights and such were usually spectacular, with the CGI integration being a bit inconsistent, with it sometimes being good, and other times looking not very good. The other scenes (you know, 70% of the show), had no visual style or flair and made me want to skip them. There were no longer any beautiful backgrounds or interesting indoor sets to look at while the characters just sat around, it was excruciating. The OP was significantly worse that the last seasons\'s, in my opinion. I just didn\'t have anything interesting to look at. I skipped it almost every time. The ED, however, I never skipped. It looked very good when it was moving and the still shots made me feel like they were trying to convey something about what they were showing. It also reflected the darker tone of this season compared to the last one, as the entirely chill and heartwarming ED of last season was replaced with shots of the characters struggling to fight against their foes and showing their unwillingness to back down. Speaking of the last ED, there are several shots and scenes in the show that mirror it and have the same sort of tone, which I really like. I also love how they integrate those random conversations from the games into their next episode previews. As a fan of the series (albeit a minor one), I was ecstatic that they included those.The score for art still is high because of the brief but constant scenes of fantastic looking action, which is the least that I expect from ufotable.Sound: oh god. (2)It\'s so bad. I personally didn\'t like the OP song at all. The ED managed to keep me occupied enough, as it is  FLOW, who rarely disappoint me. The reason this is so low, though, is due to how the music was used in scenes. These ""epic"" scenes of the Shepard and his comrades fighting off there great evils are undermined by music that just doesn\'t do anything but act as background noise. It;s absolutely ATROCIOUS in some places. The sound effects weren\'t even good, this being in the same season as Youjo Senki, which had no problems at all in this department, with every attack feeling powerful and significant. The voice acting was good out of the main cast, with nobody from the main eight having poor of slacking VAs, but they didn\'t really try to stand out or do especially amazing. They put the requisite amount of work in. The other VAs were not as solid. there were some moments that they simply didn\'t do a good job, along with one or two slip ups from the main cast as were. I\'ll let you decide when, where, and who.Character: what a disappointment. 6/10The one reason that this section was doomed from the start is how rushed the story moves along. The only two characters with any meaningful growth were Rose and Dezel. My favorite character, Edna, only got two lines regarding advancements in her subplot. Sorey had some well done development In the first season with him changing from a naive kid to a naive kid with a thorough understanding of the hardships that he is destined to deal with, and that he cannot deal with the Age of Calamities by himself. It was made VERY clear that Sorey and his comrades were not very strong in the grand scale of things. He was ready to grow drastically into a very good character, or act as an anchor to the other character\'s development, but no. The other characters get NOTHING. The closest to development that the other\'s get is Lailah with her backstory that only references her in name. With this it\'s obvious that the story changed from the game. A tales game would never let their characters stay as they are,Enjoyment: 4. I have to wait until Apr 29 until I can finally say i\'m done with this series? Ugh.Overall: 55 is not bad. 7 is not average, 5 is. a 5/10 is simply not worth watching. A 7/10 is what is expected from a series that people are expected to watch. The only reason this number doesn\'t round down is due to the action\'s visuals and how much I enjoy the banter between the characters from the last season. Anyway, thanks for reading, even if you just skipped until here. If there is anything you happen to want to point out or discuss, go ahead and message me, assuming this site has that feature. I don\'t actually know. Also message me if you thing I can improve my reviews, i appreciate your time. new series. What even happened between then and now?

It looked very good when it was moving and the still shots made me feel like they were trying to convey something about what they were showing. It also reflected the darker tone of this season compared to the last one, as the entirely chill and heartwarming ED of last season was replaced with shots of the characters struggling to fight against their foes and showing their unwillingness to back down. Speaking of the last ED, there are several shots and scenes in the show that mirror it and have the same sort of tone, which I really like. I also love how they integrate those random conversations from the games into their next episode previews. As a fan of the series (albeit a minor one), I was ecstatic that they included those.The score for art still is high because of the brief but constant scenes of fantastic looking action, which is the least that I expect from ufotable.Sound: oh god. (2)It\'s so bad. I personally didn\'t like the OP song at all. The ED managed to keep me occupied enough, as it is  FLOW, who rarely disappoint me. The reason this is so low, though, is due to how the music was used in scenes. These ""epic"" scenes of the Shepard and his comrades fighting off there great evils are undermined by music that just doesn\'t do anything but act as background noise. It;s absolutely ATROCIOUS in some places. The sound effects weren\'t even good, this being in the same season as Youjo Senki, which had no problems at all in this department, with every attack feeling powerful and significant. The voice acting was good out of the main cast, with nobody from the main eight having poor of slacking VAs, but they didn\'t really try to stand out or do especially amazing. They put the requisite amount of work in. The other VAs were not as solid. there were some moments that they simply didn\'t do a good job, along with one or two slip ups from the main cast as were. I\'ll let you decide when, where, and who.Character: what a disappointment. 6/10The one reason that this section was doomed from the start is how rushed the story moves along. The only two characters with any meaningful growth were Rose and Dezel. My favorite character, Edna, only got two lines regarding advancements in her subplot. Sorey had some well done development In the first season with him changing from a naive kid to a naive kid with a thorough understanding of the hardships that he is destined to deal with, and that he cannot deal with the Age of Calamities by himself. It was made VERY clear that Sorey and his comrades were not very strong in the grand scale of things. He was ready to grow drastically into a very good character, or act as an anchor to the other character\'s development, but no. The other characters get NOTHING. The closest to development that the other\'s get is Lailah with her backstory that only references her in name. With this it\'s obvious that the story changed from the game. A tales game would never let their characters stay as they are,Enjoyment: 4. I have to wait until Apr 29 until I can finally say i\'m done with this series? Ugh.Overall: 55 is not bad. 7 is not average, 5 is. a 5/10 is simply not worth watching. A 7/10 is what is expected from a series that people are expected to watch. The only reason this number doesn\'t round down is due to the action\'s visuals and how much I enjoy the banter between the characters from the last season. Anyway, thanks for reading, even if you just skipped until here. If there is anything you happen to want to point out or discuss, go ahead and message me, assuming this site has that feature. I don\'t actually know. Also message me if you thing I can improve my reviews, i appreciate your time.', ""Watching this as someone who had played both of the games it is based on, I can safely say that this anime is better sequel to Tales of Berseria than the eponymous game.That said there are a few very jarring inconsistencies between the story here and the story of ToB. I will not describe them here to avoid spoilers but let's just say that, among other things, Zaveid would not be happy to discover that dragons can in fact be purified.The story is also quite different  from the Tales of Zestiria game, especially in this season, where pretty much the only common point is...Sorey defeating the bad guy. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I would have loved to see some of the other locations and plotlines from the game, though that would require a longer run that the 25 episodes.As for the characters, I think that they were majorly improved compared to the game. I know that a lot of reviewers consider them to be pretty weak, but as someone who spent the 50+ hours necessary to complete the game I was overjoyed to find that Mikleo and Dezel were actually given personalities. The only one who was downgraded was Edna, who spent the entire game snarking at everyone and there is seriously not enough of that in the anime.The art and sound are both amazing and the pace picks up a bit compared to the first season. I honestly can't judge the anime from the position of someone unfamiliar with the lore, so I can't say whether they would like it, but if you played ToB and want to know what happened with the world afterward, give it a watch. It's shorter than the game at least. Sorey defeating the bad guy.

Since it tackles human emotions, the capability of human to destroy things cause by their greed, by their selfishness, it really captures my excitement. However, the continuation of this anime kinda disappoints me. Though it still focuses on what the first one is, there are questions that failed to found its answers. It feels like something is missing. Some valuable explanation has been left unsaid, which I think I can find in the game itself. Still, I like how all of the characters made...their way to do the right thing even if it means sacrificing their very existence.CHARACTERS: 7/10The characters are too perfect, now that I think about it. Except for Rose who show her hate, her pain, her loneliness. The main protagonist is too good to be true. He is innocent and kind and good natured that it is too hard to believe. Well maybe, that's the very reason he became the shepherd. The unending forgiveness and understanding. I think, the character of Velvet which belong to a promotional videos (2 episodes) is great. She's like a ravage beast killing someone who stops her objective but also hides her pain using that.ANIMATION AND SOUND: 10/10There's no doubt that the animation is great. The action scenes are really something and the angle of it are very well shown. The voices of the character perfectly matches the expression they're making, it's incredible. It's song is catchy and entertaining to listen to, you'll be persuaded to watch it.ENJOYMENT: 9/10Naturally, I really enjoyed it. Apart from the fact that is has an almost perfect animation, it's story is really interesting. Though I can't really think of a genre much more interesting that humans' mentality. The one thing thats really aggravating is the hanging questions of mine which I really don't get an answer to.ENDING: 7/10Combining all of the seraphims in one body is kinda lame, sorry. It's cute though. Maybe it will look cool if after that fusion, something new will come out of it. Like a new skill or what? Like something unexpected will draw out of it. That's just my opinion. But the real question of mine is why it ended like that? It feels like I'm watching a shounen-ai and yuri in the end. There's no need to be that close, isn't it? Or are they really ended up together? their way to do the right thing even if it means sacrificing their very existence.CHARACTERS: 7/10The characters are too perfect, now that I think about it.

This season continues to expand upon both of what was established in the game itself and what was introduced and expanded upon in the previous season. As I have yet to complete the game that acts as the anime’s source material I have no idea whether it still follows the game or not but in any case, this season continues the journey that Sorey...and his seraph friends embarked upon in the previous season as they try to stop the lord of calamity from bringing eternal darkness and despair to the land.While the previous season was largely set in the country of Hyland this season features much more different countries and environments that Sorey and his party get to visit. These include the country that served as the enemy last season which is the Rolance empire and the northern lands of the continent. While the main story itself is still very much focused on stopping the lord of calamity the anime’s story also has a number of subplots that are interlinked between the main plot and have consequences in the main plot.The overall plot of Tales of Zestiria the X2 like the previous season follows the adventures of Sorey the newest incarnation of the Shepard an ancient hero that has the ability to both see and interact with spiritual beings called Seraphs and use these beings to aid him in battle. The main role of a Shepard is to cleanse instances of malevolence that have taken root in the world and to ultimately confront the source of it which is the lord of calamity. While the first season served to establish both the world that this series takes place in as well as establish the individual characters and their respective skills and personalities with relation to their roles in the party this season was more focused on dealing with the effects that the malevolence has had on various people and closing in on the source of this which is the lord of calamity. In addition to the main plot this season also has a number of sub plots that help establish characters that have already appeared in the series while also changing some so that their roles in the story are better.SoreySorey played by veteran voice actor Ryouhei Kimura of Angel Beats fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the protagonist of the story. A kind, honest and caring person that tries to believe in the best of humanity Sorey is an adamant believer in diplomacy and prefers to converse with others to try and stop conflicts with diplomacy rather than settle them with physical might. Even before Sorey become a shepherd Sorey could see the spiritual beings known as seraphs that inhabitant the world alongside that of humans. While kind and positive Sorey is also a determined person that doesn’t tolerate injustice of any kind and will try to stand up for those that are too weak to do it themselves. While preferring to avoid combat Sorey is however still an able combatant that can easily knock out enemies quite easily. As a shepherd Sorey takes his duties seriously and perhaps a little too seriously. When confronted with impurities that are caused by the malevolence Sorey will always try to purify them even when the alternative of ending their lives would have been many times easier. In a way, this personality trait of his is what defines Sorey and makes him really stand out. Sorey is someone that values friendship and dialogue more than others and as a result he is someone that can get on well with most people no matter which country they are from. This is helped by the fact that Sorey is an understanding person that tries to understand what ails a person. In the previous season Sorey was very much still learning about his role as a shepherd. As a result, Sorey at that time was more brash in his actions yet at the same time somewhat reluctant and hesitant in his new role with regards to purification.Though this season takes place only a few weeks after the first season ended we can see that in this season we can see that Sorey has grown more confident in his role as a shepherd and yet at the same time developed a sense of caution that tampers his love of exploration and the taking of risks. The reluctance that seemed to bother Sorey though not actually gone has been replaced with a determination to find out what caused the lord of calamity to be borne and deal with that to protect the world. Abilities wise in the second season Sorey has been shown to be much more proficient in his use of weapons and using the abilities of his allies when he armatizises with his seraph allies.RoseRose voiced by veteran seiyuu Mikako Komatsu of Re creator’s fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Sorey’s allies in the story. While Rose was a support character in the first season in this season she is given more of a main role as she is important to the story. A young woman that Sorey and co encounter back in the first season Rose was a part of a large guild of merchants that often sold their wares in different locations due to the fact that the continent that they were on was in the middle of a war. Because of this profession Rose was a cheerful, positive and polite person that was also a bit sneaky. However, beneath this positive personality of hers was another personality that she adapted when she became an assassin. In this alternate personality Rose is logical, serious and lethal and only cares about fulfilling her mission. In this we can see that Rose actually takes a lot of pride in her work as an assassin. Rose is someone that believes heavily in the idea of justice and as a result is someone that can’t tolerate people that flaunt the law which also expands to those in power as to her their positions give them the means of circumventing the law. Back in the first season Rose was one person that didn’t completely believe in Sorey’s role as a shepherd yet at the same time she was able to sense the existence of a spirit near her. In this season after the events of the first season we can see that Rose now believes that Sorey really is the shepherd though she also uses every opportunity to use him to help her business.One aspect of Rose that was hinted upon back in the first season and expanded upon in this season was how popular and how respected she is by the merchants that she crosses paths with and how they are akin to a family than anything. One of the subplots that forms a part of the series narrative is one that shows Rose’s past and what her childhood was like. This subplot I felt was really well done as it allowed us as the viewers to see what Rose’s childhood was like and what caused her to turn into the person that she is now.  This act also helped introduce Rose to the work that Sorey does and helped reaffirm the faith that she had lost in humanity as a result of what had happened in her childhood. All in all, I felt that Rose as a character was well designed and it was nice seeing her character evolve as the series went on. I felt that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu really did a fantastic job portraying her.LailahLailah voiced by veteran seiyuu Noriko Shitaya of Fate Stay Night fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a seraph companion of Sorey and one of his chief advisers. A long living seraph that had served the previous shepherd before coming to serve Sorey Lailah is a kind, caring and wise person whose long life means that she has seen a great many things and has acquired a great deal of knowledge of various matters. Despite being centuries old Lailah still looks someone that’s in the early days of adulthood. As the senior seraph within Sorey’s party Lailah often acts as the voice of reason and calm for Sorey and advises him on the best path and course of action that can be taken. Patience and warm are perhaps the best words that can be used to describe her. In the first season Lailah’s main role was to tamper the inexperienced Sorey and introduce him to the role of a shepherd slowly while making sure that he is learning. Now that Sorey has gained a degree of experience in his role and more understanding of his role ins season 2 Lailah’s role is more like an adviser than a teacher yet her knowledge is still something that the cast relies on. Like all seraphs Lailah is also an able combatant with her attack style making use of pages from a book that she uses that uses the element of fire to enhance her attacks. This I felt was a nice match to both her personality as a wise and long-lived person and her status as a fire seraph. I felt that Noriko Shitaya really did a good job portraying the character of Lailah.MikleoMikleo voiced by veteran voice actor Ryota Osaka of Valvrave The liberator fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Sorey’s seraph companions and allies. A childhood friend of Sorey as they grew up in the seraph village together Mikleo’s character is a contrast to Sorey’s character both in terms of attitude and in personality. Mikleo is a calm, level headed and considerate person that prefers to observe situations and consider all possible outcomes to a situation before making his move. As a result of this personality Mikleo serves as another of Sorey’s advisers alongside that of Lailah. As childhood friends Mikleo has a very strong bond of friendship with Sorey and while there are often times when they don’t see eye to eye on certain matters they always ended up resolving this when Sorey’s hunches proved to be correct. Back in the first season it become apparent that except for Sorey Mikleo doesn’t hold humanity in general in high regards and as a result does not place much trust in them as he believes that they can be corrupted far too easily.Though his meetings with characters like Alisha and Rose and in this season with the king of Roland have done much to show him that perhaps within the race are humans that have a strong enough personality and determination that will enable them to stand strong against the malevolence Mikleo’s views have so far only changed a little. Still while still early it is nice to see that Mikleo as a result of this has managed to forge friendships with both Alisha and Rose. A recurring event that continues from the first season is the little byplay and arguments that take place between Mikleo and his fellow seraph Edna that stems from the fact that at first Edna did not respect him that much and often lumped tasks to him. However, in this season while certainly still present the battles that both have been through as they protected Sorey have managed to forge a bond between the two that allows them to respect the skills of each other. While the bickering between the two is still present it’s far less seen and instead in its place it is a bond that is built on trust.EdnaEdna voiced by veteran seiyuu Misato Fukuen of Aokana Four Rhythm across the blue and Darker Than Black fame is one of the main characters of the anime and is one of Sorey’s seraph allies. A young woman of somewhat short stature that however has a personality that contrasts her appearance. Personality wise Edna is a quiet, blunt and direct person who isn’t afraid of speaking her mind to matters. However, this doesn’t mean that she is heartless or cruel as when Edna is warmed up to someone she can be warm and compassionate to them as well. Like most seraphs Edna has lived for a great many years and as a result she has had the opportunity the observe the human race and its progress that it’s made over the years. As a result of these actions Edna did not have a very high opinion of human’s due to their actions that caused her brother to become a dragon. In the previous season Edna had a notable personality trait which was the fact that she had a dislike of humans in general which often caused her to be rather icy towards them when she encounters them. As a result of the actions that she has seen them do both in the previous season and in this season however her opinion of them has changed quite a bit and now it can be seen that she has developed a sense of respect for them. I felt that her seiyuu Misato Fukuen did a great job portraying the character of Edna.DezelDezel voiced by veteran voice actor Daisuke Ono of Denpa Kyoushi and Attack on Titan fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Sorey’s seraph allies. A seraph with the ability to manipulate the power of the wind Dezel is a character that’s been Rose’s shadow and protector since she was little and in a way, shares a deep bond with her. Though a quiet person by nature Dezel shares many of the traits that define Rose’s personality such as her determination, tenacity and most importantly her belief in justice and the desire to bring justice to those that have avoided it due to their rank and position. Though a seraph and an ally of Sorey and the party Dezel’s most important duty that he sees is the protection of Rose which is borne out of an agreement that he had made with Rose’s adaptive father Brad. Though usually quiet and not one that can be seen to take part in rash actions there are times when Dezel can get angry enough with someone that he slips his personality bounds and when in this mode he can be overly aggressive. For the most part, however this is very rare and his default personality is a quiet and reserved person who only speaks when he has something useful to say. Dezel’s most prominent trait is of course loyalty to both Rose and to Sorey and while the former is probably the strongest one the latter is still just as strong. Though Sorey and Dezel did not have much interaction in the previous season it can be seen that in this season Dezel has at last developed a bond that is built on a degree of trust as both want Rose to have a happy life which can’t happen until the source of evil in the world which is the lord of calamity is dealt with.AlishaAlisha voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Anohana and School live fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Sorey’s human allies. A teenage girl and the daughter of the king of Hyland which makes her a princess Alisha is very loyal to her country and its people. Her loyalty to the people and country however has made her a problem for some of its politicians who look down on her beliefs and her loyalty to the people and as a result Alisha often finds herself dealing with them. Personality wise Alisha is a kind, caring and honorable young woman that can also be stubborn when she tries to help people. This trait of hers is one of the many things that I admire about her. The personality traits of Alisha’s and the fact that she actively cares about the people means that much of her countries people actually respect her and look up to her as a shining example of what a ruler should be. Although not a seraph and not having special abilities like they and Sorey have Alisha is still a capable fighter because as part of her training as a princess she was also trained as a knight by some of the best knights within the kingdom. In terms of martial might Alisha is well versed in the use of the spear and can fight reasonably well by herself.Though not explored as such in the previous season the sub story arc that was created for Alisha in this season also highlighted and introduced several traits that also helped define her character. In the previous season Alisha’s belief in the existence of Seraphs and in the existence of Shepherds served as part of her motivation for her actions but in doing so this also made her look inadequate in the face of the threats that Sorey and the others had to deal with. As a result of seeing her determination to help people and also help them as well Alisha and Sorey through Lailah established a pact in which she is able to both see seraphs and also have some of the power that Sorey has in merging with them. though only usable in times when Sorey and Alisha fight together this makes Alisha more capable in providing support to Sorey especially in the later parts of this season. While on her own she is still a capable combatant I thought that it was nice seeing Alisha get the extra offensive power that this ability provided.As a result of the sub arc that was used in this season Alisha and her men found themselves pursued by a vastly superior enemy force that beats them in both numbers and equipment and as a result Alisha and her men had to use creative tactics to stay one step ahead of them in order to achieve their goals. In this we can see that while an dependable leader Alisha is also one that can inspire and command loyalty within her men while at the same time remaining both determined and resolute in her beliefs. Arguably the most important of her traits is her restraint in that while killing the one mastermind behind the troubles in her kingdom may have been the wisest and perhaps easiest choice it will however not be the best choice as the effects that it can have can be unpredictable. Being able to think of the after effects to both the kingdom and her people and not just the initial effects is what truly defines her. All in all, I felt that Alisha was a pretty well-designed character and that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did a great job portraying her.Ian and SirelIan and Sirel voiced by new seiyuu Yuri Ehara and veteran seiyuu Masumi Tazawa are support characters and are fellow knights of Alisha that serve as her trusted subordinates. As knights of Hyland’s military both are extremely skilled in combat despite their young age with Ian being an expert archer and Sirel being a capable swordswoman. As with all of Alisha’s men both Ian and Sirel are very loyal to their princess and respect her a great deal. While neither has encountered Sorey before it can be seen that both believe in the legend of the shepherd and as such both though skeptical of his abilities to a degree still believe that he has the ability to restore order back to this world. Arguably both of these characters bring to the plot a degree of comedy to the series as despite being friends they often argue with each other about the most trivial of matters often involving Alisha in their arguments as well.Previous ShepardThe previous shepherd who had the name of Michael who was voiced by veteran voice actor Satoshi Hino of Naruto and Overlord fame is a support character of the series that is nonetheless an important character for the main plot. Michael was a shepherd and was the direct predecessor of Sorey and was Lailah’s previous master to which she also acted as an adviser. It is through his hard work that the world was able to enter a period of peace before the darkness once again returned. From what can be seen of his personality Michael appears to be a calm, honorable and compassionate man that cares a great deal about people and life whether its human or seraph. He also seems to value loyalty and honesty among not just his friends but also his allies and expects the same from them to him as well. As a result of these qualities of him it can be seen that Michael was well loved by much of the people and that they had a great deal of respect for him. Although Sorey never actually met Michael as he was deceased long before Sorey came into the world Sorey was able to understand a little about his personality thanks to Lailah and it can be seen that Sorey had a degree of respect for him as like him he too fought for a world where humans and Seraphs can live in peace with each other. In terms of impact I felt that the idea to introduce the previous shepherd into the story in an idea to allow not just Sorey but the rest of cast as well to determine the origin of the main villain was an interesting move and one that succeeded from a story writers view.Sergei and GouldmanSergei Strelka and Gouldman who are voiced by veteran voice actors Hideyuki Hori and Kentarou Itou are two support characters that Sorey and party meet during their visit to the Rolance empire. Both are knights of the country that are both loyal, steadfast and command great loyalty upon their men. Though both are knights Sergei and Gouldman actually serve different knight orders with one being in the military and one serving the church. The age-old rivalry that exists between a state and a church that is not commonly seen in anime is here cleverly put in.  Though both are loyal to the country it can be seen that this can work in two ways as the church being the spiritual heart of a country can also be called the heart of the country much like the monarchy that rules the kingdom can be seen as well. The two characters while disliking each other do however respect each other and the contrast between the two was interesting to see. With regards to their interaction with Sorey Sergei at first viewed him with a little suspicion and perhaps hostility as to him he was someone that was powerful yet an unknown that had helped defeat his countrymen in battle. However, this hostility and suspicion was gradually replaced by a sense of respect and gratitude as Sergei was able to see just what kind of work Shepherds like Sorey were doing on behalf of the people. Overall these two characters I felt were good additions to the cast as they showed that no matter which country you are in there will always be people that are both loyal and patriotic to their country yet still remain true to their king and lord and retaining their sense of honor. The angle of the government vs the church though not often seen in animes was an interesting thing to put in as was seeing the church get humiliated by both Sorey and the king.Lord of CalamityThe lord of calamity voiced by veteran voice actor Takayuki Sugou is one of the main characters of the series and is the main villain of the anime. Though only seen briefly back in the first season the lord of calamity is very much expanded in this season both in terms of role and personality. Back in the first season the Lord of calamity was mainly used to show the difference in power that lay between him and Sorey at that time. Though only seen briefly we can see that at this point the lord of calamity’s personality is that of a menacing being that has an aura of menace in him while also conveying a sense of power and arrogance. It can be seen at this point that he considers not just Sorey but that of both seraphs and humans alike to be beings that are beneath him. It can also be seen that at this point his opinion of Sorey was not particularly high at this point. In This season, however the personality of the Lord of calamity is expanded upon significantly due to him being the main villain for the main plot. In this season, you can see that the lord of calamity is while still arrogant and menacing also displays a level of cunning and intelligence that makes him a powerful villain that’s not just powerful in terms of might but also in mind as well. Though he values loyalty in his subjects this is outweighed by his overriding goal to bring the world to its knees to the point where he will willingly sacrifice his own subjects if it means that he will gain an advantage even a temporary one.As a central part of the main plot for this season it was important that the main villain of the series as the lord of calamity was be fleshed out and given a personality that makes him stand out among the many evil characters that Sorey and Co must deal with. While the lord of calamity was briefly shown in the previous season not much of his personality was explored and as such while certainly a threat he was still an unknown. The insight into his personality as provided by the main plot of this season was interesting as was the look into his past and the events there that shaped him into what he would later become. I felt that this season really did a great job of showing the origins of the lord of calamity and established him as a villain that though evil was more of one that become what he was by his actions that was of his own doing than anything.Arts and animationIn terms of art I felt that the character designs for the series was pretty well done with each being largely faithful to the original source material. The designs for the new environments that the cast go through in this season which was the Rolance empire and the northern lands I felt were also well done and looked pretty different to what we had seen in the kingdom of Hyland. Additionally, the insight into the time period where both the previous shepherd Michael and the being that later become the lord of calamity both existed as humans was interesting as it allowed us to see what outfits people wore at the time. Animation as ever I felt was excellent as can be expected of the creators of Fate Stay Night. The fight scenes for this season I felt was pretty well done and had a good level of detail on them. This season also featured more purification scenes for Sorey and the cast with them notably getting larger as they have to deal with larger creatures. These scenes I felt were pretty detailed and featured a good mix of colors that contrasted nicely with the areas in which they took place in.MusicMusic for the series I felt was reasonably strong with both the opening and ending themes being my favorites. Individual scene music was also nicely done. The opening theme was which the song illuminate that was sung by veteran seiyuu Minami I felt was really grand and did a good job of creating a sense of excitement for the episode as you enter its world once more. The ending theme which was INNOSENSE which was sung by the band Flow I felt conveyed a sense of confidence and determination which is helped by the visuals that are shown in the ending vids. The contrast between these I felt was a nice touch.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was pretty well done which is helped by the fact that the series had a very capable voice cast. The seiyuu’s for the characters of Alisha, Lailah and Rose who are Ai Kayano, Noriko Shitaya and Mikako Komatsu as well as the voice actor for the Lord of Calamity as well as his human version I felt all did pretty good jobs in particular. The character of Alisha had a notably larger role in this season that she did in the previous season and the types of situations that she was put into this season meant that both her tone and emotions must be changed and adapted quite quickly to suit these situations and I felt that in this Ai Kayano did a great job of portraying the different sides of Alisha from the resolute and determined one in one scene to the more human and caring one in the other. The character of Rose like Alisha has a much larger role in this and due to the rather unique occurrence of having two different personalities her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu notably had a tougher role to play. However, in this I felt that she was able to portray both the positive and upbeat mask of her and the deeper and more logical and darker side to her reasonably well. She also did a great job of playing the more human version of her character that starts to show as she realizes that her actions do not reflect the thoughts that she has on her role. Other’s that deserved some praise was the voice actors for the king of Roland and Sergei as well as the voice actors for Ian and Sirel who I felt all managed to portray their characters pretty well.Overall conclusionIn conclusion, I felt that the second season of Tales of Zestiria X was a great follow-up to the first season. While the first season did an excellent job of creating the foundations of the world and its setting it also did the same for its characters as well as laying the foundations for the story. This season built upon this excellent foundation by reinforcing both of what was in the game itself and introduced in this anime.  While the overall plot of the first season was focused on introducing Sorey the new shepherd to both his duties as the shepherd and to the countries that are on the continent that they are on this season very much expanded upon that by both introducing new territories and also showing how much Sorey has improved both in terms of skills as a shepherd and in his beliefs as well. The overall plot of this season also as a result of the foundations now shifted to the task of addressing the source of the problems that Sorey and the party had been battling in the first season. Whilst the first season was more about learning about the lord of calamity and reacting to his moves this season was focused on determining what his plans were and stopping them before they could get any worst. A side effect of this was that it allowed Sorey and co the chance to explore new countries and meet new people that share their views. Watching all this and seeing them identify and deal with the causes of the malevolence was tremendously satisfying.  While the main plot was of course dealing with the lord of calamity the idea to actually discover his source through the diaries of the past shepherd I felt was an interesting move but one that fitted well with Sorey’s personality of preferring to understand a problem rather than solve it by might of arms. In this we get to both explore a time period that took place before Sorey was born and see not only what the world back then was like but also get to see what the previous shepherd and the lord was like. I felt that this was an interesting experience as it gave us a look into the personality of the previous shepherd who had saved the world before Sorey did and also see how he was regarded by the lands people and also see why Lailah held him in such high regard. Additionally, it also gave an interesting look into the original form of the lord of calamity and the circumstances that caused him to turn into that form. Using this opportunity to look into the causes for the lord of calamity’s creation I felt was a great move and fitted well with Sorey’s determination to purify all sources of malevolence rather than going the easy way of eliminating them. with regards to his origins I have to say that I was genuinely surprised by the events that caused him to transform into that form. As a result of Sorey and co visiting new countries and territories that they had yet to visit before they encountered a number of interesting characters like the King of Roland who despite his struggles with the church still managed to convey a sense of compassion and kindness that showed that he cared a great deal about his people and the characters of Sergei and Gouldman whose differences in order meant that they will be opposing each other despite both being loyal to Roland.  These characters I felt were interesting as they help give Rolance its own sense of identity and proves that no matter which country you are in there will always be people that will stand resolute against chaos and protect its people.The sub story arcs of which there were two in total I felt really did a good job of expanding upon the characters that they had as their focus which in this case is Alisha and Rose and the events there I felt also did a great job of not just developing their characters by introducing new personality traits but also in expanding and improving their existing ones as well.One thing that this season seemed to have more of was the act of purifying an area. While the previous season did a good job of introducing the concept of purification this season once again upped that by featuring it more while also increasing its scale as well. This I felt was a good way of showing just how much power Sorey has managed to attain through his hard work and training. The scale of the larger purification's I though was impressive. Tales of Zestiria has always been famed by for impressive fight scenes and this season is no exception with each of the fight scenes in this season being impressively detailed and animated with my favourite being the last battles of the series.The endings for any anime series has always been a tricky thing to do depending on how many characters you have and how the story ended but in this I was really impressed by how the series actually ended and how it managed to feature just about every one of the main and support characters in a future that’s both logical and makes sense. The way that they did it via the use of an ending within the episode I felt was an interesting way to do it as well. More importantly they also managed to use this to convey the true direction that they should go following the wishes of the shepherd that not just the two rulers but everyone knew and respected. In a way, I felt that this is probably one of the best endings I seen in a long time as it not only ended on a good note but also addressed both the many loose ends that the series had as well as showing the results of the bonds that individual characters have forged while also showing how their individual stories ended as well.All in all, I felt that the second season of Tales of Zestiria the x was a worthy improvement to the series that built upon the foundation that was established by the first season while also improving upon nearly all aspects of it. The strong points of this season I felt was the interesting story, strong characters, strong character development, interesting setting and the Excellent voice acting. This is further reinforced by the strength of the animation and the excellent combat scenes and music.  It’s the combination of all these things that made Tales such an interesting series. and his seraph friends embarked upon in the previous season as they try to stop the lord of calamity from bringing eternal darkness and despair to the land.While the previous season was largely set in the country of Hyland this season features much more different countries and environments that Sorey and his party get to visit. These include the country that served as the enemy last season which is the Rolance empire and the northern lands of the continent. While the main story itself is still very much focused on stopping the lord of calamity the anime’s story also has a number of subplots that are interlinked between the main plot and have consequences in the main plot.The overall plot of Tales of Zestiria the X2 like the previous season follows the adventures of Sorey the newest incarnation of the Shepard an ancient hero that has the ability to both see and interact with spiritual beings called Seraphs and use these beings to aid him in battle. The main role of a Shepard is to cleanse instances of malevolence that have taken root in the world and to ultimately confront the source of it which is the lord of calamity. While the first season served to establish both the world that this series takes place in as well as establish the individual characters and their respective skills and personalities with relation to their roles in the party this season was more focused on dealing with the effects that the malevolence has had on various people and closing in on the source of this which is the lord of calamity. In addition to the main plot this season also has a number of sub plots that help establish characters that have already appeared in the series while also changing some so that their roles in the story are better.SoreySorey played by veteran voice actor Ryouhei Kimura of Angel Beats fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the protagonist of the story. A kind, honest and caring person that tries to believe in the best of humanity Sorey is an adamant believer in diplomacy and prefers to converse with others to try and stop conflicts with diplomacy rather than settle them with physical might. Even before Sorey become a shepherd Sorey could see the spiritual beings known as seraphs that inhabitant the world alongside that of humans. While kind and positive Sorey is also a determined person that doesn’t tolerate injustice of any kind and will try to stand up for those that are too weak to do it themselves. While preferring to avoid combat Sorey is however still an able combatant that can easily knock out enemies quite easily. As a shepherd Sorey takes his duties seriously and perhaps a little too seriously. When confronted with impurities that are caused by the malevolence Sorey will always try to purify them even when the alternative of ending their lives would have been many times easier. In a way, this personality trait of his is what defines Sorey and makes him really stand out. Sorey is someone that values friendship and dialogue more than others and as a result he is someone that can get on well with most people no matter which country they are from. This is helped by the fact that Sorey is an understanding person that tries to understand what ails a person. In the previous season Sorey was very much still learning about his role as a shepherd. As a result, Sorey at that time was more brash in his actions yet at the same time somewhat reluctant and hesitant in his new role with regards to purification.Though this season takes place only a few weeks after the first season ended we can see that in this season we can see that Sorey has grown more confident in his role as a shepherd and yet at the same time developed a sense of caution that tampers his love of exploration and the taking of risks. The reluctance that seemed to bother Sorey though not actually gone has been replaced with a determination to find out what caused the lord of calamity to be borne and deal with that to protect the world. Abilities wise in the second season Sorey has been shown to be much more proficient in his use of weapons and using the abilities of his allies when he armatizises with his seraph allies.RoseRose voiced by veteran seiyuu Mikako Komatsu of Re creator’s fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Sorey’s allies in the story. While Rose was a support character in the first season in this season she is given more of a main role as she is important to the story. A young woman that Sorey and co encounter back in the first season Rose was a part of a large guild of merchants that often sold their wares in different locations due to the fact that the continent that they were on was in the middle of a war. Because of this profession Rose was a cheerful, positive and polite person that was also a bit sneaky. However, beneath this positive personality of hers was another personality that she adapted when she became an assassin. In this alternate personality Rose is logical, serious and lethal and only cares about fulfilling her mission. In this we can see that Rose actually takes a lot of pride in her work as an assassin. Rose is someone that believes heavily in the idea of justice and as a result is someone that can’t tolerate people that flaunt the law which also expands to those in power as to her their positions give them the means of circumventing the law. Back in the first season Rose was one person that didn’t completely believe in Sorey’s role as a shepherd yet at the same time she was able to sense the existence of a spirit near her. In this season after the events of the first season we can see that Rose now believes that Sorey really is the shepherd though she also uses every opportunity to use him to help her business.One aspect of Rose that was hinted upon back in the first season and expanded upon in this season was how popular and how respected she is by the merchants that she crosses paths with and how they are akin to a family than anything. One of the subplots that forms a part of the series narrative is one that shows Rose’s past and what her childhood was like. This subplot I felt was really well done as it allowed us as the viewers to see what Rose’s childhood was like and what caused her to turn into the person that she is now.  This act also helped introduce Rose to the work that Sorey does and helped reaffirm the faith that she had lost in humanity as a result of what had happened in her childhood. All in all, I felt that Rose as a character was well designed and it was nice seeing her character evolve as the series went on. I felt that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu really did a fantastic job portraying her.LailahLailah voiced by veteran seiyuu Noriko Shitaya of Fate Stay Night fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a seraph companion of Sorey and one of his chief advisers. A long living seraph that had served the previous shepherd before coming to serve Sorey Lailah is a kind, caring and wise person whose long life means that she has seen a great many things and has acquired a great deal of knowledge of various matters. Despite being centuries old Lailah still looks someone that’s in the early days of adulthood. As the senior seraph within Sorey’s party Lailah often acts as the voice of reason and calm for Sorey and advises him on the best path and course of action that can be taken. Patience and warm are perhaps the best words that can be used to describe her. In the first season Lailah’s main role was to tamper the inexperienced Sorey and introduce him to the role of a shepherd slowly while making sure that he is learning. Now that Sorey has gained a degree of experience in his role and more understanding of his role ins season 2 Lailah’s role is more like an adviser than a teacher yet her knowledge is still something that the cast relies on. Like all seraphs Lailah is also an able combatant with her attack style making use of pages from a book that she uses that uses the element of fire to enhance her attacks. This I felt was a nice match to both her personality as a wise and long-lived person and her status as a fire seraph. I felt that Noriko Shitaya really did a good job portraying the character of Lailah.MikleoMikleo voiced by veteran voice actor Ryota Osaka of Valvrave The liberator fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Sorey’s seraph companions and allies. A childhood friend of Sorey as they grew up in the seraph village together Mikleo’s character is a contrast to Sorey’s character both in terms of attitude and in personality. Mikleo is a calm, level headed and considerate person that prefers to observe situations and consider all possible outcomes to a situation before making his move. As a result of this personality Mikleo serves as another of Sorey’s advisers alongside that of Lailah. As childhood friends Mikleo has a very strong bond of friendship with Sorey and while there are often times when they don’t see eye to eye on certain matters they always ended up resolving this when Sorey’s hunches proved to be correct. Back in the first season it become apparent that except for Sorey Mikleo doesn’t hold humanity in general in high regards and as a result does not place much trust in them as he believes that they can be corrupted far too easily.Though his meetings with characters like Alisha and Rose and in this season with the king of Roland have done much to show him that perhaps within the race are humans that have a strong enough personality and determination that will enable them to stand strong against the malevolence Mikleo’s views have so far only changed a little. Still while still early it is nice to see that Mikleo as a result of this has managed to forge friendships with both Alisha and Rose. A recurring event that continues from the first season is the little byplay and arguments that take place between Mikleo and his fellow seraph Edna that stems from the fact that at first Edna did not respect him that much and often lumped tasks to him. However, in this season while certainly still present the battles that both have been through as they protected Sorey have managed to forge a bond between the two that allows them to respect the skills of each other. While the bickering between the two is still present it’s far less seen and instead in its place it is a bond that is built on trust.EdnaEdna voiced by veteran seiyuu Misato Fukuen of Aokana Four Rhythm across the blue and Darker Than Black fame is one of the main characters of the anime and is one of Sorey’s seraph allies. A young woman of somewhat short stature that however has a personality that contrasts her appearance. Personality wise Edna is a quiet, blunt and direct person who isn’t afraid of speaking her mind to matters. However, this doesn’t mean that she is heartless or cruel as when Edna is warmed up to someone she can be warm and compassionate to them as well. Like most seraphs Edna has lived for a great many years and as a result she has had the opportunity the observe the human race and its progress that it’s made over the years. As a result of these actions Edna did not have a very high opinion of human’s due to their actions that caused her brother to become a dragon. In the previous season Edna had a notable personality trait which was the fact that she had a dislike of humans in general which often caused her to be rather icy towards them when she encounters them. As a result of the actions that she has seen them do both in the previous season and in this season however her opinion of them has changed quite a bit and now it can be seen that she has developed a sense of respect for them. I felt that her seiyuu Misato Fukuen did a great job portraying the character of Edna.DezelDezel voiced by veteran voice actor Daisuke Ono of Denpa Kyoushi and Attack on Titan fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Sorey’s seraph allies. A seraph with the ability to manipulate the power of the wind Dezel is a character that’s been Rose’s shadow and protector since she was little and in a way, shares a deep bond with her. Though a quiet person by nature Dezel shares many of the traits that define Rose’s personality such as her determination, tenacity and most importantly her belief in justice and the desire to bring justice to those that have avoided it due to their rank and position. Though a seraph and an ally of Sorey and the party Dezel’s most important duty that he sees is the protection of Rose which is borne out of an agreement that he had made with Rose’s adaptive father Brad. Though usually quiet and not one that can be seen to take part in rash actions there are times when Dezel can get angry enough with someone that he slips his personality bounds and when in this mode he can be overly aggressive. For the most part, however this is very rare and his default personality is a quiet and reserved person who only speaks when he has something useful to say. Dezel’s most prominent trait is of course loyalty to both Rose and to Sorey and while the former is probably the strongest one the latter is still just as strong. Though Sorey and Dezel did not have much interaction in the previous season it can be seen that in this season Dezel has at last developed a bond that is built on a degree of trust as both want Rose to have a happy life which can’t happen until the source of evil in the world which is the lord of calamity is dealt with.AlishaAlisha voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Anohana and School live fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Sorey’s human allies. A teenage girl and the daughter of the king of Hyland which makes her a princess Alisha is very loyal to her country and its people. Her loyalty to the people and country however has made her a problem for some of its politicians who look down on her beliefs and her loyalty to the people and as a result Alisha often finds herself dealing with them. Personality wise Alisha is a kind, caring and honorable young woman that can also be stubborn when she tries to help people. This trait of hers is one of the many things that I admire about her. The personality traits of Alisha’s and the fact that she actively cares about the people means that much of her countries people actually respect her and look up to her as a shining example of what a ruler should be. Although not a seraph and not having special abilities like they and Sorey have Alisha is still a capable fighter because as part of her training as a princess she was also trained as a knight by some of the best knights within the kingdom. In terms of martial might Alisha is well versed in the use of the spear and can fight reasonably well by herself.Though not explored as such in the previous season the sub story arc that was created for Alisha in this season also highlighted and introduced several traits that also helped define her character. In the previous season Alisha’s belief in the existence of Seraphs and in the existence of Shepherds served as part of her motivation for her actions but in doing so this also made her look inadequate in the face of the threats that Sorey and the others had to deal with. As a result of seeing her determination to help people and also help them as well Alisha and Sorey through Lailah established a pact in which she is able to both see seraphs and also have some of the power that Sorey has in merging with them. though only usable in times when Sorey and Alisha fight together this makes Alisha more capable in providing support to Sorey especially in the later parts of this season. While on her own she is still a capable combatant I thought that it was nice seeing Alisha get the extra offensive power that this ability provided.As a result of the sub arc that was used in this season Alisha and her men found themselves pursued by a vastly superior enemy force that beats them in both numbers and equipment and as a result Alisha and her men had to use creative tactics to stay one step ahead of them in order to achieve their goals. In this we can see that while an dependable leader Alisha is also one that can inspire and command loyalty within her men while at the same time remaining both determined and resolute in her beliefs. Arguably the most important of her traits is her restraint in that while killing the one mastermind behind the troubles in her kingdom may have been the wisest and perhaps easiest choice it will however not be the best choice as the effects that it can have can be unpredictable. Being able to think of the after effects to both the kingdom and her people and not just the initial effects is what truly defines her. All in all, I felt that Alisha was a pretty well-designed character and that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did a great job portraying her.Ian and SirelIan and Sirel voiced by new seiyuu Yuri Ehara and veteran seiyuu Masumi Tazawa are support characters and are fellow knights of Alisha that serve as her trusted subordinates. As knights of Hyland’s military both are extremely skilled in combat despite their young age with Ian being an expert archer and Sirel being a capable swordswoman. As with all of Alisha’s men both Ian and Sirel are very loyal to their princess and respect her a great deal. While neither has encountered Sorey before it can be seen that both believe in the legend of the shepherd and as such both though skeptical of his abilities to a degree still believe that he has the ability to restore order back to this world. Arguably both of these characters bring to the plot a degree of comedy to the series as despite being friends they often argue with each other about the most trivial of matters often involving Alisha in their arguments as well.Previous ShepardThe previous shepherd who had the name of Michael who was voiced by veteran voice actor Satoshi Hino of Naruto and Overlord fame is a support character of the series that is nonetheless an important character for the main plot. Michael was a shepherd and was the direct predecessor of Sorey and was Lailah’s previous master to which she also acted as an adviser. It is through his hard work that the world was able to enter a period of peace before the darkness once again returned. From what can be seen of his personality Michael appears to be a calm, honorable and compassionate man that cares a great deal about people and life whether its human or seraph. He also seems to value loyalty and honesty among not just his friends but also his allies and expects the same from them to him as well. As a result of these qualities of him it can be seen that Michael was well loved by much of the people and that they had a great deal of respect for him. Although Sorey never actually met Michael as he was deceased long before Sorey came into the world Sorey was able to understand a little about his personality thanks to Lailah and it can be seen that Sorey had a degree of respect for him as like him he too fought for a world where humans and Seraphs can live in peace with each other. In terms of impact I felt that the idea to introduce the previous shepherd into the story in an idea to allow not just Sorey but the rest of cast as well to determine the origin of the main villain was an interesting move and one that succeeded from a story writers view.Sergei and GouldmanSergei Strelka and Gouldman who are voiced by veteran voice actors Hideyuki Hori and Kentarou Itou are two support characters that Sorey and party meet during their visit to the Rolance empire. Both are knights of the country that are both loyal, steadfast and command great loyalty upon their men. Though both are knights Sergei and Gouldman actually serve different knight orders with one being in the military and one serving the church. The age-old rivalry that exists between a state and a church that is not commonly seen in anime is here cleverly put in.  Though both are loyal to the country it can be seen that this can work in two ways as the church being the spiritual heart of a country can also be called the heart of the country much like the monarchy that rules the kingdom can be seen as well. The two characters while disliking each other do however respect each other and the contrast between the two was interesting to see. With regards to their interaction with Sorey Sergei at first viewed him with a little suspicion and perhaps hostility as to him he was someone that was powerful yet an unknown that had helped defeat his countrymen in battle. However, this hostility and suspicion was gradually replaced by a sense of respect and gratitude as Sergei was able to see just what kind of work Shepherds like Sorey were doing on behalf of the people. Overall these two characters I felt were good additions to the cast as they showed that no matter which country you are in there will always be people that are both loyal and patriotic to their country yet still remain true to their king and lord and retaining their sense of honor. The angle of the government vs the church though not often seen in animes was an interesting thing to put in as was seeing the church get humiliated by both Sorey and the king.Lord of CalamityThe lord of calamity voiced by veteran voice actor Takayuki Sugou is one of the main characters of the series and is the main villain of the anime. Though only seen briefly back in the first season the lord of calamity is very much expanded in this season both in terms of role and personality. Back in the first season the Lord of calamity was mainly used to show the difference in power that lay between him and Sorey at that time. Though only seen briefly we can see that at this point the lord of calamity’s personality is that of a menacing being that has an aura of menace in him while also conveying a sense of power and arrogance. It can be seen at this point that he considers not just Sorey but that of both seraphs and humans alike to be beings that are beneath him. It can also be seen that at this point his opinion of Sorey was not particularly high at this point. In This season, however the personality of the Lord of calamity is expanded upon significantly due to him being the main villain for the main plot. In this season, you can see that the lord of calamity is while still arrogant and menacing also displays a level of cunning and intelligence that makes him a powerful villain that’s not just powerful in terms of might but also in mind as well. Though he values loyalty in his subjects this is outweighed by his overriding goal to bring the world to its knees to the point where he will willingly sacrifice his own subjects if it means that he will gain an advantage even a temporary one.As a central part of the main plot for this season it was important that the main villain of the series as the lord of calamity was be fleshed out and given a personality that makes him stand out among the many evil characters that Sorey and Co must deal with. While the lord of calamity was briefly shown in the previous season not much of his personality was explored and as such while certainly a threat he was still an unknown. The insight into his personality as provided by the main plot of this season was interesting as was the look into his past and the events there that shaped him into what he would later become. I felt that this season really did a great job of showing the origins of the lord of calamity and established him as a villain that though evil was more of one that become what he was by his actions that was of his own doing than anything.Arts and animationIn terms of art I felt that the character designs for the series was pretty well done with each being largely faithful to the original source material. The designs for the new environments that the cast go through in this season which was the Rolance empire and the northern lands I felt were also well done and looked pretty different to what we had seen in the kingdom of Hyland. Additionally, the insight into the time period where both the previous shepherd Michael and the being that later become the lord of calamity both existed as humans was interesting as it allowed us to see what outfits people wore at the time. Animation as ever I felt was excellent as can be expected of the creators of Fate Stay Night. The fight scenes for this season I felt was pretty well done and had a good level of detail on them. This season also featured more purification scenes for Sorey and the cast with them notably getting larger as they have to deal with larger creatures. These scenes I felt were pretty detailed and featured a good mix of colors that contrasted nicely with the areas in which they took place in.MusicMusic for the series I felt was reasonably strong with both the opening and ending themes being my favorites. Individual scene music was also nicely done. The opening theme was which the song illuminate that was sung by veteran seiyuu Minami I felt was really grand and did a good job of creating a sense of excitement for the episode as you enter its world once more. The ending theme which was INNOSENSE which was sung by the band Flow I felt conveyed a sense of confidence and determination which is helped by the visuals that are shown in the ending vids. The contrast between these I felt was a nice touch.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was pretty well done which is helped by the fact that the series had a very capable voice cast. The seiyuu’s for the characters of Alisha, Lailah and Rose who are Ai Kayano, Noriko Shitaya and Mikako Komatsu as well as the voice actor for the Lord of Calamity as well as his human version I felt all did pretty good jobs in particular. The character of Alisha had a notably larger role in this season that she did in the previous season and the types of situations that she was put into this season meant that both her tone and emotions must be changed and adapted quite quickly to suit these situations and I felt that in this Ai Kayano did a great job of portraying the different sides of Alisha from the resolute and determined one in one scene to the more human and caring one in the other. The character of Rose like Alisha has a much larger role in this and due to the rather unique occurrence of having two different personalities her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu notably had a tougher role to play. However, in this I felt that she was able to portray both the positive and upbeat mask of her and the deeper and more logical and darker side to her reasonably well. She also did a great job of playing the more human version of her character that starts to show as she realizes that her actions do not reflect the thoughts that she has on her role. Other’s that deserved some praise was the voice actors for the king of Roland and Sergei as well as the voice actors for Ian and Sirel who I felt all managed to portray their characters pretty well.Overall conclusionIn conclusion, I felt that the second season of Tales of Zestiria X was a great follow-up to the first season. While the first season did an excellent job of creating the foundations of the world and its setting it also did the same for its characters as well as laying the foundations for the story. This season built upon this excellent foundation by reinforcing both of what was in the game itself and introduced in this anime.  While the overall plot of the first season was focused on introducing Sorey the new shepherd to both his duties as the shepherd and to the countries that are on the continent that they are on this season very much expanded upon that by both introducing new territories and also showing how much Sorey has improved both in terms of skills as a shepherd and in his beliefs as well. The overall plot of this season also as a result of the foundations now shifted to the task of addressing the source of the problems that Sorey and the party had been battling in the first season. Whilst the first season was more about learning about the lord of calamity and reacting to his moves this season was focused on determining what his plans were and stopping them before they could get any worst. A side effect of this was that it allowed Sorey and co the chance to explore new countries and meet new people that share their views. Watching all this and seeing them identify and deal with the causes of the malevolence was tremendously satisfying.  While the main plot was of course dealing with the lord of calamity the idea to actually discover his source through the diaries of the past shepherd I felt was an interesting move but one that fitted well with Sorey’s personality of preferring to understand a problem rather than solve it by might of arms. In this we get to both explore a time period that took place before Sorey was born and see not only what the world back then was like but also get to see what the previous shepherd and the lord was like. I felt that this was an interesting experience as it gave us a look into the personality of the previous shepherd who had saved the world before Sorey did and also see how he was regarded by the lands people and also see why Lailah held him in such high regard. Additionally, it also gave an interesting look into the original form of the lord of calamity and the circumstances that caused him to turn into that form. Using this opportunity to look into the causes for the lord of calamity’s creation I felt was a great move and fitted well with Sorey’s determination to purify all sources of malevolence rather than going the easy way of eliminating them. with regards to his origins I have to say that I was genuinely surprised by the events that caused him to transform into that form. As a result of Sorey and co visiting new countries and territories that they had yet to visit before they encountered a number of interesting characters like the King of Roland who despite his struggles with the church still managed to convey a sense of compassion and kindness that showed that he cared a great deal about his people and the characters of Sergei and Gouldman whose differences in order meant that they will be opposing each other despite both being loyal to Roland.  These characters I felt were interesting as they help give Rolance its own sense of identity and proves that no matter which country you are in there will always be people that will stand resolute against chaos and protect its people.The sub story arcs of which there were two in total I felt really did a good job of expanding upon the characters that they had as their focus which in this case is Alisha and Rose and the events there I felt also did a great job of not just developing their characters by introducing new personality traits but also in expanding and improving their existing ones as well.One thing that this season seemed to have more of was the act of purifying an area. While the previous season did a good job of introducing the concept of purification this season once again upped that by featuring it more while also increasing its scale as well. This I felt was a good way of showing just how much power Sorey has managed to attain through his hard work and training. The scale of the larger purification's I though was impressive. Tales of Zestiria has always been famed by for impressive fight scenes and this season is no exception with each of the fight scenes in this season being impressively detailed and animated with my favourite being the last battles of the series.The endings for any anime series has always been a tricky thing to do depending on how many characters you have and how the story ended but in this I was really impressed by how the series actually ended and how it managed to feature just about every one of the main and support characters in a future that’s both logical and makes sense. The way that they did it via the use of an ending within the episode I felt was an interesting way to do it as well. More importantly they also managed to use this to convey the true direction that they should go following the wishes of the shepherd that not just the two rulers but everyone knew and respected. In a way, I felt that this is probably one of the best endings I seen in a long time as it not only ended on a good note but also addressed both the many loose ends that the series had as well as showing the results of the bonds that individual characters have forged while also showing how their individual stories ended as well.All in all, I felt that the second season of Tales of Zestiria the x was a worthy improvement to the series that built upon the foundation that was established by the first season while also improving upon nearly all aspects of it. The strong points of this season I felt was the interesting story, strong characters, strong character development, interesting setting and the Excellent voice acting. This is further reinforced by the strength of the animation and the excellent combat scenes and music.  It’s the combination of all these things that made Tales such an interesting series."", ""Tales of Zestiria the X 2nd Season was nothing special for me just like the 1st seasonWhen i 1st heard about the anime I thought it would  be good and full of action and stuff like thatbut I was really disappointed the story was boring,character were a bit interesting but nothing special,the animation was fine,although the whole anime is about purification and stuff like that you can predict what's gonna happend in the next episode or in the next scene...I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone,but people like stuff like this,well it's up to you to chose whether you gonna watch it or not...:D :D"", 'I\'ll be honest, the only reason this is getting a seven is because the last few episodes were pretty solid. If only, if only the rest of the series was like that.Alright, so I saw some definite improvements this season to last season, though I kind of felt like other stuff was sacrificed for it a bit, but I\'ll go through what I was happy to see in this second season. As far as the main character\'s development, I enjoyed that it swayed more towards and actual motive for this season. He seemed like he was fighting conflict within himself to decide how he wanted...to use his power, and he ultimately figured out the answer. Getting that insight into his character is something I was craving from the last season, so I\'m glad I saw it here. I also thought that the focus on one of the other characters and her story was the best thing I saw in this series. They wrote it really well to compliment her overall feelings toward the world she was living in. Other points on this season that I loved: the fighting sequences and the art. We know about ufotable\'s art style already and how amazing it is, but the fighting especially brought out how phenomenal it is.So, this season did improve in a few ways, especially in how it presented it\'s story, but it still didn\'t wow me that much. There were characters whose stories weren\'t necessary to be told, there were characters that tried to become important for five seconds for no reason before disappearing, and the explanation of the world and the story didn\'t improve at all. I still don\'t really understand why the world is the way it is in this anime, and they didn\'t explain what was happening in the plot all that well either. Sometimes stuff would just happen that had no precedent for making sense, but the anime didn\'t take the time to say, ""Hey, just so ya know, this is why this is like this."" That theme stayed with it all the way until the end. I did enjoy watching this season, perhaps, a bit more than last time, but it fell short of what it could\'ve been.I\'m not gonna come back to this, but I did at least get the chance to exercise my creative thinking by revising this story in my head so that it fits better with what it was trying to accomplish. So, it\'s not like I didn\'t get anything out of it.P.S.

It has its holes, but still complete.The anime is a zig-zag line, zipping across that straight line back and forth. It generally follows in the same direction as the game, but ultimately takes its own path. It grabs bits and pieces of the main game along the way, and adds its own unique spin to it....Examples include:- Certain events played out exactly as in the game- Additional events were added to add depth- Some events played out differently- Lots of events were omitted to cut on timeAs a result, some holes in the game were patched up by the anime, but the anime created even more holes in the whole universe by the end.I was lucky enough to have played the game and its expansion before watching this. I was able to know exactly what was going on, thus making the whole viewing experience more enjoyable. In fact, because I played the game first, the anime had the liberty to expand more on the universe of the story, and I thank the anime for doing that.Unfortunately though, the zig-zagging nature of the anime broke some rules explicitly laid out by the game, which, was hammered into you as you played it, causing some confusion regarding whether something was possible or not.It leads to the question of whether the game was meant to be the straight line, or the anime was supposed to.A warning in advance. If you haven't played the game......you're not going to have a good time.Critical details were left out, character development was small, battle scenes weren't impactful enough, there's just too much the anime doesn't do without having the game as its backbone.

Following the Sparrowfeathers/Shattered Bones made for some intriguing moments and Rose was really fleshed out well as a character.  But, once things shifted to the final battle with the Lord of Calamity, the anime was just far too rushed and killed what could've been a great anime.  Major events were just happening in a blink of an eye, and it kind of baffled common sense.  For example: (Spoiler) Rose was having a horrible time Armatizing with her own close...Seraph Dezel, but later on, Armatizes with Mikleo in one go, just out of nowhere.  No discussion, nothing.  She's suddenly just there with Mikleo in her.  Makes no sense.Because of the rushed speed, some characters were making major decisions and sacrifices with hardly any thought, or forewarning, and then they just went and did it and it was over.  Way too rushed and it hurt the story.  Also, aside from Rose, there was no further character development whatsoever.  This left characters like Zavied and Edna very flat and one-dimensional, even Lailah became just someone there to do explanation of the plot.  They also hurt Alicia, because in the first season, she was a boss, but in this season, she was just a (mostly useless) sidekick.  And they never even explained what was the deal with the random Hellion following Alicia around.The story just really didn't come through in the second season.The animation was still beautiful, though, and the soundtrack was good, especially the ending song.

Most of it will sound the same to you after a while.Inspite of it all, this anime has one of the best endings from the last 6 years.

Speed Grapher,https://myanimelist.net/anime/198/Speed_Grapher,"[""MainNo matter which site or forum I go to I see very mixed reviews for this show, Speed Grapher. And it's usually because the show looks good and dark and gritty but then it's disliked because it's not as action packed as___ &ldquo;insert your favorite anime here.&rdquo; So based on that I think a good review should point this out. It should also state that if you want an anime that's good and dark and gritty but is also character driven and therefore will dedicate a few episodes to building and defining the characters' personalities, then you will like this show....if you...want a show that's gritty and dark but has low character development and more shootings and bigger explosions then watch, Black Lagoon.Art-StyleThe animation is very good....it's by Gonzo [I'm actually starting to remember these company names]. Gonzo is the company that did &quot;Last Exile&quot;, which had very awesome art and animation, so Gonzo is a good company to base your art/anime standards by. Speed Grapher is very dark and gritty. Even grittier than Black Lagoon because there was really nothing that seedy about Black Lagoon. Black Lagoon tried to make their town [what was it....Roanapour?] seem so bad ass and dirty, but the art style contradicted that image they were trying to portray, it was too clean, too slick and polished. With Speed Grapher, you got the true sense of being in those respective environments; in the fancy mansions you felt it was fancy and high-class, in the seedy parts of town you got that feeling, seeing the trash and hookers and stuff. Also as I said earlier the animation was excellent, good fight scenes, no corners were cut and no looping.SoundThe OP, well I never really liked Duran Duran, hmmmm OK well maybe except for the song they did for the James Bond movie also I liked &ldquo;The Reflex&rdquo; but I didn't go wild for this song &ldquo;Girls on Film&rdquo; it's just not my thing. But you gotta respect any anime that's willing to make that their OP. The ED songs were forgettable even if the art was nice. The Japanese voice cast did a good job [I don't think the Japanese have ever really done a bad job....except for Inuyasha's voice, where the US voice was waaay better!]StoryOK so this is where it's crucial in the review, and this is where I diverge from the reviewers that didn't like the show or at least the story part. Because I really was impressed by this story. Like I had said in the animation part, this story is gritty! It gives you are real no-holds-barred account of how truly seedy and disgusting is the underbelly of the world's richest top 2%! Well at least within the fictionalized world of Speed Grapher. And you see the sleaze up close and personal, right down to the funky drool and the raunchy sex-orgies. This story depicts just how the real world works, that those in power feel then can do just about anything....that since they MAKE the laws, they are ABOVE the law. Sure a lot of things in the story are make-believe fantasy and science fiction but make no mistake that the very core of this story carries a kernel of truth! Political rants aside, will also be entertained [again as I said in the first part, you have to love character-based anime] by the various inter-relationships and dynamics between the characters as well as character development episodes, that lets you know some of the good guys aren't so good and some of the bad guys aren't so bad.Cast/CharactersI have to say the bad guy, Chouji, stole the show for me! He was tall with long hair, sleek and impeccably dressed....oh and he has a kick-ass power! No doubt in my mind he's merciless, just for the simple fact that he allowed or even orchestrated Kagura to be subjected to all of that sick shit so I can't say I condone his behavior or even understand him on a moral level. He's simply on my radar because he scored high points when it came to the coolness factor. The main guy, Saiga, is an alright guy. I mean he has no 'razzle dazzle' qualities or anything, but he's cool. I guess you would have to look at it from the story point of view, he's supposed to be a normal citizen, he's not rich or anything....even though he's considered high-profile. Also he's supposed to be a bit on the older side and has been though a couple of wars and has seen and experienced a lot of hardcore shit so it wouldn't seem right for him to be this young fetchingly hot bishounen&mdash;right? Kagura, is the princess&mdash;or in this case goddess&mdash;so there really is no need to talk about her, she's cute she skinny and beautiful with long locks. OK, the last person worth mentioning is the blond chic with the gun. I think she's cool, she became a little bit scary and obsessive for a while......and I wasn't feeling that whole 'let's rape an unconscious dude thing' I don't care if he's your man&mdash;it's creepy! OK there are some gay dudes in this show that were not only there to be funny but were actually kind of vital to the plot.Worth it or NOT?This is a keeper. I would recommend this to people because it is more on the 'hardcore' side of anime, lots of sex and blood. I wouldn't consider this one of the anime greats but it is cool, intelligent and picks up the pace when it needs to. I can see my self re-watching this. want a show that's gritty and dark but has low character development and more shootings and bigger explosions then watch, Black Lagoon.Art-StyleThe animation is very good....it's by Gonzo [I'm actually starting to remember these company names]. Gonzo is the company that did &quot;Last Exile&quot;, which had very awesome art and animation, so Gonzo is a good company to base your art/anime standards by. Speed Grapher is very dark and gritty.

I can see my self re-watching this."", 'Speed GrapherThis Series has a lot of Adult Subjects such as: Corruption, Greed, Power, Action, Sexploitation, Blood and Gore. So before u even give this series a try u should be careful as to what u are in for.General Thoughts: This is a relatively old Series exactly a decade old by the time of this review. However it does necessarily mean u should not give this show a try. As it has a lot to offer if u stick around to watching it till the end.Story: 7.5 ,The Story is about this Former War photographer who is now making a living as a freelance...photographer journalist named Tatsumi Saiga who has found himself investigating a secret fetish club for the Ultra wealthy called Roppongi Club. He tries to photograph the club\'s ""goddess,"" a 15-year-old, exploited girl named Kagura, but is discovered. As he is about to be killed, Kagura kisses him, granting him the ability to destroy anything he photographs. Saiga soon discovers that Kagura\'s body fluids, like her saliva, in combination with a certain ""virus"", can give people bizarre abilities relating to their secret desires, fetishes, and obsessions. Club members strive for the honor of becoming ""gifted"" via Kagura\'s power.Saiga soon becomes entangled in this secret underground society and the powerful and corrupt Tennōzu Group mega-corporation that operates it. He attempts to free Kagura, a move that puts the two of them on the run from the Tennōzu Group and blood-thirsty members of the club with bizarre and often horrifying special power.The plot itself I found to be entertaining and it really engages how those with power and control can really become corrupted by that authority and wealth they outline and how they use it to their advantage. It is also set as a cat and mouse game where the main 2 protagonists are constantly on the run as they try to escape the Clutches of the club members and the corporation.There is also a revenge story that builds as the story goes which would finally reach it’s climax at the end. The story itself is not exactly the greatest as there are time where it would seem a bit silly and the scenarios a bit repetitive but that it actually improved over time especially towards the second half.Characters: 9 What really drives the series is not as much as the story but the characters that are within it. All of who have such complexities in their personalities and histories that all in one way or in another intertwine with each other that makes the story progression even more worthwhile.Even the one off villains are given some form of development and background that would give the audience time to see as to what drove them to these actions and the reasons behind them. If not u can even sympathize with them to some extent no matter what the justification was.The 2 main protangsts are also great because there chemistry works so well. There interactions and behaviour towards another is built up slow and progressively that in the end nothing would seem so forced or overdone.However the real character that has been built up so well and done so right would be the main villain, In order not to give away spoilers all I can say is this, What he started out as one way would find himself different in another.Art and Animation: 7 This is probably the series main real weakness, Even for a series that is over a decade old, the art and animation is not exactly the greatest as with other series that have also come out during that time.At times it might seem a little foggy or a bit hiccuped and the frames might a little to stiff at certain scenes. However it is not exactly the worst either.Despite the outdated animation and art it is still good, particularly the animation sequences that reflect the dark and twisted atmosphere that the story focuses on as well as those special moments where the focus on the characters feelings or to reflect their emotions with the animation background in which in those cases they work wonderful.Soundtrack: 9 The series features a wide variety of music types which range from classical music such as moonlight sonata, to quire music such as Amazing Graze to a jazzy, action oriented sound track that makes it so compelling. Most of it actually is a combination of Jazz mixed in with piano and acoustic music.The classical music is mostly used in scenes to reflect situations that would fit with the appropriate tone that the music is known to accessories with. It defiantly keeps up with the overall scenes and situations that makes watching the series even more worthwhile.Bottom line: 8 If u are a looking for a good show that focuses on corruption and greed as well as fun action and good character build up and a good old revenge story than I would defiantly recommend you Speed Grapher.It is not a series that would win high praise or a lot of attention but it is a good show to watch if u like the sort of genres that I have mentioned as well as to give something a try when u have some free time \uf04a. photographer journalist named Tatsumi Saiga who has found himself investigating a secret fetish club for the Ultra wealthy called Roppongi Club.

But in all this time, despite the Boku no Pico‘s and the Kodomo no Jikan‘s, and even the Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures, I’ve never encountered anything quite as strange as Speed Grapher, a Gonzo anime from 2005. And this isn’t a strange anime in that it’s inherently difficult to understand or presents itself as wacky comedy, it’s strange because it’s just really fucking weird.Our hero is named Saiga, a famed war photographer. Working for a newspaper in Tokyo, he gets caught  up in a club where...Japan’s richest and most powerful go to have sex, eat, drink; indulging in depravity. Saiga winds up being captured by these people and is going to be executed when a young girl falls from the sky named The Goddess. She kisses him and  gives him apparent superpowers. He can use his camera to make things blow up by snapping a picture of whatever it is. Anyway, he saves the girl, gets caught up in a plot to destroy Japan, and spends the whole series battling a bevy of strange enemies with  superpowers like his, while also protecting the girl.  There’s biological weapons, gray area bad guys, and lots and lots of really creepy sexual tension.And this is where I find that the series really excelled: the bad guys. Each bad guy had a  superpower related to his or her fetish or addiction. There was a dentist who got off to kissing a tooth he pulled. He turns into a spider person with dental equipment at the ends of his legs. There was a guy in a gimp suit who had elastic abilities. There’s a guy who’s made out of speakers who tweaks his nipples to turn up the volume. It’s really freaking funny and I don’t particularly know if it was supposed to be. I spent more time laughing at this series than I have at any anime I’ve ever watched. So if you’re looking for a comedy, you have one here.The entirety of the bad guys is supposed to apparently represent the greed and corruption of the Japanese government, a notion that will be jammed down your throat more often than you’ll like. Especially toward the end, the message is so loud and spelled out in such simple terms that you’ll want to bang your head against a wall. “GOVERNMENT IS CORRUPT! OKAY! GOT IT!”Another bang your head theme is how often the Goddess, whose real name is  Kagura and has the ability to give people the superpowers, is kidnapped. If you’re looking for a strong female lead, this series is not for you. Kagura is weak, whiny, and entirely depends too much on someone to save her. A portion of the series is dedicated to her and Saiga escaping from the bad guys, but a majority is spent with Saiga saving her ass.The interaction between these two is interesting though and the few reviews I’ve seen for this show either call the character development between these two one of pedophilia or one of brother and sister. I didn’t feel romance in any way brewing between the two characters, but it’s easily misconstrued as Saiga’s girlfriend gets completely jealous of the two anytime she sees them together. This makes the relationship out to be something creepy between a thirty-some year old and a fifteen year old. But nowhere in there is there sexual tension. He loves her, she loves him. If any romance was to be had it’s one-sided from Kagura’s end considering she spent all of her life bottled up in her house with very little outside interaction. So it’s pretty easy to understand if she loves the guy who saved her.That said, I should bring up Ginza, the cop whose in love with Saiga and the character who gets my Seal of Best Character award. She’s a sort of yandere, threatening to kill Saiga if he doesn’t fuck her and such. But she’s got a more compassionate side that the series gives a little time to shine. She’s also hilarious, calling out any act of violence as “self defense”. The biggest problem with her is her outfit. Do Tokyo police not have regulation outfits? She’s basically showing off her thong. That is not regulation anywhere lady.And finally we have the bad guy, Suitengu. At first he’s a bad guy, later he’s in the gray area. He has a terrible past and back story and he has white hair, glasses, and a coat, so you know he’s a conniving, evil person. In the grand scheme of things he’s not a memorable bad guy, especially compared to the weirdos Saiga battles to get to him. But he served his purpose and became a little more three-dimensional toward the end.Issues with the series are plentiful, the main one with the story, for me, being the pacing. It starts off pretty fast-paced but the middle slumps a little and the end is protracted and drawn out to get to a slightly satisfactory conclusion. The formula also gets dull. A bad guy is played up then goes to face off against Saiga. Then when that bad guy’s dead, the next one shows up. So it can get a little stale which might be why I felt the middle wasn’t as exciting as the beginning.Another problem is the music. And it’s not the actual music because the OST is fantastic, blending  haunting piano with the jazzy action-movie music of the eighties. It’s the overuse of the same five or six songs. It’s obvious this show wasn’t made with a huge budget and the music really tells you that. The same songs over and over and over to a point of total annoyance. Plus, that damn piano gets stuck in your head.The dub is…edgy? There’s a lot of curse words thrown in pointlessly and lots of yelling. It’s a pretty good dub that could do with just a few less “fucks” thrown in to make it “mature”.The animation is dated and doesn’t hold up in any way. It’s low-budget and can look like total crap at points. It’s not  God-awful, but it does make some still-shots laughable as hell.So where do I stand on Speed Grapher?  When it started, I loved it. It was wacky, it was weird, it was original. But as it kept going it got mired in politics and giving off a message. It grew stale because of the formula but stayed fresh by introducing ridiculous bad guys. The characters were, for the most part, decent, but  could use more fleshing out. And the ending wasn’t  as spectacular as I was hoping  it to be.Say one thing about Speed Grapher though: it’s entertaining as hell for all the wrong reasons. The inclusion of all these sexual deviants getting off to some of the weirdest stuff makes the show hilarious, despite the fact it’s trying to give us a message of greed and corruption. It’s an extended metaphor that is given in such a way as to make whatever message it’s sending a joke. Yes, political greed is bad. Yes the country is fucked up. But when you play up the Prime Minister to be absolutely evil then fight him as his head  expands into a giant balloon and his tongue becomes spider legs, your whole message is destroyed.Metal Gear Solid could throw us messages because, despite the bevy of insane, weird, and otherwise unrealistic characters, there were still human characters and situations we could relate to. And I see a lot of Metal Gear Solid trying to come through here. It just doesn’t work.This is an entertaining, dark, and edgy anime. But it’s also not at all as smart as it tries to be, nor as serious. It’s hilarious, it’s weird, and it, ultimately, is one of the strangest things I’ve ever seen.Especially Saiga baring his chest to show the ten cameras he has strapped to himself. If ever there were a laughable way to defeat a bad guy, it’s goddam chest cameras.Suggested. Japan’s richest and most powerful go to have sex, eat, drink; indulging in depravity.

Only 2 people survived that day, suitengu and saiga. Thats where they got some kind of virus that allows them to have &quot;superpowers&quot;.After finding out what the group was all about, Saiga decided to fight against them using his special ability, killing everyhing he photographs.Its a fine story, it started very well indeed, then by episode 12 it gets a bit worse, but still very...nice.Art (7.2) - Art...Although not bad, i think it lacks in some characters design, also is not an aspect that got my attention. But its not that terrible,so 7.Sound (7.3) - Sometimes fits well, sometimes it doesnt fit so well. Besides that, the voices are ok, opening and ending are also ok, the big problem is just the other sound, from the ost some are good, other are not good, and as i said it in some moments the action doesnt fit perfectly with the music. But still ok.Character - (9.0) There it is.. i liked the characthers in speed grapher. After i finihsed i can say some things about all the most important characters in the anime, and thats positive. Another point is that the characters have nice abilities, and that turns it more interesting. Not perfect, but for sure one of the best aspects in my opinion.Enjoyment (8.0) - I liked! I seriously dont think i wasted my time..an anime with lots of action, with fine story and characthers..so i recommend..Overall (8.0) - Not much left to say, basically its an average of all the aspects. nice.Art (7.2) - Art...Although not bad, i think it lacks in some characters design, also is not an aspect that got my attention. But its not that terrible,so 7.Sound (7.3) - Sometimes fits well, sometimes it doesnt fit so well. Besides that, the voices are ok, opening and ending are also ok, the big problem is just the other sound, from the ost some are good, other are not good, and as i said it in some moments the action doesnt fit perfectly with the music. But still ok.Character - (9.0) There it is.. i liked the characthers in speed grapher. After i finihsed i can say some things about all the most important characters in the anime, and thats positive. Another point is that the characters have nice abilities, and that turns it more interesting. Not perfect, but for sure one of the best aspects in my opinion.Enjoyment (8.0) - I liked!

The plot is semi-episodic, with an overall story arc that binds the individual episodes together. While some people complain about the art, I had no objections there: it is a grim, gritty setting, and the art has a film noir look that fits that setting. Likewise with the sound: while I don't have much to praise about the series's music, I don't have anything to complain about.Where it really failed for me was in the category of character. To give the show credit, both the heroes and the villains have well-developed back stories....These are people who have suffered, and it seems like we ought to care about them when they are fail or triumph, as the case may be. And I have to say that the story arcs for all significant characters have satisfying endings: whether the characters live or die, you feel that their stories are wrapped up well. That was one of the things I liked about the series.The problem is that I simply didn't care that much about any of the characters, not even the two central characters. Saiga was a passable hero. In my opinion, he lacked an appealing-enough personality to carry the show on  his own, but he could have worked as a hero given the right pairing. Unfortunately, he was paired with a girl who had virtually no personality at all. Under the circumstances, I wouldn't expect a young girl like Kagura to be a fighter, but she should have at least shown some sense of humor, or charm, or wit, or emotional depth . . . or,  well, anything other than the naive sweetness and vulnerability that characterized her. A sweet, vulnerable heroine is not always a bad thing (such a character can give the hero a reason to protect her), but Kagura needed some additional spark of personality in order to function as a likeable protagonist or a believable potential love interest.Ultimately, this meant that the relationship between the two main characters --which COULD have been one of the strengths of the series--was, from my perspective, shallow and uninteresting. At the end of the series, I was relieved to be done with it, but while I could abstractly note that the finale was a solid one, I just didn't really care about the fates of any of the characters. And, in my book, that's a major failure on the part of the series, given that it tried so hard to develop both villains and protagonists as well-rounded characters.

My advice is - dont rush and watch it slowly."", ""Oh the 2000’s… It was a growing period for anime, but produced some of the most gripping series in the history of the medium (Monster, Full Metal Alchemist, Ergo Proxy etc.). It was also a period of time when directors tried new things, for better or for worse and major risks were taken to produce that next “big” original series.  Produced by the once giant Gonzo studios (Kaze no Stigma, Welcome to the NHK), Speed Grapher tries to push the envelope of an adult anime while making every effort to establish itself as a standalone success. Unfortunately, lofty expectations mixed with inconsistent animation and...a sporadic use of themes cause the anime to meander to the point where it loses itself. Simply put, Speed Grapher is what happens when an anime tries to do “too” much.For story’s sake, Speed Grapher has a solid premise laid out from the get-go. A once acclaimed war photographer, Tatsumi Saiga, decides to investigate the inner-workings of a private club for high ranking Japanese officials in order to help reinvigorate his career. He ends up getting more than he bargained for and becomes tied up in the club’s intimate secrets when he is kissed by a 15 year old girl at one of the parties. The girl, Kagura Tennouzu, has a unique virus dwelling in her body that can be transferred to certain individuals possessing a genetic variant causing mutations. Basically, she accidentally kisses Saiga and now he can blow shit up with his camera. That’s the kind of show we’re talking about here.The anime sounded so outlandish that I just had to give it the old college try, and although there were massive hindrances, I enjoyed it overall. The first thing I want to throw out there is that Speed Grapher is absolutely NOT suitable for children. The series is interspersed with adult themes, and incorporates vivid scenes of dismemberment and borderline pornography. Although it didn't get tagged with the “adults only” title, I would strongly advise against anyone under 14 watching this. Unfortunately these lewd scenes are so prevalent that it ends up detracting from the overall experience in Speed Grapher. It's one thing to show shots of ongoing orgies featuring heavyset 50-year-old men when it ties together with the scene (I guess), but it's another to drop them in sporadically. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth, to say the least.However, the groundwork for the story is quite well written. It features two strong protagonists, each with their own set of goals and morals and plenty of nonstop action and brilliantly paced suspense around every turn. The show’s villain is bad to the core, stopping at nothing to get what he wants… which of course he initially does. There are a multitude of themes explored in Speed Grapher as well, but due to the sheer number and relatively short air time, most of these ideas become diluted and ineffective. After a promising first few episodes, the series limps to the finish line in the most predictable anime ending of the century. Although so much was attempted, few aspects were actually fully explored or successful. By the end of the series I began to become bored and felt like it drug on into its inevitable conclusion.The complexity in dialogue within Speed Grapher is very erratic and inconsistent. One minute they're talking about serotonin levels and brain functionality, and the next they're throwing around four letter vulgar insults and pedophilia references. I'm all for playful conversation, but at least be more consistent. The tumultuous dialogue, mixed with the overwhelming number of ideas explore cause Speed Grapher to fall into a “hodgepodge” of sorts, making it harder to understand the overarching message the writers were trying to convey.Character wise, the two mains (Saiga and Kagura) are leagues above everyone else in the series when it comes to development. Saiga is actually a “smart” protagonist, which is hard to come by these days. He is dealt defeat multiple times throughout the series and most of the time isn't rushing to save Kagura with a blind eye (pun intended for those of you who have seen the anime). His motives and justification are made very clearly known and his relationship with Kagura is more of a bond than anything sexual. Fortunately for the viewers, the writers didn't overstep their bounds in trying to make a romance happen between a 15 year old and a 30-somethings washed up photographer. Kagura, in contrast to Saiga is fragile, innocent and pure. She knows nothing about her condition and Saiga does his best to keep it that way. The two play well off each other, taking the damsel in distress concept a bit further than normal. It's interesting to see Kagura’s growth into a more independent woman as opposed to her aimlessness from the beginning of the series. Some of her moments (acting wise) are a bit cliched, but she IS supposed to be a highschooler after all.Our main villain, Chouji Suitengu is a one-dimensional character on the surface: wanting only money and power to spread his influence. Needless to say it was nice to see his past and motives fleshed out, even though they were somewhat irrational. His acting was superb, and added to the level of mystery immensely. The episodic antagonists each had a small backstory, and starkly unique abilities. It reminded me of Xmen in an odd way, with each of them harboring a strange power only they would have. In the whole scheme of things I don't really care for the one-off approach to characters, and Speed Grapher was full of them… and it seemed like sometimes the writers were just trying to fill episodes. I was a bit let down that more time wasn't spent getting backgrounds of Suitengu’s henchman, and why they were so loyal to him in the first place. I think there was only about two scenes that expounded on this.Alright, let's get down to the fatal flaws Speed Grapher has: the animation and the sound. I understand that the anime came out over ten years ago, but there are some straight up sloppy instances of animation here. Disfigured character faces, choppy action scenes and bland background images did not bode well with me at all. I get that the washed spectrum of colors sought to set the atmosphere, but it just didn't translate well for me.The music is especially bad. The OP is decent, but the real pain was the misuse of background music throughout the entire anime. I could probably count 8 tracks that were played over and over and over and over and… well you get the point. The style of music the worked with shows like Gungrave failed miserably here because of their repetitiveness. If you can sing each tune from the OST after watching the series once, they're probably overdoing it a bit. The tracks, in addition to being overused were also too loud, causing the dialogue between characters to be drowned out occasionally. The 2nd ED was perhaps my favorite track of all, and the images were drawn quite well. Best part of the audio? The English dub. It is FAR superior to the Japanese one, and offers much more to the mood due to its noticeable Western influences. Chris Sabat’s role of Saiga was brilliant, and I'm glad to see Justin Cook’s skills on full display here adapting it.Well, I can say that I really did enjoy Speed Grapher more than I should’ve based on its shortcomings. I'd chalk it up under a “cult classic” or “guilty pleasure” category. It's low brow, vulgar and justice filled, with the standard good guy, bad guy ending we all know so well. I'd recommend this to fans of similar 2000’s shows like Gungrave, Black Lagoon and Darker than Black… though sadly I don't feel it's technically as good as any of those. Take what I say with a grain of salt, because this could very well be a surprise series for you if you can get past the imperfections.

The entire premise and synopsis of this series is about a photographer who anything he takes a picture of dies... but this isn\'t quite accurate. Garnering several comparisons to Death Note regarding ""supernatural object that kills people efficiently and powerfully from a distance"" one may think they are in for another analytical thriller where the protagonist can carry out undetectable assassinations, or perhaps some sort of monkey paw-esque cursed object scenario where a photo is taken of a large group of people and they all start dropping dead 1 by 1 and he has to find a way to...undo the curse before it reaches his loved one who was in the picture. This series is nothing like those scenarios that may have been brought to mind.The titular camera upon interacting with the supernatural powers will fire a ballistic concussive blast directly forward at the first thing in its line-of-site. Literally like a gun. It isn\'t a special ""cellular lifeform degeneration"" effect that leads to certain death either, several characters receive multiple \'shots\' at point blank range and continue to remain alive. Like a gun. This anime is largely about political corruption and conspiracies so perhaps if it was in a setting where the protagonist has the only \'firearm\' trying to take down legions of bad guys without being mobbed down knowing a single mistake would be certain death, sadly that is not the case. Every episode has easily 12 bad guys who all have guns and have no qualms shooting them. The supernatural element draw of this anime is immediately nullified. Granted they do follow up with some interesting limitations of the camera shots ability - it won\'t focus correctly in fog, if something is transparent it can\'t be focused on, there needs to be adequate lighting before a picture can be taken, etc.I\'m writing this review 14 years after the series came out so I\'m being mindful of conventions in the medium that may now seem dated. It comes from an era where studios were getting experimental and finding what works in this field and the products can be hit or miss sometimes. I finished this series feeling like I really wanted to like it but I just couldn\'t. I\'m told this genre of anime is considered ""ecchi"" - there is a lot of sexual content, and a lot of dark themes. However instead of coming off as mature and distinctive it just comes off as weird and out of place. A criminal mastermind couple will be talking about their next step in their mafia empire and then the guy will just grab a boob out of nowhere. A fugitive who escaped numerous hitmen and survives deadly injuries passes out and the detective who takes him to the hospital starts licking his face. It\'s not erotic, the mood isn\'t there, it often just feels thrown in to be edgy. There was one scene where it was used effectively but it was in tandem with bribery in exchange for sexual pleasure and abandoning your moral duty so the complexity of everything made it more effective than just \'random boob\'.The characters are hit or miss. The main protagonist Tatsumi Saiga is the main character and the series won\'t ever let you forget it. In the very first episode we get to see how all the women want him, but he\'s too cool with his cigarettes and being the only male to have a popped-collar shirt. Even the men want him too, in case you forgot that he\'s super awesome. He isn\'t given any real flaws so it\'s hard to relate to him or truly care about his struggles beyond a surface level.Hibari Ginza is the main police detective who has a history with Saiga, but the writing seemed to forget to ever make her likable to the audience. I absolutely hated this character. Whenever she was getting shot at I hoped she would die, when she gets kidnapped I hoped she would stay gone. It is ridiculous how obnoxious this character ended up being. I think in 2005 she was intended to be a ""sexy"" and ""cool"" character similar to how Bayonetta is today but instead EVERYTHING just comes off as cringey. She\'s supposed to be a detective but constantly brandishes extremely flashy and gaudy gold-plated pistols that would be highly impractical in detective work. She constantly has tantrums and shoots people with no repercussions, including someone literally walking out of a hospital after recovering because they are interested in another woman more than her. The intros have her running a pistol slowly along her crotch and then licking the other one but as you learn more and more about her personality it just makes you think ""gross"" instead of ""hot"".Suitengu is one of the villains who has a fairly interesting and complex backstory (one of the parts of the series I did enjoy). Unfortunately it is lacking somewhere as we eventually learn that both Suitengu and Saiga share a common enemy at one point but instead of teaming up or even taking them down separately, Suitengu continues to fight Saiga for no explained reason. It\'s like that part of the storyboard got moved to a later episode and they forgot that they have no reason to be enemies at this point.The real crowning character is Kagura Tennouzu. One of the only characters the series gives you reason to care about, grow on you, and actively want to be safe, taken care of, and overcome all kinds of obstacles to have a happy ending because she deserves to be happy just for once. She was the reason I watched the series to the end because it made me invested in her struggle. If you\'ve ever known a kind person who tries their best in the world but keeps getting beat down over and over Kagura should remind you of them in some ways.A large focus of the plot is on a super rich crime organization that lets powerful people indulge in their desires to a supernaturally hedonistic degree. While this could have been done well, it comes off as very ""monster of the week"" style with each super power villain being dispatched in the very episode that are introduced, if not the very next one. There were some interesting ideas explored here (especially for a 24-episode series) like someone who loves diamonds gets the power to become pure diamond, someone who loves food gets the power to devour anything, etc. but they didn\'t get to be fleshed out much more than that which would have been fun I think. A lot of the bad guys seem a little TOO over the top - a guy that likes girls hands literally collects sawed off hands in a room, a guy that likes teeth literally collects teeth, a guy that likes girls legs literally collects sawed off legs in a room, etc. While there are depraved people like this we see too much of the same kind of depravity to be believable.A major complaint I have is that the series appears to only have 3 songs. I\'m not talking about the 2 openings and endings, I mean the music that plays during the episodes. You will recognize the tunes quickly because there are literally only 3 and they play a LOT. I didn\'t realize how much it would be fine for characters to just speak without music playing in the background until I had to hear the same song over and over and over and over every episode. It feels like they were trying to be jazzy-artsy like Cowboy Bebop from a similar era but they didn\'t quite have the budget for it. On the other hand the sound effects are quite effectively used. Some of the high-pitched whirring used when a bad guy is using dentist drills had me physically wincing with sympathy pain. The disgusting villain that can devour anything made some super gross slobbering noises as he devoured stuff that left me feeling grossed out too.I don\'t have a strong closing summary for this anime in mind. I watched it because someone had recommended it as similar to Death Note (which I love) and this is nothing like it, so I created an account to give my perspective on this series. It is a very interesting attempt and you can see that the team gave it some effort at some points but overall I can\'t recommend it. undo the curse before it reaches his loved one who was in the picture.

He isn\'t given any real flaws so it\'s hard to relate to him or truly care about his struggles beyond a surface level.Hibari Ginza is the main police detective who has a history with Saiga, but the writing seemed to forget to ever make her likable to the audience. I absolutely hated this character. Whenever she was getting shot at I hoped she would die, when she gets kidnapped I hoped she would stay gone. It is ridiculous how obnoxious this character ended up being. I think in 2005 she was intended to be a ""sexy"" and ""cool"" character similar to how Bayonetta is today but instead EVERYTHING just comes off as cringey. She\'s supposed to be a detective but constantly brandishes extremely flashy and gaudy gold-plated pistols that would be highly impractical in detective work. She constantly has tantrums and shoots people with no repercussions, including someone literally walking out of a hospital after recovering because they are interested in another woman more than her. The intros have her running a pistol slowly along her crotch and then licking the other one but as you learn more and more about her personality it just makes you think ""gross"" instead of ""hot"".Suitengu is one of the villains who has a fairly interesting and complex backstory (one of the parts of the series I did enjoy). Unfortunately it is lacking somewhere as we eventually learn that both Suitengu and Saiga share a common enemy at one point but instead of teaming up or even taking them down separately, Suitengu continues to fight Saiga for no explained reason. It\'s like that part of the storyboard got moved to a later episode and they forgot that they have no reason to be enemies at this point.The real crowning character is Kagura Tennouzu. One of the only characters the series gives you reason to care about, grow on you, and actively want to be safe, taken care of, and overcome all kinds of obstacles to have a happy ending because she deserves to be happy just for once. She was the reason I watched the series to the end because it made me invested in her struggle. If you\'ve ever known a kind person who tries their best in the world but keeps getting beat down over and over Kagura should remind you of them in some ways.A large focus of the plot is on a super rich crime organization that lets powerful people indulge in their desires to a supernaturally hedonistic degree. While this could have been done well, it comes off as very ""monster of the week"" style with each super power villain being dispatched in the very episode that are introduced, if not the very next one. There were some interesting ideas explored here (especially for a 24-episode series) like someone who loves diamonds gets the power to become pure diamond, someone who loves food gets the power to devour anything, etc. but they didn\'t get to be fleshed out much more than that which would have been fun I think. A lot of the bad guys seem a little TOO over the top - a guy that likes girls hands literally collects sawed off hands in a room, a guy that likes teeth literally collects teeth, a guy that likes girls legs literally collects sawed off legs in a room, etc. While there are depraved people like this we see too much of the same kind of depravity to be believable.A major complaint I have is that the series appears to only have 3 songs. I\'m not talking about the 2 openings and endings, I mean the music that plays during the episodes. You will recognize the tunes quickly because there are literally only 3 and they play a LOT. I didn\'t realize how much it would be fine for characters to just speak without music playing in the background until I had to hear the same song over and over and over and over every episode. It feels like they were trying to be jazzy-artsy like Cowboy Bebop from a similar era but they didn\'t quite have the budget for it. On the other hand the sound effects are quite effectively used. Some of the high-pitched whirring used when a bad guy is using dentist drills had me physically wincing with sympathy pain. The disgusting villain that can devour anything made some super gross slobbering noises as he devoured stuff that left me feeling grossed out too.I don\'t have a strong closing summary for this anime in mind. I watched it because someone had recommended it as similar to Death Note (which I love) and this is nothing like it, so I created an account to give my perspective on this series. It is a very interesting attempt and you can see that the team gave it some effort at some points but overall I can\'t recommend it.', ""First things first: This anime was absolutely awesome.The story was amazing. It was original and captivating. It kept you enjoyed throughout the whole story. It had a great flow and was easy to follow. Every episode was great and every episode was unique. Absolutely a ten, hands down.The art was pretty good. There were some very beautiful scenic or sky backrounds that took my breath away, but there wasn't anything especially brilliant.The sound was also pretty good, I think. I really enjoyed the opening theme song.The characters were outstanding. Every villian was great with their own different power. I was always amazed at the powers...they came up with and couldn't wait to see what the next villian could do. The main characters were also outstanding, all with their own personalities and features.This is not an anime for kids though, because there were some sex scenes, all though they never really lasted more than a few seconds. It wasn't for hentai reasons and it helped add to the story.Speed Grapher was the perfect mix of violence, hate, friendship, and love. It was dark and deep. Once again, it was absolutely amazing.

LOVED IT!"", ""I was on the lookout for as mature anime series - mature in the sense of gritty and adult themed plot - and following some surfing I found this gem - Speed Grapher.Once the I saw the opening with Duran Duran's Girls on Film, I knew I would like this. The idea of the main character using his camera as a weapon was an interesting concept, kind of reminded me of the horror PS2 game Project Zero (Fatal Frame), and although this series has slight horror by the way of various monsters making their entrance in the show, I felt this series to be more...of a action drama.The relationship between Saiga and Kagura was sweet and core to the series. It was his teachings to Kagura about the reality of the world which was interesting to watch and you can really see their affinity for each other grow as the series progresses. However it was the villain Sitengu who stole the show for me, after seeing his background and motivations in what he is doing and I personally felt - good on him and hope he succeeds, which to have that kind of feeling for the villain for the peice proved to me that this was good story. YOu even start to have feelings for his back up crew of villains, which again I have only seen in Black Lagoon.I did feel however the series did become a monster of the week scenario, and the series could have been shorter, but its a TV series so I think we all have to live with this!Fan fave - Ginza was welcome humour relief to the series, however she was a much needed contrast and flip side of the coin in protection Saiga. It was nice to see that similarity portrayed. Plus she fulfilled a guys fantasy of taking control of some situations - if you know what i mean! ;)With regards to the sexual themes, were they required? I think this aspect is where Speed Grapher was trying too hard to aim for its intended mature audience, and could've been handled better, but I think it was probably a way of enticing people to watch the series,m thankfully it didn't interfer with the story.Animation wise - not as good as Gonzo could be, but not that bad that it effects enjoyment. Sound track wise - fiited the series well, but nothing too memorable that makes you want to OST.At 24 episodes not much of investment of time, and if you do like a dark gritty character driven story, and you dont mind some OTT, give Speed Grapher a go, especially past episode 4 where it starts to shine.An overall 8/10. of a action drama.The relationship between Saiga and Kagura was sweet and core to the series.

This show is mean for adult audience with action, blood, nudity and truely great to sit back and enjoy. Nowadays, there is no more fine piece like this and monster, Steingate anime anymore. Truely recommand for mature audience, not for kids. Suitengu starts up this society, then the photographer guy, Saiga, crashes the party, gets kissed by the girl with the power-giving powers, Kagura, gets his powers to kill/explode things through his camera lens, and then kidnaps the girl and kills a bunch of richies as he makes...his break for freedom. Then the chase begins. This is a multi-angled chase too. Suitengu\'s boys are after Saiga and Kagara; Saiga and Kagara are after relics of both their pasts; and Saiga\'s domineering S&M fuck buddy, police detective Ginza, is after her boytoy in order to keep him all to herself.

No, wait, now somebody else has the sword!"" Only instead of ""sword"" I mean ""weak-willed, rich, little, persecuted, teenage girl named Kagara.""

Saiga is a photojournalist who's seen it all. He is well known for being a war photographer. He now lives in Tokyo doing regular photo work and is completely disappointed with his work, until one night he stumbles into a secret club where he finds some of the darkest most disturbing truths about the world around him. But amongst the grim he find's the beautiful girl which to him instantly becomes the perfect subject for his camera. All hell breaks loose and Saiga now finds himself with a new disturbing power which he can't explain and the...young female who doesn't understand what's going on either. They end up running for their lives while trying to solve the mystery behind Saiga's powers and the girls connection to the club and what it all means for the city.Story: The story is well told and very complex. This anime does a great job of showing some of the more disturbing sides of life. You can actually walk away with a wider perspective of some of the ways people in this world actually think.Art: The art is very sharp  and crisp. The scenery changes quite a bit giving you different contrast in colors so that you're not always looking at the same thing.Sound: The music and sound of the anime is good but probably one of the weaker points not because it is bad but more because it really doesn't stand out much on its own at any point.Character: Other than the main character's, you'll meet a new character every episode. It's unique in the fact even in just a 30 minute episode the creators do a great job of letting you understand the new character's quite well before the end of the episode.

You'll also be trying to understand the world in where this is all taking place as and get a handle on it. It's definitely a suspenseful show that does a great job of making you sit back and think about the world around you.Overall: I'd recommend this show to anyone that like's a interesting story but its definitely at an off beat pace. Be forewarned though, this anime delves into the sick and perverse side of human lives, so you'll see a couple slightly disturbing imagines depending on how sensitive you are to said scenes.

And the lyrics... ""I\'m all jittery like a horse\'s tail""? That\'s, like, the worst simile ever. The opening theme is fantastic, though, and the dubbing simply kicks ass. You will hear lines like ""Get me more diamonds, you cocksuckers!"", ""Geez lady, that was fucked up"", and ""Try not to crap yourself with excitement.""Character:...The characters are great and they have different sides to them. Like the gun-toting detective woman you\'ll meet in episode one. You think you have her figured out, but then in the third volume it turns out she\'s more than meets the eye.Enjoyment: This is a nine only because I don\'t like Tsujido (sp?). Just plain don\'t like him. Yeah you are probably saying that should go under \'Character\', but I don\'t enjoy this character...

He tries to photograph the club\'s ""goddess,"" a 15-year-old exploited girl named Kagura, but is discovered. But instead of killing him, she kisses him, and the photographer gains a strange new power from that kiss: everything he takes a photo of explodes…My thoughts:This is an interesting series that contains a...lot of nudity and sexual references so I don’t recommend it for those under the age of 16. It depicts the greed in human nature; what people will do to get what they want. The action in the story is really just the encounters Saiga has with the ‘monster of the week’ that show up to stop him and grab the girl. Although sometimes the villain of the story is to be hated, I found that I liked Suitengu and his three loyal goons. What happened in his life is what shaped him and though you’re sure of what he’ll do; he surprises you when he does something totally out of character.

Basically the male protagonist and the female protagonist are on the run from an evil organization. Oh and some people have super powers. As you can imagine the protagonists have to hide from/kill a whole horde of henchmen while learning about the organization and how they fit into it. Around the halfway mark things just fizzle out. It’s not even like they start up a lame new story arc…they continue the first one with no new ideas. This series could have been 12 episodes long. This anime is watchable ONLY if...you’ve seen everything else in this genre already.Story pros:-Some of the characters have pretty cool super powers. The main bad guy’s power is awesome.-There are some really twisted themes in here that try to explore the depths of human depravity. Money is portrayed as an all-powerful corruptive force that runs the world, while the elite are portrayed as hedonistic monsters who live only to sate their dark, perverse fantasies (in this anime they are usually violent, sexual or both). There are definitely more than a few WTF moments..Story cons:-Some of the characters have pretty lame super powers. The second in command bad guy’s power is a great sense of smell…there’s a bit more but he’s pretty much useless.-They have this habit of randomly cutting to flashbacks without warning the audience. I appreciate the attempt at developing a backstory but it sometimes takes a few minutes for you to go “ohhh, this is in the past”…usually after you see an already-dead character come on screen.-There are definitely dead spots in this anime where nothing is really happening. There will be long car rides with Saiga and Kagura and you’ll think “this is a great opportunity for a conversation and character development”…then Kagura falls asleep in her chair.-One episode is SHAMELESS filler. It’s the worst filler episode I’ve seen. They play 15 minutes of old scenes (usually explosion/action) scenes and tally up the monetary damage as they go along.Art 5: Weakest part of the show. The animations look pretty dingy and cheap. Maybe it adds to the whole “gritty” feel but it feels dated and sloppy. And oh god I want to shoot myself whenever they show a scene with mist or smoke (there are a bunch of them). It makes the screen look like a giant smudge.Sound 7: I felt like the music was not too memorable. What stood out (in kind of a bad way) was their frequent use of English in the anime (the Japanese version). As much as I dislike listening to English dubs, I really, really hate it when Japanese voice actors attempt to do either American and European accents. I’ve never seen it done well and it always makes me cringe. This anime may be the worst case of it. Jesus, there were at least 2 episodes with 10+ minutes each of “English” dialogue. It wasn’t pretty.Characters 6: The leads were boring. Saiga is your classic, gruff, tough, scruffy male protagonist…the type of dude who’s burnt out, drinks more than he should and probably has PTSD. His past as a war photographer is interesting but I felt like they didn’t develop him enough. By the end of the series I still wasn’t quite sure what he was all about. Kagura was also kind of disappointing. She lacked any emotional depth and pretty much stayed a pawn for the entire series. The romance story was also done wrong. The ages are just too far apart. Saiga looks 30+ and acts like a broken down old man while Kagura is 15 and is basically a naïve child. I feel like the series didn’t quite know whether to make Kagura a girlfriend, sister or daughter figure to Saigas. For most of us, these are mutually exclusive roles so it was just weird to see them interact in some scenes. Ex: (Saiga to Kagura) “You haven’t even lived half as long as I have!” wtf do I make of that?. I thought Suitengu (bad guy) was very cool as a character and had complexity and an engaging back story.  All of his scenes were interesting. Despite his depth, he and Saiga didn’t really click well as enemies and there wasn’t any of that synergy between foes (i.e. like in Death Note or Psycho Pass). In essence they didn’t make each other shine. One more thing. I’m a fan of the Yandere character archetype and I feel like the series missed a real opportunity with Ginza. I mean she is psychotic, a police officer, in love with Saiga, and prefers using lethal force over making an arrest. She could have had a much more interesting an influential part in the series than the always-one-step-behind the action role that she got.Enjoyment 6.5: I realized what this series was a few episodes into it and I continued to watch it for the hell of it. I didn’t hate this series but it left me feeling irritated and unimpressed.Overall 5: Just not enough substance to keep me entertained or caring about what would happen next.Violence/Gore: lots of blood and killing. If you want that then this may be the anime’s salvation. Usually something fucked up or violent every episodeLove/Romance: They tried to stitch something together but it came out forced and creepy.

Some scenes, like the desesperate ones who can't pay the menbership of the tennouzu group, are a good example of the well-construct critic. Despite it was released in 2005, the economical themes are just what happened in the last years. Unfortunately, some stuff bring the quality of this series down: the animation is mediocre and looks old, but it wouldn't be a excuse to don't give a try to this series. The characters give me different impressions: Saiga is a good main character, but Kagura, despite she started...fine, lacks in character development. The best characters, along Ginza, the cool police woman, are the villains, Suitengu, Tsujido, Makabe and Ginji, they're cool, and it the end of the show they really feel human. Others, like Bob, act too steryotipical. And then the Euphoria...some of them are really memorable, like Lady Diamond, other are just weird and perverted dudes the main couple has to defeat, and really forgeteable.My recommendation: give it a try, just for the social, political and economic themes, the show deserved it. fine, lacks in character development.

You'll damage your brain in how much it goes up and down with the characters ever changing views of each other. It doesn't do a horrible job conveying a villainous plot, but it doesn't do a good job either.Speed Grapher has a very abstract story line. It sometimes gets confusing and changes pace quite often but it doesn't entirely make it a bad anime. While throughout the most of it's slow paced moments, it leaves you wanting so many answers for things and it takes its sweet time to answer them, sometimes...not answering them all. at about two, thirds through, It gets to the point where it seems like the writers didn't know what else to do. So they just made up new, odd powers and gave them random people. But none of them survive past 2 battle encounters with the main character, which makes Europhein fights almost bores you.Art is easily sub par. characters lack proper emotion in their animation, and too often you can easily distinguish static backdrops from animated pieces. Colour palates are most times dark making everything dull. The lighting with tones and shades never really added much to the scenes them selves as most times it wouldn't have changed the mood regardless of time of day.Sound is the toughest category of this anime as it had some really good original pieces however it reused the same ones far too many times. Occasionally even adding famous music pieces. It lacks sound in some places where there really should be, making it seems like its either jumped a mute section or they cut corners with their sound budget.Character development can be confusing as at one point the main female character hates her mother and the main antagonist, another moment she cries and almost does a complete 180 on her feelings to them. The main villain seems to have no real goal at the beginning apart from wanting to rule everything but at the end it's revealed everything that was though about him was wrong. It's a  decent development but it really does your head in.Overall enjoyment isn't terribly high, as mentioned in the sound, it plays some of its original pieces way too much to the point where it ruins what could have been a  good feels or action scene. Some episodes are good enough to make you re think a few of your opinions while others seem to drag on pointless aspects with added important factors that almost make you have to watch the fillers so you don't miss something. not answering them all. at about two, thirds through, It gets to the point where it seems like the writers didn't know what else to do. So they just made up new, odd powers and gave them random people. But none of them survive past 2 battle encounters with the main character, which makes Europhein fights almost bores you.Art is easily sub par. characters lack proper emotion in their animation, and too often you can easily distinguish static backdrops from animated pieces. Colour palates are most times dark making everything dull.

I am compelled to write my own review of it, so hop on board everyone! Series Composition done by Shin Yoshida, who has involved himself in some of the Yugioh series.Story:Speed Grapher is about a Former War Photographer turned Photojournalist with an odd photography fetish named Tatsumi Saiga, who gets involved in investigating an underground fetish club where he witness all the lewd and illegal activities going on, eventually stumbling upon a ritual where he ends up gaining to power to...blow people up through a Camera, the show is then about him trying to free the Club\'s ""Goddess"" Kagura from the Club. It\'s follow a monster of the week style format in the early and the middle episodes as Saiga having to fight a club member that had been blessed by the Goddess known as a Euphoric.Characters:Saiga weirded me out at 1st with his photography kink early on, but ended up winning me over with how despite his jaded outlook in life, he still desires to do what\'s right despite his status, plus he\'s a hot Ossan with nice sideburns and goatee, which isn\'t exactly common protagonist material. So he stands out in my book.Kagura Tennouzou, while I\'ll admit could favor for some character growth, is a Damsel in Distress done right as the show actually goes out of it\'s way to show her circumstances and how it affects her sheltered lifestyle, along with how Saiga goes out of his way to inspire her to live on and get her darn freedom, despite the rest of the cast getting in the way of that.Chouji Suitengu, or as I like to nickname him ""Pimpcoat Sephiroth"" is the show\'s main villain, at 1st he seems like your standard hedonist mafia boss, but as the show goes on we eventually learn his origins and true agenda despite his reputation.Hibari Ginza, Or as I like to nickname her the ""Cop THOT"". is easily my least favorite character in the show, her whole character is that she stalks and lusts after Saiga, wanting to get into his pants despite his lack of interest nor consent. And also becomes jelly of Kagura for having Saiga looking after her instead of giving Ginza the D. While the show does try to redeem her towards the end of the series, it\'s still wasn\'t much to excuse her BS.Other Characters of note include Shinzen, Kagura\'s cruel b**** of a mother, Suitengu\'s lackies Tsujido, Niihari, and Makabe. Bob, Saiga\'s gay neighbor. Togashi, Saiga\'s Boss, and Ryougoku, a doctor who\'s well acquainted with Saiga since the war, as well as the various Euphorics Suitengu hires to try to kill Saiga and capture Kagura. Overall a pretty decent cast, even if alot of the characters are scummy hedonistic jerkfaces you want to see get their just desserts.Visuals:It\'s average GONZO fare with the occasional offmodeling GONZO is infamous for, but at least they hardly relied on CGI here which is a good thing. Backgrounds hold up pretty fine, though Character Models may seem rough by today\'s standards.Sound:Shinkichi Mitsumune of Yugioh and Utena fame composed the BGM here, and I will say this is one of his more underrated works, appropriately Gritty, Melancholic, and Jazzy, even upbeat at some points. The Original Opening for the Japanese Release is Duran Duran\'s Girls on Film which is great. Though because of licensing, the Funimation Release used one of the bgm ""Shutter Speed"" for the OP, which blends in with visuals just fine. The 2nd Ending Theme ""Break the Cocoon"" by Yorico is great, though the 1st ending theme ""Hill of Poppy"" feels rather out of place and jarring considering some of the earlier episodes end on a disturbing note.Voice Acting:The Japanese Cast stars Yuji Takada, a not so prolific VA in his only leading role as Saiga and Kei Shindo (who won the role from a contest of over 300 participants) making her VA debut as Kagura. They fair fine, if a little lacking at times in Takada\'s case. The Big Highlight of the Japanese version was without of doubt Toshiyuki Morikawa as Suitengu, especially considering he\'s Sephiroth himself, who does a nice job showcasing Suitengu\'s ruthlessness and angst. Other seiyuus to find include Takako Honda, Gara Takashima, Hiro Yuki, Hisao Egawa, Kenjiro Tsuda, Takehito Koyasu, Rikiya Koyama, and more. Though it does suffer from some really bad attempts of English speaking from Saiga and American characters later on in the show, so be prepared to LOL (or Cringe depending on how you react to Engrish).The Funimation Dub is what intrigued me alot more, and I will say it\'s stands out alot more than the Japanese cast here. Christopher Sabat got to showcase a more jaded and weary performance as Saiga, which is a big contrast to the roles people usually know him for. It was also notably the 1st time he and Monica Rial (who plays Kagura) got to covoice together here long before the likes of DBZ Kai, One Piece, and Fairy Tail, and their vocal chemistry here holds up strong. Also of note is Christopher Ayres as Suitengu, who also does a great portraying Suitengu\'s ruthlessness and angst just as good as Morikawa, and makes the eventual rivalry between Saiga and Suitengu more amusing in hindsight since Ayres would eventually voice Frieza in the Kai dub of DBZ. As much as I hated Ginza, Clarine Harp knows how to steal the show whenever Ginza is on screen and does an amazing job showcasing Ginza\'s selfishness and how much of a ruthless psycho she can be. Other VAs to find include Mark Stoddard, Pam Dougherty, Greg Ayres, Bob Carter, Robert McCollum, Antimere Robinson, Kent Williams, and more.Overall: One of GONZO\'s stranger original titles they made, yet It\'s a show I still remember fondly to an extent to this day, even if it\'s a show that will have you disgusted, but intrigued for what they were going for here. blow people up through a Camera, the show is then about him trying to free the Club\'s ""Goddess"" Kagura from the Club.

Warning, it is for more mature viewers. Anyway, the story is compelling and moved forward by great voice acting from the cast. The art in speed grapher is very detailed, but has a darker tone. There are not many bright colors, which fits the story and the setting of the anime. If you don't mind anime that is heavy on story, but has some really cool action scenes, SPEED GRAPHER IS FOR YOU!! Overall I would give it around 8 or 9, definitely worth watching. "", 'This anime is truly an unforgettable anime. While there are many anime that I\'ve watched where I go, ""Yay, this seems like an interesting anime!"" then at the end go, ""...Well, that was okay, I guess. Next!"" and completely proceed to forget about it, this anime does not fall into that category. Even the next morning, I found myself still thinking of the intricacies, of the plot, of what-ifs that could have happened, of what things that could have been done differently. Oh, and even though this is an anime, I actually cried at the end. It\'s that good.Story: 10/10This is one of those very...few anime which actually get you hooked even midway into the first episode. There have been many anime where I\'ve stopped midway because it was moving too slowly, or even more anime where it just fails to get more exciting or get a move on even after five episodes. For me, this anime was paced beautifully, not too much action or dialogue in one episode, and telling just enough to not get you confused yet keep you interested enough that you HAVE to watch the next episode. The plot and the way it was carried was as interesting as every bit it sounded, and just overall amazingly carried out. It did not feel rushed nor did it feel slow, and this is actually one of those anime which I\'ve watched all 24 episodes straight (yes, 12 hours straight) because every time I try to leave it for the next day, I just HAVE to peek at the next episode and end up watching the whole thing. In fact, the only warning I have is that if you don\'t want to lose sleep by watching this 12 hours straight, then don\'t even watch until you have the time to do so, because I GUARANTEE you, you will NOT be able to put this down once you\'ve started it.What interested me the most is the balance of action and ""lay-low"" scenes in the whole anime. Also, the battles that they face are not like any of those random battles in other anime that are added in there just for the sake of it: every battle they face actually has a significant contribution to the overall plot and are all stepping stones to finding out more about the true nature of Japan. And what I really like the most? They\'ve manage to turn a cliche-type plot into something that was interesting, dramatic, and so well-woven together that there was no room for fillers. Every theme is present in this anime: revenge, corruption, seeking justice in an unjust society, money, power, politics... You name it, they have it. And most of all, this cliche-type plot that they have, they have managed to turn into a mind-boggling anime that will make you think about it long after you have finished the entire series (in one sitting, I guarantee you).Art: 6/10I am not a big fan of the art simply because the lighting, for me, was too dark. I suppose it adds to the mood of the story, and it works fantastically, but there are times where the art looked like it was hurriedly drawn, or times when some of them looked a little bit deformed. The art looked kind of... 2D-ish, for me, though the art was not really so much of an obstruction to keep me from watching it, because the exciting story and plot twists just keep you from even noticing how badly drawn something is. And this is coming from someone who is very picky with anime art.Sound: 6/10Simply because there was nothing memorable about the background music or the opening and ending themes. But this might be because the music blended in so beautifully with the action on-screen that I didn\'t notice it. Either way, it\'s a fair score.Character: 9/10Just the occupation of the main character should be enough to draw you in: a war photographer. Now that\'s something interesting, something that hasn\'t been focused on too much before. Now, this may be a little biased since I am a politics/war junkie (yes, despite me being a girl), but it really is something new. His personality is just as beautiful as well. While you would expect a cynical, overly angry tough guy who in reality really just wants someone to hold him close and love him, such a stereotypical personality for a character with an occupation like his is NOT at all present. In fact, he is quite a mysterious man and doesn\'t open up, but at the same time, he is not this overly angry person who pushes everyone away and refuses their help just because of his pride. He is a balance of mystery and seclusion and also loving and generous who does not want anyone important to him harmed. What I love about him, too, is that even though he is a tough guy, he knows when he needs help, and takes that help. I don\'t like characters who are overly proud, and he is not one of those typical angry tough guys.However, the one I did not like very much is Kagura. She seems like the typical ""oh, I want to do something/ help you with this, but I\'m so weak I can\'t do anything and end up getting captured all the time"" type of damsel in distress. Sure, I appreciate her efforts and her thoughts, but it\'s most of the time her fault why Tatsumi gets into danger/ has to put himself in danger. Her determination is truly admirable, but at points where Tatsumi has sacrificed everything for her and she chooses to give up... just irks me. I don\'t like girls who are overly weak and can\'t do anything like her, and yet because of their wanting to help, they just make the situation worse. She seems like a very common character, and nothing about her stands out.There was one woman I really liked in that anime, though, and it was Ginza. Now there\'s a woman: tough, and can handle herself. While I was kind of annoyed at first that all she cares about is Saiga and doesn\'t realize just how many lives she is jeopardizing, and coupled with her attitude towards murders waving them off as if they were just another thing on her to-investigate list, the way her outlook in life changes once she has seen the full-blown corruption of all the higher people in Japan coupled with the fact that she is able to finally let go of Tatsumi once she realizes that he really doesn\'t love her and won\'t ever love her because of Kagura, made her one of my favorite characters. She is not the overly annoying type of stalker nor is she the overly tough woman who can defend herself against anything. And that\'s what\'s beautiful about the characters of Speed Grapher overall- they are not complete Mary or Gary Sues. Tatsumi, just because he has a camera that can explode things, is not overly powerful or undefeated. Ginza, just because she has guns and can shoot a pinhole from 200000000 miles away, does not mean she manages to get a headshot at anyone and everyone she meets. They all have a balance of good traits and bad traits, strengths and weakness, and for me that is just amazing.And Suitengu is your typical bad guy: badass, calm, collected, and smokes REAL money. NOT. Unlike most bad guys in anime, he actually HAS a purpose for doing all the things he\'s doing, not just because he\'s evil and he likes to bring harm to other people or anything like that. Of course, I won\'t tell you just what is his real purpose, you just have to find out for yourself. And also, he has an interesting plot twist concerning Saiga as well, but again, I\'m not going to say what it is.Enjoyment: 10/10Like I said, this is one anime that you will never put down once you\'ve started watching it. I enjoyed every single episode, and there was never one where I went ""ho-hum, this is starting to get really boring"". And if there ever was a filler episode, I didn\'t notice one. For me, everything blended well into each other perfectly, and there is nothing I would want changed in this anime, plot-wise. Though the art could have been better.Overall: 10/10This is truly a balanced, well-created masterpiece. If you want an anime that will strike a sensitive cord, or an anime that will make you think, then this anime is just for you. few anime which actually get you hooked even midway into the first episode.

Overall it\'s very darktoned and dramatic. Not my kind of thing but I decided to watch it anyway.Story: 7A girl, Kagura, is drugged and used to pleasure rich politicians. Then a famous photographer, Saiga, gets caught up in it and decides he wants to save the girl.The main story is that of Kagura and Saiga. Infected with a virus (at least I think it is a virus) they try to save themselves while escaping from the aristocrats who try to capture them.Behind this there...is a deeper story which centers on the ""dirty politicians"" and messed up society we live in. Though showing their good face to the citizens, these politicians abuse their power to achieve money and sexual pleasure.It\'s not my thing, but it portrays reality pretty good.Then there also is the supernatural part in which people turn into maniacs who basically have orgasms collecting human legs, eating diamonds or bouncing around like tennis balls.  I hoped the story would center more on the virus which inflicts these crazy habits and abilities, but it didn\'t.Art: 5Didn\'t like it. Very little color, but I suppose that goes with the dark tone the anime has. Little time was spend on the caracter design. They only one I enjoyed watching was Tsujido.Don\'t remember the backgrounds too well so I guess they weren\'t too special either.Sound: 4At the beginning the music was nice. The fact that they only used 3 tracks in the entire anime bothered me.Opening was nice, so is the video that goes with it. The first ending was horrible, Shione Yukawa just can\'t sing. Luckily halfway the series they save us by changing the ending song to another, much better, one.Character: 7They are good characters, Saiga, Kagura, Suitengu, Tsujido... Very distinct, each with a fixed goal to achieve. They are all quite powerful characters. Kagura I liked least, she\'s so manipulative, running behind anyone depending on how she feels.Enjoyment: 5If you like this kind of drama you\'ll probably enjoy it a lot more then I did. It\'s a story about reality like we all know it. I see it every day so I don\'t have to see it in an anime too.Overall: 6It\'s a good anime, has a lot of drama and criticizes society. It also has quite a bit of supernatural events to make things more interesting. If I would be neutral about my preferences in anime I would probably give this an 8. But I expected a more supernatural-based anime, which I didn\'t get, hence the 6.If you\'re looking for a dramatic view on society however, you\'ll probably enjoy this very much. is a deeper story which centers on the ""dirty politicians"" and messed up society we live in.

It also has quite a bit of supernatural events to make things more interesting. If I would be neutral about my preferences in anime I would probably give this an 8. But I expected a more supernatural-based anime, which I didn\'t get, hence the 6.If you\'re looking for a dramatic view on society however, you\'ll probably enjoy this very much.', ""This anime was, for lack of a better word, weird. There\xa0are\xa0a lot of\xa0anime\xa0that are strange, but they're usually trying to be deeply philosophical or artistic, touch some weird topics, or forcing themselves to be weird. This doesn't really fall into any of these categories. While in some sense it does try to make some philosophical points, these are pretty superficial, and pretty simplistic. While it certainly does have some scenes that have a good amount of artistic flair, that still isn't at the core of why this show is strange. It also does have some strange topics, mostly how degenerate people can be, but that...just feels like a part of why\xa0it's\xa0strange. Furthermore, the strangeness never feels forced, and that's why how weird it is\xa0is\xa0so striking, because there's no specific thing that makes it so strange, but rather everything comes together to be really strange. For example, the\xa0individual\xa0powers being tied to strange desires is somewhat weird, but if it went full battle anime it probably wouldn't be that strange. But it doesn't, rather it keeps things fairly grounded even when these\xa0powers\xa0get completely\xa0ridiculous.\xa0The scenes showcasing depravity or\xa0showing the rich and powerful as degenerates wouldn't\xa0be so weird if that seemed to be the point of the anime, but rather, they just seem to be the backdrop, which makes it more likely to make the viewer uncomfortable I'd say.\xa0Just\xa0all around, there's a lot\xa0individually\xa0and in combination that makes it super strange, and that's certainly not a bad thing. Rather, I'd say that it's one of the best things, in that it keeps things super interesting.In terms of plot, the core plot is basically Saiga simply trying to save\xa0Kaguya. However, this is made difficult by the real plot driver, which is\xa0Suitengu\xa0and his machinations that require\xa0Kaguya. This plot does a really good job with characters. The main heroes, Saiga and\xa0Kaguya, have a strange relationship, but they come across really well after all they go through. Other side characters such as Ginza and Bob also feel important enough to matter, and ultimately come across just as well.\xa0A real strength with this show though, is that the core cast of villains\xa0is\xa0great, though not in terms of having super\xa0sympathizable\xa0backstories or goals the viewer can sympathize with. Rather,\xa0Suitengu's\xa0goal doesn't really seem to be anything beyond simply achieving revenge on the world. But still, they come across as human characters, with depth, and ultimately have an air to them that makes them seem cool despite everything. This is emphasized by the fact that there are also another\xa0group\xa0of villains, basically the politicians, who serve somewhat as a foil in that they're incredibly easy to hate. The various side\xa0Euphoriacs\xa0were also interesting, in that\xa0their\xa0power seemed to delve into the core of who they are, which was strange, but certainly made good characters. Ultimately, all of this drives the plot at a good pace, slowly building things up to a massive scale ending, which was strange, in that both the villain and heroes seem to win, in that their ultimate goals in the end weren't entirely incompatible, and hence even though there is a tremendous disaster, it ends on a somewhat happy\xa0lighthearted\xa0note that was reasonably satisfying.The art and animation were really good and there were a lot of good action and artistic shots. The OP for the first half had an interesting concept of basically being a recap, with each episode having a different one, which I thought worked well. The song was completely random but I suppose it worked. The OP for the second half used the same song for a standard OP, but also had great and memorable visuals. The soundtrack was really good with a number of really memorable tracks. Overall the sense of\xa0style\xa0and atmosphere created was really good.tl;dr: A show that comes together to be very bizarre but still works really well. just feels like a part of why\xa0it's\xa0strange.

This anime provides a crazy situation about money hungry figures who use sex and currency to corrupt the minds of famous actors, doctors, and especially politicians, through the power of the supernatural. Tatsumi Saiga, a photographer obsessed with dramatic and controversial pictures, stumbles upon an underground sex club that corrupts all who are famous and their supposed goddess who gives divine powers to Tatsumi through her kiss. After that, the story revolves around tatsumi and the goddess Kagura, running away from the club owner Chouji.Now before I give away too much info, you would be better off watching the actual show.

What we have here is a ""chase, capture, escape"" action thriller that has been given the sort of glossy superficial trashiness that we haven\'t seen much of since sci-fi magazines of the 70\'s, while at the same time the story is, at its heart, an odd mix of romance, lust and longing.Tatsumi Saiga, a famous but now burned-out war photographer who has recently recovered from near fatal wounds from his last assignment, stumbles upon a true ""den of...iniquities"" in Tokyo where the rich and powerful in Japan get to taste the most forbidden of pleasures, and if they are chosen, get to have their innermost dreams made real by a kiss from a ""goddess"".  Saiga unintentionally gets kissed by the young ""goddess"", who tearfully asks Saiga to save her. That kiss changes Saiga into a ""Euphoria"", a monstrous being whose innermost wish has now turned into a terrible reality. In Saiga\'s case, his ""wish come true"" means that now when he ""shoots a photo"", his camera truly ""shoots"" the target with varying amounts of destructive power.Saiga is not the only person to have been transformed into the ""Euphoria"" state. There are many others out there who now have unimaginable powers of cruelty and destruction and they are sent after Saiga after he becomes obsessed with answering the plea for help from Kagura, the young ""goddess"", who is the powerless pawn of her fabulously wealthy and powerful mother Shinsen and her mother\'s aid and lover Suitenguu. Add to this set-up a slew of baroquely conceived characters, animation that occasionally approaches a dreamlike quality, and a jazzy sound track and you have a dark and sometimes subtly humorous bit of fast-action brain candy that doesn\'t take itself too seriously and is consistently entertaining.

Well, look no further, for this wild ride of a series will satisfy your entertainment needs in every aspect you can ask for. As a Gonzo show, it has sexual themes, romantic themes, revenge, justice, tragedy, conviction, conspiracy, thrill, adventure, sci-fi and all the like. It\'s a lot for a show to handle but the way it weaves its narrative, along with episodic villains to spice things up, it comes out with some very good pacing, making for an enjoyable binge experience, once you...get past its exploitation film aspirations that is. Thus, a true action series with an earnest heart of gold underneath! Oh, and WATCH THE DUB, it\'s very good and takes great advantage of the obvious western influence of the series, on top of not sounding as self-serious, which helps emphasize the fun aspects more.The storyline beyond the synopsis flows very naturally with only a few stumbles along the way, where the pacing is slowed down, looking for material to keep going, only to then move on to setting up the last, pivotal, climactic arc. I cannot overstate how it managed to hook me for an entire day, always leaving the right amount of questions open, with equally rewarding answers.But, as a show with many spices, it also includes monster-of-the-week type villains, all of which have their own creepy atmosphere surrounding them. They are all given just enough screen time to seem like true adversaries to Saiga. For whatever minor plot details are left hanging or unresolved, you don\'t care because the show has moved smoothly enough by keeping tabs on Kagura and Saiga, and later on: the antagonist Suitengu. These three characters make up the heart and soul of Speed Grapher.The many, many themes in Speed Grapher are tied very closely to the characters, forming their motives in a believable fashion, creating a grounded world of absurdist realism, not unlike a superhero film with complicated themes. There are more hyperbolic extremes than metaphors, which fits so much better in the essence of an action show that isn\'t afraid to step into schlock, yet also be earnest in its character drama and development.The art is rough on the eyes. The western dark urban aesthetic isn\'t pleasant, but it also shows ghetto alleys and slums. But we also get out of the city quite a few times, so there absolutely is variety in setting and color palette, even if it\'s washed out most of the time. It serves as a great background to BLOW SHIT UP, regardless of it. The designs are made to be realistic and move smoothly, yet there are no comedic scenes to where you get other versions of said designs. This would ruin its noir grounded tone. However that doesn\'t stop the show from having a humor about itself, be quirky and accentuate its weirdness when the time is right.Action cinematography isn\'t to be underestimated either, a lot of the close up cuts are done in a thrilling fashion to where it\'s entertaining to watch, yet economical for production. It\'s most obvious in the monster of the week battles as well. While the dramatic close ups don\'t overdo it, to where you see the rough cel lines of a character model, it\'s kept snappy where it needs to be, yet also underlines a dramatic moment just right, in whatever ridiculous circumstance. And that\'s not to take away from the creative, yet also tactically savvy skirmishes.The music is servicable, keeps tension and pressure when needed. Lightens the mood during downtime. Accentuates the BOOMING action with joy and glory. Everything you need a good ost a audio design to do, especially the tension soundtrack, it works very well for the moments it is picked and is in my head since the climax of episode 1. But the bigger credit here should go to the Funimation dubbing team. They uplifted the material into a whole new territory where it doesn\'t feel as dry or as self-serious as the Japanese voicing. There\'s a better, softer, and equally somber flow to the American English, and even if it is set in Tokyo and its surroundings, the noir urban atmosphere, along with the 80s action and exploitation film influence it fits like a glove. Kagura doesn\'t need to sound like a squeaky school girl, she is 16 after all. Saiga is just as impassioned and badass, while Suitengu captures every frame he is in with his charming presence that makes you tingle, with his buttery smooth voice.The characters, oh, the characters. Saiga in a lot of ways is your shounen protagonist. Yet as an adult he is free to be proactive as much as he goddamn wants, and less reactive to the plot. He IS a driving force quite a few times throughout the show, and every time it is backed by an impassioned, idealistic motive of his that is pure in spirit. He is the reason why I would call this show an adult shounen, due to him representing ideals of righteousness and especially freedom, be it from materialistic or spiritualistic bonds. He isn\'t cocky, and fights when he needs to, not when he pleases. He runs away from overwhelming forces, but is not afraid to push forward the mystery behind his newly acquired powers. A war journalist at heart, seeking an intense experience that enables him do everything in the show. He feels alive, but you also see what he\'s like before we got to the juicy action he craves for subconsciously.Kagura is quite the intriguing character. She in aspects embodies the angsty teen, but as she becomes unsheltered and embraces the sweet smell of freedom, slowly becomes something much more than a damsel in distress plot device. At the end of her journey, she is shown to be her own, independent woman. Not afraid to take rash action and control. Doesn\'t play the ""I\'m sheltered"" gimmick for too long, but naturally she feels guilty for her own powers within her that essentially are the basis for the plot.And finally Suitengu. This guy may remind you of Sepphiroth, but trust me he is his own person as well. He is more than a mercenary, ruthless capitalist, he has an underlined, pervasive charm than that. One of the most amazing turnarounds is his backstory, providing new thematic avenues worthy of the final arc that\'s all about him. Why he treasures Kagura on a personal level and wants her back at any cost. In the end he is not the true foil to Saiga, but rather someone who takes freedom in a completely different direction. One that is ever so personal, yet grand at the same time. He is truly a memorable and supremely villain that you come to respect throughout and at the climactic end of the series.Notable supporting characters include Mrs Tennouzu and Ginza. Mrs Tennouzu is more of a background story filler character, she has her own sets of characteristics and mysteries that are revealed over time, also fleshing out her behavior and her approach to politics, how she acquired her position in the story.Inspector Ginza is obsessed with Saiga, but not in a healthy way, nor is he recipient of it. In a lot of ways she may remind you of Revy from Black Lagoon, albeit less aggressive and more sensual. She gets her own subtle development over time, yet still manages to hold screen presence as an essential support character that follows the plot with the viewer.My enjoyment of the series doesn\'t only come from how bingable it is. But, for the earnest storytelling it offers. The explanations it provides satisfy the autist in me just enough. The twists and turns of the story hit all the right notes. The monster of the week battles never felt like they interfere with previous plot establishments. They accentuate what began as schlock entertainment. It\'s a main dish of action with lots of different spices that give it a distinct taste of its own that is astringently sweet. The sex and BDSM imagery is an aesthetic I\'m completely unphased by, for the show manages to handle all its tones with a masterful stroke, whether its absurd or dramatic. But above all, I respect the show for being honest to the ore with what it is: entertainment.It is not here for any huge twist to present a perspective of life, nor is it insulting to my intelligence in providing a sloppy plot with flimsy motivations and dark twists for their own sake.Overall I loved my time with this show. But due to its inherent nature as a purely entertainment action series, with no aspirations for anything higher, which in turn takes to its advantage all the way. Including a satisfying epilogue conclusion to everyone\'s arcs and plot threads after all is said and done. So you can safely invest in this experience and come out satisfied at the end.

I haven't seen any slick guy like him on any anime I watched. I really liked that the manga artist who created this series, got their thinking cap on!The whole...anime was super good! I really liked the English Dub cast (Christopher Sabat, Monica Rial, Christopher Ayres, Greg Ayres & Clarine Harp especially) and it's involving you as the viewer to get intense vibes from watching the anime.Totally recommend this anime, 8/10! anime was super good! I really liked the English Dub cast (Christopher Sabat, Monica Rial, Christopher Ayres, Greg Ayres & Clarine Harp especially) and it's involving you as the viewer to get intense vibes from watching the anime.Totally recommend this anime, 8/10!"", ""I find when I see this anime on forums alike It usually has a Hate or Love sorta aspect to it. Personally, I absolutely loved this anime, though it is definitely not for the faint of heart.This story revolves around a war photographer, who gets caught up in a mystery revolving around a young girl. I don't usually like to give synopsis's within my reviews, so if you want the nitty gritty details you can go find those yourselves. Personally, I enjoy watching older characters more than younger ones, but that definitely depends on the anime. Saiga, the protagonist is a vetran war photographer who...inherits the ability to... explode anything he takes a picture of. When I explain this to people most just stop listening when I mention that bit. But the anime still maintains its serious edge with absolutely stellar fight scenes and very serious adult undertones.  The story overall was nice and unique, not over top and even, just maybe, realistic. Maybe the peep show bit with the harem or nudity was pushing it a little, but if you get past all the echi, and heavy severe sexual themes, you get an amazing mix of action and plot that will most likely satisfy your urge of badass anime.For characters, I didn't have a problem with any particular one. Maybe slight things pissed me off here and there, but overall no one went onto my bad side. The protagonist, Saiga, and Kagura, the two main characters had nice character development throughout the story. Each one had unique views and pasts. One thing I noticed though, having watched this anime multiple times is that almost every character presented here had a terrible past - I can name at least 3 characters that had a form of human trafficking or violent assault in their past. It wasn't bad though, since the story was pretty much chalk full of that sort of topic and It just added to the dark undertone of each character. Each one had a reason for they're actions, and the antagonist especially. It was a constant struggle from dislike to sympathy with the main antagonist. I found it visually and mentally interesting trying to piece together each and every story.I thoroughly enjoyed the music. I personally love when Anime decide to go out of they're comfort zone with something different. Whether it works or not I always seem to have a sort of respect for those kinds of productions. In the case for Speed Grapher, they used an American song, Girls on Film by Duran Duran. It fit it quite nicely, with a retro theme but still giving it nice dark undertones.Art wise I was impressed. It wasn't one of those stellar animations, but it never seemed to bug me. I tend to be hyper sensitive with art and animation - but this anime never seemed to let me down in that department.After hearing all the good things I have to say about this anime, there is just one tiny little thing that gets me every time I re watch this anime. For how ever many people I speak to, I like to associate Siaga and Kagura as a sort of fatherly love/desire relationship. Yet at the very end of the series, it contradicted they're relationship and hints in the 2-3 last episodes of something more than protector or friend. I really REALLY do not see those two as any more than that. It's up to your discretion but I personally don't like to entertain the thought of a 40 year old man with a 16-18 year old high school student.Other than that I absolutely loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story, but can handle the gore, violence, dark undertones and sexual themes. inherits the ability to... explode anything he takes a picture of.

I personally love when Anime decide to go out of they're comfort zone with something different. Whether it works or not I always seem to have a sort of respect for those kinds of productions. In the case for Speed Grapher, they used an American song, Girls on Film by Duran Duran. It fit it quite nicely, with a retro theme but still giving it nice dark undertones.Art wise I was impressed. It wasn't one of those stellar animations, but it never seemed to bug me. I tend to be hyper sensitive with art and animation - but this anime never seemed to let me down in that department.After hearing all the good things I have to say about this anime, there is just one tiny little thing that gets me every time I re watch this anime. For how ever many people I speak to, I like to associate Siaga and Kagura as a sort of fatherly love/desire relationship. Yet at the very end of the series, it contradicted they're relationship and hints in the 2-3 last episodes of something more than protector or friend. I really REALLY do not see those two as any more than that. It's up to your discretion but I personally don't like to entertain the thought of a 40 year old man with a 16-18 year old high school student.Other than that I absolutely loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story, but can handle the gore, violence, dark undertones and sexual themes."", ""Speed Grapher, I think, may be the most underrated anime i've seen :) It seems that very few people watch it, and very few appreciate the(Though at times weird and creepy) beautiful aspect of the story.Story: 8- Speed Grapher has an extremely unique and well executed story, im not going to give away any spoilers, just know its amazingly original.Art: 9- The visuals of the anime aren't anything amazingly breathtaking, however the anime is almost 10 years old, so in my opinion the art was pretty great for the time it was made.Sound: 8- The only reason this got knocked down 2 points is because...of the dull opening of the show.

There wasn\'t much though.In 6 episodes. And there was kind of a lot of negaitve stuff already. :(Not clean SPOILER FREE.(Has some hints because then you can relate more or understand more what was bad about it).But these information nuggets wont spoil anything for you....------ Here we go P:-----I don\'t recommend the anime but here is why and what there was.(Kid = Kagura Tennouzu. Main character, sadly. She is 15 BTW.).If you like older men taking care of stupid unexperienced overly spoiled kid then this is it for you.Such an turn down. This kid made this anime so much worse. This Kagura Tennouzu is made for some specialized anime watchers who like helpless characters and this turns them on? Yikes. This kid turned me the opposite way. ""Dropped the Anime"".This kid doesn\'t have eyes or brains. She seems something and asks. What is going on? What is this place? I mean look around. Guys get theyr D sucked. Use your imagination. (These kind of characters/people. Me no likei them at all).Counter argument is that. She lived in a really strick place. My argument against it. She went to school with other girls. She is 15. I mean there are talks. Some one 100% have been already done it. In this world for sure. There would be talks 100%. This is just nonesens.---Art.---Is old. 2005. But it feels older.---Story.---Story can be nice. The idea and the city. But the kid ruins it with the personality. And for some reason people want this kid. (Watched only 6 episodes. Maybe she has somethig important).And the story acts like this kid is super hot and stuff like an angel. Thankfully not for me. Otherwise I would hear knocks on my door. They could made her prettier I believe.+1 to the anime that she didn\'t have big boobas. Normally every character has those SUPER big.---Sound.---Avarage. Nothing special.The music though.Was super bad. Some of the scenes I wanted to skip ahead because the music isn\'t the greatest. Trying to be nice here. :D---Characters.---The kid. Who I really really really don\'t like. If only they made similar kid character like the female main character in ""Akatsuki no Yona"". She tried to improve. Learned. Evolved.The kid 6 episodes has been useless and only crying. Male character saves her then she cries that she useless. Happened 2-3 times in 6 episodes. This is 24 episodes long.Some of the characters can be interesting. So I added 6 because I didn\'t watch it enough.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bonus info and negative things about this anime/overall.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1.Is it only me or somebody else too.That it kind of starts to annoy me that in tons of animes where guy character runs from danger with girl. They hold hands. I mean that\'s really insufficient. You run alot faster solo rather than holding hands. I mean go and try. If you want slower person to run faster you don\'t pull from hand. You push theyr back little. Because if you pull theyr hand theyr body will not be inline and they lose balance. Pushing from behind little is like running down hill kind of. Then the legs start moving faster trying to keep themselves standing otherwise they drip.Yep. These kind of things annoy me. BTW. The main character is suppose to be super smart. Sometimes. He wouldhave done something else than holding her hand.2.Bullets don\'t travel much in water. Only 2-3 meters. More meters with pistol.Proved by Mythbusters.The main character got shot in water +5 meters below.3.Cigarette can\'t ignite alcohol not even gasoline. Just try it yourself. (Gasoline fumes is the thing what ignites).I don\'t understand why animes and movies or series do that. Do look cool?I mean. It\'s not because that doesn\'t work.Am I getting too old? (These things always have annoyed me even when I was younger).4.And this anime had other really not so realistic things. Like how the kid started to sing super well out of nowhere. Voice turned squeaky to grown up woman.And that kind of singing needs practice and she didn\'t or the anime doesn\'t show she did. In any way. She only says that she is bad and you see what she practices out of school. Daily routine. There was no singing.Maybe she is one of those people who say they are bad at something but comes out they super good. But my reaction to that would be. Yeah right. That doesn\'t fit her character. But who I\'m to know. I guess.5.Main character the photo grapher forgets his pictures but he didn\'t forget earlyer. He is the super photo grapher. BUT! He has big brains when he needs.Throws up mirror and takes a picture of it to blow up a person from the mirror. How did he know it\'s gonna work? Thinking like that on spot?In mid fight. Saw a mirror and memorized that he can use that and then throws up the mirror and takes a picture. Super big brain.But forgets his picture tube. :D Nice! (Earlyer episodes he didn\'t).6.Episode 6. Farewell, Diamond Woman.This means this new character what pops out is gonna die and I know her ability. I already know these by reading the title of the episode. :D(Anime spoils it self with titles). :DAnd watched to the end.Yep. She died. Who would have known.Title told what happened in episode 6 in 3 words. :D Nothing else much happened. Only little character building and the kid whining again that she useless.------ End ------I wrote this review because I saw popular reviews were 8/10 mostly and other really highly rated.Don\'t know what they said there but really, you like 15 years old helpless spoiled kid who doesn\'t wanna learn and improve and only whines?(Maybe she wants in the future but damn. It takes her long).I mean I watched this only 6 episodes and already saw so many mistakes. The mistakes probably keep coming. + the kid. Hopefully she improves.If you like this kind of anime check ""Akatsuki no Yona"", that\'s decent/good. Ohh my bad. She knows that she is useless in one of the episodes. Then few episodes goes and she wants to imrpove already and starts putting in work later.But hopefully you know what you step into because when I briefly checked some info about this anime.

However, Gonzo tends to make average anime at best usually. Does Speed Grapher fit the mold though? More notable then the main director is the guy who was involved in many aspects of the show: Co-director, episode- and animation- director, key animation, and even character design; Masashi Ishihama was clearly determined to make his mark on making Speed Grapher a success.Our main character is Saiga Tatsumi. He is an ex-war photographer and his current case is following the trail...of a secret club in high end Japanese society. As a freelancer, he uses his old war skills and his determination to get into this secret club. There he discovers this club strives to get the member to enjoy their deepest sexual desires ranging from bondage sex to torture. Of course, Saiga gets caught, but is strangely sacrificed to their “goddess.” Instead of killing him, Saiga is kissed by the goddess and somehow granted powers based on his most sexual desire, everything he takes a picture of explodes.Speed Grapher does some things right and at the time, has not been seen in anime for a while. The plot is pretty interesting which makes for a decent story overall. It even places an intriguing take on society in a setting that has pretty good atmosphere. Saiga is a good character that has the right motivations, but so do the few side characters as well. However well the show starts out and no matter how much action takes place, Speed Grapher quickly falls into a long loop of “monster-of-the-week” syndrome. Sure, the antagonists known as Euphoria are fairly memorable with their interesting designs and small backgrounds. Unfortunately, this drags on and puts the plot on hold. Even the “goddess” which was interesting at first suffers from damsel in distress disease constantly and quickly wears on the viewer.Character designs are pretty bland even for 2005. Even the art just lacks so much detail along with chopped up animation. This hurts the action sequences in the show no matter how cool they may be. The over-top-villains with the evil society made the plot go on, and watching Saiga’s struggle seemed real. Again however, this is even thrown to the curb by a very lack-luster ending making the viewer wish something else would have happened.This could have been a great series, but so much seemed half-way done.

While it expresses the thirst for power and greed of the &quot;elites&quot; of society, the anime incorporated supernatural powers into it to spice up the story line.The super villains toward the end of the series were not as well thought out and less appealing compare to the ones near the beginning but still pretty creative.

Allow me to explain. (Theming and character issues in paragraphs 2,3&4, Music in 5, Positivity in 6)The writers of Speed Grapher want the viewer to see a world where in a post-war environment the rich have gotten richer and the poor get poorer. The first mistake made is that one sees no...poor people in this show. The rich are set up to be extraordinarily wealthy. This is okay. The problem starts with how as far as the exposition says, the poor lead absolutely terrible lives, yet none of them are ever seen. We see some prostitutes and drag queens, but those are just generic things out of any poor environment. They aren\'t starving or anything either. Nobody in this show is doing all that bad for themselves overall. This means that there is no dichotomy shown between the rich and the poor, which was part of the original premise. Anyone who claims that the main character, Saiga, is poor is clearly wrong based on how he can constantly buy new cameras, outfits, medical treatment, get cars, and support another human being the whole time throughout the entire series. Seeing as how Saiga is supposed to be a mirror of Suitengu, the villain, who has more money than god, this is a bit of a major screw up. The lack of  juxtaposition between the rich and the poor leads to the viewer believing that there aren\'t actually any poor people and fails to get the point of the ""money is the root of all evil"" theme through. I guess a war between the wealthy and the slightly less wealthy will just have to do.The second major problem with Speed Grapher is that despite trying to show that money corrupts people, none of the things that the various villains of the show do seem to be caused by being rich. One lady eats diamonds. That\'s not because she\'s rich, it\'s because she\'s a freak. She belongs on My Strange Addiction rather than be a henchman for the leader of a large underground organization. The show goes into a backstory bit about how her husband drove himself into debt getting diamonds for her, but she isn\'t ever shown to be sympathetic. Instead, the story leads the viewer to dislike her more, seeing as how it seems as though she liked the diamonds more than her husband. It isn\'t shown that money made any of the characters in the show crazy. In fact, it only shows that all of the people in the super special rich people club are just a bunch of sexual deviants and freaks because  that\'s just how they are. One guy is just obsessed with skin because that\'s his bit. It just seems like money isn\'t even the problem in this world as much as just weirdoes who also happen to have money.This leads into the third major problem with this show, which is the gratuity with which we are exposed to degenerate sexual behaviors. The degeneracy isn\'t the problem. The sex isn\'t the problem. The problem is that the viewer is shown these things far too many times after they\'ve already gotten the point. While at first it seems to be a display of maturity on the part of the series, being willing to show sex stuff openly and all, but as it goes on, it just demonstrates how little understanding it has for all things lewd. This comes from an overall lack of sexual tension between any characters in the show. Saiga and his lady Ginza have a sort of sexual relationship, but there isn\'t any tension. The same can at first be said of The villain Suitengu and his lady-friend Shinsen Tenozu. They just kind of have sex sometimes with no real build up or expectation. Characters never explore sex or sexuality in any way, and it\'s just there for no particular reason. It\'s dumb.The last thing I have to complain about before explaining that I actually like this show is the music. The opening and the second ending theme of Speed Grapeher are pretty good. Everything else is trash that never sets the mood or accurately displays the tone of any given scene. The show has an odd amount of 80\'s synthesizers despite having a 2000\'s grunge vibe that would have felt more dirty if more grunge, punk, and progressive rock had been used in the soundtrack opposed to clean and controlled sounds they have. That\'s it for my complaints.I liked this show. You as the reader of this review have no reason to believe that, but it\'s true. Despite its faults, Speed Grapher did one thing really well, and that one thing drives its score up to a seven. That thing of course is its action scenes. Every fight and encounter in Speed Grapher is outstanding. All of the characters have cool powers that work in interesting ways and are used with a great amount of creativity. Due to this, the show has an appeal closer to Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure and Darker than Black. In fact, I\'d say that it\'s a really good in-between of those two shows. In Darker than Black, the powers are only used in one way, but the fights are really dynamic because of it, and in Jojo, the powers are complex, and the fights have a lot of creativity behind them because of it. Speed Grapher gives our main character the ability to blow things up with his camera. This is used in interesting ways, such as when he photographs a reflective surface, the reflection blows up. If he shoots a transparent surface, whatever\'s behind it blows up. Where the characters fall short, their powers do the heavy lifting. Whether that happens to be a good or bad thing is really up to the viewer, but I was in the mood for some neat action scenes when I was watching it, and the show definitely delivers on that front.Speed Grapher has a number of problems, but is worth a watch if you like Darker than Black (Dynamic fights), Jojo (But not as campy) , and Texhnolyze (With a lot less nihilism), but serves as a watered down, shallow combination of them. It\'s pretty neat. Try it out. poor people in this show. The rich are set up to be extraordinarily wealthy. This is okay. The problem starts with how as far as the exposition says, the poor lead absolutely terrible lives, yet none of them are ever seen. We see some prostitutes and drag queens, but those are just generic things out of any poor environment. They aren\'t starving or anything either. Nobody in this show is doing all that bad for themselves overall. This means that there is no dichotomy shown between the rich and the poor, which was part of the original premise. Anyone who claims that the main character, Saiga, is poor is clearly wrong based on how he can constantly buy new cameras, outfits, medical treatment, get cars, and support another human being the whole time throughout the entire series. Seeing as how Saiga is supposed to be a mirror of Suitengu, the villain, who has more money than god, this is a bit of a major screw up. The lack of  juxtaposition between the rich and the poor leads to the viewer believing that there aren\'t actually any poor people and fails to get the point of the ""money is the root of all evil"" theme through. I guess a war between the wealthy and the slightly less wealthy will just have to do.The second major problem with Speed Grapher is that despite trying to show that money corrupts people, none of the things that the various villains of the show do seem to be caused by being rich. One lady eats diamonds. That\'s not because she\'s rich, it\'s because she\'s a freak. She belongs on My Strange Addiction rather than be a henchman for the leader of a large underground organization. The show goes into a backstory bit about how her husband drove himself into debt getting diamonds for her, but she isn\'t ever shown to be sympathetic. Instead, the story leads the viewer to dislike her more, seeing as how it seems as though she liked the diamonds more than her husband. It isn\'t shown that money made any of the characters in the show crazy. In fact, it only shows that all of the people in the super special rich people club are just a bunch of sexual deviants and freaks because  that\'s just how they are. One guy is just obsessed with skin because that\'s his bit. It just seems like money isn\'t even the problem in this world as much as just weirdoes who also happen to have money.This leads into the third major problem with this show, which is the gratuity with which we are exposed to degenerate sexual behaviors. The degeneracy isn\'t the problem. The sex isn\'t the problem. The problem is that the viewer is shown these things far too many times after they\'ve already gotten the point. While at first it seems to be a display of maturity on the part of the series, being willing to show sex stuff openly and all, but as it goes on, it just demonstrates how little understanding it has for all things lewd. This comes from an overall lack of sexual tension between any characters in the show. Saiga and his lady Ginza have a sort of sexual relationship, but there isn\'t any tension. The same can at first be said of The villain Suitengu and his lady-friend Shinsen Tenozu. They just kind of have sex sometimes with no real build up or expectation. Characters never explore sex or sexuality in any way, and it\'s just there for no particular reason. It\'s dumb.The last thing I have to complain about before explaining that I actually like this show is the music. The opening and the second ending theme of Speed Grapeher are pretty good.

In a society of near complete corruption, our protagonist (Saiga) has to work to protect the life of the person he saves from bondage (Kagura). Kagura is known as a goddess who grants powers unknowingly to those she comes in contact with. This makes her a prime target for Japan's elites who desire her abilities in order to give them superhuman gifts.The setting of the show provides a baseline for which the plot progresses and we can see the main characters interact. A lot of the characters are fairly...one dimensional (at least on the villain spectrum). The exception to this is the series main antagonist Suitengu. When finishing the series, I found that I really sympathized with Suitengu and even wanted him to accomplish his goal to a certain extent. In fact, both he and saiga seem to have the same goal of wanting to expose corruption within Japanese society, however they have different ways of accomplishing this goal. This makes for an interesting conflict between the two.The viewer is able to emphasize with both Kagura and Saiga because both strongly seek the goal of freedom. A lot of series is getting to see the two develop a bond. While this is enjoyable, the show isn't as captivating because kagura is a character archtype most are already too familiar with seeing in anime with minimal development.The fights in the series don't add up to much. They are enjoyable, but the fights don't have much plot tied to them. They exist merely to explore Saiga's powers as he and Kagura repeatedly try to run away. I must say that the fights are enjoyable and the way the powers are implemented are unique.Although the plot is fairly slow and not as interesting at times, the anime is very captivating near the end and it wraps up nicely, which is rare for a lot of anime.

Gonzo obviously put most of their time and resources into that pilot episode to hook watchers in, because none of the magic in it is present later on. Even the pacing is much better, if the rest of the show was as well-paced then maybe it would be a more reasonable 12 episodes rather than an agonizing 24. Mix the poor animation with the repetitive, uninspired soundtrack, and it\'s almost bad enough in a The Room sort of...way. Almost.Next up is the cast. Initially, it showed promise. Saiga had this weird fetish and interesting enough background for a good story, Ginza was basically filled to the brim with personality and potential, and Kagura seemed like a character ripe for development. Unfortunately, they handed off these fine ideas to some 6th graders after running out of cash to pay their writers to afford the animation staff of the first episode. Saiga reveals himself to be a completely static, watching-paint-dry level character with no real depth to speak of. Ginza, who somehow manages to be one of the stronger characters by the end of the show, ends up never realizing her potential and just sort of exists to throw a small wrench in the story on occasion... But at least she has some spunk and is actually memorable. Kagura gets a TINY bit of development as she becomes more independent about halfway through the story, but it\'s pretty minor and she\'s still somehow more boring and one dimensional than Saiga, sort of just existing an object for the plot as opposed to a fleshed out character. Seriously, they could\'ve replaced Kagura with a magical stone or something and it would\'ve panned out about the same.The structure of the narrative is... Messy. There\'s this unnecessary Monster of the Week formula that is thrown in solely to pad out the show. I believe there are roughly 7 of these episodes that could\'ve been cut out in pretty much their entirety and the narrative would have stayed the exact same. Now, I\'m not saying this is inherently bad, there are some good shows that utilize the Monster of the Week formula, but those shows tend to... You know... Actually be entertaining. In Jojo, you get an insane axe-wielding manlet that turns people into children and fetuses. Jojo gives you a literal primate with a giant living cargo ship as his battle spirit. In Speed Grapher, you get... Crazy dentist guy that uh... Has spider legs? Woman that has a convenient power that is primarily useful against specifically Saiga and would be rendered useless if he had a gun instead of a stupid camera ability? Keep in mind all of these throwaway villains get owned in the lamest ways possible, and all of them only serve as pointless obstacles in the way of the narrative.Another issue with the pacing is the monologues. Oh boy, the monologues. Get rid of the Monster of the Week bullshit and the speeches and you\'d have a pretty tight 12 episodes and a notably better show. You know that old writing rule, ""Show, don\'t tell""? Speed Grapher is the epitome of why this should be at least somewhat followed. There are so many damn monologues in this anime that all have the same damn sob story instrumental backing them that I would legitimately facepalm in the second half of the show whenever it played.And for the last negative criticism, I think the show lacks bite and is rather immature. The only time I was like ""oh damn"" is when Suitengu\'s motive was revealed in a flashback showing him mercy killing his sister who was turned into a sex slave. The 1% is said to be very corrupt and devious but we only see glimpses of this in its raw form, preventing much real emotional connection to the idea. Bob is... Likely the worst written recurring gay character in anime. He\'s flamboyant, sexually questionable, and exists to serve and praise Saiga because he\'s so awesome and totally not boring as fuck. I could get into the nitty gritty of the dialogue, but my review is already getting long in the tooth.Now, for the positives. While Suitengu is seemingly one dimensional in the first half, he ends up guiding the story in a unique direction with a strong motive and goal. Seeing his family torn apart due to the greed of the elite would drive anyone to do some crazy stuff, and he proves to be a uniquely Accelerationist paragon in the very last stretch. Magical, really, since I\'d be surprised if the writing staff was even aware of the concept of Accelerationism when they wrote Suitengu if the rest of the show is any indication. Suitengu almost saves Speed Grapher... But it\'s too little too late.Euphoria factor is an interesting concept even if it goes nowhere and it fails to develop into a compelling power system. Fetish powers could be a good idea to use in a more competent show going forward.

The gore animation wasn\'t too over the top like some anime could be. As expected, the fight scenes in this ova is quite good. I also really liked that character animation.Sound (8.5) : There isn\'t an op or ed to judge, but I must say, the OST was quite good. It fitted the anime very well and didn\'t seem out of place at all.Character (9) : For characters, we have the overpowered Arima and the guy who wants revenge, Fura. We also have Minami, who seems like a cute and innocent girl. There is a little character development for Fura, from a rebellious teenager to an outstanding ghoul investigator. It was quite interesting to watch the main characters interact with each other.Enjoyment (10) : The original Tokyo Ghoul series (Not Root A), is one of my favorite anime of all time. So of course, I would have enjoyed this ova and I enjoyed every single bit of it. Unlike root A, which I disappointed me a lot.Overall (9) : I really liked this ova and can\'t wait for Pinto which is coming next season. I would recommend this ova to anyone who enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul.

All I can say is thank you Studio Pierrot, but I still don't forgive you for Root A. They did a 180 from Root A and did not butcher Ishida Sui's work at all!Tokyo Ghoul: Jack's story, art, and characters are all beautifully adapted from the manga for our viewing pleasure. The OST is also completely brand new and fitting! You will not, I repeat, you will NOT be disappointed in by the Tokyo Ghoul: Jack OVA adaptation.The only possible downfall is that it's only 30 minutes long! Overall enjoyment is 10/10.P.S.

It felt like a bit of a let down since there was no Kaneki. But that still doesn\'t affect my review cause the characters and action was great without it.I really liked the mood the Introduction of the OVA generated. It gave me a sort of ""Japanese Hotline Miami"" feel, which i loved.Fight Scenes were action packed and full of tension.I think conclusion was a great summary, which was also not a completely closed ended ending as it leaves room for other OVA\'s to develop.T~T No Kaneki...but still 10/10 but still 10/10', 'Might contain spoilers, So, read on your own risk.Been waiting for this one to air and after watching, I\'m somewhat happy.

There was enough romance, suspense (a little), mystery and action for a 30 min. ova.They\'s packed so much in 30 minutes and I\'ve loved it. Thank goodness it was nothing like ROOT A.Although, I felt as if, the end was kinda rushed. Felt like they just ended it out of nowhere.

If anyone needed a reaffirmation that Arima Kishou was a badass ""Jack"" OVA is a pretty good refresher.Story/Character:Having read the manga prior to the anime adaptation I have to admit the story was captured quite well. Aside from a few events out of order and expected dialogue differences nothing felt out of place. The only thing that I would have changed was less foreshadowing someone\'s ""true identity"" and a little more development between Arima and Fura. It felt like their commitment to each other was a...little rushed seeing as they had spent almost no time together unlike the manga that shows them take down many a Ghoul before even saving Minami.Art/Sound: The animation in this OVA was brilliant and had quite a few exhilarating fight scenes. The music was good as expected of a Tokyo Ghoul related animation. I have always thoroughly enjoyed the mixture of haunting as well beautiful piano tracks the series has to offer.Overall, I really enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul: Jack.

The artwork, animation and sound are all ""√A1"" and while they differ from the actual anime series, it is a good change. I felt immersed from the first opening shot of the city and streets. I was given the sense of atmosphere which I desired going into something Tokyo Ghoul related.Character development is done well for a 30-minute runtime. However, one thing that bothers me is that Arima is a tad bit...""Overpowered"" for his age. Most investigators are older, wiser and through experience gain the skill he seemed to show off in only 2-3 scenes. The fights could\'ve been a lot better too. When I think of Tokyo Ghoul, I think of fast paced, glowing characters across the screen where as we only recieve a small amount of that in this OVA.I respect this OVA more then the anime series but it does have flaws which are not that bad in comparison. ""Jack"" is a 7/10 in my eyes because of the artwork, decent character development, and really good story arc. ""Overpowered"" for his age.

""Jack"" is a 7/10 in my eyes because of the artwork, decent character development, and really good story arc.', 'Art: 9-9.5/10 Character designs are eye-pleasing and there is a decent amount of detail (e.g weapons, clothing etc could be seen clearly). Not quite ""insanely awesome"" like I would say for Kara no Kyoukai (the original 7 movies not the abomination that came later) or say Mardock Scramble or a lot of other anime, but still looks pretty damn good.Animation: 9-9.5/10 There are a few very well animated scenes that would frankly put most animated movies to shame. I\'m talking about the arima vs minami fight at the end of the episode. The character animation for minami was simply drop-dead gorgeous when she revealed...her kagune (having her slowly glide to the ground on her kagune was a beautiful touch). In general the kagune animations in this OVA are incredibly smooth and eye-pleasing.Choreography: 6/10 Unfortunately the OVA (as does the main TG series itself) drops the ball when it comes to fight choreography. Most of the time Arima is just running around dodging tentacles here and there and fights are typically ended by him just running up and slashing the ghoul across the midsection. The most decisive action in the final fight was just a simple spear throw which while arguably more practical is visually unimpressive. If you compare the fight choreography here to the choreography in let\'s say Seirei no Moribito (and in fact most Production I.G-directed action series such as Real Drive or most BONES-directed action series like FMA and FMAB) it\'s very lackluster. Now you could argue that the OVA is limited by the manga in terms of how good of a choreography it could actually use and having read the manga I think this argument has some merit. On the other hand I would argue that there is such a thing as Creative License (I know it usually refers to something different but here I use it to mean ""freedom to not stick completely faithfully to the source material"") and I know that a lot of anime studios do not adapt a manga totally faithfully (see the 1993 JJBA OVA for example) and this may lead to lots of bitching by manga readers but also an excellent and enjoyable work when viewed in its own right (yes I know that OVA had Mitsuo Iso working on it but it doesn\'t mean you can only take liberties when you have a godlike animator on your team). So I think in this case a more thoughtful and perhaps more daring director could have chosen to alter the scenes so as to depict superior fight choreography. In any case there is large room for improvement.Direction: 8.5/10 There are quite a few very well directed scenes in the anime but I felt the transitions between scenes were a bit abrupt and not very smooth. There were too many jump cuts than necessitated but overall the choice of camera angles (both perspective and level of zoom) is sound. There were not any outstanding shots that I would call attention to unlike the case with Trust and Betrayal and a few scenes in Hunter X Hunter 1999 which I consider among the most well directed action anime ever. Whilst there is a good amount of foreshadowing in the anime I felt that took away some of the surprise from the reveal at the end so I would argue that is not a sign of excellent direction after all. I would also question the choice of scenes to include as I thought that perhaps a few more scenes could have been devoted to developing the character relationships so we could actually care about the people who died. It would have helped to show a more human side to Arima (maybe show him waking up in the morning or cooking or eating food or something) so he doesn\'t come off as a complete autist. The meeting between Yamori and Lantern also did not give off the vibes of 2 extremely dangerous ghouls meeting one another so could use some improvement.Story: The story was weird as fuck. None of the characters acted realistically. Especially Lantern and Arima. I know they\'re ghouls but...are all ghouls supposed to be mentally messed up? They are literally batshit insane. Lantern wants to experience human life, then she goes out and starts fucking murdering people. Like...what are you trying to go for here, seriously. And I\'m not sure why she suicided at the end but that felt weird and out of place. I know it\'s supposed to make you cry or some shit? But we had like 5 minutes of screen time and she was acting fake as fuck all the way through so...yeah. There was not a minute of genuine emotion from Minami except when she was dying so I can\'t say she was a very well developed character. Arima is an emotionless autist so not much to say there (he acts weirdly out of character a few times like letting Fura and Minami in on his secret Lantern-hunting mission which he isn\'t supposed to let anyone know about but w/e maybe he\'s psychic or something). Fura is...not very delinquent-like. Idk what delinquents are like in Japan but he doesn\'t act like any delinquent I know of. And especially that guy that died at the start - ""we should have stayed and played baseball"" - FUCKING REALLY? THESE ARE YOUR LAST WORDS? Come the fuck on man...okay. Enough bitching about the one aspect of anime that I don\'t really care about.Overall: Delicious Minami tentacles and some hot Arima-on-ghoul action mmm tasty.

The storyline was a nice easy running ghoul story with a very relatable story from Uruka Minami who is super cute in all ways. If the main show kept this sort of pacing it would have soared even higher.The art is a great standard and very much the style of the show.The sound was nicely selected and gave a really good side story vibe even.Characters are developed off the main story of course which is great. Aki is the weakest of the characters that matter since...she is somewhat selfish compared to Minami especially.A nicely constructed story well worth a watch. she is somewhat selfish compared to Minami especially.A nicely constructed story well worth a watch.', 'English version:The story is basically about the youth of Arima Kishou, showing how he was such a prodigy and powerful since as younger.

In general, that\'s far...from being a masterpiece but it is very nostalgic and I highly recommend it to people that already finished the second season of Tokyo Ghoul.Portuguese version:A história se trata basicamente de um conto da juventude de Arima Kishou, mostrando como ele era mesmo um prodígio, mostrando que desde adolescente ele seria (ou talvez já fosse) o membro mais forte e habilidoso de toda a CCG.

You don't get the characters' full story though, and the plot itself remains mostly a plain police-detective story. To end in a positive tone though, I would say that it had some well crafted elements of surprise with respect to the development of certain events.Characters: None of the characters impressed me! Both Taishi Fura and Arima seemed really promising, but I was not given enough background for either of them, nor has the plot...helped in this direction. In consequence, I lost interest. Some aspects about their pasts were hinted at, but in the end no much connection could be made with their present lives. Arima's motives remained a complete mystery too. Uruka Minami was also disappointing. Her motivation seemed exaggerated.

This is a double edged sword in storytelling, on the one hand you don't have to worry much about sticking to established themes or character traits because so far as we know there aren't any, but on the other you have to climb the hurdle of getting the audience to care about what are essentially new characters in just one episode's time.As...far as getting emotionally invested in the character I think the episode does a good enough job of that. I certainly found myself caring more about Jack than a good number of the supposed main characters from this franchise. It gives him a clear motivation and really lets you root for him as he tries his best to hunt down various ghouls murder mystery style. It was a neat little story, though the twist was a little obvious if you stopped to think about it for a second.I think if you have no prior knowledge of the manga or future installments in the franchise as I did when going into this you can still have a good time. It feels like you might get a little more out of it if you had any idea who Arima is, and going into season 3 or season :Re or whatever it's called I think I'll actually care a bit more about him as a character now that I at least can tell you who he is and what his deal is.8/10 surprisingly good. far as getting emotionally invested in the character I think the episode does a good enough job of that.

It expands a lot on someone I didn\'t care or know much about in the main series. I don\'t often come across an anime where delinquents are portrayed sympathetically. In this they are. You are quickly made to realize that they\'re just goofy kids, theyre not a stereotype. There\'s a really interesting parallel to the way the way deliquents are described, as ""deserving"" of the bad things that happen to them, and the ghouls. I think it\'s also interesting how Tokyo Ghoul, which is largely a story about persecution, could easily have framed the ghouls as completely lacking humanity....It\'s easy to see how Fura could join the CCG thinking they were doing a morally right thing, and how Arima could feel the same. The characters in this OVA have great chemistry. I could easily see them being protagonists in a longer series.

This studio is mainly known for the “World Masterpiece Theater”: under this label, there are many animes which are all based on a classic western novel.In this case, the anime takes its source from the classic 19th century novel of the American writer Mark Twain/Sam Clemens. in the same vein than others 80s animes, it was widely broadcast on many European TV channels (Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain…) with a significant success: millions of kids have watched it at that time…I was one of them ^_^The scene takes place in...a town close to the Mississippi river in the 19th century USA, and we followed the fantastic adventure of the young Tom Sawyer and his friends.The art and animation are very satisfactory for an anime of this generation. Like other Nippon animation anime, the general work is less “Manga style” than usual (no blue hair or galaxy like eyes), very likely to stick more with its literary source.The target audience is obviously the children. All the ingredients that will make a child dream of marvelous adventures are gathered here.The strength of this anime is the very naturalistic aspect of all the environments and the plausibility of the personality of each character (children or adults) making this anime quite realistic from a western standpoint and it will surely awake the little child who sleep in everyone of us.The music by its funny aspects and the use of traditional instruments match perfectly the action and the astuteness of our young hero.Like many others eighties anime, The French Dubbing is once more very professional and has involved a wise choice of voice actors (especially Francette Vernillat whose voice fit perfectly Tom Sawyer). Unfortunately I never get the chance to hear the dubbing in other languages. Maybe some of you can tell us…Overall, this anime will entice positively a young audience by the inner nature of Tom Sawyer and his adventures but will raise interest among older viewers by its naturalistic aspects as well…Let’s play the pirate on the Mississippi! a town close to the Mississippi river in the 19th century USA, and we followed the fantastic adventure of the young Tom Sawyer and his friends.The art and animation are very satisfactory for an anime of this generation.

The bad guy of the anime makes few appearances but when he does, it means something and leaves the viewer intrigued. Injun Joe is truly one of the most underrated villains in anime history. His appearances in some of the last 12 episodes of the anime, makes the show enter a new type of quality. ', ""Set in the United States of the 19th century, this anime shows us the life of a rather naughty boy: Tom Sawyer and his companions and friends. Tom lives with his brother (in the book he mentions that he is a stepbrother) and his aunt Polly. Tom is very lazy boy, mischievous and always a headache for his aunt and his school teacher who will not hesitate to punish him ... with beatings.Tom prefers to be free, to play near the river with his best friend, Huckleberry Finn, who lives an enviable freedom for other children. His mother died long ago and his father,...a drunkard, practically abandoned him. Tom likes adventures and he will always be looking for a way to have them. For example, one day he had the idea of being pirates and living on an abandoned island in the riverFor a few days he lived there with Huck and another friend of both. Since no one was notified of this adventure, the days passed and even the adults believed they were dead. On the day of his funeral they appeared at church out of nowhere.Mark Twain, the original author of this story, drew a bit from his experiences as a child near the Mississippi River.

Tsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no Himegimi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/807/Tsubasa_Chronicle__Tori_Kago_no_Kuni_no_Himegimi,"[""I'll get right to the point and try to make this review simple. Please do note that I will occasionally refer to the anime series, hence there will be some bias present in my review.Story: 6/10Despite being called a movie, its duration is rather short (personally I feel as though it was an OVA or extended episode). The movie has a rather plain and unsurprising plot, not exactly superb but its not horrible either. Still better than most of the fillers from the Tsubasa anime.Art: 10/10As expected of Production I.G, the animation is simply superb and detailed, with a wonderful use of colours. The...movements of both the characters and inanimate objects are fluid, and the character designs are also pleasing. There were hardly any moments where I felt the characters look like they were drawn rather odd. While I originally intended to give the art a 9, thinking of how disappointing the animation of the anime series done  by BeeTrain was, I decided to give it a 10. You can clearly see the difference in animation quality between the two studios.Sound: 9/10Music has always been the strongest point of the Tsubasa anime series to me. The music used were all familiar tracks from the anime series, all composed by Yuki Kajiura, so theres no problem where music is concerned, though I did feel that some of the tracks used didn't quite suit the scene. The opening song and ending songs by Kinya and Yui Makino respectively were also very good and fit the movie well.Character: 6Being a 30 minute movie, there isn't exactly anything special about the character development, as the audience is expected to know them by now. They are all the same as you see them in the anime/manga.Enjoyment: 7Although some will find this movie rather boring or too short, I really did enjoy it. Especially when compared to all those filler episodes from the anime.Overall: 7Overall, I find the Tsubasa Chronicle movie rather entertaining despite being only 30 minutes long. Is this movie really worth your time to watch? While I wouldn't recommend this movie as a must watch, it certainly wont hurt to give it a try either.The plot is simple but the animation really makes up for it (Once more the Tsubasa anime comes to mind when I say this). You are not obligated to fully agree with my ratings and opinions nor does this review truly reflect what this movie is like. Hope you enjoyed this review by a first-timer like me. movements of both the characters and inanimate objects are fluid, and the character designs are also pleasing.

It isn\'t one of my favorite shows, but it was pretty good and I look forward to the second season. However, this short film was quite terrible.Story (3/10): I rarely have ever been so lost as to what the hell was going on in an anime. This movie has absolutely nothing to offer. It isn\'t canon and adds nothing to the story. This ""movie"" (if you even want to call it that considering how short it is) doesn\'t even feel anything like the Tsubasa TV series does. It\'s just...a mindless short story about... hell, I don\'t even know what it WAS about!Character (3/10): The Tsubasa characters have zero presence. They are just there. The entire time, they seem to be screwing around and at one point flying on some sort of thing (I don\'t remember what) to try and let some mute girl talk again. (If that\'s even what was happening. I couldn\'t follow the mindless story.) The ""villain"" in this movie is extremely clichéd and boring and could not be more forgettable. Every other character introduced also sucks. The mute girl could be an interesting character if she had development, but she\'s not gonna get that in 35 minutes.Art (7.5/10): The animation was pretty good. It looks better than the TV series. My only gripe is the coloring. They made Syaoran\'s hair much too light...Sound (7/10): The sound was fine. Nothing sounded bad, but nothing astounded me either.Enjoyment (2/10): 15 minutes in I found myself almost falling asleep. If this movie was any longer than it was, I don\'t think I could have finished it. I don\'t think I have ever been so happy to see the credits roll after an anime movie.Overall (3.3/10): Overall, this is a crap movie with nothing to offer. It adds nothing to the series and was just a way for them to get some money off of Tsubasa fans. Don\'t bother watching it unless you are a completionist who wants to see everything Tsubasa, no matter the quality. a mindless short story about... hell, I don\'t even know what it WAS about!Character (3/10): The Tsubasa characters have zero presence.

The plot is little more than a chapter from the manga or an episode from the  TV series just stripped of most of any depth either one might have.It\'s a very simple and basic story of our heroes landing in one of the many ""world of the week"" seen in an adventure and fighting ""big bad of the week"" and resolving the plot at the end.   Ideal for a short especially for one aimed...at a younger audience over the older demographic the manga was written for, or the more all-age-demographic the TV show aimed for. While not really vital to see or read the source material of the movie you might be thrown off just a bit if you jump into this blind with no information. The movie does it\'s best to set the background of the plot by recreating the first encounter with Yuko who explains the needed sacrifice from Syaoran to save Sakura\'s life so even then getting lost in this movie should not be an issue.The art and animation style is lovely, being it is a movie, with a beautiful and lively color pallet and really great and detailed art direction.  With character desiigns by Yoko Kikuchi it plays a little more closely to CLAMP\'s signature art style but without the stiff limitations often seen.The cinematography also is pretty creative in the same right and shows a lot of high professionalism despite the short length. Proved to not be a throwaway B-Team project against the A-Team Holic project, I.G did clearly commit some resources sadly lacking from the TV series and later OVAs.Much if any music by Yuki Kajiura is unfortunately tossed into the background and doesn\'t offer anything new for the franchise OST being just one or two simple pieces that you will barely notice, topped with some of the more iconic pieces such as ""Break the sword of Justice.""Likely in an effort to differentiate themselves from the TV series and to work around Kajiura\'s schedule they quickly edited a few pieces together and downplayed much of the original score. There is a opening theme by singer Kinya, who also provided the opening them songs for the TV series, but the song seems placed in the movie for the sake of having an opening theme given it plays for only five seconds and doesn\'t get it\'s full rendition anywhere in the movie it self.  Yui Makino on the other hand gets to show her vocal talents with a full ending song, ""Amrita"" which is a nice ending theme to close out as the credits roll.The acting in the Japanese version is very solid with a great cast of Miyu Irino, Yui Makino, Tetsu Inada, Daisuke Namikawa and Mika Kikuchi. The English dubbing however is less than stellar with a handful of good performances but two weak performances by Monica Rial as Sakura and Carrie Savage as Mokona.   Like in the series these two are the weak links and are both a miscast for these important roles.  Jason Libercht however does perfect to capture Syaoran and manages to catch what Irino brings to the role perfect.  Same can be said of Chris Sabat as Kurogane and Vic Mignogna as Fai.The TRC movie is visually beautiful and well made but doesn\'t really offer anything much more given it\'s strangely undercut running time, a suitable pre-show for the Holic movie but not much to give on it\'s own.   Fans will enjoy it enough but there\'s not much to entice a general audience. at a younger audience over the older demographic the manga was written for, or the more all-age-demographic the TV show aimed for.

Fans will enjoy it enough but there\'s not much to entice a general audience.', 'Unlike its companion (xxxHolic: Midsummer\'s Night Dream), this film offers nothing to a household name as Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. If possible, avoid it at all costs.Story (3/10): I\'m being nice here, since there is no plot. I am no against plotless movies, that is, movies in which its plot is developed through music, surrealism, and style rather than straightforward, understandable actions that lead the storyline. I\'m open to avant-garde storytelling. The xxxHolic movie partially falls into this kind of cinema; however, Tsubasa\'s film pretends to have a traditional kind of plot but it\'s so filled with plot holes, nonsensical actions, characters that do things just...because that makes this film accomplish nothing no matter how you look at it. At this point I can\'t tell what was  the bad guy\'s goal. I can\'t tell what the birdcage was. I can\'t tell you a summary even if I wanted to. If you add the fact that the film contradicts Tsubasa\'s universe and even the film itself, things get worse: Mokona should act as their means to understand each other, a translator of the sorts, they even point it out early in the film, but no matter how far from other they all are, they can easily interact. The leader of the royal guards (I don\'t know the name) was easily  kicked in the face by Fye but at the same time had no problem avoiding Syaoran\'s kick, even though the latter is a way more proficient physical combatant than Fye. To make things worse, Syaoran gets to be proficient again later on the film.Art (5/10): The designs are nice, the animation is smooth which makes the battle scenes rather enjoyable, but the backgrounds look off every now and then. It makes the characters look like they\'re not there. For a feature film you\'d expect more.Sound (3/10): Nothing memorable. Not one single melody, sound effect or piece is worth mentioning.Character (1/10): Characters here are here just for the sake of the ""plot."" The villain is the worst case. At the end you won\'t understand why he did what he did, and especially , why he did it the way he did it.Enjoyment (3/10): Only enjoyable is you can just watch fights and give zero importance to what is going on there.Overall (3/10): It\'s rather sad this is what they made to be the xxxHolic film\'s companion. They couldn\'t be so different in quality. I know the xxxHolic film was written by the Clamp\'s leader herself, but that\'s no excuse no make the Tsubasa film a worse than a mediocre job. It\'s like they tried to develop a complex plot but chopped many scenes out due to time constraints. The movie should have been 30-40 minutes longer at least to accomplish whatever it tried to accomplish. If possible, avoid this film. It\'s not worth +30 minutes of your time. because that makes this film accomplish nothing no matter how you look at it. At this point I can\'t tell what was  the bad guy\'s goal.

This is the worst movie I've ever seen this year!Story: 3 (Poor)On paper, the premise of the movie showed some promise, specifically due to the fact that Princess Tomoyo (from a different dimension than the one Kurogane is from) makes an appearance. We haven't seen much of Tomoyo in both the anime and manga when this movie was released, so this is a potentially interesting story where we not only get to see Kurogane interact with this version...of Tomoyo, but also explore a minor character who only appeared in the first chapter of Tsubasa, right? Nope.Instead, the story goes through the motion of a formulaic plot. Be aware that for a movie, it is very short (lasting only 35 minutes!), so there's not much plot to begin with. Something bad happens to Tomoyo, Syaoran and the gang tries to take down the tyrant king, they acquire the feather, the end. That's it! I wish I'm joking, but aside from the convoluted lore of this country and the convoluted motivation of the villain to bring darkness into the world - neither of which were explained, presumably because they ran out of time in the 35 minutes - there's really nothing interesting here, and you won't miss anything.Character: 1 (Pathetic)That's right, pathetic. Character development is none, because there's not enough time to do any of that in the 35 minutes. The dialogue is brief and thin, so you won't learn much about Tomoyo's personality in this world, and the other minor characters are uninteresting plot-devices existing merely to move the plot along. We don't learn anything about that little boy that joins Syaoran's adventure either, Koruri. He merely mistook Syaoran as the bad guy at the beginning and becomes practically invisible throughout the rest of the movie (till the very end in the very last scene). Syaoran and Sakura are just trudging along as they always do, having no special development that's specifically made for the movie. What kind of writing is this? I've seen better character writing in Transformers movies!Worse of all, Kurogane, the one who's supposed to have the most feelings towards someone who looks like Princess Tomoyo (irregardless of whether if it's the actual person or not) only appears for about TEN MINUTES of the entire movie! Ten minutes! Kurogane and Fai are left behind as side characters! What the hell is going on?!Art: 6 (Fair)Being a movie, the art is thankfully much better and more detailed than the TV series. But there are also slight variations and some weird changes that make the familiar characters you know look awkward. For example, Mokona looks thinner for some reason, and all of the main characters have slightly different faces from the TV series. The fight scenes are the highlight because of the improved visuals, but that's about it - a pretty but hollow thing.Sound: 4 (Decent)The music is functional. It keeps the movie from being too boring, and certain movies (like GTO) do have very awkward scenes where there's complete silence that makes it a dull experience, so at least this movie has the decency to add workable music. But that's it, workable and functional. Yuki Kajiura's sounds were recycled from the TV series, and if she added any new themes here, they were uninspired and didn't stand out.Enjoyment: 2 (Dreadful)Needless to say, I was left in shock when the movie ended. I kept waiting for a more interesting development to happen, something that might add layers or offer us new perspectives of the familiar characters we know, but nope, it just ended. What a slap in the face.Overall: 2 (Dreadful)This feels more like an advertisement for the Tsubasa anime and manga than a movie. Stay away from it, do not waste your time. There's nothing to offer for any kind of audience, both new and old fans of Tsubasa. Stick with the TV series, or better yet, the manga. of Tomoyo, but also explore a minor character who only appeared in the first chapter of Tsubasa, right? Nope.Instead, the story goes through the motion of a formulaic plot. Be aware that for a movie, it is very short (lasting only 35 minutes!), so there's not much plot to begin with.

The dialogue is brief and thin, so you won't learn much about Tomoyo's personality in this world, and the other minor characters are uninteresting plot-devices existing merely to move the plot along. We don't learn anything about that little boy that joins Syaoran's adventure either, Koruri. He merely mistook Syaoran as the bad guy at the beginning and becomes practically invisible throughout the rest of the movie (till the very end in the very last scene). Syaoran and Sakura are just trudging along as they always do, having no special development that's specifically made for the movie. What kind of writing is this? I've seen better character writing in Transformers movies!Worse of all, Kurogane, the one who's supposed to have the most feelings towards someone who looks like Princess Tomoyo (irregardless of whether if it's the actual person or not) only appears for about TEN MINUTES of the entire movie! Ten minutes! Kurogane and Fai are left behind as side characters! What the hell is going on?!Art: 6 (Fair)Being a movie, the art is thankfully much better and more detailed than the TV series. But there are also slight variations and some weird changes that make the familiar characters you know look awkward. For example, Mokona looks thinner for some reason, and all of the main characters have slightly different faces from the TV series. The fight scenes are the highlight because of the improved visuals, but that's about it - a pretty but hollow thing.Sound: 4 (Decent)The music is functional. It keeps the movie from being too boring, and certain movies (like GTO) do have very awkward scenes where there's complete silence that makes it a dull experience, so at least this movie has the decency to add workable music. But that's it, workable and functional. Yuki Kajiura's sounds were recycled from the TV series, and if she added any new themes here, they were uninspired and didn't stand out.Enjoyment: 2 (Dreadful)Needless to say, I was left in shock when the movie ended. I kept waiting for a more interesting development to happen, something that might add layers or offer us new perspectives of the familiar characters we know, but nope, it just ended. What a slap in the face.Overall: 2 (Dreadful)This feels more like an advertisement for the Tsubasa anime and manga than a movie. Stay away from it, do not waste your time. There's nothing to offer for any kind of audience, both new and old fans of Tsubasa. Stick with the TV series, or better yet, the manga."", 'So guys, Tsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no Himegimi show us when Sakura, Sayoran, Fay and Kurogane arrived in a new world called Land of BirdCage, there they discovered that people and birds have a good relationship, everybody has one bird, in this new place they have to fight against the King of Land of Birdcage, and save this world and Tomoyo-Hime. you can call this movie as a OVA because it is so short. ^^ ', ""I am a rabid fan of anything relating to Tsubasa Chronicle, so I naturally picked up this movie. In this review, I will treat this movie as a side story arc within the Tsubasa Chronicle franchise.Story: 2Whoever decided that 30 minutes was enough time for a typical Tsubasa Chronicle arc needs to be fired. You will hard pressed to find another story so rushed and choppy in anime. The scenes were extremely short, the story moved light-speed fast, and there were huge informational gaps between scenes. One particular scene transition that comes to mind is one scene involved the characters forming a plan and...then the very next scene the environment and circumstances had changed, a decent amount of time had passed, and what happened during that time was quickly brushed over with hurried dialogue. It was like watching the preparations for a battle and then skipping over the fight scene to the outcome. A better analogue would be that this movie was originally a 3 hour feature film that was edited down to 30 minutes, so only flashing visual pictures of plot points were shown. The only reason why I gave this story even a 2 is that the concepts themselves weren't irritating or originally atrocious.Art: 8For a 2005 anime movie, the art is quite good. It stays true to the rest of the earlier Tsubasa Chronicle franchise.Sound: 9The same OST from the series is used in the movie, so it is excellent. Gorgeous could not be a better word to describe this OST. However, the 10/10 OST is compromised by ill-timing. Songs were either played during inappropriate scenes or choppily edited.Character: 5I tried to view the characters independently from the series. Since the characters were slaves to the rushed plot and not allowed to display their typically strong personalities and character development, they came off rather bland. The new characters especially suffered from this, but they were rather uninteresting to begin with.Enjoyment: 3Everything was moving so fast and with so little explanation that I found very little enjoyment in this movie. I felt like I was watching the Tsubasa Chronicle characters perform an improvised skit while casually listening to its phenomenal soundtrack.Overall: 3One of the worst cases of storytelling that I've ever seen. At least it was Tsubasa Chronicles so it had good art and music, but the shadow characters and atrocious storytelling made it barely watchable. then the very next scene the environment and circumstances had changed, a decent amount of time had passed, and what happened during that time was quickly brushed over with hurried dialogue.

As movies are usually given around 2 hours, this would likely have been padded out with more explanation if it had been given the time. In a way, I wish it would have been since what was there already had potential, but given that it wasn't with its 30 or so runtime minutes, I would rather judge this less like a movie and more like an episode or OVA.Looking at it from the perspective of an episode or OVA makes me feel far more positive about it in...the context of the series. It might feel like an afterthought if you're watching it years after seeing the original series and for this, I don't blame you, but given that I saw it not long afterward, I didn't feel that I was left waiting for something that didn't deliver. It actually fit in with the style of the series storytelling quite well and could've easily passed as another episode. If that had been the case, I would've easily considered it one of the best episodes.The art was excellent with a vibrant colour palette and the animation was smooth. The panning stills people complained about? Gone. There are scenes where they used shortcuts (obvious if you know what to look for), but they still made the series far more visually appealing than pretty much anything in the original series. Their fight scenes were far better choreographed and it looks like they had access to a better team with far more reference material and experience.The sound quality was fine with excellent voice acting, but what even was happening with the music? It was so out of place in certain scenes that it actively broke immersion. If the music mixing in the episode could be touched up, it'd be basically perfect.As for the characters, they expect you to pretty well know everyone going in so you don't learn anything new about them, however, their characterizations are vastly improved in this movie. Body language had been an issue in the original series where the characters themselves were pretty much as static as the still shots. Here, characters have a larger range of emotions and expression with weight added to their interactions even if we're not learning anything special. Though they aren't going to win any awards, I was still happy to see Fai do more than close his eyes and smile at everything.Overall, nothing groundbreaking, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. the context of the series.

The plot comes out of seemingly nowhere and the ending is linked to the xxxHolic movie: A Midsummer\'s Night Dream, though that isn\'t terribly important. What I found most confusing was that some of the logic didn\'t quite seem explained enough in the movie. For instance, it\'s never really understood why the ring was necessary for the ritual, or the truth as to what ""power"" Tomoyo and her uncle held. In my opinion, the guard was a minor character and didn\'t need...as big of a role as he had, while other characters (Fai and Kurogane) took a backseat, especially near the film\'s end. However, there are some positives; the action and plot makes some degree of sense and creates some intrigue, and Syaoran\'s barrel attack was the best scene of the movie, as well as Sakura being given Tomoyo\'s ring. Overall, I am of the opinion that if you enjoyed Tsubasa Chronicles, then this movie is arguably worth giving a try, so long as you don\'t care about the little details too much. 7/10. as big of a role as he had, while other characters (Fai and Kurogane) took a backseat, especially near the film\'s end.

Uma Musume: Pretty Derby,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35249/Uma_Musume__Pretty_Derby,"[""Sometimes I just really fucking love Japan. This time is that time. Welcome to Uma Musume, show about horse-girls.Ever since the masterpiece of sports anime, Keijo, ended, I have been eagerly waiting for another series that treasures the beauty of sportic anime ladies. This time they have animals ears, tails and are so goddamn happy all the time. It's great.The characters are the selling point of this anime. Special Week (yes, that's an actual name of the main character) is super positive and energetic. It's almost as if there is no reining day in her life.(heh, pun). Unless someone sexually abuses her legs. Make...sure to never go behind a horse girl or she might just kick you!Silence Suzuka on the other hand is perfectly sportic. She was born to run. Whenever she trots away I find myself sitting on the edge of my saddle in awe. Amazing. This is what Sports series should be like. Forget that seasonal 'Megalo Box' and see what true sportsmanship is all about.These girls have a dream to be the fastest horse-girls in the universe (by universe I mean within this anime because this type of shit doesn't exist anywhere else). How do they achieve this then? By going to horse-girl school and eating food like a.... well like a horse, but also with the power of friendship (the polar opposite type of friendship than you see in my little pony, I swear). Pretty neat.Some say these characters should have been centaurs. Pfff. Centaurs are the worst mythical creatures ever invented. Why? Because they have 2 backs, but can't lie on either. Must be worse than hell. The best choice was clearly to make them human-horse hybrids.The animation is great, everyone looks sexy and the sounds match the series like tail matches a pony. Just truly a stable production (heh pun v.2.0).This series obviously won't work when watched seriously. The best way to enjoy this is to take all the silliness in it with open pastures. Gallop to your closest Crunhyroll and give it ago because this type of greatness should be witnessed by all. sure to never go behind a horse girl or she might just kick you!Silence Suzuka on the other hand is perfectly sportic.

That\'s right. I\'m talking about those ones. Just the idea of thinking about it makes me want to puke. Those videos changed my perspective of horses in a heartbeat.I found this anime yesterday when one of my friend added it into his/her\'s PTW list. The thumbnail of the anime looked enticing so I decided to click on it and it brought me to the information page. I first thought that this show was...a show with fox girls. However, I was wrong. This show was a show with horse girls. Horse. Girls. That first word.. It makes me want to puke. The past experiences I\'ve had with horses in Pornhub and XVIDEOS.. They\'re terrible. They\'re terrible! But I decided to start this anime anyways because they looked like a fox.The story of Uma Musume is pretty simple. Horse girls racing. They win. They lose. Repeat. That\'s the plot of the story. We\'re simply just seeing cute horse girls racing each other. However, the simplicity is the gem of this show. It\'s not too edgy. There\'s nearly. Actually. No fan service at all. It\'s just pure entertainment and joy. This show is the ideal show for whoever\'s bored and doesn\'t really know which know they should watch.P.A. Works\' art and quality still stands tall and strong. Powering the enjoyment of the show to the utmost. Though I have a small hope that it could\'ve been better if they made the effects when running better. P.A. Works never fail with their art style and quality. Maintaining their status as one of the best anime producers out there. I approve!There\'s really nothing much for me to say about the sounds except from the fitting background musics that perfectly fits the scenarios. They\'re really good. I even cried. More than once. Not lying. Aside from the background musics. Everything else is pretty much already perfect and balanced so I have no negative comments.This also applies to the characters. They are likable and I especially like Silence Suzuka because she looks ""the most"" like a fox. Aside from my preference. The character developments are awesome and realistic. Losing is the key to success, and through hardwork, one becomes stronger. This anime also changed my perspective on horses. The memories of those terrible experiences had been completely cleansed by the pure kawaii horse girls of this anime. Ah, I have been enlightened.I really enjoyed this anime. It was relaxing to watch. Well. To a certain extent and it also calmed down my depressing emotions from a previous anime I\'ve watched in which gave me depression. I am all happy again thanks to this anime!Anime really is amazing. Anything can become possible so long as it\'s anime. Cliche! But that\'s the point, isn\'t it? Heh. Anyways. If you want to see something that is relaxing and intense at times and is guaranteed that it won\'t give you depression. If you want to see kawaii girls running. If you want a little motivation.

The anime deepen values such us the need to improve no matter the adversity and the friendship. It is great seeing they did not resort to the fanservice or the boring and the repetitive plot ideas of the average sports series. The simple story carries a diverse set of characters and exploits their various personalities. Furthermore, the idea of moving forward keep us the viewer entertain until the end of the series.The main story is about horse-girls and their struggle to be the best. They suffer, cry, smile, joke, they are...rivals, and are good friends. The story follows Special Week and her dream. In the beginning, we can feel her character a bit generic. As the story progresses, her role increases the complexity showing her emotions and fitting the story development. Special Week is the center of the story. However, the other horse girls aren’t left behind, and all the characters advance with the story and develop their personalities. For example, Silence Suzuka, her reasons for competing, and her values.  The story pacing is excellent. For a sports anime, they do not prolong the tracks in an annoying loop. The direction focuses on both aspects, the sport and the slice of life of this horse girls. It is pleasing how these girls keep fighting to improve and to be the best but in a very healthy way and not the annoying, pedant rivalry from other series.On the other hand, the horse-girls names came from real horses. Perhaps, some of the details in the story are from real events, but those do not spoil the plot. Furthermore, the story has comical events executed are a perfect time and are used to boost the interest in the characters. The anime tried to mix the horse-girl idea with the idols. I am not entirely sure if they succeeded, but the idea is not intrusive with the whole story and adds some dynamism at the end of each race.Another remarkable aspect from this series are the characters. For me, they are the most enjoyable part of the story. They do not need the fanservice or the idolizing theme to gather the viewer's attention. The plot helped the characters to evolve and to show their values, rivalry with some comical events each episode.Finally, I consider Uma Pretty Derby an acceptable series that could bring some entertainment that some viewers will find enjoyable and funny.

Just how abstract does this concept sound? As weird as it might seem, Uma Musume is an outstanding show that exceeded my expectations.Let's start with characters, which to me play the most important role in this case. All the horse girls are based on real race horses and their designs are all connected to their real life equivalents. I love the character designs - they are all so detailed and the connection to the actual horses makes them even more interesting. All girls are unique,...both physically and in terms of personality. And I love them all. With a cast this broad, it's amazing that all characters stand out in one way or another, and I think everyone watching this show will find a horse girl they'll love. Honestly though, at first it was hard for me to choose a favourite. But among all the lovely ladies, I think it's the elegant Suzuka that I love the most.It's also worth noting that the characters have the names of the actual horses, and these can be a bit quirky, yet - in my opinion - really cool.Now onto the races. They are also based on the races that actually took place, and their outcomes are also inspired by how it was in real life - now this is a unique kind of fanservice! My advice is to read a bit about the horses and their stories. You might spoil yourself a bit, but it makes watching this anime all the more interesting, since you know what is about to happen. And it increases the emotional impact. Not everything goes like it was in real world, though - and I'm especially happy about one thing that got changed. So happy that it made me burst into tears.The races are exciting and well done, I enjoyed watching them, and the fact that I actually care about the characters made watching them race even more enjoyable for me, since I was cheering for my favourites.Aside from racing, we see how the characters train, get stronger mentally and physically, develop friendships, face their fears and make their dreams come true. And as much as I get bored of regular slice of life, I enjoyed such kind of scenes in this anime. The comedy scenes are actually funny, there are some unique gags in Uma Musume which get repeated throughout the series but don't get old or unfunny. Uma Musume made me laugh many times. About as many times as it made me cry. I didn't expect a show about horse girl idols to make me this emotional, but Uma Musume did have an impact on me. It was funny, it was sad, and it was heartwarming.As I said before, our horse girls shine not only on the track, but on the stage as well! The songs are nice and catchy. And if you like them, I recommend checking more of the characters' songs, not only these that were included in the anime. Still my personal favourite is Silent Star, which we get to hear at the end of one of the episodes.Uma Musume both sounds and looks good. As I said, I love the detailed and diverse character designs, and the artstyle and animation are of good quality too.To wrap it up, Uma Musume turned out to be a great surprise for me and I enjoyed it in every aspect. I highly recommend it, no matter if it's the slice of life, the races, the horse girls or the comedy that you're looking for. I hope you will love my horse girls as well! both physically and in terms of personality. And I love them all.

I hope you will love my horse girls as well!"", ""I see no one has done a review, and I've never actually done one, but I wanted to take the opportunity to let you know what you're getting into if you are looking at the cover art and title and wondering...Horse Girls: Obviously, from the cover art and title.Fan Service: Not really. Through 4 episodes this show has taken the high road and chosen to avoid too many opportunities to pander to that demographic. So for those hoping to see Horse Girls in often compromising situations, I feel this show will disappoint you. Episode 1 is your one fleeting glimpse of anything approaching it.Idols:...Unfortunately, and it feels tacked on, as an afterthought. Fortunately they don't focus too much on it, but I wish they would have used the time they do devote to it to develop the characters or plot further instead. Without the Idol bit, I feel this show could have pushed into an 8 by seasons end.Comedy: I am enjoying how they are treating horse girls as a concept. It's made for some mildly humorous events between certain characters and situations. There is more comedy hidden in the antics of certain horse girls, but only those who recognize who they are (see below) will probably get it. They even managed to make the Idol portion of the show somewhat humorous. None of which I think will make you laugh in any audible sense, but you might smile or get a little warm feeling in that part of your brain that tells you something was funny in a cute way.Drama: Maaaaaybe we might see some later. See below. For now the show seems pretty laid back and campy.Sports: This seems to be the bread and butter of the show, so if you like sports anime you'll probably find plenty to like in this show. So far the races have been entertaining to me, and realizing their historical significance has increased my enjoyment of them and the plot as a whole. The girls seem to be friendly rivals, but there seems to be more of a competitive rivalry developing where the horse trainers are concerned.Speaking of historical significance, all the girls in the show are named after real horses. If you don't want to spoil yourself, then don't bother looking them up, but if you're like me (who isn't too bothered by spoilers) and wanted to know if they were real names and more about them, you might wind up getting more enjoyment out of the show by educating yourself about the horses and their racing heritage, and that enjoyment includes some of the antics some of the girls have displayed so far.So that's it in a nutshell. I've been enjoying the show. The girls are cute (cute character designs in general), the story is interesting to me. The art and sound seems good to me, but in fairness I'm not the kind of guy who runs around critiquing things that closely. So far this has been a pretty good Cute Girls style show that happens to be more of a sports anime...that happens to have Idols. I'm giving it a high 6, so we'll round it up to 7/10. Unfortunately, and it feels tacked on, as an afterthought. Fortunately they don't focus too much on it, but I wish they would have used the time they do devote to it to develop the characters or plot further instead. Without the Idol bit, I feel this show could have pushed into an 8 by seasons end.Comedy: I am enjoying how they are treating horse girls as a concept. It's made for some mildly humorous events between certain characters and situations. There is more comedy hidden in the antics of certain horse girls, but only those who recognize who they are (see below) will probably get it. They even managed to make the Idol portion of the show somewhat humorous. None of which I think will make you laugh in any audible sense, but you might smile or get a little warm feeling in that part of your brain that tells you something was funny in a cute way.Drama: Maaaaaybe we might see some later. See below. For now the show seems pretty laid back and campy.Sports: This seems to be the bread and butter of the show, so if you like sports anime you'll probably find plenty to like in this show. So far the races have been entertaining to me, and realizing their historical significance has increased my enjoyment of them and the plot as a whole. The girls seem to be friendly rivals, but there seems to be more of a competitive rivalry developing where the horse trainers are concerned.Speaking of historical significance, all the girls in the show are named after real horses. If you don't want to spoil yourself, then don't bother looking them up, but if you're like me (who isn't too bothered by spoilers) and wanted to know if they were real names and more about them, you might wind up getting more enjoyment out of the show by educating yourself about the horses and their racing heritage, and that enjoyment includes some of the antics some of the girls have displayed so far.So that's it in a nutshell.

I wanted to enjoy this, very desperately you could even say.It is, to my understanding, that this was merely an advertisement for the game based on the same name. There is horse racing, and there is idols. From a Japanese market perspective, this makes sense considering idols are a popular genre. The combination of the two ideas seems creative enough to make a decent and successful show. Rather than horse racing and idol dancing/singing being on the same level, the idol aspect is secondary to the story....Although, in the second half of the show, it is entirely irrelevant. This makes it come off as a cheap tactic to get more money, and it most likely is. This would not be such a huge issue if the racing element of it wasn\'t so mediocre.The entire plot revolves around racer girls getting random power ups for no explainable reason in order to ""overcome"" their obstacles and achieve their dreams. Not only is that unrealistic in the manner it was shown, but it is blatantly lazy writing. There was one episode where the show seemed to incorporate some actual strategy, such as when Special Week learned to change her running technique in order to get up a hill and defeat an opponent. This is the moment where the show\'s potential could have thrived and portrayed our main heroine as a crafty, adaptable, and relentless person. Then it completely disregards that and never uses it again. Additionally, there was a long running comedy shtick of Spe eating white rice - if I recall the food correctly - yet no one seemed to stop her or inform her it would only make her fat? There could have been an entire episode dedicated to the struggle of formulating and maintaining a proper athlete diet, showing us exactly how hard it is to be in top shape and something we could all relate to. But the potential for a well-thought-out approach to an intensive sport was squandered yet again. My frustration only continues from here.We are introduced to Special Week as our main horse girl. However, my problem with her is that she is too plain. Too boring. She even looks boring, taking on the appearance of a side character as her fellow peers have more flashy appearances. This isn\'t so much a critique, but it\'s merely an observation I noticed. I can easily see how her backstory ties in nicely to her look, but my preference would have been something more distinctive. My hope at the start of the anime was that they would build on her character eventually, which they did to a certain degree with her outsider backstory and all. The girl from the countryside narrative sure did a decent job at making it seem like she would come out of no where and flip the entire racing industry on its head, changing it forever. Soon after, it quickly falls apart as she is seemingly unimportant, loses a lot, and whose entire growth only comes from a friendly rivalry with a cliche promise. Don\'t even get me started on the side characters. They were equally as boring and unimportant aside from maybe two or three. They all literally say the most cliche things. Honestly, who wrote this script? And who keeps writing in that comedy routine of two side characters constantly fighting each other because they\'re ""close"" or whatever? That was done to death, especially by the last episode. It\'s a common writing tactic, which is used to compensate for weak character writing, to portray them as ""likable"" and ""relatable,"" but it did the opposite effect and only made me hate those two more. This is further proven to be the case considering I don\'t even remember their names, which I couldn\'t care less at this point, in such an overwhelmingly huge cast. The continuous addition of supporting roles dilutes their overall impact in an already scarcely fleshed out tale.While most of these girls had underwhelming personalities, you would think the art and animation would be the strongest part to the show. Well, we were wrong. The art style is painfully generic and emulates a wannabe A1-Pictures idol show but can\'t seem to get there just yet. This is PA Works we are talking about. We know exactly what PA Works is capable of when it comes to its world building and creation of beautiful backgrounds. My immediate first impression of the show was, ""This is not PA Works."" And rightfully so, because this leaves a stain on their track record. ""But maluhia, you can\'t go comparing other shows to this one."" Well, I can, I did, and I have a good reason for this. PA Works is a very niche studio in the anime industry, just as much as Kyoto Animation is. If Kyoto Animation\'s quality dropped drastically, everyone would be quick to point out the differences. This is the case as well, and it should be a valid critique in the face of mediocrity. You are called Progressive Animation Works for a reason, so why do you bring irony to your name with subpar work? To make matters worse, much of the running scenes in Pretty Derby include recycled backdrops with the bottom portion of their bodies often being cut out altogether. For a running-sport anime, it\'s kind of hard to be that without the actual dynamics of running. The dullness of it all only intensifies when the ""climax"" episodes look like any other predictable race it had previously shown us. There was nothing satisfying about it, yet it tricks you into thinking investing time into it would pay off by the end. To pour salt on the wound, the last race has every other girl being able to keep up with Silence Suzuka, which contradicts Suzuka\'s entire buildup of character and every event before as if it never happened. Not only was the conclusion pulled out of thin air, but it insults your intelligence.To wrap it up, the music component was just ""okay."" If I\'m being honest, there\'s not much to say, and you couldn\'t really argue otherwise considering the idol portion of the show was unimportant to the story as a whole. The ED did include a small scene of Special Week coming first place in a race, beating out her rival whom came in second, and the rest of their team took the remaining positions. It is possible that this was the end result of the finale race as it was heavily implied by their coach over and over. I guess you would have to play the game if you\'re interested in more? Not that I would. As for the trainer\'s romance, it unexpectedly appeared then ceased to exist, much like my hopes for PA Work\'s latest effort. To summarize Uma Musume: Pretty Derby (TV) in one word, it would be lazy.Final rating: 2/10. Although, in the second half of the show, it is entirely irrelevant.

Once i found it on VRV i remembered that i wanted to watch this so i gave it a watch and holy crap i freaking love this anime. Everything about it is very lovably.First the Story. The story follows Special Week, a horse girl wanting to be the best horse girl racer in Japan. Along the way she meets other horse girls like Silence Suzuki who Special Week looks up to and following Team Spica as they all race towards there goals. The story was very nice and easy to...follow. It also motivates you to want to do something like them. Weather that be running or just working on something you really want to.Next the art. The art style of this anime is very unique and colorful. This anime could of had blan colors, but it chose colors that would pop to the viewer and want to keep an eye on because with most anime today having the same art style it is very nice to see this anime not follow the norm and create visually stunning scenes for the entire anime.Next the sound. The sound was spot on with every movement either the characters made or what the area around them does. What i really liked was when any of the girls were running or multiply were running at a time it made it sound like an actually horse was running, but then remembering it was horse girl running made it even more enjoyable because they paid attention to details and made sure everything was correct.Next the characters. The characters for any anime are the make or break for a series. For this anime every single characters was lovably and enjoyable to watch. Even the background characters had some personality to them which i dont see in anime that much. For this show to give a personality to all the characters you see on screen is a warm welcome for me.Finally the enjoyment of the anime. I loved this anime all the way from the beginning to the end. This is one of those shows where you say i want a second season so badly. I laughed when scenes were actually funny, i was worried and excited for the characters during there races, the encouragement each of the characters give each other is very sweet and makes me feel like one of them sometimes. Overall the enjoyment for this anime is through the roof. I will say that this anime is suppose to be taken in a fun way. You want to have fun with it and go in trying to find something sad.Overall this is one of the best anime i have watched in some time. If this got a second season i would be all over it just because of how much i enjoyed it. Hopefully i get to see more of them because it was so much fun watching this and always having a smile to my face. follow. It also motivates you to want to do something like them.

YEAAAAAAAH ... this is what we have.This wonder became one of the most exciting animes of the April 2018 season, when I watched it, due to its very well run races having all the excitement of the audience and remarkable moments that surprise. With each race we are in expectation of what could happen, if there would be an accident or who would win, nothing in them is predictable. Despite the rivalries between the teams the girls are super friends and together they are motivated in order to continue their careers. When I saw that P.A.Works was going...to adapt the anime, I was excited. The character design is captivating and the color palette quite excellent. The dynamics of the storyline are consistent thanks to the races. The anime is clearly aimed at those who want to watch a more traveled and comedic storyline with lots of waifus for all sides! at the time I was anxious because there were rumors that the game would finally come to life. But that would only happen after a few episodes of Season 2, in 2021 ... and that will be for the Reviewn of Season 2. Well ... finally, I highly recommend this wonder. You can watch without mercy hahahahahaha. to adapt the anime, I was excited. The character design is captivating and the color palette quite excellent.

Knowing that, one could think of this anime as a longer advertisement for the game and not expect much. That's what I thought at first, but it turned out to be a really enjoyable show.In japanese animation, there are lots of combinations of female characters with animal traits. Wolf girls, monster girls and probably most popular cat girls. Uma Musume Pretty Derby is a show about horse girls. But not just random girls with horse ears and tails. They are named after real-life famous...race horses. The story is also based on actual races. After watching Uma Musume, you may not only be interested in playing the mobile game from Cygames, but also want to know more about horse racing.Big part of the Uma Musume project is that the characters are also performing on stage like idols. Some people may think that it's trying to appeal to broader audience, but personally I think it's really interesting combination and works rather well in a world of horse girls, where they are already racing idols.Story 9/10It could be an advertisement, boring race sequences and the same introductions repeated for different girls in every episode. Instead, what we got is a great show about joy and sorrow, friendship and rivalry, defeat and victory.Art 9/10Animation is just great. Races are dynamic and detailed character design really sets apart different girls. There are a few moments of 3D animation but the models and movements are really similar to 2D, which is nice.Sound 9/10We can hear only a couple of original songs from the game. In the future Cygames will probably release more. Sound effects during racing sequences work nicely and sound similar to actual horses running.Character 9/10Every horse girl has unique traits. They have their own uniquely designed outfit for races. During the 13 episodes we can also witness development for main characters.Enjoyment 9/10Some cliches are inevitable, horse girls may not sound promising to everyone, but I highly recommend watching Uma Musume Pretty Derby if you are looking for something light to watch.

Uma Musume is an anime derived from a mobile game about Horse Girls racing. If you happen to beat your opponents, you get to set up and start fulfilling your dream of becoming an idol.If someone were to tell me that premise, half of me would think that it would sell extremely well and the other half would believe that person is out of their mind. Yet, this anime works so well.The foundation of this anime is in its great storytelling about...a girl by the name of Special Week going from, essentially, inferiority to idealism. The story is by no means original, but that doesn't matter when it is executed as well as it is. There is plenty of foreshadowed plot points that are complemented by quick resolutions, which keeps the pacing of this series upbeat. The storytelling of this anime is very textbook, and I think its through that rigidity that viewers get offered a substantive story, instead of an anime studio taking the low-ground with CGDCT fluff.The art design and sound of Uma Musume doesn't really give much to be desired. The biggest problem that I can see people having is that the CGI racing girls don't really blend well into the colored backgrounds. Having that drastic switch between digital art into CGI is not really a harsh criticism, but it can be a little jarring to see clean digitial art movement that gets quickly shifted into CGI. I think that could have been cleaned up a bit more.However, I don't think anyone can talk about this series without talking about how cute the girls are and how their outfits are fantastic to look at. I sincerely hope the costume designers had fun creating those outfits. The racing outfits were all the same, but when it came to individual stuff, I think it was really good looking.Uma Musume is one of those once in a few years anime that was made to break expectations. It is by no means the best anime of its season. However, to call it less than a top 10 anime for that year, I think would be a great disservice to how well executed it was.

On the Character category, so ok them horse girl were name after famous real life racehorses in Japan, but let's not focus on that, rather let's focus on them horse girls' relationship were  we can't deny that there was this shoujo-ai involve but was hidden in some way like the relationship of Special Week and Silence Suzuka in a form that SpeChan want to race her, Gold Ship and Mejor McQueen in a form of GolShi's Bullying on McQueen that often backfires  Scarlet Daiwa and Tokai Teo whose relationship can be compared to that of two bitches duking out and liking it as well well, either way it was funny and touching as well especially when we talk about the background on them as real horse in real life were it pretty much match up if you'll look on the details of those real horses  . Now on the Art category of this anime there was the usual knee high socks and every horse girls were sporting it, so cosplayer will have something to go for it but when it comes to them horse girls racing attire, I sure them cosplayers would have a lot to choose from .

The premise sounds really weird but I encourage you not to be put off by the fact that they are horses, especially when characters like cat girls are common place now in a lot of modern anime.Story:The plot is simple, it follows a bubbly young protagonist called Special Week on her quest to become the best horse girl she can be. Its pretty straight forward but there's some twists thrown in there to keep you watching.History:Believe it or not Special Week is actual a real horse and the show does a great job...at recreating their races into a sports anime. If you are fan of the real life races, you will surely be appreciated of the level of detail they put into making the environments match real life. To further this point, even background characters have unique designs based off their real life horses and they also follow the story lines of their real life counterparts.

I also loved her relationship with the other lead Suzuka, the interactions between them were so nice to watch and they had lots of chemistry together.My only complaint would be that since it's based off a gacha game, a lot of characters are introduced at once and it can be a bit of an overload at the start.SoundI love the music in this show.

One of the most fun shows I've ever seen. Period. There's a lot of reasons as to why this show is just so fantastic and I have noted down most of them in this review of a show that defied all odds, all expectations and gave us one hell of an epic anime.First off,...one thing the show was excellent in doing was the way it accurately portrayed the original history behind the horse girls. To those of you who are unfamiliar, the names of the horses aren't made up, these are real life Japanese horses who raced in the '90s and have been anime-ified as being horse girls while maintaining a 95% historical accuracy rate. Why 95%? It's because one of the horses had a dark backstory which was toned down in the anime, although you'll see it, it won't be as dark as the harsh reality was which is pretty much understandable because Uma Musume isn't such a show in the first place. Nevertheless, apart from that, from start to finish, Uma Musume maintained a healthy accuracy rate (in fact, it's 100% in terms of who won and lost the race) throughout its entire run. Pun intended.Despite its accuracy, most of the people who watched the show may obviously not have knowledge of the original Japanese horses and their races, so this helps to bring suspense to the table, but this is not all. Uma Musume knows a lot of things, and it knows damn well how to control the element of surprise as well as the suspense it brings with it. What am I talking about? You can never predict who'll win in the race, not even when the race is going on. You might think this is easy but if you look at most sports anime they don't have as much suspense or any suspense at all because they always show the main characters as Shounen as possible who will work hard and defeat the opponents no matter how difficult they are to beat.What Uma Musume makes us realise (that most other sports anime don't) is that hard work and teamwork alone won't give you the win you think you deserved. It shows us the harsh life lesson that hard work doesn't always get rewarded and you won't always win, and this is shown by making the protagonists lose at times. “Is that all? There are a few anime that show the team of character lose” you might say. As with most things in life, losing isn't the end of the story. It's what comes after that. The lessons you learn from it, Uma Musume knows and shows just that, such as by characters coping with their loss, starting to work even harder, not be too overconfident and take proper measures and be grounded. Beware, if you expect this anime to be all wins and celebrations 24/7 you're in for a surprise. This seemingly kiddish show (I really feel sorry for those who think that) has a lot of lessons to teach, like friendship. In particular we got to see the friendship of Special Week and Silence Suzuka build up. At first Suzuka was admired by the rookie Special Week but after becoming roommates it all changed. For the better. Making new friends, interacting with your friends, having fun, this is all the joy of friendship and we saw all of this excellently shown by Progressive Animation Works (or P.A works to you acronym fans).On the other side of the spectrum friendship also brings with itself, rivalry. And this was also evident although not as much. We saw Special Week and Silence Suzuka cheer each other on along with challenge each other from time to time. This is very important to show since most friendships have these (to those of you without friends, please find some and discover the joy of friendship and rivalry) and this ends up as yet another plus point for the show, rivalry isn't always hating each other, it can also mean friends battling each other for who comes out on top and having a nice laugh about it later. That's friendship. That's rivalry. No. That's friendly rivalry. Or wait. That is the true spirit of friendship itself isn't it? Apart from having someone to challenge we also have the hardships. What happened to one of the two was horrifying and though it wasn't as dark as the reality was it still left a crushing impact on most of the viewers and many were devastated (or at least the characters in the anime were). That's where the hardship struck. The friend rushed in tears to save her best friend and neither could function properly since they were so worried about each other. This is what hardships in friendship can be sometimes. And we should support our nakama and try our hardest to overcome the obstacles that lie ahead.Coming back to the previous point of suspense, we got suspense because we saw our favourite characters lose. When we see someone not maintain a 100% win rate, we start to get tense when we see their next race because there's a possibility that they might lose, and this is evident in every real life sport (and a few anime). No team will lose forever, no one will win forever, both will happen to everyone albeit in different ratios. And another important thing is that victory isn't always achieved with working alone, or to be more accurate, it mostly doesn't work. Victory is gained through teamwork, and no, not the Shounen type. Teamwork is helping your friends do better, share your ideas, cheer each other on, encourage friendly rivalries. These are all what makes us achieve victory, and although we can't always win we still learn important lessons and realise that we had fun working with our friends. And this spirit is what people should follow.Uma Musume didn't show us everyone working alone, despite being an anime about racing, a primarily single-person sport, it showed us how all the girls helped each other gain the edge and have fun racing. This is what Special Week embodies, this is what sports should embody. Sports is fun and when it stops being fun, you quickly drop out and this is what was evident with Silence Suzuka. She couldn't find racing fun and Special Week taught how to have fun while racing.On the topic of racing we cover the artstyle as well. P.A Works knocked the ball out of the park with this one (been a long time since I made a sports pun). The bright colourful palette cheered me up and the animation during the races was much like the rest of the plot, serious yet cheerful. Uma Musume might show it's characters being playful and lazy at times as with every sports person outside the field but when you step into the field finally, it's a battle. And P.A Works knew it, which is why the races themselves are taken very seriously. You don't see hilarious stuff happening while the race is going on. You see the characters fixated on that finish line and have to keep moving forward, which is pretty reminiscent of P.A Works’ name itself, to move forward. Think of it like a two sided dish. One has the playful nature of friends meeting each other and messing about and the second, which has everyone become serious because of the situation and obstacles ahead. If it wasn't obvious, the artstyle even while they're racing takes a serious yet excellently designed turn.And speaking of the races themselves, I've never enjoyed watching a race where people run. Car races and the like are fun but P.A Works made running enjoyable, which is also a huge plus point to the show. Despite it's unique aspect and nature of the show (horse girls based on real horses racing), Uma Musume does a fine job of making it's premise easy to understand, heck it's TOO easy to understand. Just run as fast as you can while making sure you don't waste stamina. Train too hard and you lose, train too less and you're unprepared. Finding the balance is what's necessary. And this concept may feel simple because it is simple, it's surprising how many anime haven't done this as easily. To cover another good point and to make another pun about the anime’s plus points, we have the pacing (:P). Surprisingly, it's not fast paced. The pacing is done such that it's easy to understand what's happening without having to go back and on the other hand it doesn't drag on. We saw a race in most episodes and it was a breeze to smooth over them without issues.A large cast left me concerned since I thought not everyone would get development and unfortunately this was what I found as a problem in the anime. The show was too focused on Special Week and Silence Suzuka to focus on even the other Spica horses, let alone Rigil. I felt we could have seen much more if this show was a 24 episode series since that could mean we'd see development for them as well. Another problem I felt was that at times Uma Musume felt repetitive. This was in the earlier stages of the anime, namely it's first 4 episodes before it went with one proper varied formula and stuck to it. As a final point, yet another positive one, the show had a fantastic soundtrack. Apart from the catchy OP and ED, the BGM (or background music to those who don't know) hyped me up and oh the music that played when the races were on, especially the way the tone of the music went even higher in the last corner of the race. It left chills on my spine. Never been so hyped for such a show before.So overall, Uma Musume is a show that started off a bit slow, but it later (after the third episode in fact) steps up and excellently continues it's run to the finish. It teaches us lessons about friendship, hardship, rivalry, loss, teamwork and whatnot, and still manages to hype over it's viewers with it's brilliantly done racing segments and soundtrack. If a bright cheery anime with important life lessons is your type of anime to watch, then Uma Musume will be sure to leave you satisfied and wanting for more. Although the anime was mainly for marketing and engaging interest for the Uma Musume mobile game, the Anime’s quality itself far surpasses what people would expect, all thanks to P.A Works.The Spring season had a lot of interesting anime but only two came out on top for me. Hinamatsuri and Uma Musume. If this review gauged your interest in trying out the anime, please do so, for you are in for one heck of an awesome show at the Starting Gate!P.S: Without spoilers, that last episode has got to be one of the most legendary ones I've ever seen. Why? It's one hell of a FANTASTIC send-off to a lovable series. It embodied everything that made the show great from it's previous episodes. The final race and the end credits made it feel like I was watching a big budget anime movie, and that's exactly how the artstyle was, but it was EVEN MORE EPIC in the last episode. Uma Musume is definitely a show I'll miss a lot. one thing the show was excellent in doing was the way it accurately portrayed the original history behind the horse girls. To those of you who are unfamiliar, the names of the horses aren't made up, these are real life Japanese horses who raced in the '90s and have been anime-ified as being horse girls while maintaining a 95% historical accuracy rate.

I never expected for an anime about a group of cute girls who sing and dance and do sports to be this good?? Not to mention it's just a promotional anime for a mobile game.First of all, it's such a bizarre concept but it just works. They go all the way with its weirdness and embrace it. The amount of references and easter eggs related to real life racehorses is incredible and just shows how much dedicated and truly passionate the team behind this project is.The...animation is vibrant and fun, each character manages to have a unique and interesting design, and that's incredible considering there are like 60 horse girl characters in total.Another aspect I like about it is that it isn't a fanservice anime at all, like what I first thought it would be. It's very lighthearted, and at its very core it's just a well portrayed sport anime with themes of friendship and accomplishing goals. I was worried about the whole idol part but it doesn't feel annoying at all, it's barely used in the anime and I believe the whole reason it's tacked on to begin with is just because it's gonna be a part of the game. If you're expecting Love Live but with horse girls then you're gonna be disappointed.Anyway,the experience of watching this is just pure joy and I loved every second animation is vibrant and fun, each character manages to have a unique and interesting design, and that's incredible considering there are like 60 horse girl characters in total.Another aspect I like about it is that it isn't a fanservice anime at all, like what I first thought it would be.

The outcomes were pretty predictable and I never felt the stakes. The idol aspect of winning the races feels like a weird afterthought in...nearly every case. nearly every case."", ""Progressive Animation Works.\xa0 P.A. Works.\xa0 Over the years I've come to anticipate and fear the kinds of projects they bring to light, seeing both the potential and missed potential of their primarily original works.\xa0 So, what's their follow-up to Sakura Quest?\xa0 A series that for all intents and purposes was a return to form for the company's standard style of storytelling?\xa0 Why it's a mobile game adaptation of course!\xa0 I'll be honest, was not expecting that one.Story:Uma Musume: Pretty Derby takes place in a world where special girls are birthed as horse girls, girls who are capable of running at incredible speeds and largely participate...in the sport of 'horse girl racing' and go to specialized schools for the sport.\xa0 Here, we follow the story of 'Special Week', a horse girl from the sticks who dreams of becoming the number one horse girl in Japan, and her fellow members of Team Spica as they train, race, and run their way to victory.A typical road to success story, Uma Musume is primarily a box standard example of the story trope, detailing primarily its main protagonist and her journey alongside the rivals and friends that she makes along the way.\xa0 The story isn't really much to write home about as you could probably discern what goes on from episode to episode in terms of results to chronicle the character's journey, but does do its job well enough to create a plot that being based on a mobile game of all things, is actually commendable.But despite that, there are a few issues that bog down an otherwise decently-crafted road to success story.\xa0 The first and main of which is pacing.\xa0 Uma Musume has HORRENDOUS pacing, to the point that each successive episode feels less and less impactful because every episode has various horse girls do race after race after race after race after race.\xa0 There's little to no emotional investment put into each race as typical sports tournament arcs have, as regardless if Special Week or any other relevant character loses or wins the last one, very little (or usually hardly enough) time is spent on the fallout of each race before we're thrown into the next one.\xa0 With an average of two races per episode, it's easy to see how this becomes an overwhelming problem.\xa0 Time issues doesn't stop there, as the show consistently uses jumpskips or some variant of time fast forwarding in order to get to the next race or plot point, making it so that nothing really sinks in, which is primarily where emotional attachment for characters forms.Another problem is the content.\xa0 The show focuses on three aspects: cute high school girls (who are also horses, so we also get the kemonomimi crowd), idols, and horse racing.\xa0 While the show gives us heaps of racing and a fair chunk of the high school stuff (even though all they do is basically gym), anything idol related is almost none in the grand scheme of the show despite being one of the core aspects of the mobile game that make up the series' identity, as it acts as each race's ' post-game show' with the top three girls in a race singing a song.All in all, Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is a show that despite focusing on Special Week's journey to become the best horse girl in Japan, is bogged down by rushed pacing that devalues each race and character moment in the show that muddles the show's attempts at an honest, cohesive story, which is honestly a shame considering at first glance I had almost no hope for this show when I first saw that P.A. Works was responsible for it.Overview:+ Half-decent main narrative- Horrible pacing- Pacing brings down the story's quality as a whole- Idol aspect feels underwhelmingCharacters:Being characters from a mobile game, specifically a gacha 'waifu collection' game, much of the cast of Uma Musume focuses on quantity over quality, ultimately creating a largely one-dimensional cast where each girl fulfills a 'niche' without stepping over their own character boundaries.But of course, we still have a protagonist, and that protagonist is 'Special Week', or 'Spe' by everyone else in the series.\xa0 Named after an actual racing horse of the same name, Spe doesn't really have any defining traits about her aside from being the cheerful dreamer that's kinda ditzy and cute for the majority of her screentime.\xa0 She is ultimately defined by her desire to fulfill her dream, but finding anything beyond that single characteristic is difficult since the show mostly shows racing or training montages for races, so time devoted to explore more of her personality are basically zero to none.Then there's Silence Suzuka, a girl who is also named after a real racing horse, who serves the part as Spe's role model and best friend to give the series a 'close rivalry' to fuel Spe's desire to do better.\xa0 Largely a more kuudere and relaxed version of Spe, Suzuka largely plays the same role as her protagonist counterpart, with the only difference being her demeanor towards the world around her, having more reserved character traits be the defining way she reacts and responds to everything around her.\xa0 She does get her own episodes to help explore her character, but those parts as with the nature of a show with massive rushing don't get enough time to fully sink in the necessary impact.The rest of the cast features at least two dozen separate horse girls, each about as important and difficult to remember as the last since the show just loves throwing every possible combination of waifu bait at the audience in hopes that one of the more than eighteen 'main' girls in the series gets your attention.\xa0 They're all also named after real racing horses, so there is an explanation for their weird names.\xa0 But that doesn't mean that the show will introduce them at an even pace, as more than likely, half of the existing horse girl cast will be thrown in randomly in one scene, leading one to ask 'Who?' when a new girl with a convenient name-tag on the side of the screen shows up.\xa0 Aside from them, the actual human characters don't have much to them, and more than likely represent the 'player' character in the mobile game, since Team Spica's trainer for one doesn't actually have a name, and is referred to as 'Trainer' by the girls for the entirety of the series.Overview:+ Waifu bait (Because I know someone will)- One note castArt:Produced by P.A. Works, Uma Musume sits squarely in the middle for the company's usual track record of animation quality, which I find very strange considering how a mobile game adaptation has better art than some of the company's better works.\xa0 Regardless, the art for Uma Musume is very much the typical P.A. Works's 'marble' design, having a nice glossy and rich color palette that is honestly way better than what I expected for the series.But really where the art for the show truly shines is in its races, for multiple reasons, both good and bad.\xa0 For starters, this is pretty much where all the animation budget is funneled into.\xa0 Each race, and there are many, uses a lot of repeated frames that when put together into one racing scene actually visually makes them appealing to watch, when up close.\xa0 From far away, it's very easy to see that the show utilizes CGI in order to cut costs for far away models.\xa0 It makes sense from a production standpoint, but it's so obvious from the angles they use them in that it bothers me personally as a viewer.Overview:+ Above standard art quality- Use of CGI is not very well hidden and quite obviousSound:Now given how this show is also considered as an idol show, both the OP and ED are sung by the seiyuus for the members of Team Spica, resulting in a pair of idol-based tracks that to me sound too generic for me to really bother analyzing them.\xa0 Sure they're alright, but nothing too standout as far as I'm aware.Personal Enjoyment:The never-ending journey to watch every P.A. Works show that releases is a weird one to say the least.\xa0 I've been pulled from watching two idiots lusting after their music teacher while solving convoluted mysteries, to a melodrama involving people from the sea, to a mech show between aliens and people from feudal Japan.\xa0 So really, I guess it was only a matter of time before they did a waifu racing series featuring horse girls named after and having the records of actual race horses from Japan.The show is definitely not my favorite project from the company, but it is far from the worst.\xa0 It's a harmless show that despite having a major flaw that ultimately drags everything else with it, has a consistency about it that makes it at least enjoyable to watch.\xa0 It's definitely not for those who aren't fans of horses, racing, sports, moe, or idols, but does serve something for those niches and does it well enough to elicit some form of enjoyment.For me though, I found the show to be average, but harmless.\xa0 If nothing else, it's another step towards my never-ending crusade to watch every P.A. Works show ever made, and definitely not one of the more offensive ones towards my viewing experience.\xa0 So really, it could be worse, and that by itself is a compliment considering Glasslip's existence and infamy. in the sport of 'horse girl racing' and go to specialized schools for the sport.\xa0 Here, we follow the story of 'Special Week', a horse girl from the sticks who dreams of becoming the number one horse girl in Japan, and her fellow members of Team Spica as they train, race, and run their way to victory.A typical road to success story, Uma Musume is primarily a box standard example of the story trope, detailing primarily its main protagonist and her journey alongside the rivals and friends that she makes along the way.\xa0 The story isn't really much to write home about as you could probably discern what goes on from episode to episode in terms of results to chronicle the character's journey, but does do its job well enough to create a plot that being based on a mobile game of all things, is actually commendable.But despite that, there are a few issues that bog down an otherwise decently-crafted road to success story.\xa0 The first and main of which is pacing.\xa0 Uma Musume has HORRENDOUS pacing, to the point that each successive episode feels less and less impactful because every episode has various horse girls do race after race after race after race after race.\xa0 There's little to no emotional investment put into each race as typical sports tournament arcs have, as regardless if Special Week or any other relevant character loses or wins the last one, very little (or usually hardly enough) time is spent on the fallout of each race before we're thrown into the next one.\xa0 With an average of two races per episode, it's easy to see how this becomes an overwhelming problem.\xa0 Time issues doesn't stop there, as the show consistently uses jumpskips or some variant of time fast forwarding in order to get to the next race or plot point, making it so that nothing really sinks in, which is primarily where emotional attachment for characters forms.Another problem is the content.\xa0 The show focuses on three aspects: cute high school girls (who are also horses, so we also get the kemonomimi crowd), idols, and horse racing.\xa0 While the show gives us heaps of racing and a fair chunk of the high school stuff (even though all they do is basically gym), anything idol related is almost none in the grand scheme of the show despite being one of the core aspects of the mobile game that make up the series' identity, as it acts as each race's ' post-game show' with the top three girls in a race singing a song.All in all, Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is a show that despite focusing on Special Week's journey to become the best horse girl in Japan, is bogged down by rushed pacing that devalues each race and character moment in the show that muddles the show's attempts at an honest, cohesive story, which is honestly a shame considering at first glance I had almost no hope for this show when I first saw that P.A. Works was responsible for it.Overview:+ Half-decent main narrative- Horrible pacing- Pacing brings down the story's quality as a whole- Idol aspect feels underwhelmingCharacters:Being characters from a mobile game, specifically a gacha 'waifu collection' game, much of the cast of Uma Musume focuses on quantity over quality, ultimately creating a largely one-dimensional cast where each girl fulfills a 'niche' without stepping over their own character boundaries.But of course, we still have a protagonist, and that protagonist is 'Special Week', or 'Spe' by everyone else in the series.\xa0 Named after an actual racing horse of the same name, Spe doesn't really have any defining traits about her aside from being the cheerful dreamer that's kinda ditzy and cute for the majority of her screentime.\xa0 She is ultimately defined by her desire to fulfill her dream, but finding anything beyond that single characteristic is difficult since the show mostly shows racing or training montages for races, so time devoted to explore more of her personality are basically zero to none.Then there's Silence Suzuka, a girl who is also named after a real racing horse, who serves the part as Spe's role model and best friend to give the series a 'close rivalry' to fuel Spe's desire to do better.\xa0 Largely a more kuudere and relaxed version of Spe, Suzuka largely plays the same role as her protagonist counterpart, with the only difference being her demeanor towards the world around her, having more reserved character traits be the defining way she reacts and responds to everything around her.\xa0 She does get her own episodes to help explore her character, but those parts as with the nature of a show with massive rushing don't get enough time to fully sink in the necessary impact.The rest of the cast features at least two dozen separate horse girls, each about as important and difficult to remember as the last since the show just loves throwing every possible combination of waifu bait at the audience in hopes that one of the more than eighteen 'main' girls in the series gets your attention.\xa0 They're all also named after real racing horses, so there is an explanation for their weird names.\xa0 But that doesn't mean that the show will introduce them at an even pace, as more than likely, half of the existing horse girl cast will be thrown in randomly in one scene, leading one to ask 'Who?' when a new girl with a convenient name-tag on the side of the screen shows up.\xa0 Aside from them, the actual human characters don't have much to them, and more than likely represent the 'player' character in the mobile game, since Team Spica's trainer for one doesn't actually have a name, and is referred to as 'Trainer' by the girls for the entirety of the series.Overview:+ Waifu bait (Because I know someone will)- One note castArt:Produced by P.A.

At first glance at Uma Musume, I don\'t really think it\'ll appeal that much, I was like ""It\'s all about just competitions right? Will this be another cliche one?"", Fortunately I was wrong, the first episode did a great job introducing new characters and it\'s goal. You might think that this competition anime will just be a cliche but you\'re quite wrong, Uma Musume is trying it\'s best to be as unique as it can, If you want racing and girls all around your screen with proper plot,...I recommend Uma Musume. I recommend Uma Musume.', ""I would like to start by saying while I gave this a 7, I did not enjoy the series. But the quality and polish is without question.The story: plot is that a horse-girl, Spe-Chan, wants to be the best horse girl of Japan. The setting is completely wonky with the idea of horse-girls. Are there horse-boys? We don't know. Do horse-girls have professions that arent racing? Not that we see. Why do horse-girls do idol performances after a race? To say thank you to the fans. We don't know a lot but horse girls are the most popular thing of Japan in this world. Why...did I rate this a 7? Because they fucking based the plot off of IRL race horses and races. And they did their homework for this show. They took the actual stories of race horses and put them into girls bodies and made an anime off of it. Even more, this is based off a gotcha mobile game.S1 follows Special Week and Silence Suzuka. I think they characters relationship is unhealthy and awkward. I think nothing makes sense in this setting, but the characters frustration is really well written.The art is a stupid well polished aspect of the show. Who the hell puts so much effort in facial expression, backgrounds, dirt flying, ect for a freaking gotcha game anime about horse-girls no less? Apparently those who worked on Uma Musume. While I don't think the art is groundbreaking, it is consistent, well done, outfit designs are unique, and the animation is of superior quality. Even if you hate this anime, there is little to criticize.Similar to the Art, the sound also cut no corners. While the music isn't my style, every character can sing (season 2 literally has a song with over 32 characters singing). The music is up-beat and catchy. The sound editing and sound effects are also on point. It really does have a very high quality.Characters: Well, the characters are based on actual horses. And once again, the studio did their homework on the personalities of the horses. I don't love the characters, except for Goldship. Goldship is best horse-girl. But we have a rather large cast of characters that while not fully flushed out, do have the potential. Considering the season is only 13 episodes, we get a lot. Some of you will love every character. I did not like most of them, but I can't help but give credit where it's due.My enjoyment was rather meh. I watched this because a friend of mine loves it. I did not love it. I didn't even like it. I couldn't get over the hurdle of horse-girls are idol athletes who everyone loves and they may or may not be the equivalent of Rome's gladiators, loved by fans, but also have no other option but to fight. I like sports anime, but this was not what I wanted.Overall, I think the quality speaks for itself. If you don't enjoy this, it's certainly not an issue of the quality. I can't say this anime is for everyone, but there is something to be admired for the show. did I rate this a 7? Because they fucking based the plot off of IRL race horses and races.

That is, I didn't have any context for the show other than that these girls were anthropomorphized horses.Well, any promise of the show basically died after episodes 1 and 2. I figured out pretty early on that this show was probably an anime original for how many characters there are. Lo and behold, the show was a game adaptation. No wonder. There's just no way you can create a cohesive show with 10+ characters. It's...impossible. Even after episode 3 or so, there just aren't any characters that have a lot of screen time or purpose. The show was just doomed to die at the start.While most game adaptations just straight-up suck, some are good. This show was not of the good ones. I understand that Cygames wants to cater to all the fans by having the horse girls that fans love featured in the anime. Well, sometimes the best thing to do is not try to cater to everyone, creating something generic.As a result of trying to juggle all of the characters which are impossible, the rest of the show also gets neglected. You kind of just see Special Week, the MC, go fast in races. There's no training, strategy, or much rivalry. It's pretty braindead, and all you see is Special Week performing well in races without much context as to why she is good, or why the race is important to her. The idol thing is a gimmick thing that just seems attached to the races, which it obviously is. The games featured it, but adding it to the anime doesn't make a lot of sense for how little time and focus it has.So, not only does the show neglect any sort of character development, training, or importance to the race matches in favor of slice-of-life interactions with other horse girls, none of the themes are executed well either. There's a complete lack of focus, characterization, and too many things bundled into a 12-episode season. If the show decided to only focus on the character development of team Spica, which only has four or five girls, perhaps it could have been better. impossible.

It looked interesting, girl runners with the cute touch that they are horse girls. Binge watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is the first sports themed anime I've watched I could seriously find nothing to dislike about this anime, if you like comedy, drama watching someone attain their goals in fierce competition and defying the odds this...anime is defiantly worth the watch. anime is defiantly worth the watch."", ""This Review Contains No SpoilersDisclaimer: The following review is my personal opinion, how I experienced and thought about the anime Uma Musume. It is not an attempt to convey objective facts, as one would find in a report, on the contrary, it is my opinion and how I think about the anime, it is purely subjective, not less and not more.StoryThe main plot is nothing completely new but the horse-girl aspect and the rivalries were entertaining, and, in their best moments, even dramatic. The humor felt sometimes off, especially when it relied on the team-members: They felt gimmicky and tacked-on until much later in the...anime where they finally got the chance to establish a relation with the viewer, but this was too little too late. The direction and series-composition put on the shoes before the pants, in this regard. The races themselves were well-staged, created proper excitement, and were often the highlight of each episode. One aspect I could neither understand nor accept though, until the very end, was the performing-of-a-song aspect after each race: It never received proper attention to justify its existence in the story, aside from episode 2, and it also made no sense whether we compare it to reality, where such a thing doesn't exist in horse-racing, or to what we learned from the Uma Musume universe itself: The girls are professional athletes, they train running, every day, and nothing else, that's their profession, singing and dancing is not part of their training, and yet the story expects them to be able to sing and dance on a professional level. Try to make sense of that. Hint: It doesn't make any sense at all. Speaking about not making sense, it could be argued that there are no antagonists in Uma Musume, for even the leader of the rival team is begrudgingly supporting our girls and our team. Were we to judge them as actual antagonists, we would not find much antagonizing about them, which was disappointing and leads us to an overall 6.5/10.CharactersThe main character may be steeped in various cliches but has, despite that, enough individuality, visually and in terms of personality, in order to be recognizable in the vast sea of anime characters. There is also an interesting dynamic between the two main characters, which, for the most part, is carrying the main plot. Among the supporting characters, the team-members of Special Week (the name of our main character) feel flat, in their best moments, and slightly aggravating, in their worst moments. They could have added to the anime if a little bit more attention and time in the spotlight would have been dedicated to them. This actually does happen towards the end of the anime, but, as previously mentioned, it is too little too late. The rival horse-girls though are diverse, memorable, and entertaining enough to justify an overall score of 7.5/10.VisualsThe character designs are quirky, tasteful, and covered with numerous lovely details. The attention to detail is also noticeable if we check out the backgrounds, the props (_carrots, carrots, carrots_), the outfits, and hair accessories of the girls. The designers did a great job in this regard. Some horse-girls though lack a little bit of visual individuality, and can be hard to tell apart until later on. That may also be attributed to the sheer number of girls which the viewer has to become familiar with. The visual quality is slightly above average with the odd scene and background here and there dropping in quality while the horse-girls themselves are well drawn, but not enough to warrant an overall Very Good rating: 7.5/10.AudioI experienced serious issues with the sound-mix where effects (steps, ringing, doors) and background noises (crowd cheering) were twice as loud as they are supposed to be, which made for a dangerous and unpleasant experience with headphones. This actually stopped being an issue from episode 9 and onward, but such a blunder can simply not be defended. The soundtrack is mostly invisible, which doesn't have to be an issue for music that is meant to stay primarily in the background, but there were, with a few exceptions, almost no noteworthy moments at all. In the end, it managed to be below average, and that is quite an achievement in itself. The opening song is unremarkable too and leaves us with a scent of no-risk, no originality, but the ending song makes up for it with a nice melody that is actually catchy and well-fitting: 5/10.EnjoymentDespite the flaws and letdowns with story and sound, I enjoyed most of my time with Uma Musume: The charm of the main characters, paired with the cute visuals, managed to overshadow many shortcomings: 7/10.SummaryA weak start was followed by a surprising sprint, but Uma Musume ran out of breath and missed a spot on the podium by several horse-lengths: 6.7 - Fun, but not winning any trophies.Afterword: My rating is not based on my own abilities and skills to produce anime, but it is relative to all the other anime I was privileged enough to watch and enjoy so far. I believe that a creator is always above the critic: It takes not only skill and dedication in order to create, but, above all, courage, whereas it takes no bravery to judge the work of someone else. In this sense, the effort it took to write this review is, despite the rating, a way of expressing my humble admiration.PS.

Just...enjoy the anime and have fun in the silly moments. enjoy the anime and have fun in the silly moments."", 'Out of 100 Nobles watching...84 were impressed!6 were busy laughing at derpy 3d models5 aren\'t into idol stuff5 weren\'t too amused with the tropesUma Musume really had no business being as good of a show as it was. It stands as a testament to the intrigue and life that can be given to a show when the protagonist of a story has no guarantee of victory.The show is set in an alternate universe where the spirits of famous race horses from our world are reincarnated into ""Horse Girls"" in this world. The horse girls have horsey ears and tails, but otherwise are regular human women....It\'s a pretty low tier monster girl for consumers of THAT genre, but the execution is done well and the fact that the girls don\'t have a dopey double set of ears like many monster girls from other media the show automatically gets a few Nobles attention for the immersion factor.The story follows a young horse girl from the countryside named Special Week making her trip to attend a prestigious school for training horse girls for races. She holds the dream of being the best horse girl in Japan and her pursuit of that dream directly colliding with the hopes and aspirations of the other characters in the show are where things get interesting.As mentioned earlier the show does well with its immersion. It has a well built world that the horse girls live in that makes horse girl racing and culture feel like a living breathing part of its canon. The show contains a massive cast of characters and every horse girl is based on a real-life racing horse with aspects of their personality, appearance, and clothing reflecting their origin. It\'s a nice touch and shows P.A. Works really cared about the product they were making.A short note on the OP and ED. They\'re both amazing and filled the ""Shiny Days"" and ""Ishukan Communication"" shaped holes in my heart left by Yuru Camp and Kobayashi\'s Maid Dragon.The biggest draw back to the show was that it was very obviously made on a budget. Panning still shots, recycled frames, and the implementation of mixed 3d/2d effects that strain the eye are the offenders here. For the most part the show makes very good use of editing and action lines to make the more ""animation light"" sequences still feel alive and natural.The use of CG models in a number of background crowd shots were annoying but even worse were models used during some of the actual horse racing scenes that presented an image of 3d characters float-walking on a 2d plane. This wasn\'t a huge problem though because despite some of the janky weird looking running animations there were lots of racing scenes that were gorgeous and conveyed a powerful sense of motion and speed that were a joy to watch and left me at the edge of my seat wondering who was going to win.To conclude, I don\'t like idol type anime or manga, but Uma Musume had so much more than just an idol show to offer and presented a moving narrative that at times had me shedding manly tears the same way Boku no Hero gets me.The aspirations and dreams of characters you love with only one allowed victory... who will win?

It's basically track & field under the guise of horse girls. Initially this show was one of the ones that I thought I would drop after an episode or two but luckily that wasn't the case. The Idol aspect of the show that popped up in the first episode didn't take up too much time and also wasn't a main focus for the remainder of the series thankfully. Also there was a race happening almost every episode so I think there was plenty for a sports anime fan like myself to enjoy even if I...didn't particularly care for some other elements of the show.The story is your standard one that you'd find in some other sports anime, a new character arrives at a new school/town with dreams of being the best. They then compete, find new friends and rivals along their journey. So in that respect, the story is average with the high points coming from the emotions you would feel watching the races and the low points being the slice of life moments between the characters in my opinion.I think the best aspect about Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is definitely the art. I loved the character designs and always thought that there was a lot of thought that had to have gone into color coordination because while everything is very colorful it never once feels like it was obnoxious. The animation was okay but maybe it wasn't the style I had in mind for when I want to watch track and field.The soundtrack was pleasant and when the idol moments did happen, the songs were nice. I had a minor gripe with the sound effects as I thought the audio balance may have been off a couple times and they were too loud as a result.The characters were good and I liked the main character pairing of Special Week and Silence Suzuka. The show did a decent job of getting the audience invested into what each of these characters desired. The cast of side characters are good as well but the big problem was that there was so many of them that at some point you just end up not caring for most of them after a while.While I recognize that Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is a very good show, there were a couple things aesthetically that took away from my enjoyment of the series. Nevertheless I still think that this anime is worthy of a recommendation. didn't particularly care for some other elements of the show.The story is your standard one that you'd find in some other sports anime, a new character arrives at a new school/town with dreams of being the best.

Works, which brought us Angelbeats. In my personal opinion I think this show might be some of it\'s best work yet. The show gave us something we didn\'t know we needed, until they brought it to life in this anime. HORSEGIRLS!!Story:Ok, so Pretty Derby is about a world where all the great race horses that have passed away in our world are reincarnated in this new one as horsegirls. Which as essentially just normal girls expect they have tails and ears of a...horse, as well as their speed and endurance. The main story revolves around Tokyo\'s Tracen Academy, a highschool for horse girls hoping to moving on to fame and fortune as both racers and idols. (The top three winners of each important race have to preform on stage in fancy get ups to sing and dance) That is for those who are not familiar with idol anime.*Spoiler* The horses in this show are ones that actually did exist in real life, main characters and all. The races are real events that happen in Japan and the ones around the world mentioned in the show. If your curious you can look up all the horses and see what made them special in real life. but that will basically make the show less exciting because they list all the races that each horse has ran. As someone who grew up around horses and race horses in particular I can really appreciate the design and the characteristics that have been Incorporated in characters.The story centers around Special Week a horse girl from the countryside, who has just transferred to Tracen, and she\'s determined to fulfill her promise to her mother to become the best horse girl in Japan. On her way to the school for the very first time, she takes a pit stop at the race track and instantly falls in love with Silence Suzuka\'s style, becoming determined to race on the same team as her.Winning the races is the main point of the story but the writers did an amazing job  of portraying every single race as important in its own way for the characters develop. I was on the edge when Suzuka just went from world record breaking speed to slowly decelerating, limping one leg after the other, barley being able to still keep going. Wow was it immersing. Weather it was Suzuka\'s loss and hospitalized race, to Special Weeks win at one the G1 races, to El Condor Pasa\'s vistories in Europe. Each and every race had a meaning and I honestly think that is one of the main reasons why the show is so popular.Characters:I thought the idea of incorporating the real life horses into horsegirls was a little strange at first, but it quickly grew on me. Special Week and Silent Suzuka are probably the two who develop the most in the series. They both find a kinship in one another through racing. Not just to win but to inspire others to shoot for the stars, and that anyone can achieve their dreams. I found it be a endearing relationship that built upon each other. Special Week never gave up on a crippled Suzuka. Suzuka never stopped believing that Special Week could become the best horsegirl in Japan.The rest of the characters while important were unfortunately not touched up in a series manner like the other two. I will say that the fact that this show never took itself too seriously is what makes the show great and a cut above a lot of others. Still it would have been a little nicer to have gotten to know more of the main teams characters like Vodka and Scarlet better then just them comically competing over everything. Then again, that is one of the points that makes the show funny. Yes school work is still important as well as training but whenever everyone is around there friends go out of there way to make themselves laugh and have a good time.Animation and Sound:The animation is actually cutting edge in it\'s own right. I am not an athletic person and when I am in the mood to exercise running is probably my least favorite sport. This show actually puts a very good spin on the race, trying their best to not make it look like NASCAR. That\'s even with the frilly dresses that logically one could not run that far in. Specifically when Special Week, Suzuka, Pasa, or Air Groove really start running they form air that is not something you see in real when people run but you can see it when horses run. The detail in the movements is extremely lifelike, with Suzuka the best way to hold out her hands when she\'s running and the way that they ""kick"" off to make their move to steal first place. This puts the world in a realistic perspective that I\'m sure took a lot of hours of watching the Olympics.The music is geared towards the target audience which I would say is preteen- teen girls. It defiantly isn\'t bad. The idol aspect is really undermined, but it was kind of ridiculous to begin with. I think they just liked the idea that everyone can look up at the winners dancing and admire them to the point where they will want to push themselves.In conclusion:This anime is probably one of the best of 2018. It\'s funny, its endearing, shit it even makes running look fun (Run at your own risk). As I\'ve stated in my previous comments the show is successful because it does not take itself too seriously. You can sit back and enjoy this show without having to worry oh who\'s going to die, who is going to cheat on who. It\'s pretty realistic in nature of the way people interact with one another. Quite possibly the way we wish our friends would treat us in the real world. If you looking for something to entertain yourself and have a good laugh with every episode I would give this anime a try.Score: 8 horse, as well as their speed and endurance.

However, even leaving aside questions like ""What is a horse girl"" and ""Why do they have an idol performance after a race,"" this show\'s viewing experience is still confusing and fragmented.The beginning of the story introduces Special Week, a country horse girl who wants to become ""No. 1 in Japan"", which to some extent implies to the audience that this is a typical Shounen story;However, even if the audience has watched the entire season, ""becoming number one in Japan"" is still an abstract concept: how to be number one in Japan? What...awards do you need to win? Are there any national-level events? On the other hand, the growth of  Special Week has not been specifically portrayed, only the two states of being happy after winning the game and feeling uncomfortable after losing the game.Of course, this may also be my preconceived idea; this is not necessarily a classic Shounen story.The beginning of the story introduces Special Week\'s future roommate Silence Suzuka, another trendy horse girl, which to some extent hints to the audience that this is a story about ""bonds"";However, after a whole season, the writers don\'t give the two characters any impressive interactions, whether as friends, colleagues or rivals.Of course, this may also be my preconceived idea; it doesn\'t have to be a story about bonds between characters.The beginning of the story introduces Mr. Trainer; at his invitation, Jack joined the team Spica, which to some extent implies to the audience that this is a story about team cohesion;However, I found that the trainer did not act as a mentor to the horse girls in the story as I expected. His role may represent the player\'s identity in the game, but it could be more valid. On the other hand, the interaction of the characters in the team is only superficial. More than simple slices of life and exchanges aimed at a comedy atmosphere are needed to support the team to become the story\'s core. Moreover, our horse girls have to fight alone in every game.Of course, this may also be my preconceived idea... awards do you need to win? Are there any national-level events?

This piece of media doesn’t need to exist, nobody has asked for it, but yet, once you saw it, you knew you were in love with it. And as it turns out, other people felt the same way. Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is a show just like that. Described by MAL as a slice of life sports anime, Uma Musume: Pretty Derby follows an aspiring horse girl named Special Week, working her way to become the greatest horse racing girl in Japan! Horse...girls are made to run, so many of them spend their careers participating in races, much like the racehorses of our world. Along her journey, Special Week meets other horse girls, all acting as rivals and friends as she attempts to reach the top with them.As I was scrolling through the Spring anime season and saw this show with some cute poster art of horse girls and a synopsis with nothing but the description, “Based on a mobile game,” (The synopsis changed later) I thought nothing of it. But the fact that they were horse girls, I thought that this would be a new extension of the “Monster girl” genre. Much like Monster Musume, or the highly regarded Dragon Maid. So the decision to watch the show was based upon that alone. Although, the first episode hooked me.The first episode starts off with introductions to the main characters. They introduce Special Week arriving to the city, where she was previously from the boonies. Her character is just your average happy go lucky girl that's inspired by horse girls. As well as determined to become one of those girls. Silence Suzuka is one of them. She comes out as first as the quiet girl who has the talent to be the greatest. She wins a race by a landslide before Special Week’s eyes in an honestly well put together and exciting race. This inspires Special Week to want to race with her. And furthers the plot. After the race, the winners then go on to hold an idol concert. Special week is then introduced to her manager and the other supporting character horse girls. The episode ends with a fun and upbeat ED to match the show’s tone.The rest of the show consists of Special Week racing in various Derbies and Cups around Japan. It also further develops her relationship with Silence Suzuka. Every episode has an exciting race in it, which helps to the pacing of the show. Although, that being said, many of the races are similar to each other, and if you’re not really into the races in the first place, you may find yourself bored very quickly. Special Week and Silence Suzuka’s relationship is very generic in terms of happy slice of life friendships. Although, with what the show is trying to accomplish, works fine.Speaking of what Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is trying to accomplish. This anime was made to advertise a mobile game of the same name. As of writing this review, the mobile game has yet to come out. As an advertisement, it's easy to view the formula it’s following to sell as many games and merchandise as possible. Its cute and noticeably different characters, their outfits, their personalities are all made to sell. Uma Musume is even taking from the idol genre, one of the arguably most profitable advertising strategies in effect in Japan right now.Despite its origin and nature, the people who created this had a lot of care and research into crafting these characters. Every horse girl is based on a real Japanese racehorse. And each girl’s design is very uniquely based on the horse they’re based on. The shows events even loosely follows the races each horse in real life wins. This includes somewhat major plot points. Animation is good and fluid. The art is nothing different. Music is fitting to what the show is. Character designs are top tier, even if the character personalities don’t.I liked this show. Even if the content is predictable and samey, it does what it needs to do well. It was pretty popular this season, and it deserves it. I recommend this to those already familiar to these types of anime advertising. I give this show a 7 out of 10.

This has been your PixEFit’s spoiler free, but not really review."", 'Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is an Anime about Horse Girls going to School and Copeting in Diferent Races Inside of Japan and even Outside of it where the winner gives a small Idol-style performance. Its kind of a weird Premise but I ended up Enjoying it. Maybe a bit too much...Story: 4/10The Story follows Special week. A horse Girl that Wants to be the best Horse Girl in all of Japan in her Quest to do so. When She Arrives to Tokyo Tracen Academy with the help of her Perverted trainer, she meets Silence Suzuka, One of the best Race horses of her generation, along...with other aspiring race horses. She ends up Joining Team Spica, Having a Friendly Rivalry with Silence Suzuka and The enemy team\'s El Condor Pasa at a smaller Degree. This Story Felt very Battle Shonen like but adapting it to a Slice of Life Sports Show. If I Had to make a Direct Comparison it Would be to Naruto (I know the Low Hanging Fruit When Critiquing Shonen but I Ha to Use it.). Suzuka vs Spe felt a bit Like early Naruto vs Sasuke. Her Small Friendly Rivalry felt a bit like Some Naruto vs Lee (Even though that is more prominent in the Rock Lee Spin off but Whatever).Even The Trainer\'s Relationship with the Enemy Trainer felt a Bit Jiraiya and Tsunade like. I felt like the Story was too Copy and Pasted but Don\'t Worry because the anime makes up for it in Diferent aspects.Art: 7/10The Anime has good animation. The races never felt so bad that I wanted to Skip them. The Races were nicely paced and made you feel like they were very high stakes. The races is where this Anime Shined. The Idol segments were very well animated. Even during the massive insert song at the end of EP.13 it didn\'t look bad. Instead of Going Full CGI Like Love Live they went with traditional animation similarly to Idolm@ster. Very Nice Overall.Sound: 6/10The OST Was Good Enough. It wasn\'t too Distracting during the races and acompanied their scenes well. The ED and OP are very Catchy. I remember When the First two Episodes Aired I Couldn\'t get ""Make Debut!"" Out of my Head. I Still love the song But not as much as the other Song used in Promotionat Material for the Mobile Game. The Seiyuu fit their characters really well. They even Got Spe\'s Real Life Jockey,More on that later, to Voice as part of the Commentary team during one of the races. Overall, The Sound Design was really Good. Good Casting and Nice OST.Character: 6/10Every Character in the Show is based on REAL race Horses from the late 90\'s to Early 2000\'s and their Jockey.That can be Noticed on their Character Design. The Horses Themselves look like anthropomorphised versions of their IRL counterparts and their race costumes use similar color that their IRL jockeys used to Use. Their Personalities felt very Copy and Pasted. With Most Characters, I felt like I Had already seen a Similar Character Somewhere else. Most of It\'s points in this category are for the Character Design and their Atention to detail. For Example, They Gave El Condor Pasa a very Subtle Engrish accent to simbolize that she is an American breed and a Luchador Mask to Simbolize The Latin Origin\'s of her name. Is it a bit racist? Yeah but I didn\'t rally mind as a latinamerican myself. I see How someone could\'ve gotten triggered by it.Enjoyment: 8/10I really enjoted the Show. The Races were very entertaining and even the S.O.L Parts were funny at some points. Every horse girl has something likable about them and Even if their Character dinamics and Personalities are Copy and Pasted they are extremely Likeable. Maybe It is because of my Former love for Love Live (pun intended). I was a bit disappointed that there weren\'t that many Idol segements but whatever. That was not the min selling point for the show.Overall: 6The Anime is really good if you have nothing to watch. Most episodes end in a Race so you will always get a Climactic Finish. If you Like CGDCT Shows or Horse racing in general I recommend this show. Even If you Don\'t like any of those I still reccommend it. You might be pleasantly surprised. with other aspiring race horses. She ends up Joining Team Spica, Having a Friendly Rivalry with Silence Suzuka and The enemy team\'s El Condor Pasa at a smaller Degree. This Story Felt very Battle Shonen like but adapting it to a Slice of Life Sports Show. If I Had to make a Direct Comparison it Would be to Naruto (I know the Low Hanging Fruit When Critiquing Shonen but I Ha to Use it.). Suzuka vs Spe felt a bit Like early Naruto vs Sasuke. Her Small Friendly Rivalry felt a bit like Some Naruto vs Lee (Even though that is more prominent in the Rock Lee Spin off but Whatever).Even The Trainer\'s Relationship with the Enemy Trainer felt a Bit Jiraiya and Tsunade like. I felt like the Story was too Copy and Pasted but Don\'t Worry because the anime makes up for it in Diferent aspects.Art: 7/10The Anime has good animation. The races never felt so bad that I wanted to Skip them. The Races were nicely paced and made you feel like they were very high stakes. The races is where this Anime Shined. The Idol segments were very well animated. Even during the massive insert song at the end of EP.13 it didn\'t look bad. Instead of Going Full CGI Like Love Live they went with traditional animation similarly to Idolm@ster. Very Nice Overall.Sound: 6/10The OST Was Good Enough. It wasn\'t too Distracting during the races and acompanied their scenes well. The ED and OP are very Catchy. I remember When the First two Episodes Aired I Couldn\'t get ""Make Debut!"" Out of my Head. I Still love the song But not as much as the other Song used in Promotionat Material for the Mobile Game. The Seiyuu fit their characters really well. They even Got Spe\'s Real Life Jockey,More on that later, to Voice as part of the Commentary team during one of the races. Overall, The Sound Design was really Good. Good Casting and Nice OST.Character: 6/10Every Character in the Show is based on REAL race Horses from the late 90\'s to Early 2000\'s and their Jockey.That can be Noticed on their Character Design. The Horses Themselves look like anthropomorphised versions of their IRL counterparts and their race costumes use similar color that their IRL jockeys used to Use. Their Personalities felt very Copy and Pasted. With Most Characters, I felt like I Had already seen a Similar Character Somewhere else. Most of It\'s points in this category are for the Character Design and their Atention to detail. For Example, They Gave El Condor Pasa a very Subtle Engrish accent to simbolize that she is an American breed and a Luchador Mask to Simbolize The Latin Origin\'s of her name. Is it a bit racist? Yeah but I didn\'t rally mind as a latinamerican myself. I see How someone could\'ve gotten triggered by it.Enjoyment: 8/10I really enjoted the Show. The Races were very entertaining and even the S.O.L Parts were funny at some points. Every horse girl has something likable about them and Even if their Character dinamics and Personalities are Copy and Pasted they are extremely Likeable. Maybe It is because of my Former love for Love Live (pun intended). I was a bit disappointed that there weren\'t that many Idol segements but whatever. That was not the min selling point for the show.Overall: 6The Anime is really good if you have nothing to watch. Most episodes end in a Race so you will always get a Climactic Finish. If you Like CGDCT Shows or Horse racing in general I recommend this show. Even If you Don\'t like any of those I still reccommend it. You might be pleasantly surprised.', 'Uma musume is a good anime in some areas. I can\'t also deny it has some faults starting from episode 1 but that does not stop me from enjoying this anime.Plot 7/10The Plot is simple enough for anyone to ubderstand but what i like sbout the plot is its original (at least for me). I never heard of any other anime the feature horse girls in recent years unlike some anime that copies from each other.Art 8/10The art for me was amazing. Everything was well designed from the characters and the environment.in my opinion, it has one of the best animation/art style this season.Sound 8/10I...did not really pay much attention to the sound or audio in the anime or maybe its the VA that made a tremendous job for each character.Character 9/10The characters in the anime was interesting ans instead of focusing only on special week\'s every day life, They made every characters have ebough screen time so that you can feel ""connection"" between the characters and the viewers wheter they will get attached to a certain character or dislike it. I liked them all but of course my fave character is special week. Throughout the series, Special week shown tremendous character development physically and mentally. Although she became arrogant after her big win causing her to lose a year worth of races. She made a comeback by remembering whats the dream of her mother is - to be the best horse girl in japan.Enjoyment 9/10I enjoyed this anime a lot and each and every race always gets me on the edge of my seat figuring out who will win. Not only me but some of the audience might agree with me that the races are nerve racking because you wont know who will win.my only problem is at the ""bonus"" episode. I kinda knew that everyone will tie from the start and i didnt expect that would really happen. I was dissapointed by that because i wanted one horse to prevail over the other, i would accept two to three horses would tie considering the skill gaps they have with each other, it reallu does not make sense to me.Overall 8/10Overall this anime was great, I really could not say much more since i said everything i wanted to above but hands down this anime was entertaining. did not really pay much attention to the sound or audio in the anime or maybe its the VA that made a tremendous job for each character.Character 9/10The characters in the anime was interesting ans instead of focusing only on special week\'s every day life, They made every characters have ebough screen time so that you can feel ""connection"" between the characters and the viewers wheter they will get attached to a certain character or dislike it.

I probably would’ve believed you because that actually sounds dumb enough to be good. Uma Musume wasn’t JUST good, it was great. Even if you take away the whole horse girl side of things, you still have a great anime about character striving to be the best runners they can, how they deal with training, rivalry, and losing on their way to achieving their goals. It’s a great character piece where the Main Character doesn’t always win, doesn’t always...pull through when she has to, and sometimes you don’t know who to root for. These races can get surprisingly intense. It’s not as simple as “whoever has plot armor wins the race.” Each race is full of interesting characters with their own unique designs and racing tactics. While not all of the main cast gets enough time to truly shine, the main two were wonderful to see. Special Week and Silence Suzuka were great to see help one another as friends and rivals. The other members of their team never get the spotlight themselves, but they do well in supportive roles. The screen time they do get is always fun to see. It’s also worth mentioning that every character in the anime is based off of a real life race horse.  So if you’re really into horse races, you’ll definitely see some names that look familiar. In the anime, the winning horse girls in a competition get to do these big idol performances to celebrate their victory. However, outside the first and last episodes, we really never get to see them. I should probably be glad the races themselves were made more important than idol performances, it would’ve been nice to see more of. While this was all technically just promotion for the upcoming mobile game, it was great for a standalone anime. It’s filled to the brim with colorful, unique characters, had some intense races, great character dynamics, and is an anime that I will truly miss watching each week. It really did a great job of selling the premise of the game. I’ll definitely check that out and get frustrated when I don’t summon a SSR Special Week. pull through when she has to, and sometimes you don’t know who to root for.

Hey there are cat girls so I guess there should be one about horses now right?) How does this anime stack up? Let\'s find out.Story 7/10: Basically, the story is about a girl, er well, horse girl, named Special Week who lived in Hokkaido and starts attending school in some, well, horse girl school in Tokyo (I think) to learn to become the best horse girls they can be. In Special Week\'s case, she wants to be Japan\'s number one horse girl. In order for her...to help reach her goal, she gets ""recruited"" (read: kidnapped) by some horse girls from Team Spica in order to help them become a great team and help Special Weak become a great horse girl In regards to being the number one horse girl, this consists of winning races, the biggest being the Japan Cup. After the race, the winners perform idol concerts. Yes, you read that right. In the main races, they wear costumes that you would see pop idol\'s wear then they perform a concert afterwards (they have basically an unranked/minor races wear they wear generic gym outfits). Simply put, imagine each show as if the girls from Love Live or Idolmaster ran a track race then performed a concert afterwards. It\'s a weird combination, but they stop mentioning the concerts after episode 4 I think until the last two episodes where they have a big concert. All this though is fine, it\'s simplistic but it works. There is some drama thrown in there because hey, what\'s any anime without some drama but all of it is fine.Art 8/10: The art here is really good. I like how the characters look, the scenery looks, how basically everything looks. It\'s pretty nice.Sound 8/10: The OP and ED were pretty good, and the BGM was fine to capture each moment well.Character 8/10: (I should probably note this here, but in the first episode they talk about how ""great horses from the past are reincarnated as horse girls"" or something along those lines. I thought this was to explain why the world has horse girls but apparently they are based on actual race horses who exist. I\'m serious, go look up some of the names on Google and you will find wikipedia pages of horses with their name.) The main characters are Special Week, a cheerful, upbeat yet clumsy horse girl who wants to be Japan\'s best in part because of a promise she made to her step mom (human) and her real mom (died after giving birth to her, so it was more like a promise to her grave.) There is also Silence Suzuka, a quiet but very talented horse girl who leaves Team Rigil to join Team Spica because they help to remind Suzuka how much fun racing can be. This is all you know about any of the characters (except for Trainer at the end). Which is fine, I hate when they try to make every character important for no reason, and when you expect them to provide more information they don\'t. The only thing I wished they gave more information on is Trainer-san because they mention a few times about his past but don\'t go too much into it, although I wish they did. The only backstory they gave on Trainer-san was at the last episode. Overall, the characters were fine.Enjoyment 7/10: Now, with all this, you might think I would\'ve enjoyed it a little more than a 7 perhaps? Well, not really. This was fine, but nothing really stood out to make it a great anime, but nothing stood out to make me dislike it as well. Nothing really hooked me on it, but nothing really felt like a chore to watch. It was a fine, enjoyable anime overall.Overall 7/10: Overall, I enjoyed this show. Don\'t expect to be wowed by anything, but I\'m pretty sure you won\'t really hate anything from it (assuming this is the kinda anime you like to watch.)

I would definitely give Uma Masume a watch.', ""As someone who loathes hyper-competitiveness, I can't really bring myself to enjoy this anime. I honestly did want to like Uma Musume, but I just can't do it. The artstyle, the animation, the music, the voice acting, the character designs, they all range from good to great, and some parts in the anime remain enjoyable enough to watch despite everything else.However, when the entire premise of the anime (and almost everything around it) revolves around competition and the need to win and not much else, I just lose interest in it. For the most part, it doesn't even seem like there's much reason behind their...obsessive need to win and compete except the boring 'I'm gonna be the best.' Even the friendships in Uma Musume revolve almost entirely around competition and rivalry. Oh they'll say 'I wanna make others happy,' but at the end of the day it all still comes back down to needing to run and win races in order to do it. Why can't it be about them having fun first and foremost, perhaps even outside of racing? Why does everybody usually treat eachother, friends or not, like rivals to be defeated? Why does every character, in nearly every scene, have this pervasive need to improve their running like it's a life-or-death situation? I would've liked Uma Musume so much more if the characters had more to their lives and personalities than just constant training/racing. If it had some more lighthearted slice-of-life moments to flesh out its characters and alleviate that serious/intense tone around its racing.On top of that, other criticisms I have with Uma Musume is that the pacing could've been better, and that there are a few too many characters overall. This results in many of those characters being unable to really have enough screen time and character development - at least within just 13 episodes. Thus, I find it a bit hard to really care much for most of them.To be sure, Uma Musume is definitely not awful, because it certainly does have good aspects and ideas, and it deserves a few points for that at the least. However, overall, I still didn't enjoy it that much, and that's why I ultimately gave it this score. obsessive need to win and compete except the boring 'I'm gonna be the best.'

The story is lacking in some places and gets a tiny bit boring at parts but it has cute girls doing cute things. And those cute girls happen to be horses.Not really the idol anime I was expecting, in fact, the concerts are the least shown part. Though the music was enjoyable they only had like 3 or 4 songs that weren\'t racing music.The character design is really good, but some characters I didn\'t even realize existed until the final episode. But the ones they did show got, ok? character development.Some parts felt less like a sports/idol anime and...more of a ""look at these 2 cute girls, they\'re very gay for each other. and ones kinda obsessed. it\'s not creepy though we promise""I know this was made to be promotional material for their game though so I am excited to play that and see how they expand on the characters that got like no screen time! more of a ""look at these 2 cute girls, they\'re very gay for each other. and ones kinda obsessed. it\'s not creepy though we promise""I know this was made to be promotional material for their game though so I am excited to play that and see how they expand on the characters that got like no screen time!', 'I\'m not a fan of the ""cute girls doing cute things"" genre.I\'m not a fan of ""sports"" genre.So, you would assume I would not like this show, and I would have thought the same going into it when a friend convinced to give the show a chance.But I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed this show on a whole.Then when I found out that all of the horse girls, the race results, and their careers were based on actual Japanese race horses and their real racing histories, it just made the show all the cooler and more interesting.Now, if you actually delve into all...the individual details, there are some that stick very accurately to their real life counterparts while there are others who\'s outcomes are changed in the show, for reasons that I won\'t devulge due to spoiler reasons. But I will say that I understood why they made the changes they did, and it was never done just so that the protagonist could always win.That\'s actually something I really liked about this show, popular characters, including the MC, lose at various times. And that\'s realistic for not just horse racing but sports in general.And that\'s why I tend to not like sports anime. Because the MC, or the MC\'S team just always wins, either through the power of friendship or sheer dumb luck does this person or people who\'ve trained for a few weeks manage to somehow beat the perennial regional champions who have been training since birth, because plot armor.But because this show is mostly based on the results of actual careers, we get to see believable ebbs and flows with growth and development over time and encounters with new opponents who are better in higher ranked brackets and what it means to move up in competition and truly face tougher and tougher competition as you progress in your career.Overall, the story and the characters do a great job of showing this and it\'s paired with well done animation.I can\'t wait for the second season to finish up in another couple weeks so I can binge it next. the individual details, there are some that stick very accurately to their real life counterparts while there are others who\'s outcomes are changed in the show, for reasons that I won\'t devulge due to spoiler reasons.

After all, the mobile game this is based on is pretty popular…but not translated to English. I actually wouldn’t recommend watching this anime for that reason on the grounds that anything that can influence you into playing a gacha game (and therefore risk you sinking money into it) can be very dangerous. But even if that’s not a concern, the anime actually focuses on one girl — Special Week — instead of providing wide view of the characters.Despite not really getting what I wanted out of the anime, I ironically ended...up liking this approach more. It makes Uma Musume feel like an actual anime that could’ve been conceived without the mobile game.Plus, I think the Special Week was a good main character! She’s very endearing despite being awkward, which works well. Silence Suzuka ends up as the second main character, and her aloof personality eventually makes way for a character you root for. Ironically, the characters in their rival group end up with more personality than the members of their own group. Despite their limited time on-screen, most of the other horse girls didn’t feel shallow. I actually liked how much the Trainer actually cared for his team…even though his introduction was deeply regrettable.This anime suffers from corny writing and tropes, especially around the beginning. For every joke or gag that lands, there’s at least one that doesn’t. But I would rather have that than pervert jokes, which thankfully aren’t present in the anime at all…besides the three or so times the Trainer does the leg thing. The dialogue can also get repetitive at times, but thankfully repetitive jokes only rear their head a lot in the beginning.It’s unfortunate that those things are the first impression you get of the anime because it actually starts to become more sober after a handful of episodes. The early races did good setup, but later races start to have actual stakes. The races themselves aren’t anything special. They really only focus on two girls and upsets only ever happen because one girl could run faster. Yet despite that, the races can still be heart pumping thanks to the buildup and potential payoff thanks to clear motives for each girl.It feels like the anime is written to be inspirational and I think it works (even when it’s only felt empathetically). It can definitely get emotional — especially in the second half — and I’ll admit I teared up a few times. And when the anime isn’t pulling at the heart strings, it just has pleasant, fun vibes all around. For example, everyone is surprisingly sportsmanlike.Uma Musume may start off feeling worryingly inane and hollow, but grows to be surprisingly sincere…especially for an anime about girls doing horse racing…based off of a gacha game.

The races themselves are the star of the anime and the biggest focal point of the anime. The ""idol"" element is just there and doesn\'t have as much of a focus and is used more of a celebratory of the races. But through and through Uma Musume is a sports-fueled anime about horse girls running for fun, competition or achieving their dreams or all of the above.There are dozens of characters in this anime but the major focal points goes to Special Week and Silence Suzuka the most. Special Week is our narrative focus throughout the entire anime and we see her from an underdog with a few tricks to one of the best horse girls in Japan and we see her trials and tribulations from training to her physical and mental well being but especially when it concerns Silence Suzuka. Silence Suzuka has some character development as well, as she has the ""fun aspect"" of the races and she also one of the naturally fastest characters in the anime but is kinda an oddball. Now other characters do get their typical stereotypical attributes about them, mainly Special Week\'s team as well as their Trainer...named Trainer-san voiced by Kouji Okino as well as some of the opposition to Special Week and Silence Suzuka, mainly El Condor Pasa voiced by Minanmi Takahashi and her trainer Hana Toujou voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi.Yes, because of the HUGE cast of characters, be it allies or opponents, many characters who aren\'t the main characters easily gets shafted in this anime but LA sees this as a given considering the narrative focus and the entire main character status, but still, having the colorful cast of personalities definitely helped liven up the anime throughout the anime with clashes of personalities, comedic skits and interactions and interesting character designs and to that LA\'s favourites characters outside of Silence Suzuka and Special Week would have been Mejiro McQueen voiced by Saori Oonishi and Gold Ship voiced by Hitomi Ueda with their comedic hijinks.On speaking of which, the animation done by PA. Works is expected from them, from the vibrant and exotic character designs especially the Uma Musume\'s and the typical beautiful background work. The character designs are something LA would praise PA Works for but also with their work in the races and sure PA Works obviously used speed lines to note how fast the character is going but that coupled with the adrenaline fueled atmosphere definitely helped with the animation and those ""moments in the races"" were spot on in terms of synergy of animation and music. Nonetheless the animation was expected high quality from PA Works, both in the slice of life and more serious race moments.Voice acting was impressive to say the least even if it has a huge cast, LA knows that alot of voice actors wouldn\'t be able to flex their chops besides the main characters and those around them, but still with that Azumi Waki was easily LA\'s favourite voice actor from her honed shouting in the races to Special Week\'s personality of a ditzy underhorse, Azumi Waki fitted Special Week perfectly. El Condor Pasa\'s voice actor Minami Takahashi was great as the always genki type but LA was also impressed with Silence Suzuka\'s voice actor Marika Kouno in seeing a different vocal type from her and finally Megumi Toyoguchi and Kouji Okino had great chemistry together as rival Trainers but also supportive of their respective horse girls in varying degrees of method they did it.Uma Musume gave LA vibes of Keijo!!!!!! in certain ways, not in the fanservice obviously but in the races felt similar to the battles and with that comparison, Uma Musume in the the races really felt like you were watch a horse race with all the fanfare, commentators but just with the added monologues from the characters to add to the tension and hype during the races. Uma Musume is definitely an odd one when looking at it face-value from the typical underdog story and the trials and tribulations an underdog would go through but going into it, you\'ll feel that rush of adrenaline when the races start and your cheering or wanting Silence Suzuka or Special Week to win or just the tension itself being greatly and effective applied. LA doesn\'t know how it worked but Uma Musume managed to add elements of anthropomorphic horse girls, idols and horse racing and made it both interesting to see ""their world"" of horse girls integrated and made it awesome to watch in the process of an underdog story.Uma Musume may be for the most part a great anime but for the Spring 2018 lineup...ehhhh it\'s in LA\'s Top 10 animes. Trust LA, that statement is not a dent at Uma Musume as LA really did like Uma Musume but it wasn\'t LA\'s favourite anime of the season but it was a solid anime nonetheless. connotations to real life Japanese horse racing history with a few changes here and there but still. The races themselves are the star of the anime and the biggest focal point of the anime. The ""idol"" element is just there and doesn\'t have as much of a focus and is used more of a celebratory of the races. But through and through Uma Musume is a sports-fueled anime about horse girls running for fun, competition or achieving their dreams or all of the above.There are dozens of characters in this anime but the major focal points goes to Special Week and Silence Suzuka the most. Special Week is our narrative focus throughout the entire anime and we see her from an underdog with a few tricks to one of the best horse girls in Japan and we see her trials and tribulations from training to her physical and mental well being but especially when it concerns Silence Suzuka. Silence Suzuka has some character development as well, as she has the ""fun aspect"" of the races and she also one of the naturally fastest characters in the anime but is kinda an oddball. Now other characters do get their typical stereotypical attributes about them, mainly Special Week\'s team as well as their Trainer...named Trainer-san voiced by Kouji Okino as well as some of the opposition to Special Week and Silence Suzuka, mainly El Condor Pasa voiced by Minanmi Takahashi and her trainer Hana Toujou voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi.Yes, because of the HUGE cast of characters, be it allies or opponents, many characters who aren\'t the main characters easily gets shafted in this anime but LA sees this as a given considering the narrative focus and the entire main character status, but still, having the colorful cast of personalities definitely helped liven up the anime throughout the anime with clashes of personalities, comedic skits and interactions and interesting character designs and to that LA\'s favourites characters outside of Silence Suzuka and Special Week would have been Mejiro McQueen voiced by Saori Oonishi and Gold Ship voiced by Hitomi Ueda with their comedic hijinks.On speaking of which, the animation done by PA. Works is expected from them, from the vibrant and exotic character designs especially the Uma Musume\'s and the typical beautiful background work. The character designs are something LA would praise PA Works for but also with their work in the races and sure PA Works obviously used speed lines to note how fast the character is going but that coupled with the adrenaline fueled atmosphere definitely helped with the animation and those ""moments in the races"" were spot on in terms of synergy of animation and music.

That is Uma Musume in a nutshell. A very easy-going show with hardly any drama that just focuses on the journey of a group of girls.Now despite the show having an ensemble cast because it's a gacha game adaptation, the show mostly focuses on two of the girls, Special Week and Silence Suzuka. I think they work fine as the main duo, I even liked their relationship even if it's nothing deep.However, most of the other girls sadly miss out on good development because of this direction choice. Now, maybe people that play the game already know enough...of the other girls but as someone who is anime only I seriously struggled to even remember the names of half of the other girls. Also I wish they at least gave Trainer-kun a name, even if he is meant to be the player self-insert.Oh and Uma Musume isn't just a sports show. For some reason they also have the girls do idol performances after the races..? I suppose Japan really loves their idols but to me it would have been better to focus on one or the other rather than trying to mix them up. Granted in this show, the idol stuff was hardly present so it's only a minor gripe at best.The pacing of the show is a bit too fast to my liking. Granted most of the races that get glossed over with just mentions don't seem to be very critical to the plot at least. Although the progress of Special Week felt rushed to me. It's a bit hard to fathom all of the stuff that happened actually happened in just a one cour runtime.Now to mention something good for once; The show doesn't just randomly name the girls, they are actually based off of real life counterpart race horses that have existed and reading through discussion threads of people that are into this sport, it was cool to see that even a lot of the races were parallel to real history. Albeit some smaller and bigger liberties were taken to make the story more engaging and I'm okay with that.I had seem some people say visually the first season doesn't hold up well and even if the latter seasons improve on it, I have to say I think the show looked fine. Sure, some of the CGI wasn't all that pretty but the races were mostly hand drawn anyway. Sound department was solid too, the gallop during the races made things more tense.This show to me is the exact same how I felt about Girls Und Panzer too. Cute and wholesome girls duking it out in some kind of weird fantasy sport setting. It's all face value and no depth and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just not a mix that I can personally get that into.PS Gold Ship was probably my favorite. of the other girls but as someone who is anime only I seriously struggled to even remember the names of half of the other girls.

The reincarnation part of this anime is never really touched up on so I won't mention it ever again. These horse girls compete with one another, with the main character of this season, Special Week, who aims to be the best horse girl in all of Japan.Overall, this anime was decent. The character work with Special Week and Silence Suzuka are done exceptionally well and are easily this season's strongest point. The races themselves are fun and exciting to watch. Many of the races are paced well and do a good job leaving you...at the edge of your seat.There are some grievances that I have with this season, however. First off, despite the good character work for the two main characters of Umamusume S1, the rest of the supporting cast don't really have much to work with. The majority of the side characters are your typical goofy best friends who do wacky things together and support the main lead(s) or are simply presented as rivals for the main characters. For this season in particular, I guess that's fine, but it does leave a lot to be desired, and the final product can feel a little hollow when assessing this season as a whole.Another grievance that I have with this season has to come down to other pacing issues. Although the races themselves are written well, there are sporadic moments throughout the anime where characters will talk about seemingly important races that they competed in only for them to lose, and at times, even suffer an embarrassing defeat. Again, the main characterization in the two main characters of this show are done really well, and the training scenes and just moments with them hanging out enrich them with more emotional depth, further strengthening their motivations. However, some of these defeats that they talk about aren't really fleshed out and, at times, make it hard for me to really care about that particular race that they supposedly lost.With all of that said, the first season of Umamusume was a lot of fun. It was nice watching both Special Week and Suzuka struggle and overcome their hardships to eventually be some of the best horse girls in all of Japan. The light-hearted nature of this show and its characters is balanced out by more serious episodes where the anime really dives deep into the two main leads. Apparently, other seasons have different main leads, so I'm looking forward to seeing how all of that plays out. at the edge of your seat.There are some grievances that I have with this season, however.

And not the good kind.Let me start by saying that I am very biased when it comes to P.A. Works. They are probably my favorite anime studio out there, and everything I have watched of theirs has been enjoyable at worst and masterful at best. Unfortunately, with every good basket of fruit, there’s got to be that one with a worm inside. And this is a huge worm.I understand that this anime was created as a way to make money. Cygames have a lot of sway, and their funding has led to more than a few anime projects being...created over the years. Uma Musume is no different, being based off a mobile game of the same name. I understand the limitations that that provides, and I understand that when making this anime, the writers and designers were likely limited in how much they could flesh things out. But this felt like they were told exactly how to handle it with no freedom at all, and it resulted in quite possibly the worst anime this studio has ever put out.The story of Uma Musume is very simple, but not in a charming way. In fact, you could say that the story finishes after the first episode, because once our protagonist arrives at the academy where she is to be trained to become the “best horse girl” like no one ever was, the story makes nearly no progress. Normally that wouldn’t be an issue if this were a character drama, a slice of life with the intent of hanging on a particular moment in time. But this was trying to tell a story. This was trying to be a moving sports anime about horse girls training and running in races. The world itself is also set up very poorly, failing to explain hardly anything about these “horse girls” and how society functions differently because of them outside of races. However, I blame the majority of the story on the lack of any real characters.While yes, the characters are meant to be the focus here, it seems to me that Cygames made a long (too long) list of characters that all needed to be featured equally. This is normally not an issue when you have time to develop them all properly, but none of the characters received any meaningful development through it’s entire duration. The designs of the characters themselves are interesting in that they are based on real-world race horses, but those references are only skin deep once they start interacting with each other. All of the “bonds” and “friendships” forged along the way feel forced and unbelievable. It’s clear that they were all written only deep enough to give potential players of the game a surface-level attachment to them. By the end of the show, I found the sleazy coach to be the most relatable character, and he was pretty terrible. Not to mention he was the only male in the entire series, not counting audience background characters. Not that I am against all female casts, but in a setting like this, it simply makes no sense. I’m talking about the birds and the bees here. I guess they just spawn from giant gacha machines– I mean they just somehow get born from human mothers.The art is very good, probably the only good thing in this entire show. P.A. Works always deliver on the art front, and it seem that even in a show like this their record holds true. The backgrounds are vibrant, the characters are well animated (minus some of the really awkward running shots), and the colors pop.The sound design is fine. Some of the sound mixing, especially during one particular episode, felt unprofessional and rushed, and the sounds of the crowds often felt far too loud. The music was unremarkable, and while I think the OP and ED song were pretty decent, I feel that the rest of the soundtrack lacked anything memorable.I can’t even say that I’m disappointed. I knew that this was going to be weird going in. But I didn’t expect it to be this shady and gross. The story is a wash, and the characters are complete garbage. While the art is great, it’s wasted here. The best thing that came from this show was funding to go toward future projects.

Wonderful Precure!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/57390/Wonderful_Precure,"['Is Wonderful Precure good?Yes.Is it great for a PreCure  season?well...Don\'t get me wrong I love the show from its characters to its art to its characters Wonderful PreCure is a strong entry in the Pre franchise ...but there are two main thing that need to be addressed .1. Combat or lack there of.What makes PreCure such a unique franchise in the magical girl genre is the combat.The high budget fights with lots of kicking and punching are simply missing in the Wonderful show.That is because in this season they are not fighting villains of the week , but corrupted animals and no one wants...animal violence .That aside the community in my opinion is overreacting . Yeah its sad that we don\'t get to see the girls fight but the battle scenes are for now really well animated and fun to watch and I\'d take that any day over a  season with bad fights (DeliParty)2.The show works really well as a Slice of Life anime.As i said the characters are fun , the jokes are really clever and cute without going into the usual ""Baka neee im a tsundere now ill beat you up ,im so quirky bleh"" humor thats been seen in most animes for the last 15 or so years. But as an action magical girl anime...no not really . This season takes a new approach to the season formula and they don\'t reveal the villains of the show like they have done for the past 20 years...in fact we are 15 episodes in and we don\'t know anything about the villain of this season. I get that its supposed to be a mystery but other than a shadowy figure we have gotten nothing .It makes the main cast look like they are just running around aimlessly which doesn\'t help by the fact that it\'s a pretty silly season as well.overall it is fun to watch and its more enjoyable than a lot of other precure seasons but its got its own bunch of issuesArt:10/10The artstyle is really cute but the colors take the CAKE. Lately weve been seeing precure start using more subtle colors leaving from the really bright and contrasting colors seen with the release of Smile precure that made a chain of seasons that looked like a flashlight but in wonderful precure they managed to make the show look so cheery while using darker colors (and yes some scenes do look bright like the attack and transformation ones but its for 2 minutes not 20)Animation:7/10It could have been and 7.5 but the opening seemed so off at the start i had to take a 0.5 points off. To the average consumer it might look average but we have to remember that they make the episodes in a week ...a week . Again the fights are fun the characters rarely go off model and the cgi ed looks amazing.Character: 8.5/10I don\'t want to spoil anything but the characters are really relatable and fun to watch.My only critique would be that sometimes they don\' take things seriously when they should.Plot:4/10Don\'t get me wrong its really fun but there is a big lack of any direction going on at this point... animal violence .That aside the community in my opinion is overreacting .

Yao Shen Ji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35626/Yao_Shen_Ji,"['Yaoshenji, or Tales of Demons and Gods, is one of those new Chinese anime that I really want to like, but really can\'t bring myself to. As an adaptation of a popular web-novel and manga, it already has really good plot behind it. However, the choices that the animation studio has chosen have severely undercut this massive advantage.One of the most glaring problems is the length of each episode. Episodes are around 7 minutes long on average, but if you consider that the opening and ending animations take up 2 minutes, then you\'re left with just 5 minutes of actual storyline per episode. While this...comes out to about 200 minutes of total animation (around 10 episodes of a normal length anime), it severely limits the amount of information that can be added in a single episode. As such, each episode is only long enough to last exactly one scene or conversation, and it\'s impossible for them to fit in any extra narrative or background into the anime.On the animation side, they\'ve chosen to go with 3d models for everything. While there are good examples of 3d animation, this is just on the borderline. The quality of the models is at the bare minimum acceptable standard, about the same as a video-game. It\'s very apparent that where ever possible, they\'ve tried to reduce the complexity of the models by using textures instead of actual 3d detail. In addition, the quality of the motion of the characters is also sub-par, as there are very few examples where a character walks properly - most characters have stiff expressions or weird kinks in their walking animation that instantly catch your eye. Overall, it feels like they offloaded all the animation into an in-game animation software,such as Source Film Maker. This might be acceptable if they compensated with an increase in the amount of content, but as pointed out earlier, there\'s actually less content than a single season of an anime.On the other hand, it\'s pleasing to see that they\'ve put in effort into working on special effects for the magic systems in the show. While the character animation may be sub-par, the effects associated with magic activation still look fairly good. In addition, it\'s also fun to see then using the obvious kinks in their animation quality to showcase unique character personalities on some of the nameless side characters. This is an amazing addition, as the side characters are no longer bland and identical, but actual people with their own unique (sometimes hilarious) walking styles and expressions.In terms of actual plot, the original story as well as this adaptation both focus on an OP character who was reborn and has a new chance at life. It is honestly fun to see this character, who represents the epitome of the saying ""Knowledge is power"", destroying people\'s expectations of him and coming out on top in clever and hilarious scenarios. However, as is the problem with most adaptations, it\'s very apparent that a lot of that content has to be skipped in order to translate the story onto the screen. This is sadly even more apparent here, where the 5-minute episode length severely restricts the amount of information that can be conveyed to the viewer. Overall, unless the viewer has already read the source materials, they can easily get lost in the terminology, magic and ranking systems introduced in the anime.At the end of the day, I think it\'s a cute adaptation of a very fun web-novel, but leaves me sad about the missed potential that it could have had. comes out to about 200 minutes of total animation (around 10 episodes of a normal length anime), it severely limits the amount of information that can be added in a single episode.

The plot is captivating for my preference and easily made me look pass the flaws of the animation. Unfortunately, the author did not complete his story and has decided to drop it... which is severely depressing it'd take years for me to move on.Animation wise, 7mins episode, this shit is undeserving to the story. 3D animation does look good but not very smooth. Doesn't have unnecessary flashy scenes and keep to the plot, which is something i cannot find in many anime. First few episodes move at a...very slow pace, since 5min playtime each.

The plot is very vague and not well expressed. It's hard to understand why Nie Li lacks soul power as its not even described properly. That's mostly due to poor world building and my lack of knowledge about Taoism. Also, notice how Nie Li is a genius and has only begun to be noticed now.The Art is pretty mediocre...as they have used 3D animation. I tried reading the Manhua and the character sketches were way better. However, its not too bad after around 5 episodes. By the end of the series, I could hardly notice the flaw in animation.The OSTs were actually pretty nice. They have used Guzheng a lot, which I think has a beautiful vibe to it.

It\'s laying under layers of ""unusual"" approaches, but hides amazing deep world and unique story told in a light-hearted comedy with romance style.Layers hiding the gem are:-Art - 3D art is not great, but you can get used to it after a while-Language - don\'t get scared of Chinese language, you will stop noticing it after a few hours/series-7min episodes- I found a source that combined whole seasons in one video (40episodes), it would be pain otherwiseIf you can get over this and the bit childish dialogues/approach, then you get a deep world with solid mechanics. The combination of magic,...alchemy and family branches works very well together. Story is about MC that died after his city got destroyed, but his memories transport few year back to past (younger) himself. MC tries to use this knowledge to strengthen the city before it gets destroyed.I love how all of it fits nicely together. Having memories from ""future got bad"" gives the chance to change it - He exploits his knowledge in magic/business/alchemy/relationships and basically becomes OP. But this brings new challenges like not having enough magic power, or not having a trust of future friend and not knowing how to build it, or meeting new people that he never met in the future,..  This is all presented in light tone with comedy and romance feels, what makes it enjoyable experience.I was very sceptic after I started watching this, but now I am on 4th season and it became one of my most favourite running animes. alchemy and family branches works very well together.

I just hate that format, a good episode length is between 18-25 minutes and nothing happens in 7 minutes...but that's just my personnal taste.2) The animation is really badly done.

More Japanese swords and polearms transformed into either cute or handsome B O I S and their wholesome slice of life type adventures.Getting to the point, if you're a fan of either Touken Ranbu, or just the TR anime, it's a must watch.Art style is pretty generic, but it's still enjoyable to look at, animation is fluid and overall it's doing it's job.Can't seem to recall any music that stood out other than the opening.Moving from the audiovisual stuff, lets talk about the most important aspect of...this series. Characters. If you're looking for psychological anime with a lot of character development and moral questions, you won't find it here. And that's good. Those are really straightforward characters and I need to say, it's hard to dislike any of them, especially if you played the TR game. In this show you will find a lot of lighthearted, heartwarming situations, some small dramas here and there with a lot of comedy thrown into it.Just seeing your favourite swords (or naginatas or yari or whatever) in the action really gives you a big smile on your face.So if you're looking for a wholesome show about really likable male characters, their lifes, interactions between them, struggles and histories, you should give Zoku a go! this series.

While the animation itself is on the cheap side, the...animators knew how make good action with the available tools. Which, again, is nice for a series that is not mainly about the fighting.Character wise I would say It stayed truthful to the source material to the point It was hilarious in my opinion.Music was the same as the art, honestly. Nothing bad, nothing particularly impressive either. Just did the job when It needed to be done. Personally some of the handful scenes where the characters start to sing just because weren't really to my liking since I felt It wouldn't make a huge difference whether or not they were there.Overall this isn't a extremely complex anime and is clearly aimed at fans of the game or people with a certain level of knowledge on the series as well (I compare It to Fate in that sense. Lots of characters), yet is a nice show to pass the time. animators knew how make good action with the available tools.

Artiswitch,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49066/Artiswitch,"['If you want a short, experimental anime that you can watch in one sitting then this is it. It’s stylish with unique visuals and songs, and isn’t afraid to use these to its advantage when tackling its themes. It only gets better and better as it goes with a gradual transition into a darker tone.Artiswitch is ultimately about wishes and their consequences, both good and bad. It’s not the typical “be careful what you wish for,” type moral either. It boils down to what the character themselves wished for in order to be happy, and this is shown through both simple and extreme wishes. It...leaves a lot up to the viewer to decide on, never outright stating the outcome of a wish as being right or wrong. It never comes across as pretentious either, with many of the issues raised being able to be tied back to real-life situations.The CGI might not be for everyone, but it allowed for flexible animation and a number of visually impressive scenes when mixed with varying imagery and backgrounds. You can see the animators really using the CGI to their advantage and it pays off. Each episode brings something new to the visuals, and each one is great in its own way. It isn’t afraid to get experimental, and it pays off brilliantly. There is a decent amount of symbolism, and the visuals aren’t all for show. You can look into any episode and find a number of clever visual tricks that match the thoughts and feelings of each character. The music in each episode is just as great. You should’ve seen my surprise when they had a damn Moe Shop song start playing in episode 4.Overall, Artiswitch far exceeded my expectations. I went in completely blind and by the end of the second episode I was really impressed by everything it offered. Anyone stumbling across this like I did should check it out, at least until the fourth episode. The 8-minute episodes make it easy to consume and it is always straight to the point without ever feeling rushed.8/10 – I would highly recommend watching it at least for the unique experience it offers. leaves a lot up to the viewer to decide on, never outright stating the outcome of a wish as being right or wrong.

The result is a perfect harmony between the story, the characters, the anime, the style and even the viewer, urging us to break-out and long for a version of ourselves that is free and, ultimately, happy.The art is GORGEOUS, making up for the 3d-animation by presenting us with a beautiful journey full of spectacle and colors at every frame. And the soundtrack manages to match not only the anime as a whole, but also the feelings of its characters as they change through the story. Oh, and the costumes are amazing!

Nina is a really interesting character and the fact is that a lot of the time, the people who strive to help others who have been hurt before, the most, have been hurt themselves.The messages in this show are astounding, the visuals are confusing, yet also pretty stunning.

I found the 3d character models on the 2D background to be disorienting. Once I got over that, I found myself really appreciating the distinctive art style. The character models could have been a bit different (the face models seem like they can\'t ever look ""ugly,"" which means some of their expressions are a bit unrealistic) but for what this is, it really worked.Each storyline is unique and it\'s really interesting how each character feels fleshed out within...the tight 6 minutes we get to see them. Artiswitch does an incredible job giving watchers everything they need to know in order to identify with the characters in the very, very brief amount of time they appear on screen.That being said, I almost dropped the show entirely because episode 1 was Haruka\'s story and I just couldn\'t take it seriously. Starting off the show by asking the brave question ""what if woman WANTS to fit into gender aesthetic expectations but doesn\'t feel like she can because she is tall"" is an...interesting choice. The show really saved itself in episode 2 with Mana\'s wish to free herself from these expectations and put herself out there as an alt singer. From there, it only goes up with realistic portrayals of problems people face on a day to day basis, plus the catharsis of breaking free from social expectations or finally coming out of ones shell. Rewatching the series helped me take Haruka a little bit more seriously.My favourite is by FAR Tiara\'s episode. Artiswitch really handles Tiara\'s character well and portrayed a realistic situation that many young queer women experience with their never-actually-dating-but-kind-of-situationship-but-mostly-a-crush person. It\'s an episode that hurts so good.

Aura: Maryuuin Kouga Saigo no Tatakai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14669/Aura__Maryuuin_Kouga_Saigo_no_Tatakai,"['There comes a time when most of us tend to dislike reality. Boring people, normal unending days, and nothing much to do. Then we turn to fiction. We visualize ourselves as someone we\'re not and, in extreme cases, live up to our fantasies.That\'s what Aura\'s story is mainly about. Aura is about a story of former chuunibyou (8th grader syndrome) case who\'s now trying to become a normal person, that is until a faithful encounter with a girl who calls herself as a ""researcher"" searching for dragon terminals. At first, he hesitates on helping her as he doesn\'t want to have a relapse again but...soon finds out that she needs his help.Aura: Maryuuinkouga Saigo no Tatakai is a slice of life story that has a subliminal message. We all know the pain of bullying either as the recipient of it or as a bystander observing the damage done to the bullied. It\'s never beautiful and that\'s what Aura conveys. It shows how people tend to step on other people when they outshine them in certain weird and quirky ways. It is less a comedy show (unlike Chunnibyou demo koi ga shitai) and more of a drama with realistic elements.The art and music of this show is about average and there\'s nothing much to revolve about in the story but the main driving point of the show are the characters. This movie is all about character development. You start off with a doubting protagonist that would end up as a dependable friend for a lot of people. That\'s the norm and this doesn\'t deviate much from it except for the fact that the heroine not depended on him but he changed her. All of the characters can give you the proper emotions. You take pity on those who are being bullied and you get mad at the antagonists. Personally, there was a time I was afraid I\'d punch my monitor because of the rage building up inside me. That\'s how well the characters can pull you into their simple lives, something most shows can\'t do.Overall, the movie is enjoyable. The flow of the story is smooth. Despite the abrupt turn of events in the middle to last scenes, the story progression feels natural and believable. It feels like you\'re seeing real people and not just an animation so kudos to the voice acting staff in that division. You\'re surely bound for a roller coaster of emotions for this piece that would lead you to tears, anger, and smiles. Just try to view this movie with an open mind (Please don\'t try to compare this with Chu-2 since they are both different) and I\'m sure you\'ll enjoy every twist and turn you\'re gonna go through. soon finds out that she needs his help.Aura: Maryuuinkouga Saigo no Tatakai is a slice of life story that has a subliminal message.

So odd and foolish, indeed, did he grow on this subject that he sold many acres of cornland to buy these books of chivalry to read. … [In the end], he so buried himself in his books that he spent the nights reading from twilight till daybreak and the days from dawn till dark; and so...from little sleep and much reading, his brain dried up and he lost his wits.(Don Quixote)On first glance, the Don Quixote is a very clunky tome of a book, with about 800 pages, full of slapstick moments, very unrealistic damsel-in-distress-esque female characters, lengthy and possibly monotonous digressions, and, even with the Modern lauded Edith Grossman translation, still reads like a sack of old bricks. The style of the book, when seen from contemporary times, is very much like Cervantes\' description of the Don and his horse, a thin crooked gentleman on an equally battered mare riding off godspeed into who knows what kind of uncharted territory. The experience of reading the book itself was, to me, partially entertaining, due to the comedy and wit of some of the scenes given that it\'s one of the first books to properly use metafiction; but most of it was a lump of text after text that bored into my skull.Yet classics must not be read in isolation. The Quixote has been called the Spanish Bible, has been lauded by all sorts of writers such as Borges, Kafka, existential philosopher Miguel de Unamuno, the orientalist Simon Leys (who wrote a very very good essay on its importance in the world) and even hated on by Nabokov. A classic is not merely a text by itself but it sucks history itself with it and must also be read within the soup of history itself. What is it exactly that makes this comedy of an old man who becomes a knight in a world where chivalry is dead and gone so edifying and grand?The answer here is in the word \'becomes\'. This quote comes from Simon Leys\' essay:""The occupation which Don Quixote chooses for himself is that of knight errant. He is not under the delusion that he is a knight errant—no, he sets his mind on becoming one. He does not play at being someone else, as children do in their games; he is not pretending to be someone else, like an impostor, or impersonating a character, like an actor on stage. And he adopts the profession of knight after due reflection: it is the result of a deliberate choice. After having considered other options, he finally decided that the career of a knight errant would be the most rewarding, intellectually and morally.But how does one become a knight? Van Doren asks. By acting like a knight—which is the very opposite of pretense, of make-believe. And to act the way Don Quixote does is more than to ape. To imitate as he does is a profound apprenticeship—the true way of learning and the key to understanding. “What is the difference between acting like a great man and being one?” Van Doren asks. “To act like a poet is to write poems; to act like a statesman is to ponder the nature of goodness and justice; to act like a student is to study; to act like a knight is to think and feel like one.”Had Don Quixote been simply and plainly mad, or had he indulged in a protracted game of self-deception and play-acting, we should not be talking of him now, Van Doren observes—“We are talking of him because we suspect that, in the end, he did become a knight.”This is the crux of the Quixote, which is to provide a vision of a man who decided that, with nothing being right with reality, it should be slayed. The dragon in the Quixote is not the windmills, nor is it the giant, but all of life itself, and to be exact Spanish life in the 17th century, full of small little taverns and farmers leading mundane lives. And the most stunning thing of all is that he actually succeeds, in ingraining himself into the view of the reader. Regardless of whether Don Quixote is a good knight or a bad knight, by the end of the story he is still, utmost and completely, a knight.But being a knight is no easy task, especially in a world where knights are dead. Nabokov\'s great gripe with the book is that he found it to be too cruel. ""Hideous cruelty —with or without the author\'s intent— which riddles the whole book and befouls its humor"". The sheer about of blows that fall on the two main characters would probably be enough to cause significant limb and spinal injury to render them both invalids for life. The laughter and exploitation of the Don\'s position, especially in the later part of the book, is the pinnacle of Schadenfreude. But actually what makes the Don is its cruelty. Without cruelty, the Don would not have become, to us, a knight. He would not be a knight because he would have no dragons, and nothing would prevent him from being viewed as merely a play-actor leading a life of luxurious delusion. It is because the Don struggles at any cost that he becomes edifying. Unamuno wrote an entire book arguing that Don Quixote was an existentially real human being, even more so than his creator, who has been lost more or less in the annals of history as a paper patchwork of sources and university historical analyses.Likewise Borges himself wrote a story about a man on a strange task, to write the Don Quixote without actually reading it, by fully assimilating the writer into himself and creating the work exactly as the writer should have done. The surprising thing too is that Pierre Menard succeeds in his quest to write the Don Quixote.It is an interesting observation to make that today\'s world, rather than suffer from an exceeding amount of simulation brought about by media and video game addiction, seems in fact to also suffer from an overload of Reality. Nowadays we live in the shadow of Youtube and quick and easy video devices. There is no bad deed that is not filmed and uploaded out there. There is no embarrassment that has not been captured. We live in a world full of endless depictions of the true disgusting horrors of war, the silliness of broken testicles by people who commit acts of grandiose insanity, religious organizations and fundamentalists being stripped apart as lunatics, and all sorts of miscarriages of justice. Idealism is stark dead because no one can do any vigilantism without having shaky cam footage of some drunk idiot in a suit getting slammed by a beer bottle soberly stripping apart the fantasies of the millions behind computer screens. In some strange way society has hardened itself up against fantasy while equally basking in it. This means that the ideal world and the real world do not mingle like before but are put behind stark bars; an either/or proposition.Without the power of fantasy, some of our greatest exploits would become woefully insignificant, and we wouldn\'t be driven by the mad feelings to stop that bully or confess to that girl or do something to win the favor of the people around us. The sad thing is that now all these fairy moods are recorded down strictly and objectively in places everywhere, where men can all be judged without regard for subjectivity. Its not a bad thing though, since it also means that the grand horrors of Nazi Germany, with its monstrous spilling over of fantasy, has a much much lesser chance of coming to pass. But in the end everything must be done in moderation. An excess of fantasy is just as bad as an excess of reality; by strictly stratifying the two into two separate domains, some which the psychoanalyst Carl Jung was fighting desperately against, human being was divided without being able to become whole.(On a side note here. Tanaka Romeo, who wrote the original Light Novel for Aura, has been considered one of the greatest writers of Visual Novels and Light Novels ever, sometimes even considered as the Shakespeare of the LN/VN industry. His major themes are usually about outcasts and people who are split away from the norm, as well as some critiques launched at social institutions. Sadly from some comments floating out there on the net, it seems his work will never be fully appreciated except in the original language.)In today\'s stratified world, reality and fantasy have both reached their extreme ends. Hard pragmatism and self-interest plagues hordes of politicians and citizens, while the other half are so far off into the realm of delusion that there is almost no referent back to reality, sometimes due to the disproportionate social backlash that results from it. Fantasies are regulated into \'subcultures\', \'phenomena\', \'fashions\', \'fads\', or even worse \'mental disorders\' (I\'m okay with the belief that certain mental symptoms can be \'cured\' just as easily as physical symptoms, but the modern perception of mental disorder, especially among people who don\'t know exactly what it means, is a whole other different matter), and other big labels indicating that these are separate from life itself, based on some tenuous set parameters where fringewalkers can mingle with other fringewalkers without falling into the general \'mainstream\'. The fact is that these are all as much manifestations of Life and Society as the so-called norm. (It may be a result of the political structure that this results. For an interesting viewpoint see Hunter S Thompson\'s brilliant journal on using fringe culture to try and affect politics in Aspen.)But in this world can then anyone be so fully and existentially self-determined to  be \'rationally fantastic\'? That perfect blend of reason and fantasy that has shook many readers to the core ever since the Don Quixote was first created? There are many thinkers and people who have been posited as such, such as Che Guevara, Renzo Novatore, Max Stirner, Jack Kerouac, and other idealists. The stark difference though is that these are merely idealistic are not \'fantasists\' like the Don.Which brings us to Aura. This adaptation of the Tanaka Romeo light novel works by being a whole lot more cruel, and as a result a whole lot more cathartic, than that other famous Kyoani Chuunibyou work out there. Sadly it probably doesn\'t do the original enough justice, and it also suffers from extensive melodrama and too black-and-white a morality. Also none of the characters ever take things to the extent that the Don does, and in the end they still come off as play-acting heroes rather than really  being them. Much of the \'humor\', if this can even be considered the comedy, comes from the insane technolingo that comes out of the main heroine\'s mouth in reaction to completely ordinary situations. The movie has moments, like von Trier\'s Dogville, where you get a cheap satisfaction or feel needlessly enraged because of the stark villainy and the stark heroism. This would probably work better if it had been longer, but yet for what it gives us, it\'s worth a watch. But upon coming to the finale, something amazing happens. Whereas Don Quixote was about the Don\'s madness striving on in spite of the relentless cruelty of the world, what happens at the end of Aura is the opposite, where madness succeeds in infecting reality, and the world transforms into an Expressionistic-Romantic landscape so brilliant and powerful that it becomes a full exaltation of the need for escape in a bitter reality.In any case Aura walks down the road left behind by Cervantes; a critique of stark realism, and in praise of fantasy. from little sleep and much reading, his brain dried up and he lost his wits.(Don Quixote)On first glance, the Don Quixote is a very clunky tome of a book, with about 800 pages, full of slapstick moments, very unrealistic damsel-in-distress-esque female characters, lengthy and possibly monotonous digressions, and, even with the Modern lauded Edith Grossman translation, still reads like a sack of old bricks.

But rather than go into a couple paragraphs about him, all you need to know is that he’s a great director when it comes to comedy and a pretty poor director when it comes to everything else. However, as of late, Kishi’s really hit a new low by taking a really interesting story and slaughtering it with his poor directing. With his half-assed video game adaptations being his biggest felon, it’s no surprise that people have been panning him.Aura’s a different story though. This time, Kishi takes a not-so interesting story and actually brings it to life with pretty...great direction... and it's not a comedy either... it's a drama... (Say whaaaat?)Being a film with only 80 minutes, I believed this shaped Kishi up just a little. There’s no random sidetracking, no rushing to try to get to the meat of the story, no chopping transitioning and none of those odd “gaps” we often see with Kishi’s series. Aura is deliberately paced and the direction is dead on with what it wants to achieve. I might argue that the direction is a little too dead-on; some small breathers to focus in on some smaller moments would have been nice.But overall, Kishi’s directing is great from the beginning to the end of the film and it’s his directing which brings Aura’s generic story to life.There is honestly nothing we haven’t seen before about Aura. It’s a more mature look at what a victim of chuunibyo suffers from, but everything plays out like a typical highshcool bullying story.  There are no twists or turns. Everything can be seen coming from a mile away. Yet the story still works well and it’s not simply due to the directing.First off, the dialogue is certainly well written as there’s this genuine sense of realism in which the main characters speak that many will be able to resonate to.But secondly, the drama is simply well done.I was expecting the drama to either be Kishi’s usual lifeless crap or something along the line of Mari Okada’s overbearingly blown out melodrama. Instead, Aura’s drama falls perfectly in the center. Everything feels natural. Angst and conflicts are perfectly and realistically presented instead of a cheap means to manipulate the viewer's emotion. The drama is sweet, it’s sincere, it’s heartfelt and it’s heartbreaking.Unfortunately, the drama could have been more powerful too. Whether it was simply the writing itself and simply because the film was too short – I take blame with the latter – Aura felt just a little lacking. It takes its generic story much further than most and turns it into something great, but not amazing.  The characters are likeable and easy to sympathize with, but are far from being anything spectacular. Its major themes and the romantic relationship between our lead couple did hit many notes with me but ultimately they don’t feel fully developed to truly became powerful and thus it just misses the mark of being truly remarkable.Because honestly, I found the final scene where the male lead confronts the female lead at the tower of desks to be absolutely brilliant and it would have been more so if we were given just a little more development.Final Verdict:Story – Generic but is brought to life by good directing, unfortunately due to the length of the film the story does not feel fully developedCharacters – Likeable and easy to sympathize with, but like the story, they lack full developmentSetting – A nice theme that would have been stronger with more time to developProduction Values – Far from being outstanding, the artwork and animation are still both pretty. The music, on the other hand, is pretty damn goodDo I recommend?: I was contemplating giving this an anime a 7 or an 8 and while technically speaking, I believe Aura only deserves a 7, I’ve got to take my own personal enjoyment into account with my reviews and give a 8 (yeah, yeah I'm a sucker for this sentimental bullying kind of stuff). Regardless, I’d recommend to give Aura a try. It’s short and sweet, and while not as profound as it could have been, Aura still tugs lightly at the heart strings and it sure left me with a big smile on my face after the film finished. great direction... and it's not a comedy either... it's a drama... (Say whaaaat?)Being a film with only 80 minutes, I believed this shaped Kishi up just a little.

That could explain some stuff more clearly. Instead he got...beaten by his parents for having an imaginary girl friend.

I watched the anime like a week after I added it to my ""Plan to watch"" list, so I had completely forgotten what it\'s about, and that helped to greatly enhance my experience. I was hooked ever since the first minute. Afterwards I was a bit lost in the story, mainly because I kept wondering what is real and what is not. Not to mention my utter confusion as to how the beginning of the...anime connects to the rest of the story. At the end, when all the puzzle pieces were finally put together, the message of the anime hit me so hard that I cried A LOT. I can honestly say I relate to this anime on a personal level.

The bullying was shown in such a raw and impactful way that it can easily beat other anime movies such as ""A silent voice"".', ""I suppose the closest title you could compare Aura to would be Love, Chuunibyo and Other Delusions in that both explore a male lead trying to move on from his middle school days as a chuunibyo and encountering a girl his age undergoing the same delusions of grandeur that he went through in middle school. Unlike the mentioned TV anime that is more light-hearted and comical in its focus on Yuuta and Rikka, Aura explores the chuunibyo issue in a more realistic bent as Ryoko and other chuunibyo like her in their school are social outcasts who face frequent bouts of bullying. Ichiro's past as...a chuunibyo in middle school is a dramatic one full of similar issues as Ryoko's as he tries fitting in with others while getting dumped with the task of looking after Ryoko as she goes through her delusions as a chuunibyo. Throughout the movie, Ichiro finds himself conflicted with how to handle Ryoko as his attempts to protect her from bullying lead him to face pressure from both the chuunibyo seeking his support and the normal crowds wanting him to butt out of their hazing on the chuunibyo students. This drives the developing relationship he has with Ryoko throughout the movie which does come off as a natural one thanks to the gradual changes that both their characters undergo.Aura is not without its faults though. The climax to it borders a bit on the absurd and pushes believability quite a bit with how one of the major characters in the film could set it up, as well as the visuals to Aura looking more on par in quality with a TV anime than a movie. But perhaps the biggest issue I took with Aura had to do with how it addresses its chuunibyo issue. While more realistic in exploring the issue, the film suffers the same fate as Love, Chuunibyo and Other Delusions in that it chickens out with how to resolve the chuunibyo issue and the moral it pushes with conformity and regarding more unique traits as a bother may not sit well with Western viewers since the Japanese culture mostly values group over individual social dynamics.While I did have interest in the more realistic direction that Aura addresses the chuunibyo issue, it still suffers in lacking a satisfying resolution to the situation and having a rather ridiculous climax with Ichiro and Ryoko's situation. The film as a whole is still mostly enjoyable for the character development and chemistry between our two leads, but the finale of the film will not be one to satisfy everyone. a chuunibyo in middle school is a dramatic one full of similar issues as Ryoko's as he tries fitting in with others while getting dumped with the task of looking after Ryoko as she goes through her delusions as a chuunibyo.

The superpower idea is there, but it won't bother those who don't like the genre, and those who do will have it just with a bit of imagination. I don’t think this should be catalogued as comedy like MAL put it, that I noticed very few moments were intended to make you laugh and it is mostly drama, dissembled or...clear.In cases of bullying there are mainly two types of people in relation to the ones that are harassed: people who don't care or don't involve in fear of becoming bullied themselves, and people who help those in need in compliance with the consequences.The main character in this story is the second type, nonetheless he is still influenced by the thoughts and actions of others on him, changing his exterior facade through the story. Hiding one’s inner self and confronting others if it comes out is something that gets a lot of importance in the movie.For these reasons Ichirou Satou's evolution is one of the reasons for which this plot is interesting to follow. The other is the main protagonist Ryouko Satou. She's a strange girl who (apparently) nothing affects, and she clashes into Ichirou's gloomy world changing the uninteresting way of life he had had for months. Though from a hostile and outsider point of view they would seem completely different (an ordinary student and a freak) the plot unveils they have much in common apart from their surnames (to avoid confusion I will refer to them with their first name).Ryouko’s difference with the rest of the world is also shown in the animation: her eyes are brighter and warmer than anyone else’s and her hair shines more. In some scenes you can notice a change of light (a park of brighter greens in comparison to the greys around it, or the sun’s orange light in the darkness), but most of the film is presented in shadowy, opaque colours. The school is one of the (scarce) scenarios where this is most obvious, and (excluding Ryouko with her notorious attire) everyone there is coloured in the same muted tones. Characters are drawn with simple traces, becoming the eyes more detailed in close shots (as usual) but though I think the design to be pretty and I do not consider the choice of colours as inadequate for the film, the animation’s cleanliness fails when faces portray strong emotions. In some scenes I guess angry or anxious people were intended to have a crazy gaze, but in others this is exaggerated or the features seem just badly drawn during sudden changes of positions. Fortunately, this happens mostly in the beginning and when the film is reaching its end we are granted with beautiful and carefully drawn shots.About sound, some of the soundtrack might seem typical, but the OST has some nice pieces and it almost always fits the image well, concluding the film with a song adequate for the mood. I think voice actors did a good job (especially Nobunaga Shimazaki as Ichirou), displaying all the different and numerous moods these characters show. During the movie also a couple out-of-place fanservice moments appear, but as they are short and unusual scenes they don’t influence the story’s style.Story: 8Art: 6.9Sound: 7.5Character: 8.6Enjoyment: 8.3Overall: 7.86Overall, this might not be a film at its highest referring to technical, but it’s the emotional part what makes you like it.

Thanks for reading."", 'Warning: spoilers aheadIt was about a month ago I watched this movie. I saw people comparing it to Chuunibyou, which I love, so I thought “oh this is going to be great”. Well, I was right, though not in the way I thought. See, Aura takes the idea of chuunibyou, but instead of making it lighthearted and comedic, it puts a darker spin on it. It’s much more dramatic than Chuunibyou was, which was refreshing. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an anime that actually took the 8th grade syndrome elements with any amount of sincerity. Off the top of my head, the anime I’ve...seen chuunibyou in is OreImo, Haganai, Sabagebu, and, of course, Chuunibyou. There’s probably more I’m forgetting. However, not a single one of them took it seriously. And that’s what sets this apart from the others.Story: 9.5/10The story of Aura is very focused. Maybe because it’s a movie with a limited amount of time, or maybe because of the writing, or some other completely different reason, it has direction. Without spoiling too much, it takes the idea of chuunibyou and asks “what if society was less accepting of this”. There’s a huge stigma against people like Ryouko and Ichirou. Ichirou has learned this and conformed to the standards, but Ryouko hasn’t. The bullying scene(s) really worked well for drama. They felt natural, realistic. It felt like something that would really happen, maybe because I’ve seen the same thing happen at my middle school.Now I’m going to talk about the ending, so stop reading if you haven’t seen it and don’t want to be spoiled. So basically Takanashi Rikka builds this huge contraption out of school desks on top of the roof. How she managed to do that is beyond me, and I wish they’d addressed that, but it wasn’t enough to ruin it for me. She basically says that in order to complete the incantation, she need to kill herself. It’s at this point that you realize just how obsessed she is. Throughout the whole movie it just felt like a game of hers. But now that she’s actually ready to jump off the school roof in order to complete the incantation you realize that oh shit she is way too into this. It was an awesome setup. Maybe it’s just me and my love of tragic endings, but I feel like the ending would have been been better if she’d actually gone off the edge. It would have at least been much more dramatic and in line with the tone of the rest of the movie. The happy ending felt like it kinda came out of nowhere, and the sad ending would have just worked more naturally. Regardless, the story was amazing.Characters: 9/10Our main characters, Ryouko and Ichirou, are the two most fleshed out characters in the movie. Ichirou is a former chuunibyou whose delusions drove his family apart. He henceforth decided to never be a chuunibyou or associate with them. This is fine as a character motivation, although the idea that his parents actually beat him because of his delusions is kinda bullshit. Ryouko is just fuckin crazy. At first she seems like a “normal” chuunibyou girl, but as time goes on you realize she’s reeeeally into this shit. She’s a very interesting character, and her relations to the bullying are realistic and believable. The bullies are really the only characters I had any issue with. They’re almost as two dimensional and evil as the bullies from Elfen Lied. I get that they weren’t supposed to be deep, fleshed out characters since they’re pretty much just plot devices, but still… they weren’t sympathetic at all. They felt inhuman, and even plot devices should feel a little bit human. At least in my opinion they should.Art: 9/10The art was really good. It looked beautiful and the coloration fit the mood very well. The final scene on the rooftop stands out in particular. The orange color added a mystical, final feeling to it. I loved the character design of Ryouko, even if she did look and feel like a carbon copy of Takanashi Rikka, as well as the costume she was always wearing. I have a soft spot for cool looking clothing.Sound: 9/10This series knew how to set the mood with music. I am once again going to refer to the ending scene with them on the roof. The music used adds to the drama really well, building up to a climax at the same pace as the events. However, none of it really stood out as something I’d listen to again and again. There wasn’t any music that I’d listen to and say “ah, that’s Aura music”.Overall, I think Aura is a really well done movie. In the time they had, they managed to tell a believable, realistic story about delusions and the effect it can have on your social life. The characters were sympathetic (well, the characters who weren’t the bullies that is) and the art was stunning. This movie is worth a watch, especially since it isn’t very long. seen chuunibyou in is OreImo, Haganai, Sabagebu, and, of course, Chuunibyou. There’s probably more I’m forgetting.

Maybe it’s just me and my love of tragic endings, but I feel like the ending would have been been better if she’d actually gone off the edge. It would have at least been much more dramatic and in line with the tone of the rest of the movie. The happy ending felt like it kinda came out of nowhere, and the sad ending would have just worked more naturally. Regardless, the story was amazing.Characters: 9/10Our main characters, Ryouko and Ichirou, are the two most fleshed out characters in the movie. Ichirou is a former chuunibyou whose delusions drove his family apart. He henceforth decided to never be a chuunibyou or associate with them. This is fine as a character motivation, although the idea that his parents actually beat him because of his delusions is kinda bullshit. Ryouko is just fuckin crazy. At first she seems like a “normal” chuunibyou girl, but as time goes on you realize she’s reeeeally into this shit. She’s a very interesting character, and her relations to the bullying are realistic and believable. The bullies are really the only characters I had any issue with. They’re almost as two dimensional and evil as the bullies from Elfen Lied. I get that they weren’t supposed to be deep, fleshed out characters since they’re pretty much just plot devices, but still… they weren’t sympathetic at all. They felt inhuman, and even plot devices should feel a little bit human. At least in my opinion they should.Art: 9/10The art was really good. It looked beautiful and the coloration fit the mood very well. The final scene on the rooftop stands out in particular. The orange color added a mystical, final feeling to it. I loved the character design of Ryouko, even if she did look and feel like a carbon copy of Takanashi Rikka, as well as the costume she was always wearing. I have a soft spot for cool looking clothing.Sound: 9/10This series knew how to set the mood with music. I am once again going to refer to the ending scene with them on the roof. The music used adds to the drama really well, building up to a climax at the same pace as the events. However, none of it really stood out as something I’d listen to again and again. There wasn’t any music that I’d listen to and say “ah, that’s Aura music”.Overall, I think Aura is a really well done movie. In the time they had, they managed to tell a believable, realistic story about delusions and the effect it can have on your social life. The characters were sympathetic (well, the characters who weren’t the bullies that is) and the art was stunning. This movie is worth a watch, especially since it isn’t very long.', ""I knew going into this that the movie was primarily about bullying, but it ended up being even more depressing than I expected. A Silent Voice did a great job of building that theme into a rich and well-developed story. Aura, unfortunately, just spends most of its short run-time beating us over the head with one miserable act of bullying after another. Every time I thought the story had hit its low point and was about to move forward, it just kept coming in with one low blow after another. When it did eventually move on to the climax, the resolution wasn't as cathartic as...it could have been, and left some conflicts unresolved by the time the credits rolled. This was amended somewhat by mid-credits and post-credits epilogue scenes, but these flip-flop the ending back and forth to the point where it gets its messages muddled. It almost feels like it gave us the endings from two or three conflicting routes of a game, and consequently I have no idea what point it was actually trying to make. it could have been, and left some conflicts unresolved by the time the credits rolled.

No wonder i am so in love with this movie, not only cause her sound, her personality through Ryouko really get me into this show. The story premises keep simple until the end. No complex plot appear, just another bullying problem attach as a classical building. Then, what is the best, is the MC really gotten his self onto the knight. This is rather different by such a typical romance story appear with no good performance. Yet, this show proves how incredible its school was. Another perfect plan to show how good the story is.With that all, no...matter what people thought, no matter how people underestimate this, but my mind still clear. This is the best movie with simple premises, and such a nice ending i ever seen. The balance between real world and the fantasy one must be a great reason for me to actually thinking how good this movie was. No other choice. My point still relevant. Yet, another rant gone by some shitty people, so i shall be compromised their attitude.Keeping the story still simple, while in another side the character itself feel complex seems to be a great challenge.

However, as simple as before, the MC actually realise his bad decision, and saved my girl from her dead.

The happy ending, i love how mad sister Ichirou had there, im laughing when i know that shit. After that, ofc the last kissing between those twos shall be my reference how hot they are (i may say again, that scene as a twice kissing scenes, right? Now Ichirou can not ignore the feelings). And after credit scene with Ryouko casual cute uniform, and all going complete as HanaKana lovable sounds loaded my ears with so much feeling (yes Ryouko, you are now normal, my girl). All my dream just come to the truth. This is really good, no other words can describing what i feel right now!Again, all good thing must come to an end.

Now in high school, he strives to be a normal student. His teacher is aware of his past and uses him to help with another student a girl named Ryouko who has a similar case of delusions.This plot gives us a lot to work with.

While it delves into the emotional aspects of adolescent escapism, the generic and cutesy art designs detract from its intended depth. The story touches on important themes but falls short in execution, leaving some scenes feeling forced and lacking impact. The characters\' journeys are relatable, but the overall presentation may come across as pandering to a specific audience seeking waifu tropes.The climax of Aura: Koga Maryuin\'s Last War is unfortunately marred by unrealistic, corny, and cringeworthy moments. As the narrative reaches its peak, the execution...falls flat, relying on over-the-top melodrama that feels forced and out of place. The attempts at emotional impact come across as exaggerated and lacking authenticity, undermining the intended depth of the story. It\'s a disappointing culmination that leaves a sour taste and fails to deliver a satisfying resolution.Despite its commendable effort to explore adolescence, Aura fails to deliver a truly compelling and engaging experience. Overall, the anime fails to deliver a compelling and cohesive narrative, making it a regrettable choice for anyone looking for a worthwhile watch. falls flat, relying on over-the-top melodrama that feels forced and out of place.

You most likely came into the movie expecting a generic magic world type anime and got hit with something completely different, however in my opinion the story and setting of the anime is much better compared to a generic fantasy power type anime and the surprise subverting all your expectations actually enhances the overall experience of the show.(P.S. I was made aware that many people recently gravitating...to this movie were brought to it via tiktok but since I don\'t use the app as I enjoy keeping my braincells intact I have no way of confirming if this show is really that popular on the app)Plot: The anime mainly focuses on two concepts bullying and Chuunibyou or the eighth grade syndrome, a term presented to us on many other anime, which is basically when a teenager is trying desperately to stand out which usually happens through delusions of greatness where they typically pretend or believe they have secret powers and different backgrounds; basically they live cosplaying shounen anime MC\'s.  Our main character in ""Aura: Maryuuin Kouga Saigo no Tatakai"" is Ichirou Satou and the anime hints several time that he was a Chuunibyou during middle school and was bullied because of it and therefore changed and tried to be and act like a typical teen once he got to high school. One day he forgets his notebook at school and decides (for some weird totally not believable reason) to INVADE his school just to get the notebook back and found a strange girl in a weird costume talking about dragons and alternative universes, he decides to follow the girl and spend some time with her showing us he still has his Chuunibyou side but is just suppressing it due to trauma. We later come to find out that the girl is merely a classmate of Ichirou Satou that is at her Chuunibyou peak where she would even go to school in cosplay, miss whole week\'s of classes and constantly talk to classmates and teachers in character. The main character ends up befriending the girl at the request of their teacher and the story progresses from there with some interesting and heavy plot lines and twists. The story\'s main concept and the character development are great and I loved it but when you look objectively at the movie you will find many flaws in the details and execution of the show, some might try and argue that a movie is not enough to cover all basis but there are many anime movies that do so and if a movie is not enough than this title should\'ve simply been done in an episode format.Art: This part has nothing much to talk about as the animation is painfully average by it\'s release date and below average by todays standards. the anime aired in 2013 which is not that long ago and with it being a movie I expected some better animation, with this said the animation is not bad in a way that would affect your enjoyment of the show. The character designs were interesting to see as they resemble a more early 2000\'s type style like ""Code Geass"" and other anime of the time.Sound: With this anime being a stand alone movie it doesn\'t have your typical opening and ending songs that can greatly enhance your appreciation for the title but it did have an OST song play during a key moment of the show that really enhanced the scene in a special way making you feel much more immersed and connected to what was being portrayed; this OST is a very slow and mellow, borderline depressing song so I am not so sure about it\'s replay value outside of the anime on a playlist of some sort but it was definitely a really well thought out pick.Characters: As a Romance Drama show it\'s main focus is obviously the characters, their development and relations. Ichirou Satou our main character is in my opinion the best written character in the show with  Ryouko Satou (the girl in cosplay) being a close second, however sadly besides these two all other characters are either extremely bland or they seem to be heading for some growth and then just die out as background characters. Ryouko Satou is a girl who isn\'t happy with her ordinary self and her monotonous day to day so she decides to be as different as possible from others to try and escape reality to a fantasy scenario, this starts off as a simple quirk but after some events through the story reality starts to catch up to her and her true depth as a character is shown tackling some heavy topics, but more than a good character I see Ryoko as a mere vessel for the anime to portray this very uncomfortable but relatable theme to the viewers in the form of a cute waifu. On the other hand, Ichirou Satou, As I previously mentioned is someone who was just like Ryoko before but got bullied out of it and as the story progresses he starts seeing himself in Ryoko and seeing history repeat itself through her; with this he starts to have internal struggles where he wants to distance himself from her and specifically that world of fantasy but he also wishes to help her and take care of her so that she doesn\'t have to suffer the same way she did. Even with this absolutely amazing duo as main characters the previously mentioned lackluster side cast makes it so this anime mainly becomes wasted potential with the teacher presented as a puppet master pulling the strings behind everything but basically never mentioned again after the first half of the episode, the antagonists of the show have zero development and do not give any reasons for their actions making it look like they were simply there to lazily push plot; another character that personally bothered me was Shinako Kobato which is presented as being a character in the antagonists group who later joins the main group and is ultimately forgotten in the show making her character a completely useless piece in the anime.Overall: I think based on the rating I decided to give to this title and with the hints I\'ve been giving throughout this review (if you read it all), you can guess my feelings towards this anime. The show is a massive waste of potential as the premise of the story and it\'s main characters had the potential to make a top-tier Romance/Drama show comparing to some of the big shows withing these types and if this anime had some better execution, better development and focus on secondary characters and less inconsistencies or absurd moments (like when our mc decides to casually invade his school to get a notebook he could get the next morning via legal methods) I would give it a 9/10 or more. Sadly all of this isn\'t true so this anime can\'t go higher than a 6/10 for me.SPOILER WARNINGP.S. I didn\'t want to go heavily into this as it would be hard to do so while not spoiling but the most absurd moment was Ryoko finding that outrageous amount of tables and  being able to setup that whole castle without anybody (in a school during school day)noticing it before it was finished. to this movie were brought to it via tiktok but since I don\'t use the app as I enjoy keeping my braincells intact I have no way of confirming if this show is really that popular on the app)Plot: The anime mainly focuses on two concepts bullying and Chuunibyou or the eighth grade syndrome, a term presented to us on many other anime, which is basically when a teenager is trying desperately to stand out which usually happens through delusions of greatness where they typically pretend or believe they have secret powers and different backgrounds; basically they live cosplaying shounen anime MC\'s.

I've never been so wrong, it had nothing to do with the premice I builded up myself.

Oftenly related to magical stuff.That action is obviously considered to be a weird habit to have, especially if done by someone that\'s not fit with their age. The said female character, Ryouko, then meets the main male character, Ichirou, by...accident. Their journey begins after the encounter.Now, let\'s get to the reviewStory: 4/10As I explained as an opening before, this movie tells a story centered on the female character that\'s in a state of chunibyo, Ryouko, and the ""normal"" male character, Ichirou. The movie starts off with a comedic and kind of cutesy approach for it\'s character introduction. Giving the audience an expectation that it would tell a heartwarming story. While it\'s true, the drama here is actually pretty heavy. After giving the audience a nice and calm introduction, the movie took a sudden turn with it\'s overly dramatic complication on the center of the movie\'s runtime. The drama is heavily focused on a horrible practice done by a bunch of students, which is bullying, targeted at Ryouko.The sudden turn came in rather unexpected, in a bad way. It feels like a forced drama because there is no actual explanation for the bully to take those horrible action targeted to Ryouko. There\'s also this unexplained action taken by the said bullies to threaten Ichirou not to help Ryouko dealing with the bullies. Though the overly dramatic part of the movie might sets off the mood of the audience, the last part might bring back the audience\'s mood because of it\'s cute and heartwarming approach. Even so, the last part also came in with a flaw. A confusing act done by the main characters that are somewhat deviated with what they have experienced before.While i know it\'s supposed to tell a philosophical story, it\'s just that the movie didn\'t explains much with how and why these things on the screen happening.Art & Animation: 7/10Nothing special with the overall art quality the movie gives. It looks like the overall quality is coming from a TV series as it just looks plain, but i guess we could look past that because it still looks nice. There\'s a scene with a detailed touch on the characters face, nicely pictures what reaction/expression the characters are having on some scenes. The animation is smooth and stable throughout the movie.Sound: 8/10Now, this category might be the one that the movie did best, especially the voice acting. The voice acting for almost every character here sounds natural. Their screams could even make some goosebumps, you could feel what the characters feels from their crying scenes, and there\'s a scene where a certain character talking with a calm tone which could make you feel sad and relaxed at the same time. The music is okay. The choices of the music placed on an important scene is good enough to set the mood for the audience. The sfx here is good. If you decided to watch this with a headphone on, you could even feel like you\'re in the movie because of the nice atmosphere the sfx gives.Character: 6/10As i mentioned before, the main characters of the movie are Ryouko and Ichirou. While being the main character of the story, the movie didn\'t give out much info and/or backgrounds of the main characters. It forcefully shoves up their backgrounds in the middle of the overly dramatic sequence of the movie, and didn\'t explains or even shows it properly. Making the audience confused with the overall actions taken by Ryouko and Ichirou when dealing with their problems. Even so, Ryouko and Ichirou\'s journey dealing with all the drama they experienced throughout the movies and their relationship development could make the audience cares about them and interested to watch their journey on the movie. The other characters though? Seems like they exist only to be a plot device. Not enough screentime to make the audience at least lay an eye on them. The side character\'s action is also did not explained clearly. There\'s a scene where one of the bully is confused with what is happening, and why their action became a bullying act, then in the next scene, they willingly bullies Ryouko just because of self satisfaction. Again, no clear and proper explanations.Enjoyment: 8/10I watched this movie with an expectation of it being a fantasy+action+romance anime, what i got is something unexpected that i didn\'t know i somewhat needed. It\'s a cute movie with a big turn of tone in the middle then ends with a nice and heartwarming moment. It\'s a pretty good movie to watch overall even though there\'s a lot of downs from the movie.Overall: 6.6 -> 7: Good accident. Their journey begins after the encounter.Now, let\'s get to the reviewStory: 4/10As I explained as an opening before, this movie tells a story centered on the female character that\'s in a state of chunibyo, Ryouko, and the ""normal"" male character, Ichirou. The movie starts off with a comedic and kind of cutesy approach for it\'s character introduction. Giving the audience an expectation that it would tell a heartwarming story. While it\'s true, the drama here is actually pretty heavy. After giving the audience a nice and calm introduction, the movie took a sudden turn with it\'s overly dramatic complication on the center of the movie\'s runtime. The drama is heavily focused on a horrible practice done by a bunch of students, which is bullying, targeted at Ryouko.The sudden turn came in rather unexpected, in a bad way. It feels like a forced drama because there is no actual explanation for the bully to take those horrible action targeted to Ryouko. There\'s also this unexplained action taken by the said bullies to threaten Ichirou not to help Ryouko dealing with the bullies. Though the overly dramatic part of the movie might sets off the mood of the audience, the last part might bring back the audience\'s mood because of it\'s cute and heartwarming approach. Even so, the last part also came in with a flaw. A confusing act done by the main characters that are somewhat deviated with what they have experienced before.While i know it\'s supposed to tell a philosophical story, it\'s just that the movie didn\'t explains much with how and why these things on the screen happening.Art & Animation: 7/10Nothing special with the overall art quality the movie gives. It looks like the overall quality is coming from a TV series as it just looks plain, but i guess we could look past that because it still looks nice. There\'s a scene with a detailed touch on the characters face, nicely pictures what reaction/expression the characters are having on some scenes. The animation is smooth and stable throughout the movie.Sound: 8/10Now, this category might be the one that the movie did best, especially the voice acting. The voice acting for almost every character here sounds natural. Their screams could even make some goosebumps, you could feel what the characters feels from their crying scenes, and there\'s a scene where a certain character talking with a calm tone which could make you feel sad and relaxed at the same time. The music is okay. The choices of the music placed on an important scene is good enough to set the mood for the audience. The sfx here is good. If you decided to watch this with a headphone on, you could even feel like you\'re in the movie because of the nice atmosphere the sfx gives.Character: 6/10As i mentioned before, the main characters of the movie are Ryouko and Ichirou. While being the main character of the story, the movie didn\'t give out much info and/or backgrounds of the main characters. It forcefully shoves up their backgrounds in the middle of the overly dramatic sequence of the movie, and didn\'t explains or even shows it properly.

Dogs: Bullets & Carnage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5593/Dogs__Bullets___Carnage,"[""This short, four-episode OAV corresponds to the DOGS prelude, Stray dogs howling in the dark (I have no idea why MAL has it labeled as BULLETS&CARNAGE, because that's not what this is), but while it captures the sequence of events well enough, it fails to communicate the oddly charming harshness and raw energy of the manga.STORY - The story for the first volume of DOGS has always been a little loose and haphazard; each of the four sections focuses on a different character, and the lot of them are strung together almost forcibly as their individual stories don’t necessarily mesh meaningfully with the others around...them. The manga’s presentation did manage to find some kind of connecting thread between the four though, and each story also worked well enough as a standalone chapter. Unfortunately, while the OAV preserves the presentation order of the characters, each episode felt incredibly disjointed from the rest — actually, they felt disjointed in and of themselves as well, though I’m not exactly sure why that is.Strangely enough, even at fifteen minutes a piece, the pacing in each episode isn’t noticeably rushed. It feels pretty scene-for-scene for the most part, but in the end, you really feel like you’re missing something. Was the story really so short and inconsequential? So… uninteresting? There is a lot of action — gunfights, swordfights, wild chases — and the action is highly entertaining and fun to watch, but the story beyond the action is sorely lacking.Mihai is a retired assassin called back to his past, but the episode skips along too quickly for you to endear yourself to the character and the events that unfold are less emotional as a result. Badou collects information to sell and finds himself tangled up in a mob boss’s unfortunate business. As his section was always the most comedic of the bunch because of its sheer absurdity, the OAV counterpart didn’t suffer as much, but the humor did seem cheaper somehow in animated form. Naoto was raised with only hatred and revenge on her mind, but her narration in the anime flattened the story and I found it more difficult to sympathize. Lastly, Heine saves a genetically modified girl and confronts the haunting fringes of his own past in the process. Though his section is the one that explains the least, it’s also the one that’s most relevant to the on-going series. But Heine’s episode was surely the choppiest, and instead of exciting the viewer towards a continuing story, it seems to end on a note re-emphasizing its own precariousness.Sure, DOGS’s strength never really lay in its amazingly thoughtful or unique story; indeed, the prelude does little more than introduce some characters’ pasts and other characters’ current lives, laying the groundwork for something bigger. But as I’m not left excited about the potential or possibility of more in this anime, DOGS has thus been reduced to a mindless hour of action with no beginning or end.CHARACTER - Like the story, given the near-exactness of the presentation, I’m not quite sure why none of the characters have the charm they do in the manga, and I can’t say for sure whether my distaste is just because I was disappointed overall with this production. Perhaps the shortness of each episode has something to do with it after all — even if the sequence of events is the same, you watch through the episode faster than you would read through the chapters and you thus don’t have as much time to really care about the characters; you are less inclined to pause and rewatch the seconds of intriguing footage than you are to pause and reread a few interesting panels or pages. Mihai is an older man with a sad past. So what? Badou is a good-for-nothing with an amusing tobacco addiction. So what? Naoto is a young woman with a sad past. So what? Heine is a mysterious freak. So what?Sure, all of these characters still have the potential to be interesting, just like their manga selves, but that potential is less obvious this time around, and I was easily bored.ARTSTYLE & ANIMATION – Shirow Miwa’s art is gorgeous — his energetic character designs, incredible action sequences, and highly detailed environments are together the greatest strength of the manga; I can forgive the somewhat plain story and slowly-developing characters just because I can look at that art. As such, I spent many months worried about how all that style and detail would translate into animation. I wanted to be optimistic, but it seems that optimism was ill-placed after all. (Figures, right?)It’s a given that much of Miwa’s careful detail will have to be sacrificed in animation, but DOGS was a much lower budget production that I would have imagined. For almost all long to mid-range shots, characters are drawn in a lazy, oddly elongated manner; their facial expressions are a joke. Most action scenes move along too quickly for this to be noticeable, but as soon as it slows down, it gets embarrassing. Close-ups are crisper, but really don’t fare that much better, especially for Heine and Badou, who appear strangely generic and without any of the attitude found in their manga counterparts. For them, animators really don’t seem to have bothered too much in capturing Miwa’s style and only replicated the most basic aspects of his character designs. Mihai and Naoto are less of a dramatic departure, but that may be because both designs are less unique to begin with.Thankfully, many of the backgrounds are actually pretty all right. The cityscapes are still vast and grungy, and many shots are still taken from all sorts of interesting angles. Still, they’re not amazing by any stretch.MUSIC - The little opening theme, if you can call it that, is endearing at first — a little reminiscent of the jazz tunes of Cowboy Bebop or Baccano!, which would be appropriate enough with all the action in DOGS. But considering the rather serious and depressing themes of three out of four stories, the upbeat and cheerful melody quickly feels inappropriate. The rest of the soundtrack for the series is incredibly negligible. Many scenes are simply silent with most of the music accumulating in the action sequences, but there’s nothing really memorable.VOICE ACTING – The OAV uses the same cast as the drama CDs, which I thoroughly enjoyed. A few fans have criticized the use of “brand name” voice actors like Akira Ishida and Takahiro Sakurai but I think both do a fantastic job as Badou and Heine respectively. They give some much needed emotion to the characters when the animation fails utterly, and both depart significantly from their previous voices so even though I’ve heard Ishida and Sakurai’s voices many times before, hearing them here doesn’t invoke thoughts of their other roles. I also really like Akio Ohtsuka as Mihai; though the actual acting isn’t nearly as impressive as the former two, the voice suits the character very well. Naoto I find to be the least impressive, but that could be a mixture of my indifference towards the character and the generic narration she gave for most of her episode. Also, I think it’s worth noting Toshihiko Seki as Bishop, the blind priest, who has some hilariously delivered one-liners.OVERALL - The DOGS OAV has been a huge disappointment for me, though in retrospect, I’m not sure why I had such high expectations. Still, aside from the poor technical aspects (mostly terrible animation and lackluster music), most of this anime’s drawbacks are uniquely difficult to pinpoint. The story and characters are almost exactly as they were in the manga, so why do they feel so different? For the first time, I theorize that DOGS might just work better as a comic and the anime only serves to overemphasize the weaknesses that were already present in the source. Though the same events are covered, the anime does feel strangely rushed, the most important consequence of which is that you don’t feel very attached to the characters. It isn’t as intimate, and without that connection to the characters, much of the interest and potential is lost — unfortunate, as the potential is what I found most appealing about the DOGS manga… along with the art. That Miwa’s art was bastardized as much as it was undoubtedly adds a bit of bitterness on my part.So if you’re a fan of the manga, you’ll likely be disappointed. If you’re not, you’ll likely be indifferent — enjoy the action scenes for what they’re worth and then forget about it because it wasn’t actually that interesting. them.

If you’re not, you’ll likely be indifferent — enjoy the action scenes for what they’re worth and then forget about it because it wasn’t actually that interesting."", '""Fuck up. Gentlemen""First of all, let me point out I am a huge fan of the Dogs manga, originally I never intended to watch the OVA\'s because I had heard that they were a very disappointing adaptation of the manga. I decided to give them a watch because of the more recent chapters of Dogs: Bullets and Carnage that I had been reading and wondered how it would be if it was actually animated, so it was with some trepidation that I watched the OVA\'s.Secondly, this is not an adaptation of Bullets and Carnage, so anyone coming here expecting to see that will just have...to do with watching the original manga play out being animated.Thirdly, it\'s very disappointing.Dogs doesn\'t seem to work as an anime, I can\'t describe why it doesn\'t work, it just doesn\'t. If you want to understand what I\'m getting at go and read the manga then watch the OVA\'s, you\'ll soon realise what I mean.Now I\'ll be honest, Dogs story was never one of its biggest strengths, however in the manga it was enjoyable, it was entertaining, and at times it was downright funny. But the manga\'s storyline doesn\'t translate well onto the screen and it becomes all too obvious what the weaknesses with the storyline were. If there\'s one thing that\'s frustrating about Bullets and Carnage, it\'s that it tries to present the storylines for each character as separate entities, without really taking notice of the character interactions, as such the story feels more disjointed and broken up than the sort of one shot chapters that actually spawned it.Another issue is that some of the humour is lost, this is more prevalent in Badou\'s chapter than anyone else\'s, his most memorable scenes in the manga are again, a victim of not translating well and his episode in the anime (in my opinion anyway) suffers more than anyone else\'s in the story.The art in Dogs was always the selling point of the manga, it looked gorgeous, and the action scenes were very intense, in the anime though, the quality has dropped considerably. The character models by Kumi Ishii do at least resemble the characters in the manga but most of the time they look awkward, especially Heine and Nill who both seem to have undergone a massive change from the manga, and it doesn\'t suit them, in fact, most of the character designs in the anime don\'t suit the characters. I will cede though that at least they look good in colour.The biggest disappointment about the art though is the action. I wondered how David production would be able to pull off the amazing action scenes in the manga, and to be quite honest, they can\'t, maybe that\'s a sign of their inexperience (they\'ve only done 5 anime after all) but I digress; the action doesn\'t look good in the anime, and I mean that it doesn\'t look good, the manga had a way of making the action look good thanks to its outstanding panelling, the anime naturally doesn\'t resort to this and it suffers tremendously because of it, the gunfights are boring, the chase scenes are boring, the standoffs are boring, in fact when it\'s not busy being boring it\'s looking bad thanks to the character models. Don\'t go into this anime expecting to see the amazing art in the manga, you won\'t get it.Before I cover the voice acting I should address the music, and really, there\'s nothing worth addressing, the score is instantly forgettable being some sort of weird jazz/techno hybrid which tries to create a noir feeling similar to something seen in Darker than BLACK but fails. The music won\'t be getting any awards anytime soon so here\'s the next question.How about the voice acting?Well, my instant reactions to the voice acting where mixed, especially Heine\'s voice, Takahiro Sakurai makes Heine sound older than he actually is in the manga, his voice is too deep for me to believe him as a convincing Heine and made the character less of the cool cat that he is in the manga. Shizuka Itou and Akio Ootsuka manage to make passable performances as Naoto and Mihai, but the honour of best voice actor in this little disappointment of an anime goes to Akira Ishida.Yes Katsura fans, Ishida manages to be extremely impressive as Badou, you can literally feel that Ishida is putting his heart and soul into this performance as he embraces Badou\'s (very unique) personality wonderfully. Ishida needs to play crazy roles like this more often, rather than go with the weird (and annoying) bishonen that is Break Xerxes, and the creepy emo that is Gaara, I mean it when I say that Ishida is the best thing about the voice cast, his acting managed to save the sound aspect from a much lower score.The characters are nowhere near as impressive as they were in the manga, Mihai and Naoto were never going to win any awards to begin with, it was always Badou and Heine that stole the show for me but they suffer in the anime, it\'s hard to describe, again it\'s something that you have to read the manga to understand what I\'m getting at but they\'re nowhere near as cool as they were in the manga.Now, I\'ll be honest, I made a lot of comparisons between the manga and the anime here, I admit that the anime should be judged on its own merits but it\'s very hard to do a review of the Dogs anime without doing comparisons to the manga in a lot of places, it\'s not a terrible anime by any stretch of the imagination but it is very, very disappointing. It\'s also worth mentioning that the anime can\'t pull a stand alone move either, as there are so many indications of the producers wanting to do a Bullets and Carnage anime as well.Maybe Dogs was never meant to work as an anime.What do you know, I think I solved my own problem there. to do with watching the original manga play out being animated.Thirdly, it\'s very disappointing.Dogs doesn\'t seem to work as an anime, I can\'t describe why it doesn\'t work, it just doesn\'t. If you want to understand what I\'m getting at go and read the manga then watch the OVA\'s, you\'ll soon realise what I mean.Now I\'ll be honest, Dogs story was never one of its biggest strengths, however in the manga it was enjoyable, it was entertaining, and at times it was downright funny. But the manga\'s storyline doesn\'t translate well onto the screen and it becomes all too obvious what the weaknesses with the storyline were. If there\'s one thing that\'s frustrating about Bullets and Carnage, it\'s that it tries to present the storylines for each character as separate entities, without really taking notice of the character interactions, as such the story feels more disjointed and broken up than the sort of one shot chapters that actually spawned it.Another issue is that some of the humour is lost, this is more prevalent in Badou\'s chapter than anyone else\'s, his most memorable scenes in the manga are again, a victim of not translating well and his episode in the anime (in my opinion anyway) suffers more than anyone else\'s in the story.The art in Dogs was always the selling point of the manga, it looked gorgeous, and the action scenes were very intense, in the anime though, the quality has dropped considerably. The character models by Kumi Ishii do at least resemble the characters in the manga but most of the time they look awkward, especially Heine and Nill who both seem to have undergone a massive change from the manga, and it doesn\'t suit them, in fact, most of the character designs in the anime don\'t suit the characters. I will cede though that at least they look good in colour.The biggest disappointment about the art though is the action.

Stories twist with each other, so that even in the episode about Mihai we meet Badou, who in his personal episode calls Haine, and then, for a few second, Naoto appears before we can learn her story.As for the plot. You spend just an hour (and it never goes to waste) to watch all OVAs, but yet it may seem to you that there is much, much more. Of course, the story continues in manga, and the...fourth episode, Haine's story, has an open end. Yet each of the stories is finished in it's own way, and though consequences come, they become the beginnings of new stories - just the way the life flows and takes us from one episode to another.Of course, disadvantages are inevitable. One of the main is the art. Compared to manga, OVA loses in the way it is drawn. And the sound sometimes goes strange, noises may become louder than character's voice in the time when it is not needed.But all that doesn't matter, when you learn the stories of each one you see, when you laugh at Badou's failures or compassiate to Mihai's past mistakes, so the stories take you in, and the outstanding characters of this anime make you forget about everything around you...until it ends, after just an hour, leaving you to starve for more. fourth episode, Haine's story, has an open end.

Warning contains minor story spoilersStory (6/10)The four 15 minute episodes which make up this OVA don’t have a common plot or story between them , more to say the OVA’s seem like they are introducing the main characters for a longer anime or OVA series which is yet to come. In saying that the stories do seem to be in chronological order, in the same city and it is set sometime in the future. The other main characters are also sometimes involved...with the introductions to the other episodes main characters. The episodes break down as thus;Episode 1 – Introduction to Mihai – This shows Mihai’s return to the unnamed city for the first time after being fired from the mafia he was working for 20 years previously. Through this he has to deal with many elements of his past which he left there, including his former protégé.Episode 2 – Introduction to Badou – The episode is a change of pace from the first episode, the first episode having been gritty and emotional, this is a rather humorous romp through Badou’s character.  Badou is an information gatherer, but when he mucks up his abseiling whilst gathering information he ends up getting more information than he can handle. This is probably the weakest of the four stories and I just don’t feel it fits in, especially when he seems to have been given a character shield, although this is offset by the humorous nature of the episode, compared to the other episodes darker and more realistic settings, this can’t help but feel out of place.Episode 3 – Introduction to Naoto - This reverts back to the more gritty atmosphere of the first episode, and shows Naoto being taken in by a skilled knife as a child user after her parents are murdered by a skilled knife user. Themes of revenge and confused feelings run through this episode, as well as introducing some very interesting characters – this is probably the best episode of the OVA series.Episode 4 – Introduction to Haine – We are brought into the Haine arc knowing a little about him from what was said at the end of the previous episodes and also with him having been contacted by Badou already.  Haine has a few special abilities which make him a slightly different proposition from the rest of the characters shown in the OVA, the story revolves round him taking pity on a genetically engineered girl and trying to save her. Haine is probably the character with most room for expansion out of the main characters set so it’ll be interesting to if they make a longer series how it will turn out.Art (6/10)The artwork is the industry standard for the current production run of animated series and looks like many of its contemporise – the characters are well animated and the backgrounds are all suitably drawn. There is no animation that stands out as being different or excellently drawn, but this goes along with its gritty and somewhat humorous attitude to the series, it works out well.Sound (7/10)Hard to fault the sound either the series is well produced and has good voice acting/lip sync (a real annoyance when its slightly off) , the music pieces played through the anime are to a good standard are occur at locations where they add emotion or tension to the scene. As the series is 15 minutes long, there is no OP per se, but the ED is rather nifty and a good listen.Characters (8/10)This seems to be the main point behind the OVA, the introduction to the unique blend of characters which make up the show, with each of the main characters getting their own episode to ‘introduce’ themselves. The mix of characters seem like they complement each other well Mihai being somewhat older than the rest, but his experience on top of his still top drawer abilities make him something of a legend in the city. Compared to Badou – who is definitely the comic relief, but also can show a serious side when out of tobacco, this contrasts nicely and any moments can be brought to a comic conclusion through his actions.The most interesting characters were Naoto and Heine – both have some pretty big issues but watching them in the episodes you can already tell that there is something rather special waiting round the corner when they are on screen.Enjoyment (8/10)This is a very enjoyable series to watch, at just 15 minutes, you can whizz through the entire set in an hour as I did. The episodes actually seem longer than 15 minutes, so much happens in each one, and on more than one occasion I was checking to see they weren’t going to miss out the action scenes, which they didn’t. The only problem I had whilst watching it was knowing that this is as far as I was going to get in watching these chatacers, that there wasn’t anything to watch after I’d finished the OVAs.Overall (7/10)I would highly recommend this series of OVAs to anyone – but I would warn them that due to the unfinished feel of the series they may want to pick up the manga instead or wait till further series are announced. If this does become the precursor to a longer series this should mean the anime goes straight into the action without the need for introducing everyone.I for one am going to pick up the manga and read it, because I can’t wait for the next series to be announced with the introductions to the other episodes main characters.

Each episode tells the tale of a sigle character, and explores thier past and thier problem at hand. however, each character is unique, and brings something new to the table, making each episode a different experience from the last.The animation was alright,...however it did lack some when the gun fights were going on (like the bad guys not shooting back and just standing in fear while holding guns). But other than that everything looked pretty solid.I cant tell you much about the story, other than it was fast paced and funny at certain parts (i loved ep2).Tho its not the best OVA in the world, its worth checking out. however it did lack some when the gun fights were going on (like the bad guys not shooting back and just standing in fear while holding guns).

This is a bite-sized series; at 15 minutes per episode, an hour is all that you need to spare.Even though the episodes are short, all the ingredients necessary in a good, conventional story are incorporated. Each of the episodes focus on individuals' story and their imminent dilemma. - A lot happens in the 15 minutes; action-filled, emotional and energetic scenes are sufficiently delivered. Though you may think that this may cause a content overload, the story lines do not have that crammed, sloppy, or hastened feel to it, as the...OVA is extremely well-paced.But, upon completion, most people will agree that they felt as though something was missing... I believe this is so because 1. a single 15-minute episode is not long enough to thoroughly depict all that much, and, 2. the OVA corresponds to the introductory chapters in the Manga. (So it is expected to be more of a preface on the characters and their background.) With that said, hopefully, a full anime series or a sequel will be made; it has considerable potential to be a great series.Since each episode is just an overture to each of the characters and their main plot, the OVA itself doesn't include much substance. The interesting part was the connection that was made amongst all the characters (they make guest appearances in the each others' episodes), although, unfortunately, this net wasn't made purposeful. It would've been amusing to see where they could have gone with this idea. The character development, incorporation of the narrative and an intertwining network of the plots would be compelling to see play out.Overall, the technicalities of the OVA are moderate. Personally, the one exception is the characters. I like how they have exclusive personalities, traits, and appearances. They each have their own element that makes them and their episode distinct from the rest. As for the drawbacks, I would have to say that the main flaws lie in the art and sound. Nothing particularly stood out, as the illustrations and music were mediocre. There were actually some details that were rather disappointing, such as the fighting scenes. Not only were they a bit redundant, hundreds of bullets were dodged effortlessly, which made the gun fights very unrealistic. The sound delay when bullets were fired is also a shortcoming.As a stand-alone series, Dogs: Bullets & Carnage feels incomplete. Overall, it was more or less satisfactory, but not outstanding. The color, action, and movement may add definition to the experience for those that will read the Manga, but not substantially much else. I have found out that a handful of people enjoys these concise-type anime, without the prolonged story line or drawn-out scenarios. If this is you, then you will definitely fancy this succinct, action-packed anime. But, to everybody else, I would recommend it those that will follow-up with (or is already reading) the Manga!

Repeated action scenes, mediocre gun fights, time delay on gun shots, but the character illustrations are ok, the background scenes were only very mediocre. All in all, for an ""action"" and supposedly ""dark"" anime, it just doesn\'t give that feeling. It gives it a normal setting, nothing interesting. There were also very corny action scenes. If your a pro hitman or killer, how do you miss 15 shots when the target is standing...still. Also when it shows Heine ""jumping around"", I laughed at the slow movement. I can\'t say much more about the art, but in short, I was disappointed.Sound: This was also a point where I didn\'t like it at all. You know how sometimes you read the manga, and you imagine a voice for the characters? I do that a lot ,and I must say a lot of the characters didn\'t fit my prediction of voicing. It might be selfish or just my opinion, but I believe that Naoto, Badou could have had better voice actors. Heine was average, I guess it suits him, although they need that evil sound. Naoto sounds too soft, and doesn\'t sound like a character seeking revenge or living a life of revenge. Badou just sounds too foolish and when he starts going on a rampage, his voice just doesn\'t click. There was no opening and ending (expected) and no background music. Time delay on bullet shots. Like after a bullet is shot, it takes 2-3 seconds to make contact with something. This was a bad part in the anime.Characters: I actually enjoyed each of their character traits. A chain smoker machine gunner, an experimental human that is cool and and emits a bad side, a girl training with the person she wants to kill (although this type of character has become more common now), and a old pro hitman that emits humor and seriousness. The drawings also suit them. Nothing more to say about the characters except that I liked it a lot because it is unique, fresh, and memorable.Story: I must say, they packed in a lot in 4 episodes. Two episodes contain a character background story, and the other two are character type stories (but you kind of get a little bit of Heine\'s background story). What I liked is how they connected the characters together. Nao as a paper delivery girl, Badou on the bus and meeting with Mihai, Heine partnered up with Badou, the list goes on. They connect it well for a character part OVA. Only thing I didn\'t like was that it was really predictable. Every action and movement, I can guess what\'s gonna happen next. Maybe because the art is slow?Enjoyment: I enjoyed it actually, seeing the characters and the ending of the OVA. It really captivates the audience (me anyways). The Naoto and Heine episodes really contain a moment on finding who the characters in the ending were. I enjoyed it while it lasted I guess. However, too many factors bring this down: cliche moments, predictability, bad action scenes, lacking sound, delay in sound, the list goes on for a bit. Although in my point of view, this OVA deserves a 3, just keeping with the manga, the great characters and some of the things they did with the story, made me give it a final score of 4.TL;DR It gets a 4, I enjoyed watching it, but it could of been a darker anime, better action packed, less corny scenes, and maybe make it a little faster pace? still.

The story isn't bad, and lays somewhere between the classical mafia story and something more «supernatural». Surprisingly, even if the OAVs are short, the characters are well built, being caricature (not in the wrong way) whenever the story allows it, and serious other way. A plus : the charadesign isreally good, and the animation fluent.However, that was not the thing that stroke me most while I was watching. As a...big fan of Tarantino's movies, I couldn't help drawing a paralel between some of his films and DOGs : in both (or at least some ofHis movies) characters have separated stories, but in the end they happen to know each other...But I'm not totally convinced by the anime, because this latter pointis not specific to the anime, it is also true for the manga. And by staying to close to the manga, the anime doesn't bring anything more but colour and movement... big fan of Tarantino's movies, I couldn't help drawing a paralel between some of his films and DOGs : in both (or at least some ofHis movies) characters have separated stories, but in the end they happen to know each other...But I'm not totally convinced by the anime, because this latter pointis not specific to the anime, it is also true for the manga.

It gives you glimpses, possibly, of the main plotline, but each of the four eps don't really pick up from the previous one. It's more like overlapping parts of stories told by 4 or 5 main characters, each with their facet of intrigue. It's main purpose is probably to make you want to read the manga and find out more. ^^ArtAnimation was smooth, and I liked each of the characters' unique...designs.

Shirow Miwa practically draws the manga as a form of storyboard, so he practically did half the work for them.Perhaps with better budgeting or a better studio in charge, these OVA could have been decent.  As they stand, just painful.  Do yourselves a favor and read the manga - don't stop!  It's good stuff. "", ""Be warned: this review contains /spoilers/, as well as many references to the manga counterpart. (While the anime is rated 5, I'd rate its manga counterpart a 7. Given that this review combines both the anime and the manga rather solidly, I'm foregoing writing a separate review of the manga.)The DOGS Bullets and Carnage manga/four episode OVA are a prequel to the ongoing series DOGS. The manga contains six chapters, and the aforementioned anime contains four episodes. Each episode/chapter revolves around a particular character.The first chapter, “Weepy Old Killer”, introduces Mihai Mihaerrof, a former assassin/hitman who must confront someone from his past, specifically the son...of a mob boss whom he had tutored. This boy, Ian, killed Mihai’s lover, Milena (who, notably, was a prostitute). The chapter reaches its high during the final argument between Mihai and Ian. The first episode of the anime adapts this chapter very well, sticking with everything to the letter. As far as I can remember, there were no additions or subtractions based on the manga. Everything was followed very well. The second chapter, “Gun Smoker”, introduces Badou Nails, a chain smoker and a freelance journalist/photographer. I believe he also sells information for money, making him an informant, although I might be mixing up my animanga a bit. Badou takes a rather convicting photograph of a mob boss, causing him to become a wanted man by the rest of the mob. He is saved by Mihai and later on singlehandedly defeats the mob boss’s army simply because he lacks nicotine. (Take Badou’s cigarettes away and you die.) The anime adaption handled this very well.Chapters three and four, Blade Maiden Part One and its Sequel, centres on Fuyumine Naoto, a sword-wielding young woman who seeks revenge for her parents. As a young girl, an assassin murdered her mother and father, and branded her with an X marking on her chest. She was saved by an elder swordsman who she begins to consider her father. Later on, she finds out that she was named after the assassin who killed her parents – “Naoto”. The anime combines these two chapters into one episode, episode three, entitled “Blade Maiden”. The adaptation of Naoto’s story is done quite well, just as the other episodes were. In the last two chapters of the manga, five and six, entitled Stray Dogs Howling in the Dark Part One and its Sequel, the main character is Haine Rammsteiner, an albino man who was experimented on and genetically altered. He rescues a fourteen year old girl with wings from two men who would have forced her to become a prostitute. The head of the brothel hears of this and sends men to kidnap her. The anime also compounds this into one episode, the fourth and last one. There is one small alteration in the way they kidnap the girl (whose name, we find out later, is Nill), but this is so minor it can go unmentioned.The setting is obviously post-apocalyptic. Genetic manipulation, violence, crime, and other cruel things have become rather common and almost an aspect of everyday life. All the characters (Naoto, Mihai, Badou, and Haine) are antiheroes, a refreshing change from the stereotypical goodie-two-shoes that tend to dominate the protagonist role. In fact, many of the characters (even “good” ones) were involved in crime, violence, and underground groups at some point in their lives. From what I remember, Nill is really the only truly “good” character, and is the only woman/girl Haine is not afraid of. (He has gynophobia.) The animanga is more mature than most others, in the range of Wolf’s Rain, mostly because of the genre, “seinen”, for men, which WR is also a part of. There are many German influences, particularly in characters’ names, and this is even more prominent in DOGS.The animation overall is a tad choppy in some places, but otherwise good. The adaptation is very well-done – I was quite pleased with the way they followed the manga. The only thing I’ll really nitpick at is the fact that Nill has a seiyuu, when she is mute – but perhaps it had to be done. Said seiyuu is reduced to making affirmative noises when Nill is being spoken to, or gasping in shock/horror at the appropriate times. I can’t help but wonder how the episode would be affected if she had no seiyuu at all.The animanga, as stated before, is a prequel to the manga DOGS – the art changes slightly in the sequel (primarily a lack of screentones), but is otherwise very much the same. It is important to mention that the OVA/manga has no real ending, as it is merely a prologue to an ongoing series. Therefore, if you’re looking for a short, one-volume manga with a solid ending, this is not an anime or manga you can turn to. If, however, you intend to delve deeper into the world of DOGS and learn how all the characters are connected, feel free to watch or read DOGS Bullets and Carnage. of a mob boss whom he had tutored.

I did not know there was a Manga nor did I read this Manga. My review is therefore only based on this anime OVA.How did I get to his anime if I never heard from the manga before? Recommendations. I do like Black Lagoon and Jormungand and this anime shows both shows in the recommendations, so I thought I give it a shot.Based on the picture and the intro I thought this anime is about a group of 3-4 people doing, you know, action stuff. Like in Black Lagoon. Well it isn\'t, or maybe it is in the manga but not...in this 4 episodes.Every episode of this 4 episodes tells a short story about one of the characters. Don\'t expect big story split up in 4 parts. The characters seem to be connected a bit. They know each other or are ""friends"".Since the episodes are so short there is very little room for some back story or character development. This is making it confusing. You don\'t rly know why something is happening or wtf is even happening. You are just left with a big ""Okay...."".It all feels very unfinished. Therefore I can\'t rate this OVA high. Maybe it is something for the fans of the manga, but for people who just want something for in between  i can not recommend this. in this 4 episodes.Every episode of this 4 episodes tells a short story about one of the characters.

You don't have to read the whole series, just the one volume. The art is fierce, active, and evocative. And while each of the 4 short stories varies quality, they weave together into a powerful whole.As I said, these OVAs are frame by frame from the manga. Some of the drawings are literally the exact drawings from the manga. Except the art/animation quality of the OVAs is very poor, and...it just retells the story literally, with none of the power or heart of the originals. There are truly scary, violent people in these stories and on screen they just kind of stand around looking pasty and silly.Quick summary of my ratings:Story - 8  The stories from the mangas are pretty good. They weave together interestingly. But I would have rated this much lower if I hadn't read the manga first. They feel very lackluster in this adaptation, while the originals are defined by their ferocity.Art - 5   The art is basic at best, nothing like the incredible detail of the manga. The characters all suffer from those poofy, featureless pale faces that certain animation styles have. And the use of color and background is absolutely, mind-numbingly dull.Sound - 4   Nothing special. Gunplay is HUGE in this series, and some of the gun effects are downright bizarre. Someone can be going at it with a machine gun in both hands and it just kind sounds like a woodpecker 6 blocks away.Characters - 8  I absolutely fell in love with these characters through the manga. Each one is very distinct (some tragic, some comic). But again, the animation style and voice acting really takes away their edge.Enjoyment - 6  This is a 6 only because I had read the manga. Going in blind it would have been a 3 or 4.Overall - 3  I repeat: Please for the love of all things read Stray Dogs Howling in the Night before you watch this. It's available all over, and it only takes an hour or two. There's really no point in watching this unless you've read the manga (and even then, since it's so painfully literal in its interpretation, its not very rewarding). I can't even say that if you dislike reading, or manga, you should watch it anyway to enjoy the stories. They are done such a disservice that you might as well not bother at all. it just retells the story literally, with none of the power or heart of the originals.

I'd say who ever wanted to explore more of this anime most likely there'll be no second season, so Manga is probably is the best gateway.Yah overall sometimes to make a great anime doesn't mean that it always gotta be long...sometimes short ones can make a difference, welp I guess to each their own, so I'd say this one is pretty good. sometimes short ones can make a difference, welp I guess to each their own, so I'd say this one is pretty good."", 'Dogs: Bullets & Carnage is an inoffensive little OVA from 2009 that barely takes an hour to watch in full and definitely feels like a product of its time. It is nostalgically edgy in that particular late-2000s fashion, but beyond that it\'s a fairly unremarkable show. Beginning with the story, it consists of a series of self-contained vignettes connected in some way to the criminal underground of a city ""somewhere in Europe"", as the anime puts it. It\'s perfectly serviceable, and only lays about as much groundwork as is strictly necessary for the vignettes to make sense. Even so, it does feel a little disjointed,...and the dramatic moments feel both sudden and unearned due to a total lack of buildup, which I have seen done well in even shorter shows before. The art is this anime\'s strongest aspect, though I say this mostly due to its nostalgia factor rather than anything else. Everything from the character design to the overall art direction just bleeds 2009 in a way that\'s hard to describe unless you were there for that era. The random scars, the tortured pasts, the unrealistic gunfights- they might as well have tapped Evanescence for the soundtrack at this rate. Don\'t get me wrong, that\'s fun and it takes me back, but the problem here is that there\'s nothing particularly notable underneath that aesthetic. Speaking of which, the sound meets all standards of quality for the time, with a jazzy flare to the OST that adds to the criminal underground vibe. Finally, the characters, while interesting in concept, are all pretty weak, with little substance that makes their actions really hit home. Overall, Dogs: Bullets & Carnage is an anime which is neither bad nor good. It simply serves as a time capsule for the aesthetics that were popular at the time of its production, which is a trip down memory lane I didn\'t mind at all. Give it a shot if you have an hour to kill, and want a glimpse into the edgelord anime culture of the late 2000s. and the dramatic moments feel both sudden and unearned due to a total lack of buildup, which I have seen done well in even shorter shows before.

Bamboo Blade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2986/Bamboo_Blade,"[""The most popular (aka common) type of animes of the past year has most definitely been school comedy anime with a female cast. And this one is no exception. Thankfully they put emphasis on what matters most character chemistry.As you should already know it's a comedy about a high school kendo club, mainly consisting of (SPOILER AHEAD!) a group of girls. It all sounds like standard fare from here, and it is. The kids get involved in crazy hijinks, make silly jokes, and even have a decent amout of action in show such as this. After watching the first couple episodes, you'll most likely have...a feeling if you are going to enjoy the show since the same style of jokes makes their rounds. Sometimes, its even as if they know they're making an uninspired anime and actually puts in gags and jokes that are very cliche` for the genre but leaves minor (and unique) twists for the viewers to laugh. Honestly, I think their jokes get off so well not only because of their 'semi' unique approach to joke telling, but the characters are just perfect for this show.Like all the other great comedy (and sports) shows before it, this show puts an emphasis on the character chemistry and development. This is where the show shines the most. It's just like how they intentionally make jokes about the the comedy genre its almost looks as if they intentionally mixed the character types around to create their own uniqueness. For example there's a smart looking that is really stupid, a clumsy girl that actually has good orginizational skills, and even a really loud quiet type. Good luck finding out who im talking about, but all the main characters are like that and its one main part why the comedy feels so fresh and unique. It almost feels like they all have double personalities. But the one person that really distracted me the from the others the most is quite easliy Tamaki-chan. She definitely steals the show in my eyes. Usually the show stealing characters arent the main character (Yuki, Osaka, etc) but that isn't the case here. She is the main reason why i kept watching this show. Hirohashi Ryou did a perfect job for her voice because there is no other way to do Tamaki's voice. There are other parts of greatness in this anime but I wont spoil the show any further.Another good point of the show is how surprisingly good the artwork is in this show for a comedy show. There are various locations that you will see throughout the show, and each are shown with such vibrant color. The backgrounds are pretty detailed, you'll see alot of particle effects, reflections, and sunbeams throughout the show. And the characters are all drawn in the typical super cute borderline sexy style which is usual for a show in this type. Of course, the emphasis was more on the females than the males and you can tell because the all the men (with one exception) all look virtually the same. Another thing, is get used to their eyes as that is what you'll be seeing for the most part.Sound effects are nothing to be super enthusiastic about. All thought the sound is very well done, once you've heard any high school anime you've heard them all pretty much. With the exception of the yelling and screaming from all the cute girls (extra points from me). They even have the girls singing the opening and ending theme song just like all the others in this genre. Well when you have cute voiced seiyu's use them as much as possible i guess. There is one uinque and hilarious sound but you wont hear it till around episode 20. Trust me when I tell you that it will have you on the floor laughing.There are so many fun and memorable instances in this show it's hard not to give this a perfect score. They sure did do everything right in making this &quot;slice of life, high schoo, comedy, sports&quot; show different from all the others. But this does follow the same formula as all the other current releases (lots of girls + comedic situations + singing seiyus).

Fortunately this is one of the better ones."", ""Ever wonder what its like to be in a Kendo club? Well certainly most of us would answer &quot;no&quot; to that one, but after watching Bamboo Blade it just might make you more interested in this old time tradition! As this series does it very well!Story: 7/10Pretty straight forward for the most part, basically it starts up with a struggling Kendo instructor and his team leader trying to get others into Kendo, as their club has little to no members at present. As the story progresses they meet/get new club members and then begin a road down to the final tournament to keep the instructor...from losing his job after a misunderstanding with the school principle's wife. Now while the story remains very linear in this aspect, it doesn't just strictly stick to the whole &quot;Kendo&quot; idea, there are some nice scenes that have the girls struggling with daily life, whether it be confronting old rivals, watching a live action movie, meeting up with long time friends, to just trying to get that one part time job to earn up for a certain anime DVD collector's set that one of them wants. These play out more as sub plots on the side though, while the girls themselves make their way up the Kendo ladder. (sorry, but there is no actual love story in this anime, with the exception of one couple that already are an item from the get go) Which brings us to the Kendo itself, the series does a pretty fair job of explaining all the strategies and ropes of the sport, and never comes off as a gimmick with the whole &quot;Kendo&quot; tag. The first beginning episodes are good for giving decent enough back story on most of the main characters, so you never really feel like they tossed someone in the story just for the heck of it! While this is a comedy anime to be sure, it also contains quite a bit of sincere and touching moments as well between the characters, perhaps even more so than the actual comedy bits, which can also be seen as a negative depending on your perception. The biggest draw back overall, is both its linear plot twist fee storyline and slow pacing. There were times where I just wanted them to get on with it already. Despite this being an all female cast for the most part, I did find it interesting that there was no echhi factors in this title whatsoever. Which is great for viewers out there who are tired of having the usual all female cast that are strictly there for the fan service.There shouldn't be anything that viewers will find offensive, aside from occasional language and mild violence. (the action is all done in a professional and respected manner, and not over the top)Artwork: 8/10Pretty good for the most part, all characters and environments are drawn with good detail and personality. While its not the best looking series out there, it does animate it well enough to catch your attention and not come off as an over kill. I personally found some of the overall color schemes to be a bit on the bland side though, but the great and versatile character design and facial expressions make up for it quite nicely!Soundtrack: 8/10The music itself is good! The opening and closing themes are nice and lively, that will fill you with a sense of happiness! The background music on the other hand is pretty much this one soft violin style track, that plays during most of the series. (most of the time on the touching or heavy thought parts) Its good, just not great in the variety department as its pretty much the only real track you'll hear. Now the character's voices are awesome! From the happy and playful Kirino, to the solitary feel of Tamaki. All the voices are varied and add a distinctness to them all, and not one of them you will find annoying.Characters: 10/10Truly the heart of the series, Bamboo Blade has some of the best character chemistry that I have seen in a long time. All of them know how to compliment eachother well, and never come off as a cliche. For example: My favorite characters were Miyako (a heart throb that has two personalities) and Dan (a short geeky guy). They are actually a couple, Miyako simply melts whenever she sees him, but acts out more aggressively when around anyone else. Its just little touches like that which make Bamboo Blade so enjoyable! While the characters do a great job to make you laugh, please keep in mind that they don't do it over the top. (well for the most part anyway) Most of the time they'll just get this wacky look to them, and simply make you laugh with their facial expressions!  They all grow very close to one another as the story progresses, and by the end you will truly feel the friendship that they all share.Bottom Line: 9/10Bamboo Blade is a great title, but unfortunately I can't recommend it to all viewers, especially if you like plot twists and a fast paced nonlinear storyline, as this title has none of those. But if your looking for a fun (and sometimes moving) anime with great character chemistry and amusing anecdotes. Then Bamboo Blade hits the mark just right! from losing his job after a misunderstanding with the school principle's wife.

The biggest draw back overall, is both its linear plot twist fee storyline and slow pacing. There were times where I just wanted them to get on with it already. Despite this being an all female cast for the most part, I did find it interesting that there was no echhi factors in this title whatsoever. Which is great for viewers out there who are tired of having the usual all female cast that are strictly there for the fan service.There shouldn't be anything that viewers will find offensive, aside from occasional language and mild violence. (the action is all done in a professional and respected manner, and not over the top)Artwork: 8/10Pretty good for the most part, all characters and environments are drawn with good detail and personality. While its not the best looking series out there, it does animate it well enough to catch your attention and not come off as an over kill. I personally found some of the overall color schemes to be a bit on the bland side though, but the great and versatile character design and facial expressions make up for it quite nicely!Soundtrack: 8/10The music itself is good! The opening and closing themes are nice and lively, that will fill you with a sense of happiness! The background music on the other hand is pretty much this one soft violin style track, that plays during most of the series. (most of the time on the touching or heavy thought parts) Its good, just not great in the variety department as its pretty much the only real track you'll hear. Now the character's voices are awesome! From the happy and playful Kirino, to the solitary feel of Tamaki. All the voices are varied and add a distinctness to them all, and not one of them you will find annoying.Characters: 10/10Truly the heart of the series, Bamboo Blade has some of the best character chemistry that I have seen in a long time. All of them know how to compliment eachother well, and never come off as a cliche. For example: My favorite characters were Miyako (a heart throb that has two personalities) and Dan (a short geeky guy). They are actually a couple, Miyako simply melts whenever she sees him, but acts out more aggressively when around anyone else. Its just little touches like that which make Bamboo Blade so enjoyable! While the characters do a great job to make you laugh, please keep in mind that they don't do it over the top. (well for the most part anyway) Most of the time they'll just get this wacky look to them, and simply make you laugh with their facial expressions!  They all grow very close to one another as the story progresses, and by the end you will truly feel the friendship that they all share.Bottom Line: 9/10Bamboo Blade is a great title, but unfortunately I can't recommend it to all viewers, especially if you like plot twists and a fast paced nonlinear storyline, as this title has none of those. But if your looking for a fun (and sometimes moving) anime with great character chemistry and amusing anecdotes. Then Bamboo Blade hits the mark just right!"", 'Girls with Wooden SwordsMan, what a ride. Bamboo Blade has it all; comedy, drama, romance, all rolled up into one. By making fun of itself at random places and with the help of very fabulous characters, this show rises from its shoddy animation to join the elite group of anime this season that deserves your time.I should get the not-so-good things out of the way first. The animation is pretty bad. No, not like Musashi Gundoh bad, but repeated animation, laziness supreme kind of bad. Up until the last two episodes, the same kendo swings from episode one get repeated over and over, with only...the costumes changed. The backgrounds are nice watercolor pastels, but sometimes the characters look very funky. It`s hard to believe and oxymoronic that this show actually airs in HD.But looking beyond the badness of the animation, Bamboo Blade is golden. The characters are a riot. Their voice actresses fit them perfectly. My favorite character out of the entire bunch is Kirino, with her happy-go-lucky attitude and her beautiful relationship with Saya, the hilarious redhead. Seriously, every time Saya opens her mouth, her voice cracks me up so much that I am left on the floor laughing. Kudos to her voice actress for providing her with such an amazing voice. The other characters also pad the show with relevant humor. You have acorn head/pimp Dan, his gay buddy Yuuji, the master kendo practitioner Tamaki, the klutz Azuma, the bipolar Miyako, and their failure of a teacher, Kojirou. As added bonus and hilarity, Kojirou is voiced by the ever-so-manly Kamina from Gurren Lagann, with all the same intonations and vocal gestures. It`s great.The plot starts off as a standard shounen tournament fest, but midway through the anime branches off from the manga. Unlike most cases which this happens (cough cough Naruto filler hell), the director took very interesting directions in the plot. New characters that are just as cool as the original manga ones appear. Plot points are generally well paced and the comedy is well timed too.The music is another strong point, with epic orchestral pieces to hot-blooded insert songs. I love the songs that play when the random Bravers appear, and I also love the clack clack sounds of the Kendo fights. I wasn`t very interested in Kendo before watching Bamboo Blade, but now I check out matches on Youtube. They`re even more intense than the anime itself.Tamaki is sometimes too strong to the point of boredom, but Bamboo Blade always find ways to not fall too deep into that trap. Parodies and references are abundant. Facepalms, sweat marks, falling down in unison, everything`s there. You will definitely laugh at some point while watching, with the sudden bouts of unexpected humor.The force of lesbian tendencies is strong with this one. Don`t miss it. the costumes changed.

I usually don't like sports-related anime, but a kendo club full of eccentric girls (and you know they are if you've seen this) and the two lone guys is something that grabbed my attention. It was nice to see how their relationships with each other progressed and what was going to happen with the club.Art -I really liked the art for this series. To compare it with other series - the art is a lot like Ichigo Mashimaro or Minami-ke...(the first season, not the second season where they got lazy and didn't color in the extras); which is the type I enjoy. If you're really into that avant garde type of animation, it won't suit your tastes.Sound -I'm not really sure what falls into this category... I'm not one to listen to Opening or Endings... but the voice acting was done really well. I thought all the voices matched the characters and they did well to match their emotions.Character -The characters are the best part of this series. Every character is eclectic in some way or another. The most eclectic however is Dan-kun, which... you'll see why if you watch the series. He's special &lt;3.Enjoyment &amp; Overall -I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It takes a lot for me to actually WANT to keep watching a series. Bamboo Blade even made me want not go to class because I didn't want to stop watching it. Overall it gets 10/10 from me!Recommended For: Anyone who likes comedy, a bit of slice-of-life, school settings, and sports series. There is the near loli-factor if you're into that too... boys... I have a feeling a lot of them will like Tama-chan :D. (the first season, not the second season where they got lazy and didn't color in the extras); which is the type I enjoy.

Plus, I'm not really a huge fan of the school/romantic comedy anime genre - so I was surprised when I actually decided to watch this particular anime.StoryWhat can you really say about Bamboo Blade? Well, it's a story of 5 girls who are members of their high school kendo club. Their instructor (or sensei.. whatever) makes a bet with an old friend (who is also a rival kendo instructor) that his girls can beat the others at a kendo practice...match - the prize? A years worth of free sushi. Not the best sounding prize - but a prize none the less.  That aside, there are other &quot;mini stories&quot; that take place during the episodes as well. Incidentally, at the very beginning there's only 1 member in the kendo club - so, the first two episodes is taken up with the hilarious undertaking of recruiting new club members. They even end up with 2 male members (despite sensei's pleas to only have female members... the dirty old lech &gt;__&gt;)  What goes on beyond episode 10 is unknown to me... so, I suppose that this is all I can say about the story - and it's probably why it only got an 8.  Once I've seen more episodes - this will probably be reviewed also.  And also, the 5th member of the kendo team has yet to be recruited.  So, at the moment there are only 4 female members of the squad.CharactersThis anime is pretty creative when it comes to the characters - it almost always remains refreshing. And it basically keeps the viewer watching. From the cute little Tamaki-chan who absolutely adores anime (almost reminds me of Konata from Lucky ☆ Star), but lacks some social skills - to the rather psychotic, but beautiful Miya-Miya who shows her &quot;black&quot; side.  Then there's Saya - who can be over dramatic at times, but it all adds to he charm.  Team captain Kirino appears to be the sensible one - often taking over from the instructor during training.  However, both Kirino and Saya make a rather decent comedy duo in some episodes.SoundI can't help it! Bamboo Blade has a very catchy opening theme song (which is actually performed by some members of the cast) - as well as a pretty sweet closing theme too (which is also sung by the cast). This is one of very few anime where I don't immediately click on &quot;mute&quot; when it comes to the openers and the closers... so, for me it's a win win soundtrack.  Ok, so I have the songs on my iPod... there are you happy now?! &gt;__&lt;  No, seriously - I really do like the themes.  The only other theme that I openly like are the openers for Gunslinger Girl and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.Considering that I've only watched 10 episodes so far - I can quite happily say that I am immensely enjoy watching Bamboo Blade.

That is if his team wins at a friendly tournament. If only there were more than one loyal captain and the other that has not showed up in a while. To win, he would need a miracle. A big miracle.

You can thank me later."", 'OverviewIt\'s surprising the amount of insight Bamboo Blade\'s silly, gag oriented characters provide on the passion for and the meaning of Kendo. Even more unthinkable is the lack of ecchi in a high school girl oriented cast clearly aimed at males. Bamboo Blade is full of wonderful surprises, but the repetitive comedy and weak action elements do nothing to fill in for its uneventful plot.SynopsisAn unambitious teacher is the supervisor for Murota school\'s Kendo club. Throughout the years, his club has been whittled down to one hard working and devoted girl, Kirino, who loves the sport but is miffed that her teacher is always so...lazy. A drunken wager with the teacher\'s former classmate stakes a full year of free sushi on an exhibition girl\'s Kendo match, and with this, he is suddenly gung ho about whipping his club into tournament shape, to the delight of Kirino. He pursues ex-members and a new child prodigy, Tamaki, to fill the ranks, and in the process, revives his old flame for Kendo.Story & CharactersThe most striking element of Bamboo Blade is how realistic and poignant, yet varied the characters\' feelings towards Kendo are. Azuma, a member of the home Kendo club, adores it as a part of herself and a passion she\'s held since youth while Kirino enjoys the camaraderie it builds. Each of the main characters find a unique and believable relationship with Kendo, and even some of the minor characters shed words of wisdom. Most of the action elements also follow in this vein of realism. Even though many of the characters improve their skills, it\'s far from a ""powerup"" scenario. For instance, one of the home members has markedly wonderful aggression, but little skill and focus. Instead of taking the typical shounen route that would have transformed her into an unconventionally powerful prodigy, her lack of focus is a crippling handicap throughout, rendering her unable to win any matches. Just as in real life, the focus and skill is only be attained through painstaking practice along with multiple frustrating failures.It\'s a little too bad that the series revolves around the tiny prodigy, Tamaki. She\'s a robotic character with her desire to emulate the naive heroism of her favorite Anime characters as her only displayed emotion throughout most of the series. Though she does undergo trials towards the end that expand her emotional range, her completely inhuman nature for the rest of the series had already sabotaged any possible empathy from the viewer. Unlike the other characters, Tamaki\'s Kendo skill goes beyond the bounds of believability; she is essentially invincible. To a lesser degree, the other characters are similarly simple caricatures for a majority of their screen time, but when Kendo gets involved, their genuine elements come through. Only when they reveal their relationship to Kendo are they not generic, run of the mill anime characters.Many of their gags are funny for the first time, but each character has no more than 1 or 2 that repeat, and by the end they become clockwork. Interestingly, the action is often skipped over, either with a simple still screen, or just an announcement of a winner with no visuals at all. The tantalizing bit of Kendo we see animated ranges from excessive still screen usage to beautiful and accurate animation that captures the explosive, almost spastic nature of the matches. Still, even when the matches are just glanced over, we get the primary reward we desire in the reaction of the characters. Their genuine passion for the sport makes me feel their elation when they win, and their heartbreak or frustration when they lose. Watching the characters express themselves in the context of Kendo is compelling, but I didn\'t care a lick for the rest of the plot. All the minutia that\'s supposed to give added weight to the results of the matches, which is the free sushi at first, and then eventually the teacher\'s job, is a boring filler of screen time--Bamboo Blade is certainly far from a generic, power up sports Anime, but that novelty alone doesn\'t make it compelling. It\'s a drag to sit through at times, but the unmatched insight into Kendo, or perhaps competitive sports in general is worth wading through the other junk. lazy.

Bamboo Blade manages to do this by making the characters the driving force instead of heavily focusing on the sport itself.The plot is pretty simple, which is basically a school comedy revolving around the kendo club, they practice, go to tournaments and recruit new members along the way. Although the plot is simple, it also works because of the characters. The series is light hearted and has a fairly large amount of comedic moments which are actually pretty funny. The...pace is also just right for this kind of show.

Each character has their own very unique personality (for example Kirino is very energetic but also very responsible and very caring too) and they are each explored very well. All the main characters also develop a lot during the series (such as a Tamaki opening up more) and by the end of the anime, each of the characters have grown in different ways. The chemistry developed between the characters is also unmatched by most. Each character is likable and most of the comedic moments work because of them. Without the amazing characters and development, this anime would just be another average anime with nothing memorable about it.The art does have it's fair share of good and bad moments, the backgrounds are detailed and generally drawn pretty well but colors don't really scream out.

Though the series is focused on the girls\' kendo team, male characters are present and are actually pretty...important to the series.Av: How so?NK: Well, the main kendo instructors are all male.  Then there\'re the two seniors who play as antagonists in a couple ways.  Plus, the two freshmen boys who join the club actually have a bit of character development themselves, and one of them acts as both a supporting character and a protagonist.Av: I take it one of the females is your favorite, though.NK: Yeah.  For a while, Tama-chan was my favorite character: the hero for justice and all that.  In retrospect, though, I\'ve chosen Kirino.  She\'s described in the series as being ""the pillar of the kendo club"", and she could probably be described as the pillar of the series, too.  A lot of the humor involves her, and a good amount of the suspense is placed on her shoulders as well.  It\'s difficult to find a character like that that still has a great supporting cast.Av: Why don\'t you give a dissertation next time?NK: Sorry, I just haven\'t found a character like that in a long time...Av: Anyway, think I should take a look at it?NK: Definitely.  Granted, there are some cutesy parts...Av: I\'ll be sure to have a bucket handy.NK: It\'s not that bad.  Just girls being girls, like any slice-of-life anime out there.  If you\'re interested in kendo, Bamboo Blade is a great starting point.  I think you\'d like it because you like traditional japanese swordplay.  Kendo was used as training in the feudal age, if I recall correctly.Av: Right.

Blade Braver was a great way to add some feeling of a on-going story.Art: The animation was not anything special and was pretty much like most other anime. The drawing style and colors won me over.Sound: Soundtrack was good. Voices were good. Opening and ending themes were good. I'm not complaining.Character: I liked the characters, well most of them. Tamaki was just super cute, she was the reason I began watching this show. Kirino was an awesome character too. When she'd get...sad, you knew something was seriously at miss. I seriously wanted to kill Dan-kun, but I believe that was the original purpose of this character anyway. That american chick messing with Miya-miya seriously also annoyed me.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this show. Full of comedy and an occasional touch of epic. Girls screaming men, do and kote was kinda awesome. They also managed to put some good drama here and there.Overall: Very shonen.

Surely anyone into sports or school anime will get something out of this show."", ""I would like to preface this by saying that I've never even heard of Bamboo Blade, let alone watched it.Bamboo Blade is a comedy that comes around only once every very often. Let's face it, you've seen all of this before: Broke teacher looking for a quick fix to his problem, lovable cast of female characters who just want to train in kendo and have a fun time, all wrapped up in a comedy school setting. By no means is it anything new in the anime world, but it is still a wholly charming and fun little show.Story:Honestly, the story isn't all that fantastic. It's...very predictable and cliche, and while that isn't bad, it certainly won't win any awards. I think it's best to just accept that the story is just a setup for the truly great cast of characters to interact in, rather than a driving force for the anime.Art:Character design is fantastic in Bamboo Blade! Each and every character is immediately recognizable and really left a deep impression on me. I still can't look at Kirino's face without smiling, what a beautiful character. Animation is surprisingly good, you can tell that while they knew this wasn't making any major leaps in the world of anime, the animators were dedicated to their work and wanted this to look really nice, and honestly, my hat's off to them. Well done! I'd also like to point out the lack of ecchi - there were a lot of times in this anime that could have focused on cheap panty shots and questionable ecchi situations, but it did a good job at not offending me at all.Sound:The soundtrack to the anime is kind of weak, but it makes up for it with the fantastic voice acting. Both the English and Japanese versions are very well-done, although I prefer watching in Japanese with subs. All of the voice actresses really capture the style of the anime very well, from the comedy scenes to the more serious ones, I was captivated the whole time by their voices.Character:And here's the major selling point of this anime. Really, when it comes to writing characters, there's nothing more frustrating than a good character that has poorly-written interactions with other characters. Bamboo Blade doesn't have this problem though, as all of the characters are well-written and enjoyable, but also their chemistry is superb and all of their interactions really make sense and contribute a lot to my enjoyment of this anime.It may be a pretty typical style of anime, but that didn't keep me from thoroughly enjoying it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice, fun anime to sit back and enjoy.So, now that I've finished this review, I've decided it'd be a good idea to actually watch Bamboo Blade and see if it matches up with my review. very predictable and cliche, and while that isn't bad, it certainly won't win any awards.

Well, if you didn’t know what kendo was until now, the thought has probably never crossed...your mind. But after watching Bamboo Blade you might be more interested in this old time tradition.Bamboo Blade is pretty much one straight forward anime. In the beginning Toraji Ishida (a politics and economics teacher, also known as the Kendo Club instructor of Muroe High School) and Kirino Chiba (a second year high school student in Muroe High School and captain of the Kendo club) begin their search for new members for their club. As the story progresses they get/met new club members and soon their journey down the road to becoming and elite Kendo team begins. There are small twists and turns along the way but its not just about kendo. It’s also about the characters lives and the problems or challenges each character has to get past so they can form an elite team. This anime will make you laugh and maybe even cry, its very cute. But sadly, It’s an anime that not everyone could get into especially if you like plot twists and a fasted paced story line. But if your looking for a fun slow anime with amazing/lovable characters, then Bamboo Blade just right for you.As far as the art work goes, all the characters and scenery were drawn with a good amount of detail and the color scheme for the outfits and stuff wasn’t bad either. Mind you its not the best looking series out there, but hey if you get caught up in the story like I did you wont even notice. Plus, the cute characters and their facial expressions make up for it!Music wise Bamboo Blade has a very catchy opening theme song and a sweet closing theme as well. The opening theme is definitely a song you will sing along to.  As for the background music (which is a soft violin during most of the series if memory serves) is a good mood setter. The character voices are awesome in Japanese and English! Best part is their voices aren't annoying (in my opinion).Lastly the characters, they are truly the heart of the series. They have the best chemistry and amazing personality. The characters always make you laugh whether it be by a silly comment or just there facial expressions. They all grow very close to each other as the story progresses and by the end of the series you’ll truly see/ feel the beauty of the friendship they all share. your mind.

Producing a championship caliber team of 5 girls just for sushi (yes, even sushi) is a pretty stupid plot.  Luckily, the story never really gets into that, and the story quickly progresses to how the girls form a team and overcome diversity.  I could have done with a little less of the blade braver...scenes, which I didn't think really add much to the overall story (they could have introduced Rin some other way).  I also would have liked to see a little more from the dudes, who looked like an afterthought; especially since they seem to have hinted at Yuuji and Tamaki getting together.  From a kendo aspect, I would have to give Bamboo Blade a 9/10 since almost everything mentioned is correct: Nitto-ryu (the two sword style that Carrie uses) is a real style developed by the famous Miyamoto Musashi and is not allowed in most high schools.  Jodan no kamae (which Rin uses), is also actual technique that is very rarely used (as indicated in the anime), and finally tsuki (which Tamaki uses a couple of times), is also real, incredibly hard and illegal move in most high schools (since if you miss you end up skewering your opponent in the neck).  The one issue I had was in the ordering of the team, I'm not sure if it was a fansub error (Huzzah-Doremi) or the actual anime, but the actual ordering goes Senpo-Jisho-Chuken-Fukusho-Taisho, which wasn't how it was portrayed.Art:Overall, very good.  The characters all look different and are drawn with lots of detail, except for Eiga, though that might be for comedic effect.  Backgrounds are decent enough, tho I have to say I can't think of an anime with truly horrible backgrounds for a very long time.  The kendo scenes are drawn very well, equipment looks realistic and the characters move with a realistic feel.Sound:OP and ED were catchy, but at least in my opinion not ipod worthy.  I did think, however, the seiyuus did a very good job, especially Tamaki and Kirino; while Tamaki's voice fell into the quiet-moe mold, Hirohashi Ryou actually put some feeling into it and created a character that truly stood out.  Kirino's voice on the other hand was just funny, which is good enough for me.Character:Nothing really new about the characters, we have the beautiful evil girl (Miya-Miya), the leader (Kirino), the crazy good quiet moe (Tamaki), the super-talented klutz (Saotori) and the insane one (Saya).  But the characters do mesh very well together and it makes up for the deficiencies of the characters to create good chemistry between the characters.  For instance watching Kirino and Saya plot and scheme was like watching a manzai duo and the awkwardness of Tamaki and Yuuji together was a nice touch hinting at some romance.Enjoyment:Naturally, a kendoist watching an anime about kendo is going to give high marks.  I'm not sure how much this series would appeal to people not informed about kendo, but to those few who are crazy enough to actually do kendo, this was pure bliss.  Honestly, even if you liked the series, you probably are only getting 50% out of this anime, because there are subtleties that you have to be a kendoist to understand.  That isn't to say that people who don't do kendo can't enjoy this anime; but to those who do, join kendo and watch it again!Overall:A very, very good anime.  I would definitely recommend this anime firstly to all kendoist, but secondly to everyone who enjoys a light-hearted high school anime which can be both hilarious and heart-warming when it wants.  Now let's just wait for the sequel! scenes, which I didn't think really add much to the overall story (they could have introduced Rin some other way).

It is one of those anime that would leave a smile when you finish it :) "", 'An anime about a kendo club in school. When I first saw the name and read a synopsis of Bamboo Blade I wasn\'t too sure about it. I was no really fan of sports anime and I thought it was just another one of those which were shown here in TV. A friend of mine asked me to watch the first episode together with him and I\'m quite glad that I did it. I really enjoyed this warm and heartfilling anime.Story: To be true there isn\'t that much story in this kind of anime. The girls go to school, practice kendo and participate in kendo...tournaments. So far there is nothing special about it. The way that rather stereotypical story is told is ok though. The fact that the story is negligible doesn\'t make this anime bad. Imho anime like Bamboo Blade don\'t really need a good story to be entertaining.Art: The animation of Bamboo Blade is good just as expected from an anime from 2007. The character design is cute and fitting, the backgrounds are drawn well , the kendo matches are fast paced and quickly over. Nothing like other sports anime where running scenes for example are way too long and you can see the earth curvature while the characters are running over the sports field.Sound: Imho the strongest part in Bamboo Blade was the OST. With ""Bamboo Beat"" and ""Star Rise"" Bamboo Blade has  rather usual opening songs/ending songs vocaled by the female seiyuu crew which actually did a good job in voicing the characters, imho they all fit. But the best thing about the OST is the BGM. The BGM of Bamboo Blade is full of fast paced drums which fit the atmosphere of the kendo matches. On the other hand there are also slow paced songs without drums which fit the more laidback atmosphere when the girls are not doing kendo.Character: The characters in Bamboo Blade are all very likable. They are not as flat as in other sports series because they all have other unique character traits besides loving kendo and you actually get to see it even though the anime shows about 70-80% of the time the girls in kendo practice or kendo matches.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed Bamboo Blade because of it\'s atmosphere which was calm and nice in the non-fighting scenes and fast and quick in the battle scenes. The comedy part of this series is also quite good. The girls are all moe. It\'s a good anime to watch when you want to watch something where you don\'t have to think too much about what actually is happening and you want to lay back and relax.Overall:  Bamboo Blade was an quite refreshing anime, easy to watch and simply just nice. I highly recommend Bamboo Blade for people who like sports anime, school life anime and comedy anime ... Other people should also give it a try.One last personal thing: I am sorry for my poor grammar and vocabularies but English is not my native language and so I had some troubles writing a longer text in this language. tournaments.

That\'s not meant as criticism as I often like slower paced shows, just be aware that, despite being about kendo, this isn\'t a driving action series. It\'s more about the 5 girls, their teacher, and the 2 guys that are part of the high school kendo club. I especially like the fact that the characters, particularly the boys, are NOT the usual Anime stereotypes, and obvious ""potential romantic connections"" don\'t occur, which is good. I think there could\'ve been a lot more character development, but it\'s still a good...series and has several very memorable characters; which is more than I can say about a lot of shows.

I also recommend another series [a personal favorite] ""Princess Nine"" which is also a particularly well done high school sports Anime series.

The Prize a night of free Sushi.So the story begins with the active kendo loving member running around with the teacher to search for potential applicants. and stumbles upon a Kendo master Shoujou. The story therefore begins...The anime starts of slowly, but at a good pace, introducing the characters, and focusing on character development for them all. the action is precise and well executed, I find myself mesmorised by Tama's battle cry and TSUKI attacks.Overall it is funny, some scenes of romantic development, and growth into maturity.

But then I'm simply not that type.STORYPretty simple premise: guy in charge of the club looks to make a group of kendo chicks to compete with his ex-kendo mate's team, so that he can have a shot at his buddy's promised reward: free food for a year.Not terribly exciting, and the way the teacher just manages to put together a team of skilled kendo experts screams plot device. Plus the couple of filler episodes distract from the...main storyline, and not at the best times either.Still, having a simple plot means there are no big plotholes to drop your balls over, and the progression in the story is for the most part smooth.ARTThe main weakness of this anime. The animation quality is at best functional, and at worst, obviously flawed and jarring. It gets readily apparent that the studio had typically thrown its budget at the first episode; the quality degradation after that is obvious, with many features out of position, and the background detail a bare minimum. Fortunately it does pick up a bit near the end (as expected).The designs aren't very eye-catching (with the notable exception of the oh-so-moe Tama-chan), but the characters have been drawn very distinctively, with no chance of mistaking a person for anyone else.SOUNDFunctional. The OP/ED is typical, and the BGM (a decent if apparently hackjob-style effort) doesn't vary much.CHARACTERHere the anime really shines.

The animation quality is at best functional, and at worst, obviously flawed and jarring. It gets readily apparent that the studio had typically thrown its budget at the first episode; the quality degradation after that is obvious, with many features out of position, and the background detail a bare minimum. Fortunately it does pick up a bit near the end (as expected).The designs aren't very eye-catching (with the notable exception of the oh-so-moe Tama-chan), but the characters have been drawn very distinctively, with no chance of mistaking a person for anyone else.SOUNDFunctional. The OP/ED is typical, and the BGM (a decent if apparently hackjob-style effort) doesn't vary much.CHARACTERHere the anime really shines.

Certainly worth a watch."", 'Bamboo Blade is easily in my top 3 animes. It is a truly refreshing slice of life show. Muroe High\'s Kendo team is run by a struggling kendo teacher who lost himself years ago. His students don\'t take him seriously, and they look to the youngest member, a Kendo prodigy, for their training. While the story mostly takes our crew through tournaments and practice meets, the sports aspect really takes a backseat to the bigger picture. The show focuses mostly on the true meaning of Kendo; the name of the sport literally means ""the way of the sword.” The true focus is the growth of...the characters outside of their sport. That is what I like best about the show. As a martial artist myself, I know that life is more about the journey than the destination. Every character has their unique quirk that makes them seem real, and even the incredible Tamaki finds her shortcomings in life.When it comes to the story, Bamboo Blade is a very lighthearted show. Every episode is full of humor, and the serious moments are well broken up to keep the mood light. It feels good to watch the characters progress, with a pace that is just right for the series. The art is very well drawn, especially in portraying a realistic Kendo match. Of course, the silly cartoonish style comes out in the humor, with Tama\'s blank O_O face and Kirino\'s signature =3 smile. Musically, there is deceptively little in the background. The lack of sound is never noticeable, as I had to dig through episodes and listen to notice it for the review. Dialogue and sound effects make up the bulk, and any music is basically battle-style drums and trumpet.I like the series so much that I actually bought the manga. The two go hand in hand, but there is one thing I wish the anime had incorporated. Miya Miya is sweet on the outside to her friends and boyfriends, but in reality she is bad to the bone. This aspect is shown much deeper in the manga than in the anime, and one small detail I feel important is Miya Miya’s secret habit of smoking. It\'s a small thing to pick at, but it gave the character a chance to reflect upon her darker thoughts as the Miya Miya we don’t normally get to see.This show is a must watch. the characters outside of their sport.

While I do not think it really excels in any particular way, it's a nice series that is easy to watch and provides enjoyable entertainment.Set in a high school kendo club, it is mostly a school sports comedy that contains well known plot elements such as personal growth, changing yourself, achieving set goals, finding a purpose and keeping your spirit strong to overcome challenges.The characters are not incredibly original but most are presented well enough. Throughout the main cast you have more typical characters such as Ishida the sloppy kendo teacher...that lacks goals and motivation, Tamaki the quiet and reserved girl that is a kendo prodigy, Yuuji the considerate and nice childhood friend, Saya the wild and outgoing girl, Azuma the shy bespectacled bookworm, etc...But some characters do offer some surprise since their true nature is a juxtaposition of their overall image, Miyako, who first seems to be the polite beauty turns out to have a dark and aggressive streak, Azuma, who despite her bookworm looks and ways isn't a good student at all, Kirino, the seemingly air-headed and fun loving team captain is in fact always dependable, she is the very glue that holds the kendo club together.  I'm not sure if that's true as well of Tamaki, she's portrayed as also being a bit of an otaku, she is a huge fan of  &ldquo;Blade Braver&rdquo; (a fictional series that appears in this fictional series...) and even manages to have a small role in a &ldquo;Blade Braver&rdquo; movie, at which time she also meets Rin, who turns out to be a nemesis and a friend at the same time.So despite characters that are not really original, none come off poorly, and throughout the series, the way they interact with each other in their kendo club, how they grow and change actually works out quite nicely and makes for one of the series' strongest points.As the main character, Tamaki's story is played out most, supported by the rest of the cast and her interaction with the others, she ends up carrying the series well. Despite her past, one doesn't really feel sorry for her or overly admires her tremendous kendo skills, but you still inevitably start rooting for her. Her plot evolution and character growth was also paced well, from the few revelations, challenges, setbacks, victories and people she meets and befriends. The other kendo club members also each go through changes and evolution, some more than others.The bonds of friendship between the different kendo club members was nice to see. Especially Kirino and Saya's bond seemed quite strong, with some vague hints that there may be a bit more than meets the eye, especially on Saya's part. Or so it seems from one scene near the end, but that may just be wishful thinking.I was let down by the final episodes though. Several plot arcs are built up towards the final episodes, involving most major characters so one would expect quite a climactic ending, but most plots are concluded rather rapidly in barely a few scenes in the second to last episode, leaving the last episode to be one long epilogue of which the final scenes seem to hint at or provide the opportunity for another season to follow.Animation throughout the series is good but not exceptional, the main female cast are all drawn very cutesy, plus they are well recognizable and different, from their physique, facial expressions, to hair style and colour. Which is a great plus as quite often you'll see them in full kendo gear, so it could have gotten quite tricky to recognize them. The style used for the character's eyes isn't one seen all too often too.The overall soundtrack is not exceptional, it is just all right. I wasn't too fond of the opening or ending tracks though, not that they were bad, they felt like standard fare and the opening didn't especially make me feel excited about the coming episode.In conclusion, while this series doesn't contain any extraordinary element, the overall sum somehow proves to be more than its individual parts and will no doubt be an enjoying series to watch for all. that lacks goals and motivation, Tamaki the quiet and reserved girl that is a kendo prodigy, Yuuji the considerate and nice childhood friend, Saya the wild and outgoing girl, Azuma the shy bespectacled bookworm, etc...But some characters do offer some surprise since their true nature is a juxtaposition of their overall image, Miyako, who first seems to be the polite beauty turns out to have a dark and aggressive streak, Azuma, who despite her bookworm looks and ways isn't a good student at all, Kirino, the seemingly air-headed and fun loving team captain is in fact always dependable, she is the very glue that holds the kendo club together.

Is it possible?Yes, it is. Bamboo blade manages to do that, and with flag flapping out high. Fights really are short, as in kendo, and not something like a episode-per-battle things that you see in many different animes (or, in DBZ format, battles take 10 episodes...) Main caharcters are also human-like, they all have even the bad sides and can feel negative emotions about things. None of the characters are really weak for the show, and everyone's thoughts and life is shown somehow. None of the characters are left out. With this many...characters (6), it's quite an achievement.Series also shows the hard part of the kendo: training, training and more training. Basic training can sometimes feel really like hell (for me, it felt useless at start), but then you start to get the hang of it and it becomes something you enjoy. This is also greatly shown up in the series. Also, there are some who kinda bend the rules (even one of the main characters), but mostly series show the idea of Kendokan.The series still leaves some small things a bit open-out answered, but that can be passed as the fact that main characters have no way of finding them out. Also, comedy works well, as mentionet early. Mostly character's faces do the jokes, and it really works. Series also sometimes make it seem like they want to joke about how the characters think about something and somebody knows what they think. In Bamboo blade, characters often answer into questions other people say to themselves in their head. It's kind of refreshing since usually I get irritaded for the fact that everybody knows what others are thinking in the anime without telling it.For overall, I have just one thing to say: Kendo is way of caring, not way of hurting.

No, not in particular, I can\'t recall actually laughing once throughout the entire 26 episodes—maybe at best a smirk?Are the characters really all the great?  No, they aren\'t that in depth, and many of them are naively annoying!.Is the action superb? Far from it.  I doubt kendo in real life would even be very enjoyable to watch.  This isn\'t a real sword fight... It is with sticks.The one romance in the show, they blatantly...make fun of because it is so absurd.But what took the cake for me to rate this abysmal waste of time so poorly?  Episode 23.  That episode sums up the worthlessness of these characters.This epsiode involves delinquents that never show up and end up potentially damaging the club.  They are bullies and terrible people, yet these fools contemplate protecting them!?!? WHY!?! I cannot understand this ignorant, naive notion.  THEY WEREN\'T EVEN THERE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR, YET STILL CONSIDERED PART OF THE TEAM?!!? HOW????? This show was not great until this episode, but this absolutely RUINED any small trace of passable this anime had left.  Naive characters are NOT cute, they are ANNOYING—and this is a PRIME example of it.Also, Tamaka getting mad at him for taking the tall stance to get her practicing better against it.... And she says ""I don\'t appreciate the joke..."" WOW, be grateful Yuji is trying to help you with something you suck at!AND the way the ""sensei"" talks all low and slow IS SO GD ANNOYING!This anime panders to weak emotional strings, with a naive attempt, and an annoying cast of characters.Bottom-line: if you don\'t like sappy, unnecessarily long-drawn out animes—then don\'t watch this. make fun of because it is so absurd.But what took the cake for me to rate this abysmal waste of time so poorly?

As far as the story goes, I have to say it is pretty straight forward, but much obliged as it is still fun watch.

We follow a group of student and there instructor who all attend the same highschool and are members of the kendo team and who we get to know there day...to day training and comedic adventures.Characthers: The characters are probably the series best feature as each one have there own distinctive personality and you can relate on a more real world level, we have the instructor Toraji ishida the almost broke but fair hearted teacher and as for member teams we have Tamaki the main female lead and kendo prodigy who is trying to learn the true meaning of the kendo sport as well as to establish real social connections, we have the Kirino the captain of the team the passionate leader and bumbling fool but with a heart of gold that acts as the teams moral compass, We have Miya the complete rookie who struggles with inner violent tendencies and her ability to win but has absolute loyalty and cherishes her love life with her boyfriend, We also have Sayako the person with the ever changing interest and hardship in managing her writing career but still makes time for kendo and than finally we got Satori the ever bumbling idiot and clutz who her struggles in her studies make you question if she will ever graduate but her kendo technqiues are so good it could be her hidden talent.All of who are unique and offer an interesting variety in the cast and you just enjoy watching them together in all sort of comedic situations but also as the show progresses you see them grow and cope with there own difficulties and struggles for anyone of there years and learn to progress trough with the help of kendo.Animation: This series as of time of writing is over 13 years old and it has somewhat aged when even compared to other titles that aired around that time but it is still fair, the action sequences in particular during the sporting combats are quite detailed and layered all it needs is a little upscale in BD and it should be fine but dvd quality is still good.Sound: The opening and ending theme songs were both made by the very studio that produced with the primary voice cast voicing the songs and they really capture the feel of the sport by adding colorful beats and using traditional music in similair fashion to represent the traditional sport of kendo. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty standard just enough to keeps things going smoothly, i dont see any real note worth mention aside from these but soundtracks were not really the major thing for most anime productions anyway.Enjoyment: Overall i found it very entertaining and it really gives u an insight into the sport of kendo which is not really that popular outside of japan but still has a world wide presence and it give u a good perspective about it, so much that even inspired me to at least give it a shot. The Comedy can be over the top sometimes but no more than the usual stuff and a little laughter is good for you, What i really liked tough is the atmosphere of competitive sporting and the development of the characters as they competited with other teams and individuals, i am sure anybody can at least find someone that might relate as the diverse cast of personalities make it more appeal. I recommend this to anyone who eighter has an interest in kendo, competitive sport or even just looking for a nice school comedy series.

Bamboo Blade has an amazing cast, great voice acting(seriously, the shouts are quite believable and they don\'t sound forced - and there\'s a lot of shouting in kendo) and engaging action sequences - with a memorably soundtrack to top it all off. However, it falls flat when it comes to character development and story. Half of the cast doesn\'t really change...much in terms of personality - I\'d go as far as to say that on occassion, some of the characters are completely ignored, appearing for a scene or two, which doesn\'t seem right if they are considered part of the main cast. What\'s worse is that this time is instead spent on possibly one of the duller characters - Tama, who sadly evolves into the protagonist of the show. Don\'t get me wrong, she isn\'t a bad character, but I feel Bamboo Blade had a perfect set up for a ""decentralized"" show, where each character was important, but midway they arbitrarily decided that Tama is to take 3/4 of the spotlight. All in all, as far as story is concerned, I feel like the team behind Bamboo Blade was figuring it out as they went - some plot decisions seemed odd to me, as if made in haste. I think this is generally a fine anime that had quite some potential, but made the wrong turns. much in terms of personality - I\'d go as far as to say that on occassion, some of the characters are completely ignored, appearing for a scene or two, which doesn\'t seem right if they are considered part of the main cast.

Although that might make it sound like a shonen series, it certainly is not, but it dances on that line between shonen and seinen very well. Ostensibly about a kendo instructor and his struggles with a high school club, it's really about a young kendo prodigy named Tamaki who matures into a young woman through the course of the series.The series is short on plot, and since this was my first real sports anime...I'm not really used to that . They basically go from one tournament to another, with lots of training in between and little drama. It didn't have much to draw from, since the manga is also weak in this respect.The art and sound are passable, the fight scenes are well done, but some reuse of material towards the end becomes conspicuous. I'm not crazy about the opening or ending, and I really don't like Tama's voice, which sounds way too young even for that character.The characters obviously make the show, and all the girls are distinct and likable. It does a very good job of developing each personality, and is very patient introducing them.There's even a happy couple in the mix, which seems rather rare in anime these days.Overall, a light anime with cute characters, it should leave you feeling happy after each viewing.Favorite Character: Dan the ManCrushing on: SayaFavorite Episode: 22Favorite Song: Track #19 Yugure I'm not really used to that .

Then I watched Crunchyroll’s anime academy of sports anime and was intrigued by the ideal of learning more about a given sport by watching an anime about it. Also, many years ago, I read a review of Bamboo Blade that made me want to watch it. So I finally did and wasn’t disappointed.The first thing I want to point out is there’s no “supernatural” or fantastic fantasy elements to this series. They’re all...normal people with normal human abilities. And no one is innately good at a sport they’ve never tried or applies skills and abilities from some other sport, game etc. to the sport of kendo.The characters are diverse without being clichéd. They’re relatable and real, with a sense of real human emotions. Another shining point is the humor. It has it’s funny moments that are reserved for the appropriate time and place, without devolving into slapstick characteristic of a dedicated comedy. It was just an fun happy go luck show.As much as I enjoyed this series I do have my complaints. My first is the fact that Asuma doesn’t appear for half the series. She’s on the opening credits (which doesn’t change) but not in the first half of the series. This is a problem because she provides cohesion to the cast. There’s something missing without her, like a band with no bass player. Her contribution is minimum but when she arrives you realise what was missing.Also, it wasn’t as educational as I’d hoped. I wanted to learn more about the sport and did learn a little. Just not as much I’d hoped to learn. But it was fun, dramatic and funny and worth the time to watch. I also think it works as a gateway anime for people looking to get into anime. normal people with normal human abilities.

There’s something missing without her, like a band with no bass player. Her contribution is minimum but when she arrives you realise what was missing.Also, it wasn’t as educational as I’d hoped. I wanted to learn more about the sport and did learn a little. Just not as much I’d hoped to learn. But it was fun, dramatic and funny and worth the time to watch. I also think it works as a gateway anime for people looking to get into anime.', ""I don't always watch sports anime but when I do, usually the first few episodes are deciding factor on whether keep watching or not. Bamboo Blade is one of the anime's that has hooked me in and didn't and kept me going until the very end, but that was just my experience.Story/Character:The story about a high school kendo club that is mostly comprised of girls, I won't get to much into details but despite have a few male members in the club the story mostly centers around the girls but there really isn't a main character as the focus of the show tends to shift...from one character to the other.Now being a sports anime the plot isn't the most complicated thing in the world and is pretty straight forward and the characters are probably the main meat of the story aside from the kendo (sword fighting) matches. For the most part the characterization and character development are pretty good but aren't perfect.I feel like they could have went into more detail about some things, especially the kendo matches which really help move the characters along, the characters really change but a lot of the girl's matches are summed up in a quick 2 second transition on whether they won or lost which was a big deal for them, and I would have liked to actually see the all fights in more real time and it also would have been cool if they had actually broken down some of the strategy and the techniques they used during the matches and they could have also emphasized some of the work and training they characters had to go through and make the stakes for each fight feel as high as they actually were.However that is really the only complaint that I have about this show and even after having that said about the kendo matches and such fights are still entertaining and there really isn't to much wrong with this show.This anime isn't a 110% super serious show and it does have is laid back moment of comedic relief and slice of life but over all it's relatively well balanced.Art/Sound:I don't have much to say in this category other than the art wasn't bad but I have seen better and to be honest the sound track was kind of forgettable, though there were moments where I wanted to replace some of the soundtracks with that of Hajime no Ippo; another sports anime about boxing but that's just me.Sub/Dub:Yes there is an english dub and compared to it's subbed counter part, I could care less about which one you watch, granted I have my personal taste but to be critical here, I can't really say that one is better than the other at this point, however I will say that the dub pretty solid with no awkward moments within dialog that I tend to find in other dubs and the voice acting was passable and I didn't have any problem with it. As for the japanese voice acting, well I don't have much to say other than it sounds like a the vast majority of anime in japanese and I wasn't particularly moved by it, but for this anime I could care less which version you watch.Final verdict:Overall I would rate this as an 8/10 and I think it's worth a try. from one character to the other.Now being a sports anime the plot isn't the most complicated thing in the world and is pretty straight forward and the characters are probably the main meat of the story aside from the kendo (sword fighting) matches.

Also one of my earlier animes that I\'ve seen.Okay so it\'s a slice and life, martial arts (kendo specifically) and comedy anime. It revolves around 5 girls who are more or less good at kendo or hitting things with a stick... Plus our male characters who help out on the side and set the story sailing.So first up lets talk about the intro, like the first 2 mins into the anime you\'ll probably think, wtf did I just download a initial D anime by accident?!So with that misunderstanding out of the way lets introduce our CHARACTERS!______________________________________________________________First up...the star of the show, Kawazoe Tama! She is a tiny character who has a big heart! She is into anime in particular shounen, super hero ones, which has influenced her into being a hero of justice as well. The only downside is that she has a lack of interest in most things, quite plain, quiet and unable make facial expressions. However due to her household having a dojo, which mainly men attend has honed her skills on par if not better than most men.Next up, our energetic over hyped captain, Chiba Kirino. She is one of the oldest member of dojo, excluding all of the third years that have graduated/do not attend. She is a very caring senpai, at times and has a strong sense of family, even taking a break at kendo if needed. She has big ambitions such has winning nationals with her team and is always trying to motivate her instructor.Now we have Kinrino\'s weirdo friend, Kuwahara Sayoko. This girl is as energetic as Kirino and is also one of the older members. However she is much more impulsive and tends to have mood swings which leads to her switching hobbies every now and then. The two of them are best friends and a great comedic combo.Now we have the blac- I mean pink ranger of the group, Miyazaki Miyako. She has a pretty face and a blacken heart who only has eyes for her boyfriend... F#ck. she is a very dedicated girlfriend and tries very hard to hide her true nature from her boyfriend, but when he is not around she doesn\'t mind being violent, rude and anything unladylike.Our final girl, Girl of the hour that showed up when our heroes needed her most Azuma Satori! She is clumsy beyond belief, slow but somehow a great swords-women. She prioritizes studying above all for the sake of her parents.Now introducing our male characters! First off we have Tama-chan\'s old friend and ""guardian"". He ranked at the top ten for national or regionals, I\'m not too sure. But he is quite a normal character and plays as the straight man in the comedy. I really liked this kind of character even I started anime, no wonder I like shinpachi from gintama.Next up, Yuuji\'s friend Eiga Danjuurou. This egg like guy is as fragile as an actual egg... But he has girls fighting over him... WTF! This is retarded. Well, because of his \'experience\' in relationships, he tends to give love advice to his fellow male members much to their disliking.And finally our last main character, the main gear that sets this story in motion! Ishida Toraji! The story/plot revolves entirely on his financial problems.... Seriously, but he is a great comedy relief character, however a terrible instructor, doesn\'t really teach anyone anything but their all good anyways... Lacks motivation aside from money and in general a good example of what an adult is not suppose to do.Art,OST etc.That took awhile to get through so I\'ll just fly through the rest. Art is decent for its time, OST, nothing that I remember as outstanding but the opening is definitely catchy.Now the character development of the girls in particular is pretty well done and gives enough screen time for each girl and definitely adds more depth to them than when they are first introduced, in particular Miyako!______________________________________________________________OVERALL:-Now overall, I really enjoyed this anime, a nice mix of comedy, drama and a slash of intense kendo sparring and even a bit of sword fighting. And oh man the ending twist was crazy and a couple even gets married and woah it\'s good. So watch this great story of friendship, passion and justice! the star of the show, Kawazoe Tama!

So watch this great story of friendship, passion and justice!', 'SPOILER-FREE!There are two things that one can learn watching anime that take place in high school – there is no shortage of after school clubs to choose from, and you can bank on the fact that there will likely be a lot of girls in those clubs. It doesn’t matter if the club in question is one that has an activity associated with “traditional femininity” or not; as long as there is even the remotest chance of a club existing, not only will there be an anime about it, but that it will also likely have a large female cast.""Bamboo Blade"" was one such property...that got this treatment, using kendo as the dramatic vehicle of choice. Released in 2007, the series came during that period of time when “moe” as a concept was undergoing a bit of a renaissance and restructuring. But aside from that, I didn’t know anything else going in. I have never taken up kendo before, nor did I have any particular interest in watching a sparring match in real life. For all I knew though, this series could at least help give me some appreciation for it.As he worries about the fact that he has virtually no money and little food to eat, high school instructor Ishida Toraji meets with his senpai Ishibari Kenzaburo and makes a bet: if the group of five girls from Ishida’s kendo club can defeat Kenzaburo’s group instead, Ishida will win a year’s supply of sushi. With newfound enthusiasm for kendo, he seeks to expand the team’s roster from its lone member, Chiba Kirino. Such characters will include the reserved and tiny Kawazoe Tamaki, the supposedly-charming Miyazaki Miyako, the pessimistic Kuwahara Sayako, and the book dumb Azuma Satori.The premise affords a kind of comedic cynicism that tinges some of the dialogues and discussions that transpire. Under normal circumstances, the team of cute girls would be gathered either through their original love of the sport or because they were shown a way in which the sport could somehow teach them something about life or themselves. While large portions of that is definitely true in ""Bamboo Blade,"" with the characters undergoing some aspect of personal growth through their team bonding, Ishida makes for a good subversion of the supportive coach. His motivation for forming the team in the first place is one entirely rooted in selfish desire. Granted, it’s a rather understandable desire to not starve, but the fact that his heart is less-than-pure in this aspect makes him a rather fun presence.And the cast as a whole is a lot of fun as well. Though they may not deviate too far from the familiar archetypes one would expect from a series like this, the camaraderie and joviality makes most of the dialogues and sequences delightful. As a central character, Tamaki is the adorable prodigy who wows all that come into contact with her shinai, while Kirino is the ball of fiery gumption that manages to always have a smile on her face and make amusing light of most situations. As the cast size gradually increases, each of the girls gradually expands the scope of ""Bamboo Blade’s"" comedic potential.But given that the series is twenty-six episodes long, it’s unfortunate that not every character is given an appropriate amount of character or comedy to demonstrate. Of the main five girls, Satori is given markedly-less material to work with, both in terms of actions that she performs and personality development she undergoes throughout the run. The other four girls are given more than enough expansion to help make them fun characters, and even the club’s boys get enough time in the sun. Satori is introduced to the cast as the final member, so while it’s true that there just isn’t enough of the run remaining to adequately flesh her out, it’s a problem that I find should have been taken more carefully into consideration. It’s not that Satori is a bad character per se, but rather that she’s just not quite as much of a character as everyone else.Also a slight problem is that not every battle that took place during the run was featured. One of the tournaments only includes the highlights from a single bout Tamaki performed, leaving the following scene to have Ishida vaguely talk about the other participants’ matches. Considering that kendo is the main element that binds all the main characters together, it’s an unusual decision to skimp out on what were supposed to be the culminations of all their hard work and training. ""Bamboo Blade"" may be a comedy, but not including more actual fights was an unfortunate miscalculation.The matches that are featured though, even in individual rounds, are well-done. The rapidity of kendo strikes and the movement of the combatants are captured nicely, with a lot of noise from screams, clacking shinai, and stylized line work. The fights themselves may occasionally be brief, but each one has a strong kinetic energy that keeps things moving at a good pace, even in still-frame. If anything, the fights being such a positive of the show make my previous point about not every battle being included all the more disappointing.Thankfully, the series does indeed make up for this disappointment through its handling of tone. It rapidly shifts between light-hearted barbs that have little to do with anything to outbursts. ""Bamboo Blade"" manages to strike comedic beats relatively consistently, both of the slapstick and off-kilter variety. It affords a kind of unpredictability to the various scenarios, as I was never quite sure which kind of comedy the show was going to be throwing at me at a given moment. Regardless of which type it picked, I more often than not was at least amused, if not smiling or laughing.But as one may expect from a story like this, there reaches a point where the comedy takes a backseat and the more-dramatic aspects of the sport take place. The final main arc of the series occurs after a particularly stressful tournament, and the ensuing aftermaths of what happens there are faced head-on, and it’s solid. What makes this portion of the story work is that all the dramatic beats it’s going for are things that were hinted at throughout the course of the series, even if only in small doses. The resulting tension thus comes across as naturally built-up, allowed time to properly germinate into a compelling conflict.The landing from that conflict, however, is not so clean. Most of the underlying problems the characters are facing end up getting resolved within the span of a single episode. While on some level this rapid wrapping up of the issues makes sense given that the series is primarily a comedy, it seems that ""Bamboo Blade"" wasn’t terribly keen on letting the drama build up for too long. Perhaps the underlying thought is that if drama takes centerstage and oversteps, the change of pace would be too alienating. Frankly, I wish that it had stayed. It also teases a second season within the last episode’s final seconds which, even at the time of this writing, never materialized outside of the manga. It\'s upsetting that the show never got to see that potential realized, whatever it could have been.And the reason why it’s upsetting is that, as flawed as the show could sometimes be, it was always a delightful watch. It is not a perfect series by any stretch, but there were indeed many moments where I simply had a good time watching it. Rather than being a series of dull outings, it managed to pull off its own brand of fun. For better or worse, the show is simplistic, and this time around the block, it worked towards its appeal. Plus, I would be lying if I said that after finishing a couple of episodes at a time, I didn’t hear those kendo screams echoing in my head.Bamboo ""Blade"" may not necessarily offer much variety in the girls’ sports club type of school anime as far as character is concerned, but it has its own spunkiness and aesthetic charm that gives it life. The premise affords a kind of comedic cynicism and slapstick that works more often than it doesn’t, and the actual fights were well-done. I did grow to get a new sort of appreciation for kendo, and while my general aversion to sports anime may not have been fixed by it, watching this show was a pleasure. that got this treatment, using kendo as the dramatic vehicle of choice.

I did grow to get a new sort of appreciation for kendo, and while my general aversion to sports anime may not have been fixed by it, watching this show was a pleasure.', 'As it is very obvious from the title, this anime tells a story about girls (and some boys) doing kendo. A sport anime, without a doubt, with a shounen feels embedded strongly in it. What does this anime tell us beyond “cute girls doing kendo”? The answer is....a journey.Kendo is a journey to better our ownselves. Im not practicing kendo, but that sentece is just something that i re-wrote from what i saw in this anime. People may start kendo with small or even ridiculous reason, but after they get deep into kendo, they’ll be set off to an internal journey. Yes, a journey indeed,...and journey means character development.Character development is, in my opinion, the strongest point that this anime has. I am not telling that the other aspects of this anime are bad. Nope. But if we watch from the start till the end, what we will feel first is about character development - like Tamaki’s development to find her reason swinging her shinai, as well as Miya Miya’s. And how Ishida sensei developed from uncool, egoistic teacher to a teacher that sacrificed himself for his students (in a way, that’s quite cool). Even the plainest character like Yuuji (this is not my opinion, this is the characters opinion in anime) had a subtle yet strong development in this anime.By all means, these character developments aren’t the best case in anime world. But they are still something worth to note down in our mind and heart. These developments feel like embodiments of the soul of kendo itself, then manifested in many ways depending on who is doing the kendo. What i mean is one person way of sword differs from others. Each person has their own development in their own track, that what makes this anime so beautiful.Speaking about other technical aspects, i think it’s good except for the sound part, specifically the choice of the seiyuus. Many characters have seiyuu that don’t fit with their roles. This case is pretty similar to Shokugeki no Souma’s and it can lessen the characterization of those involved. And also, this anime needs more chibi form :3For the ending part of the review, i strongly suggest to try anime version and manga version of this title. Yes, they are different -  anime version and manga version differ quite great after the second half of the anime (and the second half of the manga). To put it simply, the anime version focuses on more shounen-ic vibe while the manga version focuses on what beyond kendo as a sport.The story writer, Masahiro Totsuka sensei, stated in the afterword of the manga that he hoped Ishida’s development would have an effect to the reader. I think his statement worth something to try, or at least, that’s what i did and i found it very amazing. So try to read/see both versions and compare which one have more effect in you ~ and journey means character development.Character development is, in my opinion, the strongest point that this anime has.

Up to ep 18, the show is good.Bamboo Blade is sometimes very old and isn\'t up to par, but at other times, its great points shine through and out-shadow the crappier parts.And what really makes Bamboo Blade something that isn\'t an obsolete 2007 anime are the characters and comedy. While everything is dated, the one thing that Bamboo Blade manages to have is a good slice-of-life comedy with kendo involved. Kirino is a pretty playful Kendo captain. She takes care of the team and it feels like she takes responsibility for the...team, but for the most is generally laid back and doesn\'t take things too seriously. She plays pranks and does some absurd things sometimes, and is a great pair with Saya, who is kind of a wild card boke, kind of ranging from a plethora of emotions and thoughts at a given time, but generally acts as a playful friend that cares for Kirino. And Kirino definitely reminds me of Nijika from Bocchi the Rock, just that Kirino\'s more comedically playful and laid back, while Nikijika is still a bit serious, despite her unreliability as a leader.Yuuji is basically a carbon copy of Shinpachi from Gintama. Yes, Yuuji\'s more serious and less of a tsukommi, but I think it\'s just Shinpachi adapting to the comedic style of Bamboo Blade\'s universe. The same voice actor, Daisuke Sakaguchi, voices the role, and I have a pretty good feeling that the reason he voiced it was because of his typecasting in Gintama as a serious, but kind of bland kendo practitioner. All in all, I can\'t say I hate Yuuji, since who can hate Shinpachi?Miyamiya and Dan are kind of an interesting pair because, by themselves, Dan is just a complete comedic relief character that gets made fun of, but because Miyamiya is attached to him, he\'s somewhat of a normal character. Miyamiya is the same, with her whole gimmick from turning ""black"" to normal being a little too one note for a comedy, but again, the fact that they\'re a pair really diversifies them in the situations that can pan out.Ishida, again, kind of reminds me of Gintoki from Gintama. He\'s a penny pincher, always poor, tries to cook up schemes to make money no matter what happens, and isn\'t seen as a role model adult. He\'s a bit sloppy, and never really takes teaching super seriously. Overall, a great addition to the cast of characters, and allows the Kendo to have the laid-back atmosphere that it has.Tama is a typical stoic, genius-type kendo character that doesn\'t really talk much, but surprisingly fits well in a multitude of comedic, and also more serious settings and dialogues.Even the other characters and other teams that they do joint practices with are really good. Their interactions with Muroe High\'s Kendo team are pretty fun and a change of pace. No complaints about the comedy or characters.Bamboo Blade is able to function both as a laid-back comedy but also focuses on Kendo seriously in competitions. People\'s skill level, emotional investment, training, and habits get displayed in official matches, and while the competitions are clearly not the sole focus, the fact that I still get invested in the outcome of matches shows that Bamboo Blade doesn\'t just have Kendo as a passing theme. The comedy is also quite brilliant, not losing its luster in 2023. I\'ve got to say, the animation is dreadful, and you clearly won\'t like the show for its animation, but the show does do a good job at pacing out comedic segments, and nails the chibi facial expressions when needed. Those small details, with of course, the contents and the delivery of the gags are quite well made and it\'s the reason why I stuck with it so long.Then came the filler. I was alright with crappy animation. Reused frames, and boring or nonexistent backgrounds. I cannot tolerate this crappy filler in the last 8 episodes. I will admit. I was hoodwinked for a solid 5 episodes. The filler doesn\'t start off that terribly, actually. I think that tying in Tama\'s obsession with Braver and how losing is a life experience is actually really well done. However, then came the melodrama. This was really a left field, and I didn\'t expect a comedy anime to have such crappy melodrama for a finale. Sure enough, after checking out the manga, I confirmed that the finale arc with the melodrama was a complete filler. The quality drops considerably, and there are no gags at all, nor is there slice-of-life content. I can\'t blame the manga. The anime production studio just decided that some crappy melodramatic finale would suit the show. team, but for the most is generally laid back and doesn\'t take things too seriously. She plays pranks and does some absurd things sometimes, and is a great pair with Saya, who is kind of a wild card boke, kind of ranging from a plethora of emotions and thoughts at a given time, but generally acts as a playful friend that cares for Kirino.

It reminded me heavily of Jinki:Extend and School Days, which I guess isn’t a very flattering-sounding comparison, but still. The characters are drawn with a bright, cute style, and the backgrounds are impressively detailed. The big thing here is the subtlety of the animation, which is extremely important considering the personality of one of the characters. There are many moments throughout the show where there will be just a tiny movement of a person’s head or mouth or hand, but will convey a lot of meaning and make the show that much more immersive....There was no lazy animation that I could see, and it felt a lot like the animators really put a lot of care into making this show. It may not look like Redline or Shakugan no Shana Final, but you can tell that the animators really wanted this anime to look good. Then on top of the great drawing and animation, there are the colors – OH MY GOD THE COLORS. The coloring is so incredibly bright and happy and bubbly, it’s almost like an assault on the retinae. Maybe some people don’t go for bright colors, but since I’m color blind, I love them and I think it made the show that much better looking.The one thing I would fault Bamboo Blade’s visual department on is how they avoided animating the actual kendo scenes. Although the anime is about kendo, they usually make the matches very short, and with as little actual animation as they can. In some cases, they actually skipped the matches altogether, preferring, I suppose, to not waste time animating them. Near the end of the show this trend starts to cease, as more matches are properly animated (and damn did they look good), but for most of the show, it’s a rather annoying problem.As weird as it may sound, I actually found a surprisingly strong similarity to K-On! for the first three-fourths of the anime. The main, obvious comparison is the moe, which both shows have in SPADES. However, whereas K-On! has girls who are extremely moe for the sake of moe, Bamboo Blade does a slightly different thing by actually designing properly interesting characters which also somehow have tons of moe as well. It’s weird, saying that the girls are both moe and strong literary characters, but it’s true. All five of the main girls are very deep, layered people with backstories, diverse character traits, and recognizable habits that make them feel pretty real. It’s extremely impressive when considering how lovable they are on top of that.The other comparison I found was the storytelling style, which, for the majority of the show, is reminiscent of K-On!. Both shows have some kind of common factor that the story centers on – kendo in Bamboo Blade, music in K-On! – but the story doesn’t focus on that. Rather, it’s treated as a sort of medium through which stories about the characters are told instead. In both cases, it’s relaxing and fun to watch, with very little stress, which is something that I really enjoy. Around episode 23 or 24 is when Bamboo Blade turns away from that relaxed storytelling and introduces some actual drama. In those last few episodes, there was plenty angst and tension to be had, and then a very good ending that I really enjoyed. I won’t go into details, but just know that it won’t stay as laidback as the first 20+ episodes would have you believe.In summary, Bamboo Blade was a really good anime that was lots of fun to watch. If you’re watching the show for moe, you’ll definitely like it. If you’re watching it for the sports focus, I wouldn’t be so sure. It may be “about” kendo, but in the end, it’s characters first; kendo second.

At least for me, it\'s a slice of life, comedy anime with a kendo setting. It can be funny at times as well. So, if you want a kendo anime with comedy and cute girls doing cute girl things, you\'ll like it.I thought the writing was lazy sometimes, like the senior bully character. He was an interesting character, that could have been used better, but they showed him in start, forgot about him for 20 episodes then brought him back again randomly to create some tension, then he\'s gone again lol.They...introduced a stalker as well in the middle of the show and hyped her up like it\'s gonna have some big character arc, but then forgot about her and just showed her randomly in between when she stalks miya-miya. You can take her out of most of the scenes in this anime, and it still wouldn\'t have any impact on the show. goes to show, how useless that character was.And there are several other nitpicks like this that just make this show...well....kinda meh.It\'s not bad at all, it can be funny, but that\'s all it is for me.Another issue I had was that, the teacher who is supposed to be very important and even is one of the main characters, is just showed so weak, how can I take him and his students seriously, if their teacher is shown so weak and useless most of the time lel. I thought maybe he will grow with the students, and we would actually see him be great at kendo, but nah he\'s weaker than his student, so that\'s kinda underwhelming. But yea, if you want a laugh, and wanna watch cute girls doing kendo, go for it bud, I don\'t give a shit.

In Muroe high school Kendo club there are only a few (4 ) members out of which 2 are delinquant boys who do not let new members join and one eccentric saya chan who comes whenever she likes and leaves in a moment. Only the captain kirino stays. Now the main character, which i liked the most and sympathized with was the coach of the kendo club koujiro ( toraji). He is totally poor so he craves for delicious food to be feed by someone else as he lacked the money...to buy them. Even if he gets money, due to his extreme bad luck, that to will be taken away by the money lender.

The charatcers are nice shaped and mixed. You can find one for all flavours. Given the case that we are speaking of a group of friends, you have all the anime classical girls, from the shy kuudere Tama-chan, to the violent and loving yandere Miya-Miya. For most of the time I've been watching it, I had...a smile on my face, and that's surely something important.Second thing worth mentioning: this show has a nice pace. Apart from some brief slice of life episodes, the focus is pretty much always mantained. You will enjoy the developing every single member of the club, and their progress in the way of the sword. And this brings us to the most important thing:Kendo.This anime is about kendo. It truly is. I'll speak as a kendoka about this: letting alone the fact that the technical features of kendo are nicely (though not too thoroughly) described, I think Bamboo Blade can give someone who's never tried this beautiful martial art an idea of what it's like. It's something that makes you grow, and gives you the opportunity of meeting and getting to know incredible people. And it's damn funny (and during summer it makes you stink :3 But Kirino-senpai will explain you why this is also a funny part). It's not about swinging bamboo sticks.So if you're curious about kendo, and you want to learn something while enjoying a nice show, give this a try! a smile on my face, and that's surely something important.Second thing worth mentioning: this show has a nice pace.

The story is good; it encompasses varied contents: comedy comes first, followed by a bit of drama, handful of Kendo actions and a little sip of romance. There's nothing wrong with the artworks, female characters are really cute and their emotions are well expressed, visually. The only exception is some dull feeling I had during the Kendo scenes. This is hard to mention by words, it was like... lacking sharpness? or so. Anyway, voice-acting was of great standard. An example can be seen in the action scene, which was brought up to...life (regardless of the 'feeling' I mentioned) with voicing. Everything else is okay as far as I'm concerned. Be warned though, if you've already read the manga, you may get feeling similar to mine that something IS missing. (Set aside the fact that no further season is aired first! It's quite off topic)That comes to a mediocre scores for animation and enjoyment. I had to admit that I'm quite biased since I liked the manga better.

So if you do plan on watching be sure to have time on your hands, because you most likely will get cut off mid ep.... anywayBefore I started watching I knew nothing about kendo, and wondered if this would even be worth watching.  At first the story seems a bit dumb.  I mean it's about a guy that makes a bet with his friend for food because he is poor?!  How can something like that be interesting?  It does change, but that isn't...till later.Most of the main story is based around the teacher at first then switches over to the students.  A good thing that I liked about this anime was that is wasn't about just one person.  They tried to make the story a little bit about everyone.  It really brought the feeling a team together.  While at the same time the way they go about there daily lives is pretty funny.Nice thing is that it is appealing to the eye.  I must admit that just because I didn't like the way an anime looked I did not watch it.As for the songs, both the opening and the ending are quite catchy.  Other than that nothing special about the sound, but nothing awful either.Decently balanced characters.  You have a skilled kendo/anime lover (very unique, not something you normally expect), the childhood friend,  the klutz, a weird person, a team cap that is always energetic, the 30% BF 70% GF combo (in the anime the BF is very small and dorky looking, and the GF is just ....... wow out of his league.  You will understand what I mean about 30% 70% when you watch it), and of course a teacher that gets bad luck just when he thinks things can't get any worse.The side characters are funny too, but I don't want to give everything away.As I have noticed it seems that any anime about school has to have at least one of the followingHot spring, vacation/field trip/outing/training camp/festival school or local.  (Or something along those lines.  It must be an unwritten rule or something)Funniest thing about this anime are the little side story's.  The side story's don't really tie together with kendo, but it is funny none the less.  Overall it is a decent anime.

The kendo matches are well paced and interesting while not being the major focus of the show.This show is really carried by its characters, as all the girls are adorable and interesting.  The coach is less of a likable character, but even he has his moments.   The Blade Braver thing is hilarious.In conclusion, if you are looking for something that will lift your spirit up and make you feel...good then check out this show.  I really hope they make a second season. good then check out this show.  I really hope they make a second season."", ""Story 6/10The story of Bamboo Blade is probably it's one major weakness. Entirely predictable and clichéd it's nothing you haven't seen before. This is ok though as the story is mostly there to put the characters in various (often hilarious) situations. The humour may not be for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it rather a lot. Ultimately the story does it's job of getting you from point a to b, and even though you've seen it all before it's still a fun ride. On a side note as someone who has absolutely no interest in kendo the show did a good job of not emphasising...or leaning to heavily on dreary technical aspects of the sport, instead focusing mostly on the great character interaction.Art 7/10Not much to say really it looks good for a comedy show. Nothing jaw dropping but nothing hideous eitherSound 7/10The show has a solid dub but with Great voice actors such as Briana Palencia and Luci Christian it really wasn't all that surprising. Having only seen it dubbed I have no opinion on which is better just watch which-ever you prefer.Music wise the opening was in my humble opinion annoying as F*CK. However the music in the episodes works much better, using  more traditional instruments. It's hardly a masterpiece by any stretch but it still gets the job done.Character 9/10This is the real heart and soul of bamboo blade, every character is unique and  brings something different to the team and they all have their own motivations for competing and being part of the club. Whether it's to be a champion of justice or unleashing your inner demon or to simply not get fired. It's the sort of show were you can just sit back and enjoy the commotion of having a bunch of eccentric characters on screen at the same time. The dialogue is fun and light hearted and often veers off topic. Even the characters themselves at times seem totally aware that their in a comedy anime, pointing out weird and overly dramatic scenes to the audience, breaking the fourth wall in hilarious fashion.Overall Enjoyment 8/10I really liked this show, it was good fun and easy to follow. Although that being said I can see some people being turned off by the humour, as what's cool and quirky for one person is just downright weird for someone else.

Trying to assemble a team of powerful warriors in order to protect a village from evil bandits… Only difference, the warriors in this version are all cute girls and the challenge is a harmless kendo competition. I am of course stretching it with this comparison but I couldn’t shake the feeling of how half a century ago Japan used to make these cool manly samurai stories and now is mostly throwing out moe shows left and right. And I don’t like that.So anyways, Bamboo Blade is basically...two things. One half is a motivational show, aimed to inspire people getting into kendo. The second half is slice of life comedy around the simple lives of its characters, most of which are silly girls. The problem here is that it fails to be captivating in both cases, simply because it is not extreme or fanatic enough. The kendo part for example is just dull. Although they teach you all the basic rules and moves of it, in practice all the duels never last for more than a few minutes and all you see is frozen images of people with speed lines to indicate what happened. Compared to the emperor of thrills, Kaiji was a super awesome show about a guy playing rock-paper-scissors. It felt a million times more exciting that people duelling with swords (even wooden ones). As for the slice of life part, it is still quite basic for the time the anime was made. Every episode doesn’t have more than a couple of funny/interesting moments when there already are similar shows with a dozen things to pay notice to in the same amount of time. So again, the flow of the story is quite slow and basic, becoming boring at times. As for the whole kendo championship, it couldn’t be shown any less exciting. They win or lose and you feel like nothing matters.What further ruins it are the completely average production values. The characters and the sceneries are rather simplistic and with basic colouring, while actual animation is very rare. You mostly stare at frozen caricatures with flapping mouths, and even the duels are crummy motions based on speed lines, zooming and panelling. Voice acting and music themes are nothing memorable either. This becomes even bigger of a problem if one has already watched other school comedies with higher production values such as K-On or Suzumiya Haruhi.Yet another problem are the unimpressive characters, who just like the humour and the production values are also average. You get this team of kendo chicks, their teacher and various friends, and nobody seems to be memorable for any given reason. That short fat guy is definitely standing out for being drawn completely different and for having a super hot girlfriend but is otherwise not memorable. As for the main team, only the airhead blond is given actual focus for watching most of the anime through her, and that other Super Sentai fan for being very dynamic and rather dramatic. All the rest are stock material and completely forgettable.A thing which keeps you interested a bit more is the various references it makes to other anime. Being a parody of sorts, it uses them as both means to make a joke, as well as motivating the viewer to watch further (two early examples are Initial D and Super Sentai ). As funny as those extras were, they weren’t that many or that often after awhile, so compared to other major parody shows such as Gintama, this anime again fails to leave a lasting moment.In all, I didn’t enjoy it much and I doubt it will be remembered in a few years.

Trying to assemble a team of powerful warriors in order to protect a village from evil bandits… Only difference, the warriors in this version are all cute girls and the challenge is a harmless kendo competition. I am of course stretching it with this comparison but I couldn’t shake the feeling of how half a century ago Japan used to make these cool manly samurai stories and now is mostly throwing out moe shows left and right.

Anime are great when they are extreme and this one played out too safe and basic to even have a shot at glory.', 'This has the worst structure of a show I\'ve ever seen. Despite that baffling aspect, Bamboo Blade is a lighthearted irreverent comedy maybe worth your time.Let\'s get the negatives out of the way.First off, the show\'s premise is that a school\'s kendo sensei, Ishida, makes a bet with his friend that his team of girls can beat his friend\'s, with the reward being a year\'s worth of eating at a restaurant.This weak hook to the show is resolved in a handful of episodes. Let me repeat: the reason for this show existing is resolved in a handful of episodes.After some meandering, the show comes up...with another premise: after a disastrous encounter with an influential figure, Ishida\'s job is at risk so he decides to win the national kendo tournament to make himself indispensable.You\'d think this should have been the premise all along, considering the high stakes. Regardless, the show\'s complete lack of urgency, momentum or adherence to sports tropes almost makes this new premise as meaningless as the initial one.By the time episode 20 rolls around there is no sense of escalation or impending finale to the story. The characters are not knee-deep into a tournament or anything like that, in fact there\'s no kendo in that episode at all, the show is more concerned with inter-relationship dynamics and characters goofing around.So if you go into this show expecting the traditions of the sports genre, think again.There\'s no explanation for newcomers as to what kendo even is. There\'s no ""discovering a sport via a character new to it"" structure. There\'s no shonen/Naruto-esque explanation of the tournament and its rival teams. All this, despite the fact that there are indeed characters who join the kendo club for the first time and need to be taught the sport, and that there is indeed a tournament with rival teams making an appearance. The show just doesn\'t have the time to treat the viewer as kindly as it treats Dan-kun (a humorously drawn character who creepily sounds like he\'s 30 years old).I already knew enough about kendo personally, so I didn\'t feel in the dark, but I imagine people who know nothing about it, will feel a mild frustration that the show doesn\'t take the time to methodically explain the ins and outs of the ritualistic martial art.So, instead of a structure of a sports show, you\'re just kind of thrown into the lives of these girls who hang out at the kendo dojo. The show\'s comedy is its highlight. It\'s irreverent and goofy, with a pleasant cast of characters.Tamaki is a standout, and ostensibly the show\'s protagonist. You\'d think that would be Ishida, but he\'s such a superficial character, useless as a teacher and has no character arc, that the actual protagonist is Tamaki. She\'s the one the viewer goes on a journey with, she actually has a character arc.Tamaki is an introvert, and in a show tempered with incompetent narrative writing, she stands out as being authentic. My favourite moment is when she starts a job for the first time. The writers nailed what it feels like for an introvert to do that.On the negative side, there\'s a subplot involving a stalker that struck me as very odd. Sure there\'s plenty of laughs to be had during the storyline, but the victim of the stalking is (accurately) portrayed as being freaked the hell out about it, to the point of paralytic fear, and I don\'t really find that amusing. The whole thing just stuck out like a sore thumb compared to everything else going on in the story.Also worth noting that Ishida sensei is beyond useless, he doesn\'t teach anyone a single technique in the entire show. Near the end instead of taking responsibility himself, he decides to leave a pivotal and stressful decision to one of his students like a coward. Garbage writing for a garbage teacher.So Bamboo Blade has a baffling structure about it, you keep waiting for the plot to heat up, but it never does. Its stuck between being a slice of life show, and one with stakes. It feels as if it was written by someone completely new to the art of storytelling. If you go in with lowered expectations, you might find the show a good time though because it can be quite funny. with another premise: after a disastrous encounter with an influential figure, Ishida\'s job is at risk so he decides to win the national kendo tournament to make himself indispensable.You\'d think this should have been the premise all along, considering the high stakes.

Doraemon: 2112-nen Doraemon Tanjou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2648/Doraemon__2112-nen_Doraemon_Tanjou,"[""Watching Doraemon's beginnings made me appreciate him more and understand his devotion to Nobita in a much deeper sense. He was, after all, just like Nobita, a clumsy amateur cat-robot with bullies of his own and a girl that makes his days a little more pleasant despite of the hardships. The bond he had with Sewashi, the grandson of his eventual master, was very adorable as well.I also loved how the very idea of Doraemon took form from a manga artist's desperate search for a new story into a dream, a fateful encounter with some random toy, and eventually into a legacy that proves time...and time again the importance and magic of friendship.I think I've fallen in love with this series even more now. ♥ and time again the importance and magic of friendship.I think I've fallen in love with this series even more now. ♥""]"

', 'This review is for Chibi Party (Enkai-hen).Ok, since there are no other reviews, I thought I&#039;d give it a go.  &quot;FMA: Chibi Party&quot; is really not an OVA that&#039;s all about the story, art, or sound - it&#039;s just supposed to be random and funny - a bit like a blooper reel.It&#039;s a 6 minute animation that takes place on the studio lot right after &quot;FMA: The Conqueror of Shambala&quot; has supposedly finished shooting.  All the characters from the film (and others from the series)  show up at the after party for drinks and debauchery.There is little to nothing in...the way of a plot here.

You, as the watcher, are one of the new state alchemists that have just been inducted into the Amestrian Army. At certain points in the story, the characters will turn and address the &quot;camera&quot; (You) with various directions and such.Personally, I absolutely ADORE this idea. It&#039;s cute, fun, and really gives anyone who loves Fullmetal Alchemist a fuzzy feeling inside. I know I felt special when Edward Elric and Roy Mustang turned around and talked to me. :DAs for the story, it...takes place in some unknown universe of time before the destruction of the Homunculi, but after all of them were introduced (except the Fuhrer), and the military is somehow completely aware of them. It&#039;s not really meaningful to the actual plot of Fullmetal Alchemist in any way, but it takes place in the familiar setting of the final battle scene in the last few episodes of the series.I hope lovers of the show will enjoy this little short as much as I did. :D takes place in some unknown universe of time before the destruction of the Homunculi, but after all of them were introduced (except the Fuhrer), and the military is somehow completely aware of them.

Little does he know that Hamaji had already met and befriended a fuse named Shino on her way to his humble adobe.The thing that stands out the most in this movie is most definitely its art, animation, and sound. The movie has a highly detailed, colorful, and polished world. Backgrounds are bursting with life and vibrant color. Beautiful Edo will amaze you with its sights and sounds, from the chaotic red light district, to the elaborate feudal castles, to the beautiful foliage. The character designs themselves are also quite interesting, vaguely resembling the characters from a Ghibli film or perhaps an older anime from the 90s. The soundtrack is also given equal treatment, with a traditional flair pulsing from its chords.The movie’s story is an interesting yet rather simplistic tale. It’s an engrossing, character driven story from beginning to end, though it is not without its flaws. Character development is rather minimal, aside from what’s given to the two main characters, and the ending to the movie felt rather abrupt. Which was a shame, because it had such an epic buildup. The pacing for most of this movie was just right, with no scene feeling like filler, nor were any of the scenes dripping with an overabundance of cheesy melodrama. And thankfully that is the case, considering the movie’s focus on romance. Now the romance of the movie could have been handled better as well. Like the ending, it is given a rather unsatisfying conclusion. Throughout the movie, it’s built up in a rather subtle way, not feeling as if it were awkwardly shoehorned in.The relationships of the characters were the main focus of the movie, though it does have its moments of brutal and bloody actions scenes. These scenes are rather fluid and detailed, down to every drop of blood, every bullet, every swift swing of a sword.However, the characters, not the action, are what make this movie so interesting. The main character Hamaji is a country bumpkin at heart, illiterate and quite ignorant of city life due to her upbringing that took place exclusively in the mountains. This gives the viewers a convenient window to learn about the city of Edo and its culture. Her relationship with the fuse Shino is the main focus of the movie. Shino is revealed to be somewhat of a tormented and deeply troubled character later on.  They grow closer and closer as the movie progresses despite the people of their respective races being bitter enemies out for each other’s blood.The other characters include a cast of lively and fun individuals. There is Hamaji’s older brother Dousetsu, a somewhat childish bachelor that appears to be far less responsible and much less humble than his little sister. There are also Dousetsu’s neighbors, a young man and his son, and a round heavyset man with a not so subtle crush on Hamaji. There is Dousetsu’s love interest Funamushi. There’s also Meido, a talented artist and writer. She is the grandchild of a famous author who attempted to paint the fuse as something more than the monsters they were made out to be through his revered novels.In a way, perhaps the movie was trying to convey a message of acceptance and understanding. The humans would mercilessly hunt down fuse without a second thought, all for the sake of protecting their own people. Although it’s also clear that some were only hunting fuse simply for the money and fame. Likewise, the fuse hid amongst the humans and ate soul after soul, like animals making no effort to restrain themselves. Neither side made much of an effort to call a truce. Neither side tried to come to understand each other. Instead, a vicious cycle of killing turned without any hope of stopping. It presents an interesting “chicken or egg” argument. Did the Fuse start eating human souls because the humans were killing them? Or did the humans start killing Fuse because they started eating human souls?Of course, that conclusion was drawn up with a generous amount of personal interpretation. There was far more room for them to convey their message a lot more cleanly.Fuse is an interesting little feudal fantasy tale that comes together as a wonderful experience bursting with life. It has its obvious flaws, but it’s a great little lighthearted watch.It has a very feel good vibe to it and is definitely worth your time. to see.

I really wanted to write two separate reviews for this  -an unbiased one and a personal one-  but that\'s quite tedious and im not sure MAL would allow it.  Anyways, i\'ll try to  keep this short and simple.Going into the film, i really really wanted to like it - I really did. And that\'s likely why i felt a bit disappointed. The simple plot of the story sees our lone heroine move into edo to live with her brother and to help...him hunt down the fuse (human/dog hybrids). Her search leads her to meet with Shino.My unbiased review would have me say that the story is fairly simplistic (no major plot twist) and maybe even enjoyable. In other words, if i were to take it at face value, there\'s nothing really wrong with it. However, a personal review would have me say that something about it just irked me. One of the genre listed with this film is ""drama"" but it didn\'t really feel as dramatic as it could have been. I blame this on execution. I personally think they could have focused more screen time on the fuse and their situation/circumstances instead of the heroine who hunts them down.The character development was almost none existent imo. I wont hold it strongly against the film, cause it IS a film but im suppose to feel inclined towards Hamaji and Shino when they only meet up 4 times in the movie? About the fuse, particularly Shino, I just never got around to really liking him. I cant really describe why i feel this way without spoiling so lets just say i felt  he doesn\'t get enough screen time/explanation for a character of  his importance.As for the art, i have no real complaints per se, but i personally don\'t think it really matched the theme(s) of the film. The art is variant and almost colorful but that doesn\'t really match with the theme(s) found in the film, etc:\'we\'re gonna hunt down these fuse, cut off their heads, and display it for the public.\' This is just a personal opinion and most people are hardly going to have much issues with the art.OVERALLThere\'s nothing really wrong with the film, it has decent plot and action but i found that it suffers from its inability to make me want to try and connect with the characters. I think the story would have had a much stronger impact had they choose Shino as the main lead instead of Hamaji.  Anyways, as another reviewer said, it does kinda have a Princess Mononoke feel to it except that its more action orientated and slightly less developed characters.So, do i regret watch the movie? kinda, but not really. Would i recommend it? As long as you go in not expecting anything great. It has a ""meh"" fell about it. him hunt down the fuse (human/dog hybrids).

In this movie there are 'Fuse' part human, part dog creatures that eat the orbs from humans, when beheaded...they die.

A recent anime TV series adaptation of his most famous work, the epic Nansō Satomi Hakkenden, was highly derivative of – and, in my opinion, somewhat insulting to – the source material. Fuse, on the other hand, seems very playful, reverent and effective in its adaptation of the same novel’s premise. Not only does the film pay it homage, it also directly references it...and even features both Takizawa as a minor character and his granddaughter Meido as a member of the supporting cast. Aptly, it is through Meido – an aspiring writer herself - that the metafictional concerns of the film are mostly explored, supporting the notions of “fakes” and “counterfeits” that are central to the characterisation of the Fuse – mythical were-wolf like creatures - and the Shogun, who serves as the narrative’s underlying antagonist. Indeed, it is through Meido’s perspective that the film is given a narrative frame, thus adding to the sense that this story is very much enveloped within the traditions of Japanese story telling itself.Another key theme touched on throughout is that of prejudice, though the extent to which it is successfully tackled is up for debate – after all, it becomes quickly apparent that humans have a very genuine reason to fear the Fuse, despite however much the latter may try to control their natural instincts. The discrimination and subjugation of women is, on the other hand, depicted in a historically accurate manner for the most part, with a poignant parallel being made between the lives of the Fuse and the ‘pleasure-district’s’ courtesans about half way into the film. The female lead and her samurai brother’s love interest are also used to explore the nature of womanhood and the construction of gender identity throughout, though in between everything else these areas aren’t really given enough time to be dealt with deeply, and the answers offered are again of questionable significance. However, the fact that the film manages to touch upon such things without losing its balance between fun and drama means that their inclusion is in no way detrimental.One of the film’s most striking factors is its direction, which – once you get into the meat of the plot – may seem somewhat all over the place at points. This, though, is sort of the point: in order to locate the film in a broad historical context of Japanese story telling, a menagerie of varying techniques from a diverse array of traditions is used, from parodies of famous wood-block prints to a depiction of a Kabuki theatre play. Whilst I can’t deny this was an approach somewhat alien to my general cinematic experiences and perceptions, it certainly had the desired effect more often than not.Despite the interjections of these sometimes visually contrasting modes of story telling, the movie does not eschew aesthetic unity: there is a default art style used throughout the majority of the film that features a Ghibli like approach to scenery coupled with the more distinctive character designs typical of most serialised anime. The animation is also largely of a high standard, aside from a few points near the beginning where it seems to slow down unnaturally for brief instances. What’s more, the various other aesthetics that are superimposed on the more conventional style - such as the woodcut imitations and the use of charcoal lines to depict aerial spinning motions - are used repeatedly, thus creating a continuity that makes them seem less intrusive and obscure when regarding the film as a whole.Continuous movement between light and serious tones – as befitting traditional Japanese stories - is another effective aspect of the film: for the most part, it doesn’t take itself too seriously, and the humour is very well done. Despite some typical anime fare - brother and sister becoming emotionally hysterical and beginning a sobbing contest upon reuniting, for instance - the various comedic elements, from the woodblock parodies and use of several Ronin film clichés to the more self-referential conceit of the story itself being ""counterfeit"", are all executed well. However, one couldn\'t help but laugh at the unintentional ludicrousness of the film\'s climax. Indeed, the last twenty minutes or so are perhaps the only parts of the film were it strays slightly too far into reliance upon typical anime tropes. It was refreshing, though, to see a somewhat more abrupt and believable romantic confession from the female lead as compared to most anime heroines, even if the peripheral circumstances and the reaction of the male lead were excessively cheesy.The film’s pacing is also generally quite good, though one sequence of events in the mid part of the movie – involving the introduction of a relatively important character, and several rather sudden revelations and pivotal plot points – comes on slightly too suddenly for my liking. Aside from this, the film breathes when it needs to – for example, in the introductory scenes in which Hamaji the hunter girl pensively stalks a wolf through a forlorn and snow-covered mountainous landscape - and keeps the action from getting too frenetic during the various fight scenes.The characterisation was something that I was wary of in the opening minutes – given Hamaji’s anachronistic character design and voice - though as the film progressed any fears were for the most part laid to rest. The main cast are quirky, but not to the extremes anime characters are often prone to be, and none of them are particularly one-dimensional. Hamaji, her brother Dousetsu, and Shino – the male lead – all receive good character exploration and development. Indeed, I particularly appreciate how some of Dousetsu’s actions - being perhaps slightly deplorable to a contemporary Western audience - seem in keeping with the historical context he inhabits, and that he remains an endearing character in spite of also being very much a man of his age in some retrospectively negative regards.One element I feel is too much of a mixed bag is the soundtrack. Whilst the sound design itself is fine, the musical score is somewhat inconsistent: several pieces sound very much derivative of Joe Hishashi’s Ghibli scores, whilst others seem to have come straight out of very average TV productions. In particular, the music underpinning several anticipatory periods building towards visual climaxes are very cliché. There was one montage sequence, however, in which one of the Ghibli-esque pieces was juxtaposed well against the unfolding visuals, providing an emotional commentary that would not have otherwise been apparent.For many, the main caveat for greater enjoyment of the film would be a broad understanding of historical Japanese culture, including myth, art, theatre and story telling. That being said, the only one of those things that I had a small degree of knowledge in was woodblock printing – along and a vague idea of what the Hakkenden was - and I still found the film very enjoyable and humorous. Indeed, though I came away from Fuse with somewhat antithetical feelings in regards to how well certain aspects really worked, my final impression was an overwhelmingly positive one; for me, it is without doubt one of the best anime films of recent years not to have come from either Ghibli or Mamoru Hosoda. and even features both Takizawa as a minor character and his granddaughter Meido as a member of the supporting cast.

Definitely worth the watch. Many people are confused about the ending, I was too, but I thought about it and wanted to share my view.<spoiler below>I believe many others like myself are left confused near the end of the film, how Shino tells Hamaji to connect with her forever but ends up leaving her to go elsewhere. While it may appear contradictory, it does come to make sense.Throughout the film, Shino struggles to embrace his identity. He tries very hard to remain human, but as a fuse, he faces immense difficulties restraining his...animalistic nature. Being neither a human nor animal, Shino is unable to reach an equilibrium as he fixates himself into fitting in a single term, let it be \'man\' or \'beast\'.After having defeated the final boss so to speak, he ultimately renders his attempts in being human worthless and concludes that he is a monster that can never become human. He hence attempts to end his life there. Hamaji stops him, however, and brings to attention the highlight of the film: one does not have to sacrifice a part of themselves to compromise for what they wish to become.Hamaji reminds Shino of his humanistic side that he himself has ignored, that no matter how desperately Shino lusts to devour human souls he always manages to stop himself at the ones he care for. At the same time, as a huntress, Hamaji also acknowledges Shino as a fuse, a monster, but in spite of that, she still loves him for who he is. At that moment, Shino realizes he doesn\'t have to pick a side—he doesn\'t have to abandon who he is by default (a fuse), because he can\'t, and just because he can\'t doesn\'t mean he is incapable of possessing the traits of a human either.With that being said, Hamaji is only able to help Shino come to terms with himself. Being in a constant struggle to accept the reality, Shino has yet to develop his own identity; one can interpret this as a child who has just seen themselves in a mirror, how they\'ve only started to comprehend the ""tools"" they are born with. Thus, Shino sets on to a journey to balance the two sides of himself before he can stay with Hamaji; if he had stayed, he risks harming Hamaji in the process. There\'s no promise being made, because he is not certain how long it would take or if he can succeed in the journey, but Shino is able to comfortably leave because of the reassurance he got from Hamaji, how they\'d always be \'connected,\' an intensity paralleled with that of a hunter and prey.--The theme of identity is also prevalent in Hamaji; having to neither abandon her huntress nor feminine side, she grows into an individual comfortable with herself. She no longer fears that being a woman would devour her huntress side and vise versa because she is able to find her own equilibrium. The emperor, on the other hand, serves as an example of one who abandons all else just to devout themselves into one aspect they possess. The film warns the audience the risks towards that route, as the emperor becomes defeated and therefore loses the meaning of his whole existence, thus reverting back to a baby (how he sucks his thumb near the end). animalistic nature.

There\'s no promise being made, because he is not certain how long it would take or if he can succeed in the journey, but Shino is able to comfortably leave because of the reassurance he got from Hamaji, how they\'d always be \'connected,\' an intensity paralleled with that of a hunter and prey.--The theme of identity is also prevalent in Hamaji; having to neither abandon her huntress nor feminine side, she grows into an individual comfortable with herself. She no longer fears that being a woman would devour her huntress side and vise versa because she is able to find her own equilibrium. The emperor, on the other hand, serves as an example of one who abandons all else just to devout themselves into one aspect they possess. The film warns the audience the risks towards that route, as the emperor becomes defeated and therefore loses the meaning of his whole existence, thus reverting back to a baby (how he sucks his thumb near the end).', ""_Fuse_ is an odd duck. Overall, I endorse Theron Martin's ANN review of it.The main appeal of the movie is its gorgeous depiction of Tokugawa Edo: the vast city with its teeming throngs and characters, lovingly depicted from the spear carriers of daimyos to the firefighting bridges and their tactics of pulling down buildings to halt fires to the popularity of woodblock prints to grandstanding actors playing to their crowds even to less pleasant aspects like teeth-blackening (which is often omitted because let's face it who wants to see pretty actresses with black teeth?). There are many little touches I enjoyed a great deal, like...the cat looking in astonishment at Hamaji walking on a fence like a cat or the conversation between Hamaji and her friend while a craftsman makes colorful banners. This is a movie you'd enjoy watching and rewatching with a commentary & Wikipedia at hand.The character designs are effective and Ghibli-esque; Hamaji could hang out with Nausicaa and Princess Kushana without skipping a beat, and the director clearly worked with Studio Ghibli in the past. This means the characters are not conventionally attractive, but they are memorable and fulfill their roles, and by verging on caricature, one can't deny - the old boat man certainly does look like a shriveled old man, the shogunate does look like a feeble young man, etc. (One dishonorable exception is the Fuse courtesan who is simply bizarre and looks for all the world like a parody of American greasers from the 1950s or something with what literally looks like a blonde mohawk.)The plot... is a bit of a mess. The Fuse hunt initially seems to be the main plot, but is it trying to justify fuses or humanize them? Except it does a bad job of that (they are pretty heavily implied to have not limited their hunting to self-defense, and is it really self-defense when they're after you for previous murders? and almost all of the Fuse are dead before the story even starts) and it wanders in focus from the hunt to other topics like Hamaji's ne'er-do-well brother (who one wonders how much he actually likes her given he only calls her to Edo to use her in hunting Fuse) or the shogun (whose own subplot makes no sense even by the end, as we never find out how he's an imitation, what his connection to the Fuse is, or how he apparently channels the grandfather of the Fuse) or Bakin's writing of the Hakkenden (another issue, there's clearly supposed to be some sort of meanignful connection between the Hakkenden and the 'real' story of the Fuse but we never understand what Bakin was trying to do as the story of the Hakkenden could hardly justify or spin the Fuse's murders). The courtesan Fuse's character hinges on her son, who is never seen and his death is mentioned almost as an afterthought. As well, Hamaji seems to be often dumb as a box of rocks: she never seems to think 'oh, that strange white-haired guy who murdered a bunch of people in front of me and transformed and jumped around is one of those Fuse my brother is trying to kill' and has to ask Shino's name though I'm pretty sure he was named twice before in her presence, and the final pairing of Hamaji & Shino hardly makes sense either. And what does any of this have to do with dogs, anyway? By the end, I was left nonplussed.Enjoyable and worth watching, but the story is too peculiar for _Fuse_ to become more than the sum of its parts and be classed along with the best anime movies. the cat looking in astonishment at Hamaji walking on a fence like a cat or the conversation between Hamaji and her friend while a craftsman makes colorful banners.

Sweet because I loved the art and wanted to love the story. Bitter because this movie is is dreadful and not worth watching. With a premise similar to the likes of Tokyo Ghoul its unfortunate this lacks all the moral gray area. Newsflash: the Fuse ARE the bad guys, they kill and eat people\'s souls there\'s no way around it. There\'s a tiny mention against this in a single line at the very end but honestly, I\'m not even sure I understood it correctly. This is the sort of thing that I feel HAS to have...been told better in the Manga. While I understand self-defense and all that, it doesn\'t change that Shino\'s body count is over 30, and if we count what happens at the end as his fault probably several hundred. I\'m not even opposed to having the bad guy be the ""hero"" of the story but they portray it as if what he is doing isn\'t wrong. Shino kills a man as he runs away, he was no longer a threat he killed him because he likes to. Anyway, even though this review isn\'t liable to be read by anyone I needed to say something due to all the people who seem to think mass murder is okay. been told better in the Manga.

The world building was spectacular, but the character relationships were lacking.Story: 7/10The premise of the story was simple and easy to follow. Though the idea of a misunderstood and feared species is not exactly original. The story is character driven and focuses on romance. The romance was somewhat forced and there were little to no relationship development between the main characters. The ending may seem abrupt (though to me it was okay). The story of about the ""fuse"" was nice, nothing new, but I liked it.Art: 10/10The art was...easily the best part of the movie. Scenes felt very lively and the backgrounds very beautiful. The colours were vibrant and the style matched the atmosphere and music. The animation was also smooth and beautiful. The world building was also great. Honestly, my words could not do the movie justice.Sound: 9/10The music was memorable and fit the atmosphere of the loud and lively Sengoku period. The voices fit the characters very well. (I watched the Sub)Character: 8/10There were many great characters. The main characters were great. The female lead as very cute but could fight. The male lead\'s character was very realistic. His moral dilemma felt real and emotional.The other characters had their own charm. The fuses also had good backstories, though some needed more development. I just wish that the romance between the leads was developed more.Overall: 7.8/10I wish I could give this movie a higher rating. The movie had great world building the story holds promise, but It was greatly lacking in character development that made me feel for the two main characters.

Her brother left to the city, and writes a note telling her that he\'d be willing to take care of her, so she sets off.What i really admired about the movie was that there was no gender stereotypes.

But although I was confused at Shino\'s behavior every now and then, I did try my best to get what was going on besides all that. I like the character developments, and the pace.

The result is nowhere near as good as either, but it's also not too shabby. It's a pretty mundane story about prejudice and love's power to transcend societal barriers. It wasn't the worst hour and a half of my life, but certainly not the best, either. You might want to give this a try. Then again, you might not.It was produced by TMS Entertainment, the same studio behind Megalo Box, D.Gray-man, Baki, Dr. Stone, ReLIFE, Rent-a-Girlfriend, and...many others. The technical production value, while not awe-inspiring, at the very least leaves little to be desired. many others. The technical production value, while not awe-inspiring, at the very least leaves little to be desired."", ""First things first: When I started watching the movie the plot seemed diffuse and didn't make much sense, and that's ok as you can use it to strengthen the story later on, but that just didn't happen.To sum up my experience of this movie I would say that it didn't really go anywhere. The heroine stayed a crybaby and not much happened except for that she started dressing more like a girl at the end.I'm assuming there was supposed to be love in this story, but it just doesn't make sense to me. As another reviewer said, Hamaji and Shino met only 4 times...during the whole thing and nothing really went on. He borrowed her gun, he bought her a kimono, he invited her to a play and asked her to kill him, she chased him down in the castle and gave him a letter, done.The characters had little personality and it didn't change through the movie as there were basically no character development.The sound was the highlight of the movie, IMO. The sound were ok and solidly done, but not anything special to make me love it.At the and of it all I was somewhat torn. I didn't like the story much, but I didn't really dislike it much either for some reason. Objectively I thought it was kinda bad, but somehow it worked well enough that it wasn't a total waste.I don't understand why this movie has such a high rating as it does, but I would say that if one just wants something to watch while doing something else, like eating or knitting, this is an ok movie.Ultimately everyone has to choose for themselves if they want to see it. during the whole thing and nothing really went on.

That scene, to my infiinite dismay, was however not really important and also not very long.Anyway, this movie is about the Fuse, dog human hybrids who consume the essence of humans to survive (this is exclusively done by killing the human in question) and a hunter girl named Hamaji coming to the big city to hunt Fuse with her big brother.Of course, she befriends and falls in love with a Fuse and doesn't even realize it for the longest time.The...story is a bit lack luster when it comes to the love story. Shino and Hamaji meet each other four times in total and while there is the potential of friendship and even love I just didn't buy it.Fuse is also a movie that, as I'd like to call it, suffers from Shiki syndrome.  Humans and Fuse are portrayed equally bad and to be honest, humans even more so for hunting down and killing Fuse. Fuse are given the handy excuse of having an unbearable urge to consume essence. It is rather unclear if they have to consume essence since we are later introduced to a character who presumably resisted from killing humans since she gave birth.That, however, makes it really hard to root for the Fuse and the love story specifically. Shino consumes the essence of at least three people on screen, kills at least six people in an alley and then proceeds to kill dozens of soldiers and admits that he can't really stop himself, pushing him, if anything, into Tragic Monster territory and not slighlty monstrous but ultimately lovabe Love Interest territory.The movie might have benefitted more in this regard if the story was told from the perspective of Shino or another Fuse, describing how exactly it is to live as a Fuse.There was also strange bit with the, I think, Shougun who was constantly muterring about the Fuse being impostors. Impostors for what? Even with the reveal at the end it didn't make much sense to me.The rest of the characters are quirky, nicely done but ultimately not really that important.The art and especially the backgrounds... majestic. I wasn't always a fan of the character designs but they kinda grew on me.Overall watchable but don't expect too much. Also don't expect too much screentime for beautiful lady Shino. story is a bit lack luster when it comes to the love story.

Ginban Kaleidoscope,https://myanimelist.net/anime/476/Ginban_Kaleidoscope,"[""Being from a cold weather climate winter sports have always been a part of my life, and that includes figure skating.  What little girl from my generation didn’t admire the grace and beauty of Katarina Witt and not want to emulate her?   Ice skating anime is pretty rare and to my knowledge this is the only one I know of.  It’s quite good and should appeal to almost anyone, even if you don’t know a double axel from a triple toe loop.Ginban Kaleidoscope revolves around a young Japanese skater, Tazusa Sakurano whose dream is to make it to the 2006 Winter...Games in Torino.  She is one of the top skaters in Japan but has the unfortunate tendency to fall in big events.  After another disappointment while at an event in Canada in which she suffers a bad fall she suddenly finds herself possessed by the spirit of a Canadian teen who died in a plane crash, Pete Pumps.  What follows is some hilarious comedy, sports drama, and a little romance.Having an athletic background I think I can relate too many of the themes presented in this anime.  Though it is obviously dramatized for the screen I think the figure skating portion of it is fairly realistic.   The interaction between Tazusa and Pete is amusing considering to everyone else she is talking to herself.  Some of it is the kind of things only Japan would think about, such as Tazusa holding in going to the bathroom because she didn’t want him to see her doing that.  Everything from her changing her clothes and bathing blindfolded so that he couldn’t peep on her to her eating tomatos because he hated them was also amusing and in a way gave some realism to the situation they were in.  The comedy all works and I found myself laughing all the way through it.There are a few inconsistencies though.  Mainly they revolve around Pete's possession of Tazusa.  In the beginning we are told that he can only see what she sees and can’t manifest his spirit outside of her but this is contradicted many times later.  Pete sees things that he shouldn’t be able to be seen, and Tazusa will speak at him as if he was standing next to her.  Now I know why they did it, to have her not speak to anyone and not have a physical form for Pete for the audience to see might have been a bit odd but the story could have been written better to account for this.  It’s a minor annoyance but significant considering how important this was to the plot.Tazusa and Pete are the only real important characters in the story.  The entire show is seen pretty much through her perspective.  Little development or screen time is given to any of her classmates, family, or even skating rivals.  Most of them just come across as background scenery.  None of them really feel like villains as the main antagonist in the story is really Tazusa against her own fears.  Anyone who has competed in athletics knows that, especially at higher levels of competition, everyone has talent and everyone’s talent is usually pretty close to one another it is the mental toughness that often makes the difference.  Tazusa's doubts about herself and her ability and her fears are very important to the story and make her feel very real.  I thought she was a very interesting character and was the main reason I liked this show so much.Pete is also a good character but ultimately not as interesting as Tazusa.  This is mainly because the story really shows no interest in developing him at all as a character.  We learn almost nothing about him.  He was a pilot, he lived in Japan a lot, and he hates tomatoes.  That’s about it.  Never does Tazusa even try to find out about his personal life, his family and friends, or even what he looked like.  I thought this was a bit farfetched as if I had some guy possessing me I think I would probably want to learn something about him.I wouldn’t call the art amazing but it is very good.  The settings are very nice and the characters are appealing.  I really liked Tazusa's skating costumes and the sports action was well done.  There were a few inconsistencies such as characters talking in profile out of the sides of their mouths.  The music was good, the OP/EN songs as well as the incidental score and the songs played during the skating events.  I thought Tazusa's and Pete’s voice actors turned in a solid performance.Those of you who like sports drama and comedy should really enjoy Ginban Kaleidoscope.  While it’s not an amazing series for the ages, it should be worth quite a few laughs and tears. Games in Torino.

I thought Tazusa's and Pete’s voice actors turned in a solid performance.Those of you who like sports drama and comedy should really enjoy Ginban Kaleidoscope.  While it’s not an amazing series for the ages, it should be worth quite a few laughs and tears."", ""For every anime where a plucky amateur becomes the star of the competition, for every anime where love and peace makes the hero or heroine new friends, and for every anime where dreams come true, there is Ginban Kaleidoscope; a bittersweet tale about reaching for your dreams and finding that winning isn't everything.The strongest aspect of Ginban is easily story. Though the premise is hokey, the execution is flawless and handled exceptionally. Most tales of this nature often fail by lending themselves to comedy. Ironically, Ginban does that, but the jokes are just pointed enough that they sell. Not every joke, such as the running...gag of Mika thinking Tazusa is yelling at her when she's yelling at Pete, hits the mark, but the dialogue between Tazusa and Pete is full of zingers and visual gags that nearly always hit the mark.Still, while the comedy is suprisingly good, Ginban does a praise-worthy job at handling the gravitas of a romance between a living person and a dead one. By the end of the series, it's very clear Tazusa's feelings for Pete. The resolution of which is purely bittersweet but well-crafted. Likewise, so is the resolution to Tazusa's Olympic dreams which demonstrate how much Tazusa really won.The characterization of Tazusa is also amazing. Her development, attitude, and the whole of her parts when all is said and done is not only the antithesis of the stereotypical Junichi Sato heroine, but it highlights her individuality, her brazen independence, and her determination as something that can be admired as well. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the cast, but Ginban is so scattered and minimalistic with how it handles the supporting cast that it's better if you just focus on Tazusa and Pete, solely because this series very rarely focusing on anyone else.Unfortunately, the technical aspects are hardly of praise. The art is sub-par and many of the performances are filled with reused animation. Even in the big performance, it's mostly just a rehash of an earlier performance with nothing that signifies how grand the performance is actually supposed to be. To further the point, I'm pretty sure you could have a drinking game for every time they use the animation where Tazusa falls on her butt.The sound aspect is better, but not because of the BGM (which is rather bland) or the songs (which are also rather bland), but the performances, especially by lead Ayako Kawasumi in a role very uncharacteristic of her other performances. She completely sells Tazusa's entire attitude better than probably anyone else could. Hiroyuki Yoshino as Pete also does a capital job of filling the role of Pete. The Engrish was a bit hard to bear, but he was great when he stuck to Japanese.In short, Ginban was a very pleasant experience. It's technical aspects may not be up to par, but the storyline and how the character of Tazusa is handled and performaned are praise-worthy for their brash originality.Overall, I give Ginban Kaleidoscope an 8 out of 10. gag of Mika thinking Tazusa is yelling at her when she's yelling at Pete, hits the mark, but the dialogue between Tazusa and Pete is full of zingers and visual gags that nearly always hit the mark.Still, while the comedy is suprisingly good, Ginban does a praise-worthy job at handling the gravitas of a romance between a living person and a dead one.

So I'll give it 7/10The Sound, is actually, OUTSTANDING! The opening and the ending theme song is really what gave Ginban Kaleidoscope, its name. The opening song is Focused on the Ginban (literally meaning: Figure Skating) part, we see in the opening theme: 'Dual', Tazusa and Pete Skating, while...in the ending theme: 'Energy' we just see a Kaleidoscope well, make Ginban Kaledioscope Complete, xD so 10/10The Characters was alright, though some of the character wasn't really focused at all, Some of Tazusa's Competitors was just focused later on the story, because the Anime pretty much focused on Tazusa and Pete.

I&rsquo;m not really a fan of sports-themed anime, but Ginban Kaleidoscope had another aspect to it that I liked. Comedy.Comedy is probably Ginban Kaleidoscope strongest asset. Every episode had something you can laugh about. Some gags were repetitive, such as Tazusa&rsquo;s inability to restrain herself from talking to Pete in public. It&rsquo;s either people think she&rsquo;s crazy (cause she looks like she&rsquo;s talking to herself) or when she says something mean to Pete, people around her think that they&rsquo;re talking to them and in turn they get hurt (Specially Tazusa&rsquo;s coach and her friend Mika). Tazusa&rsquo;s...tomato binges are also something to laugh about.The characters were OK. Pete was likable, but I&rsquo;m not sure about Tazusa. She is a bit high-maintenance. I don&rsquo;t get where all her pride comes from because almost everyone hates her. The two characters were OK, but like most characters in typical romantic comedy shojo anime, they don&rsquo;t have a lot of depth.The voice acting was so-so. I guess I have to note the engrish. It was a good effort, especially for Dominique Miller&rsquo;s seiyuu, Maya Okamoto. Smug and cocky sounded like Smag and Cacky. The surprising is, the extra voices had better English pronunciation/accents.Animation was sub par. The drawing wavers almost every episode and it&rsquo;s very noticeable. Takashima&rsquo;s face changes every time he makes an appearance. There&rsquo;s nothing special with the colors either and the colors are inconsistent as well.I actually like the music. Both themes were very poppy, catchy and contemporary. Definitely fit for a shojo anime fanatic&rsquo;s taste. I like the inserts and BGM too. Most of them were inspired by classic music. In fact, most of them ARE classic music.It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s not that good either. I like the story, but I wish the other aspects were better too.

Well, it is because the anime ONLY ONLY covers the first 2 of the 9 total volumes of the story-line!!! Everyone rates this anime 8 or lower because the anime is not the complete story, so these people  do NOT know what happens later in the manga!

The story is good and the characters are pretty well connected with each other.The chosen sport of skating is very well done by the animation studio and they have got the correct &quot;feel&quot; for the sport, it feels elegant and smooth as if the viewer was actually on ice him/her self which gave the series a slight edge to other sports anime.The characters support each other well in this series and brings out the struggle the main characters feel to achieve the best they can on the rink with the added pressure of being a...media scape-goat and the burden of being an Olympic representative.It is really the sound that gave this series a 9 out of 10, the music fitted perfectly with the series, especially the jazz parts, and gave it an elegant feel which added to the sports action.The humour isn't bad either although sometimes repetitive and I especially like the part where the voice actors try to speak English (probably not part of the official humour but never mind).All in all, a good egg of an anime. :P media scape-goat and the burden of being an Olympic representative.It is really the sound that gave this series a 9 out of 10, the music fitted perfectly with the series, especially the jazz parts, and gave it an elegant feel which added to the sports action.The humour isn't bad either although sometimes repetitive and I especially like the part where the voice actors try to speak English (probably not part of the official humour but never mind).All in all, a good egg of an anime. :P"", ""Ginban Kaleidoscope is a sports anime series about Tazusa Sakurano, a sixteen year old Japanese figure skater with an attitude problem and Pete Pumps, a Canadian stunt pilot of the same age. Since they're both from other sides of the earth, how are these two related? They share the same body, that's how. Well, not exactly. Concidentally, at the beginning Tazusa and Pete have a competition in the same place, at the same time, and, at the same time they both mess up. While Tazusa's mistake was minor, Pete's cost him his life. However, due to unknown circumstances, Pete is unable to go to heaven...and falls back to earth landing in Tazusa's body, trapt there for one hundred days...StoryI'm not really one for sports anime, but the fact that Ginban Kaleidoscope is a romance, or something of a romance pulled me in. The plot focuses on Tazusa, who is trying to get an Olympic spot in the 2006 Winter Olymics in Torino. However, due to her past failures and an apparent knack for being picked on by the media, this journey of hers isn't easy, especially with a ghost posessing her.Since it's a twelve episode series, Ginban Kaleidoscope doesn't have nor make the time for little unimportant side-stories and is right to the point. This can be a good or bad thing since it doesn't really leave room for character exploration, but it also doesn't make you yell, &quot;Get on with it already!&quot; Ginban also likes to use two main conflicts and alternate between the two, those conflicts being, Tazusa's dealing with the media and Tazusa's success and failures as a figure skater. After a while, that kind of method can get bland, but luckily, the series is short.Though the story is more or less pretty straight forward the end can leave something with an unsatisfied feeling, but maybe that's just me.CharactersAs I mentioned before, the main characters of this series are Tazusa and Pete. They seem to be polar opposites, but as they say, opposites attract, right? Ha, but the two share one characteristic in common, and that's determination. Tazusa, according to another character, has a &quot;clay/stone mask,&quot; I find this hard to believe since most of the time Tazusa is yelling at someone, usually Pete. She's loud, short-tempered, and quite childish, but I guess that's what's likable about her. But, I think, personally, there wasn't anything about her that made her truly memorable as a character.Pete, in contrast to his host, is a bit more contemplative, and well, most things that Tazusa isn't, especially optimistic, despite the fact that he's dead. I liked Pete because he was sort of funny, in the silly kind of way. Or it could've been because of all the Engrish he randomly spews. As a pair, I think Tazusa and Pete are a good duo, while not as good as other anime duos, they're pretty good.The other characters in the series, well, the reoccuring ones, are all right, there isn't anything particularly special about them... Well, one of them looks a little like Yuki Nagato from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, but that's it really.Art, Sound, and Some Other StuffThe sound was good, I think, everyone's voice was well suited to their character and the acting was more or less convincing. Also, one thing about Ginban, it uses a few English phrases, and, while normally, Engrish sounds a bit weird, it wasn't as bad as some I've heard.To be completely honest, I neverwatched all of the opening or ending songs, so I can't make a comment about them, however the former was a bit pop sounding.Animation was okay.... Sometimes the color was weird, and there was a bit of reused animation... Also, during the last episode there was a bit of a continuity problem in which they weren't sure for a second about what was in Tazusa's hair.OverallOverall, Ginban Kaleidoscope was a pretty good series. It's not one that I would recommend since, there are some things in it that are confusing, and it wasn't really addictive when watching. But it is different than other things I've seen since it's a pretty upbeat series with a sad ending (depending on your preference with the characters). It had it's funny moments, and I think that's what I enjoyed most about it, and maybe that's how it'll be for you. and falls back to earth landing in Tazusa's body, trapt there for one hundred days...StoryI'm not really one for sports anime, but the fact that Ginban Kaleidoscope is a romance, or something of a romance pulled me in.

It sets itself apart with a deep and complex story and setting, and while the unusual relationship between the two main characters lends itself more easily to comedy than romance, it ultimately makes the romance that much more meaningful.The story focuses on Sakurano Tazusa, a top female ice skater from Japan, and Pete Pumps, the ghost of a Canadian stunt pilot who involuntarily ends up possessing her after crashing his plane during an exhibition. Hilarity ensues as Tazusa unsuccessfully attempts...to rid herself of the uninvited guest who shares her body and her five senses and whom only she can hear, trying everything from occult rituals to physical discomfort to eating tomatoes, his least favorite food (nope, Pete\'s there to stay until he ascends to heaven in 100 days). Meanwhile, she must struggle against a highly-biased media, a vastly more popular rival, and a string of recent poor performances to earn the honor of representing Japan in the Winter Olympics.What makes GK so outstanding is that it combines two story elements that would have been good on their own and improves both. You could make Tazusa an ordinary high school girl possessed by the ghost of a Canadian stunt pilot and still have a good, comedy-oriented rom-com ... but her interactions with Pete wouldn\'t be as clever or funny. You could make Pete a living stunt pilot in a relationship with a world-class ice skater and still have a good, drama-oriented rom-com ... but he would make Tazusa less of a loner (and good luck inventing a non-cliche reason for Pete to leave after 100 days).Tazusa has got to be one of my favorite characters of all time. She\'s cute, she\'s witty, she stands up for herself, and she can\'t seem to stop yelling at Pete out loud when other people are around. Even though I know nothing about ice skating, I still found myself identifying with her very strongly as she fought her way through an unfair situation, conquered her faults, found her own skating style and attitude, and transformed from arrogant and self-centered to mature and independent.Pete\'s character development was much more subtle since the audience wasn\'t allowed to hear his thoughts most of the time. He starts out as just a happy-go-lucky poltergeist, but eventually he develops real feelings for Tazusa and devotes himself to helping her succeed. While I\'m a little disappointed that he didn\'t get as much attention as Tazusa, I think that ultimately the writers made the best choice in terms of pacing to not devote too much time to him or any of the supporting characters. It wouldn\'t really make sense if Tazusa had time to track down his relatives in Canada or something while training for the Olympics in Japan.I love the sound throughout this series. The OP really captures the essence of the show, and I also love the voices and sound effects, especially Pete\'s gargled screams when Tazusa is torturing him by eating tomatoes. The classical and jazzy rhythms that play during the skating are a nice touch, as well.My only complaint about this anime would be the art. While it definitely has its moments, especially when it comes to mixing styles for comic effect, there are far too many stills and repeated sequences during the skating performances that lower its impact. Everywhere except the skating, the art is worth a 9 or a 10, and there aren\'t too many skating performances to begin with, but they just skimped so much on one of the most pivotal plot points! If it weren\'t for that, I\'d give this anime a 10.All in all, GK is a fantastic and unique anime that you should definitely check out. It\'s got great characters, great story, great sound, and great art (most of the time, at least). I enjoyed every episode, and the ending moved me almost to tears.

I look here and there just to find the right anime i could really enjoy. These few days I've been watching 'Ginban Kaleidoscope' and i was satisfied. I watched these for 2 day because it only got 12 episodes but honestly i really hoped there was more.The story was about  romance, comedy but more on sports. The reason why i like these anime because it teaches moral lessons; about having a fighting spirit, having our own principle in life, having good sportsmanship, and learning...to live life to the fullest. And what inspires me most on the story was when the protagonist realizes that popularity nor award is not that matters but by reaching your goal in life. to live life to the fullest. And what inspires me most on the story was when the protagonist realizes that popularity nor award is not that matters but by reaching your goal in life."", ""(Author's Note: This is an old review that I would have written differently now, but I might as well post it on here just because)One thing you’ll learn upon leaving high school is that everything that happened during that time is utterly meaningless in the adult world. And unless you’re one of those heathens who married his highschool sweetheart without divorcing her in two years time, your first love is one of those things. Pretty soon, you’ll realize that it was nothing special other than being another small experience in your youth, move on, and then date that college chick that’s as smart as she...is fun to be around.A similar thing happened to me when I got started on my anime hobby. Back when I thought they were all the length of American sitcoms that went on longer than a roadtrip from Texas to Brazil and I treated those anime like we were having a fling, I found a peculiar little series on Youtube that I was surprised to find was only 12 episodes long: Ginban Kaleidoscope. For those of you who have never heard of the series, it’s this anime directed by that dude who did the first 100 or so episodes of Gintama, School Rumble, and such centered on this ice-skating chick who gets possessed by this Canadian pilot that died in a plane accident. For some reason, he can only ascend to heaven after 100 days, so he has to share the girl’s experiences until then – including seeing herself when she goes to the toilet and experiencing what she eats (and he hates tomatoes), so she puts up with him until then. As you probably expect, they fall for each other, help each other out, and basically act like a retarded version of Hikaru no Go.If you’re planning to watch this anime…uh…don’t. It’s not very funny, it adds nothing new to the coming-of-age sports genre, and it’s more of a product of its time than John Hughes’ films. As you probably surmised, I didn’t like this anime, even back then. The only real reason I committed to it was because I was more romantically inclined at the time and wanted to see these characters get together despite one of them being a ghost (who never spoke any Canadian). So I officially entered an “I watch you and you entertain me” relationship with the show, only to get frustrated with these stupid romantic comedy hijinks that felt like it was playing me for a fool without showing any real commitment to its promise. There were eventually some moments where I had fun, but around the end, I realized the show and I wanted different things and we parted ways amicably after we were finished with each other.Looking back on that show as of today, I wonder what it was my high school self ever really saw in it. But regardless of what I feel now, I cannot deny that it was an important moment of my life due to being the first anime I ever finished from beginning to end. Even if the experience wasn’t great and there was no real love to justify that old “it’s better to have love and lost than have never loved at all” spiel, it was still an experience that helped shape future events in regards to my hobby. Okay, I went back to my long-running comfort food that will never grow old and betray me for a while, but eventually I realized how full of bullshit they were too (apart from Ranma, who forgave me for cheating on her and we entered a long-term relationship that was way more successful, but more on that another time) and sought out more of these series that were less than 100-episodes long. I think you can guess what happened from then on.My first real girlfriend in terms of anime didn’t pan out.

Pete Pumps, a ghost possessing Tazusa seems to just be some setup for a comedy, especially when you consider that Pete shares all the senses that Tazusa does. You\'d think that most of the show would be the comedic moments of the manzai between Tazusa and Pete, as well as the occasional ecchi scenes where Pete--havingTazusa\'s senses--sees...her naked.Surprisingly, the show manages to develop a bond between Pete and Tazusa. Figure skating is still an important motif, especially paired with how Pete similarly was a budding talent in airplane acrobatics, where both have similar types of performances, judging, and theme. The airplane and figure skating themes intermix just as much as Tazusa and Pete bond over their time together. This is especially so when Tazusa\'s in constant anxiety over her performances or is in slumps because she fell down in too many long programs.There are still lighthearted comedy scenes, and they\'re pretty good at that. I actually would have wished for there to be more robust slice of life scenes, but unfortunately, while there are a decent chunk of slice of life scenes, the characters are lacking. While Pete, Tazusa, and also her coach are good characters, the rest of the cast basically do not exist, both in serious competitive settings as well as comedic ones. Tazusa\'s little sister, her classmate, and even her rival characters basically don\'t get too much screen time at all.Despite the multitude of flaws that this show has, the relationship between Tazusa and Pete is good enough to ignore a lot of the flaws. Again, Tazusa uses her figure skating to showcase her feelings for Pete, and Tazusa skates in order to ""fly in the air with Pete.""  While Tazusa of old would have cared about getting the Olympic medal, she now cares more about her performance with Pete. It\'s warming. The show could have easily given Tazusa an olympic medal for her brilliant performances, but there\'s something poetic about her getting just out of reach of reaching that point, because Tazusa\'s performance wasn\'t done with the intention of scoring well, but merely her final hurrah for Pete.This show was adapted from a long 9 volume light novel run, so I\'m guessing the awkward lack of characters, weird pacing, and sudden change in plot focus arises from the anime trying to cram 9 volumes of content into 12 episodes, which is impossible. Still, the anime did an adequate job. Yes, the animation is a slideshow, but I would stil recommend watching it. her naked.Surprisingly, the show manages to develop a bond between Pete and Tazusa.

You found one.Ginban Kaleidoscope was a rewatch for me. Once when it was airing and now many years later as a full marathon. The simplest way to describe it is as one of those shows that is definitely good enough to watch, but just wasn't quite good enough to enter the hall of anime fame. Thus as the years go by, Kaleidoscope fades into obscurity. A shame really, because in terms of actual story line this was one of the best shows of its season.For...one, the plot is fairly unique. You didn't really get a competent look at figure skating very much back then. And one coupled with an interesting and bittersweet romance no less. The character development is also very well done, with the changes in Tazusa throughout the series being a highlight as she evolves from spoiled brat to amazingly likeable. The comedy is also decent, with a running gag centering on the fact that the only person who can see or hear Peter is her. So when she talks to him this results in those around Tazusa mistaking her entirely.The main drawback of Kaleidoscope is that it wasn't given high production values to go along with it. The animation is barely par for the time, and the sound/music quality is completely forgettable. There are also many times during the figure skating scenes that feature clear keyframe copying and recycling to cut corners. So from purely an animation perspective, Tazusa and Peters adventures unfortunately come across as a poor mans 'Yuri on Ice'. However, if you can look past the fact that this shows budget didn't do it justice Ginban Kaleidoscope is one of the best written shows of 2005. one, the plot is fairly unique.

The sports culture is aptly portrayed in this one most of the time. The story is touching..comical scenes are downright funny especially the sequence at the end of the second episode. The music is average but the show doesnt really need to depend on it.This is a cute one...do watch it..warms you up really. ', 'After the first few episodes of this anime, I couldn\'t help but be incredibly annoyed at Tazusa. She was incredibly irritating, and the way she dealt with having a ghost possess her was so ridiculously stupid I couldn\'t help but think ""God, why is she doing such a thing?"" Here\'s what she did that pissed me off.Constantly talking out loud to Pete while in a public place.No one would ever do this. One reason being the fear of being treated like a schizophrenic, and two, because it\'s really, reeaally dumb. At one point she gets him to help her out with a test, and she...just keeps talking and talking and talking to him. She also consistently yells at him to shut up, while talking to her friends and coworkers.Honestly, the fact that a ghost is possessing her isn\'t even the most unrealistic part of this story. The most unrealistic part is how she deals with it.It was alright though, but Tazusa just made me leave the series feeling quite irate.

This was mostly a fanservice episode however it did manage to have some great funny moments and get a little serious for its climax. It wasnt spectacular but by all means it wasn't bad.Art: This is were most people are talking. Now that JC Staff is in charge of the show the animation has suffered a slight alteration from its first season. Some of the more...loyal fans might find this change a little hard to get used to but I however thought the animation was not bad a all and was able to get used to it almost instantly. I dont doubt JC Staff's animation department since I know they can do great animation.Sound: Unchanged from season 1 so you know what to expect.Character: The characters were always the best point in the anime, and there is no difference here either. All the characters that we know and love retain all their distinctive personalities makes this an enjoyable episode to watch.Enjoyment: I repeat myself here....I liked it XDOverall: Fanservice episode with good comedy. What else could a Hayate fan ask for? :P There is no reason you shouldn't watch this if you liked the first season loyal fans might find this change a little hard to get used to but I however thought the animation was not bad a all and was able to get used to it almost instantly.

Saabisu saabisu.""Hayate no Gotoku OVA is a fanservice OVA (o rly?) for the Comedy/Romance anime Hayate no Gotoku, which is best known for its impossible-to-understand-all references and the beautiful and epic voices of Kugimiya Rie and Wakamoto Norio respectively. While seeming to be the obligatory beach episode, the viewers are sure to realize that this show is just mocking those generic episodes. The story doesn\'t even try to be unique at all, and how that whole beach and the island can be owned by Sanzenin family is anybody\'s guess. Going into a girl\'s room while she\'s changing, check. Getting stranded on...an island, check. Team Rocket, ...erm, SPs blasting off again, check. Isumi getting lost, check. The important thing is that the producers know how many clichés they have in this OVA, and uses those for their advantage in a rather successful attempt to make viewers laugh. The story overall, because it wasn\'t all that different, got a 7 from me, which is what I would\'ve give to the first season if I had reviewed it.One thing you are sure to notice is the difference between the character designs between the first season and this OVA. Although you probably know it already, this is because it\'s J.C. Staff animating this OVA (and the second season that\'ll be following in April.) While it may take a few episodes for us to adapt to this drawing style, it surely won\'t get in the way of those great parodies to come. Anyway, the drawing didn\'t particularly bother me and will continue to be in the standards of a 2009 anime. Maria and Hinagiku-san are as lovely as ever, and have surely didn\'t even lose a speck of their beauty. The animation seems even more light-hearted now, with the new choice of sharper coloring. Not trying to be awesome or the best in the world, the art is certain to be befitting and cute. 8/10.When you talk of sound, you talk about two things, the BGM and the voice actors. Talking broadly, you wouldn\'t even notice all the small background noises in a normal slice of life anime (slice of life meaning no action or supernatural thingies involved,) while you are sure to miss it if you ever decide to watch an anime silently. Hayate no Gotoku OVA, while bringing no new and unexpected additions to the BGM, it certainly does not allow you to miss the natural and the usual sound of a slice of life anime. Besides, anything too catchy or exciting would just kill the mood.When we come to voice actors, that\'s where Hayate no Gotoku excels. Two of my all time favourite seiyuu Wakamoto Norio and Kugimiya Rie filling in with their awesome voices, I was sure to like the voice acting, and I surely did. Tanaka Rie, with the voice acting of Maria-san, is always a nice addition to any anime. I am sure that there are other good talents in the show, but none of them seem to be as rememberable as those three. What I want would be a little more of Wakamoto Norio, but any more of the epicness that is his voice would be incomprehensible by any human being and could cause major disorders in the brain. 8/10There was NO character development in the OVA, which is fine, considering it is just a reminder that HnG2 is coming at full speed in april. The characters, however, were already well developed from the past season. Other than introducing a new Sister-san, whom we anime watchers can not know anything about her at this point, nothing interesting about the characters happens. Then again, we get the re-introduction of all the characters from the original series, just in case of a memory disorder due to unknown reasons. You couldn\'t have just forgotten Hayate no Gotoku, right? Right?!? *insert yandere pic here* Yeah, Nice Beach. 8/10The main aspect, the selling point of this anime is, as 99% of you will agree, the comedy. Due to many references and Nagi-ojou-sama\'s cute tsundere\'ness, it is impossible to NOT enjoy this pillar of fabulous jokes. I, for one, am a sucker for heavy comedy anime, because my enjoyment from an anime usually comes from how much I laugh. If Wakamoto Norio\'s opening sequence wasn\'t enough to make you laugh out loud, I don\'t know what will. Female viewers (or those who find it excessive) might be turned down from the fanservicey content of this OVA, but using that fact to generate more comedy is pure genius. As a healthy male who does not mind such services and jokes derived from it, the OVA really got me in enjoyment. 10/10Summing things up, this OVA is an excellent re-introduction of the characters that you\'ve surely not forgotten (!) with the usage of fanservice and parody. Serving as a bridge with the first and the second seasons, it is pretty normal for it to contain no character and story development and just better than average soundtrack. It is, however, an OVA that will bring a smile to your face when seeing the superman-esque Hayate, lovely Maria-san and cute Sanzenin Nagi ojou-sama again, accompanied by the famous voice actings (yeah, I worship them) of Wakamoto Norio and Kugimiya Rie.

Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1030/Heisei_Tanuki_Gassen_Ponpoko,"[""Pom Poko is one of my favorite anime movies, although that's not to say it's a perfect movie. The documentary-style opening , complete with uninspired narration, will lull most people into a false sense of security before the second half. If you can stay awake for the second half, prepare to be blown away.The Tanuki's transformation prowess here makes for some of the of the most imaginative and unrestrained animation I've ever seen. A careful eye will notice Kiki, Totoro, Porco Rosso, and Galaxy Express 999 during the parade sequence.  The tanuki themselves fluidly turn without restraint into hyperrealistic, humanistic, and charicature forms....(the third being a homage to a classic manga-ka)The characters for the most part aren't very notable, more important is the interactions in the community.Pom Poko is easily the most misunderstood movie put out by Studio Ghibli. While there is some environmentalist message there, I feel this movie is more about adapting. In fact, while the main characters are raccoons, they represent the Japanese society, and how it has to cope with tradition being overtaken by technology. The older raccoons wear traditional kimonos and plan to wipe out the humans developing on their land. The grand masters apparently inspired Japanese deities-(the oldest master being 999 years old.)Eventually the tanuki learn to hide among the humans (modernize) but, not before one last battle. Most people view the battle as humorous, and it is indeed the most commented part of the movie (because of what, exactly the tanukis transform.) But I see it as an act of desperation, putting their very manhood on the line for one last hopeless push. The aftermath of the battle is all the warriors' dead bodies being dumped in a huge pile, more reminiscent of Auschwitz than a Disney movie.Because of the overwhelming circumstances the main characters must fight against, I found this movie to be sadder than Grave of the Fireflies, Takahata's much more famous work. This isn't Fern Gully or Avatar however, the tanuki are full of flaws. When they steal a TV to learn more about humans, they become couch potatoes instead. In another scene, they feast upon stolen McDonalds hamburgers.This is a very Japanese movie, it is filled with references to Japanese culture, mythology, yokai, folklore, and culture. This can make it dense and unappealing to some. They say that a truly good film is universal, but after seeing this film I disagree.Truly a great movie, one of the best. However, it might take a little patience on the viewer's part to fully enjoy. One of the best- but you might want to watch it in two parts. (the third being a homage to a classic manga-ka)The characters for the most part aren't very notable, more important is the interactions in the community.Pom Poko is easily the most misunderstood movie put out by Studio Ghibli. While there is some environmentalist message there, I feel this movie is more about adapting. In fact, while the main characters are raccoons, they represent the Japanese society, and how it has to cope with tradition being overtaken by technology. The older raccoons wear traditional kimonos and plan to wipe out the humans developing on their land. The grand masters apparently inspired Japanese deities-(the oldest master being 999 years old.)Eventually the tanuki learn to hide among the humans (modernize) but, not before one last battle. Most people view the battle as humorous, and it is indeed the most commented part of the movie (because of what, exactly the tanukis transform.) But I see it as an act of desperation, putting their very manhood on the line for one last hopeless push. The aftermath of the battle is all the warriors' dead bodies being dumped in a huge pile, more reminiscent of Auschwitz than a Disney movie.Because of the overwhelming circumstances the main characters must fight against, I found this movie to be sadder than Grave of the Fireflies, Takahata's much more famous work. This isn't Fern Gully or Avatar however, the tanuki are full of flaws. When they steal a TV to learn more about humans, they become couch potatoes instead. In another scene, they feast upon stolen McDonalds hamburgers.This is a very Japanese movie, it is filled with references to Japanese culture, mythology, yokai, folklore, and culture. This can make it dense and unappealing to some. They say that a truly good film is universal, but after seeing this film I disagree.Truly a great movie, one of the best. However, it might take a little patience on the viewer's part to fully enjoy. One of the best- but you might want to watch it in two parts."", 'Stories about anthropomorphic animals behaving like human beings have always been a form of storytelling that different types of authors, narrators and storytellers used to employ back in the old days to convey a message to their audience. This was done by using the animals as some sort of metaphor to represent human society and the flaws that show up within it’s systems. Perhaps the most famous example would be George Orwell\'s magnificent social commentary on Communism that is the timeless Animal Farm. From there, this form of storytelling would go on to get adopted by many other storytellers that came after the man. Fortunately...enough, one of the storytellers to pick up on Orwell’s unique form of narration was none other than the late and great Isao Takahata, a man I like to nickname as “The great innovator of Ghibli”.Isao Takahata is a name that needs no introduction whatsoever. The man was studio Ghibli’s greatest asset, and he was the one responsible for some of the greatest movies and TV series to come out of both Ghibli’s discography and the Anime world in general. Though Takahata has had many celebrated works throughout the course of his life, he’s also had works that have somehow managed to slip under the radar when it came to audiences and viewers everywhere. Beneath the eminent and prominent works that were Akage no Anne, Grave of the Fireflies and Omoide Poroporo, there was also a work that was just as thematically rich as those three, yet never got the recognition it deserved. That work is of course none other than the brilliant 1994 Anime movie, Pom Poko.What is Pom Poko exactly? Pom Poko would be the result of Takahata replacing his cast from his previous works with anthropomorphic animals - as in the characters have all the charm and humanity that the other Takahata characters possess, the only difference here being the fact that they are not human. Just like Takahata’s other movies, this movie was ahead of it’s time in the way it handled it’s narrative and used it to convey it’s central theme to it’s audience -- which was environmentalism -- unlike any other Ghibli movie that came before and after it. While Princess Mononoke was a great experience both in terms of visuals and direction, it didn’t quite hit the mark with it’s environmentalism theme, and it delivered the theme quite poorly might I add. It was an excellent film both narratively and visually, but Miyazaki became overindulged with those aspects of his work that he forgot to deliver the message that he preached about in a quality fashion. Unlike Princess Mononoke however, Pom Poko never concerned itself with a grand story nor did it explore the various political factions or the many landscapes and mythical creatures within it’s narrative. Pom Poko focused narrowly on a small, select group of raccoon dogs called the Tanuki species, where these Tanuki would shapeshift endlessly to take the form of humans and use those shapeshifting abilities to stop housing construction on their homeland. This was of course brilliant in reinforcing Takahata’s message regarding environmentalism. By focusing solely on his central theme and giving it more importance than other aspects of the work, he managed to deliver that theme quite perfectly in the end.The comedy is pretty spot-on as well. Almost every shapeshifting scene was fun and hit the mark in terms of making me laugh, and never did a scene go to waste. The comedic timing is almost perfect here, from the lady Tanuki shapeshifting into a malicious fox to instruct the young, juvenile Tanuki to use that specific transformation to scare off the pesky humans when their identity is discovered, to the elder Tanuki stretching his testicles to form a mattress so that the other Tanuki can sit on them. They were all lighthearted gags that never ceased to amaze me. Though the comedy managed to hit the nail on the head at most times, the testicles gag did become old and stale halfway through the movie, and it lost it’s charm due to the overuse of the gag, which is a shame since it was pretty hysterical when it hadn’t become an overused trope. It is pretty ironic though that the funniest thing about this movie is not the various creative transformations that the Tanuki made use of, rather the fact that Disney renamed the term “testicles” to ""pouches"". It is a pretty bizarre and awkward stance, and it gets even funnier the more one thinks about it. It was not an unnecessary change though, since most Ghibli movies are directed and are made for children at the end of the day, and western audiences are cultured differently from Japanese audiences, so it makes sense.The animation here is pretty consistent just like most other Ghibli movies. It does the job and it does it well enough to assert itself among it’s contemporaries. It has many well animated scenes, but my favorite one has to be the parade sequence the Tanuki perform near the middle of the movie’s run, where even by Ghibli’s standards it looks quite excellent and stands out from the rest of the scenes. Although the animation was pretty consistent for the most part, my biggest gripe with this movie was the absence of any originality or creativity when it came to the character designs. It looked like Takahata never placed any thought into making his characters as uniquely looking as possible, rather, it looked like he churned out the same character design over and over again until he got the main and supporting casts ready for use. Every character here looks like the typically animated raccoon that you would see everywhere on animated television, and all the characters look like they were copied and pasted off of one another, which makes matters even worse since the characters were well written in their own right. Now granted, this is a movie about raccoons and not humans, but it still isn’t a valid excuse for the vapid character designs. Many anthropomorphic animals are drawn in a very distinguishable and unique way in other media, so why should there be a problem here? In addition to the trite character designs, the soundtrack was pretty forgettable as well, which is a shame since most Ghibli movies are recognized by their main themes – Spirited Away had the hauntingly beautiful “The Name of Life”, Princess Mononoke had the haunting yet so ever-present “Legend of Ashitaka” and Kiki’s Delivery Service entranced it’s viewers with the beautiful orchestral melody that is “A Town With An Ocean View”. It seems here, with Pom Poko, not one track stands out from the rest. All of them are uncreative Japanese folk music tracks, they flow smoothly with one another and do well at being a coherent and cohesive soundtrack for the film, but fail to make an everlasting impression on the viewer.Not going to lie, the characters were pretty charming and were all full of wit and personality, and the creative dialogue between them was ever present. It just felt weird watching this movie and knowing that it was produced by Studio Ghibli, since there was no female protagonist to save the day in this one. Regardless, the most interesting aspect about this movie is the fact that it’s so focused in Japanese folklore, and it’s a pretty great introduction for anyone who would like to know more about Japanese mythology as a whole. This movie is a well-known representation of Tanukis in their fairy tales/mythology. For Japanese children, this is just a normal depiction of one of the many animals from their fairy tales. It is a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn more about them in their famous Japanese stories.Overall, it’s not that hard to see why Pom Poko is pretty obscure and niche compared to the other Ghibli titles. It does not have a standout heroine, it is underproduced in terms of audiovisuals compared to some of it’s contemporaries, and it focuses solely on it’s main theme - which is environmentalism - rather than focusing on developing a compelling narrative. However, I also think that this is what makes it the most unique work out of all of them. If you want to vicariously experience the theme of environmentalism, then no other movie does the theme justice more than Pom Poko. In it’s thematic exploration, it is rather excellent, and unlike Princess Mononoke, the message never felt forced whatsoever. Don’t expect this to be on the same level as other Ghibli movies in terms of anything else though, it delivers it’s central message quite perfectly, but that’s about it. enough, one of the storytellers to pick up on Orwell’s unique form of narration was none other than the late and great Isao Takahata, a man I like to nickname as “The great innovator of Ghibli”.Isao Takahata is a name that needs no introduction whatsoever.

Based on the Japanese Tanuki folklore, many of the raccoons featured in Pom Poko have magical shape shifting powers, some a little more rusty than others. These creatures begin to notice their food and shelter becoming scarce after the invasion of their land by the crew of new housing construction, and must...call on their elders, the masters of transformation, to teach them how to change their shapes. They hope to use these abilities in many different ways, but all for one sole purpose: to reclaim the land that is being stolen from them.Though in the film they are introduced as raccoons, the Tanuki folklore is centered around a very different breed, known as the raccoon dog. In either case, the creatures in this movie are far too plump to be easily identified, doubly so with the fact that in the movie, the raccoons do not possess the famous ringed-tail that raccoons are known for. Studio Ghibli's depictions of the Tanuki are nonetheless charming and adorable. Even the mean and stuffy raccoons are hard characters to hate.Also featured briefly in the film is another creature of folklore known at the Kitsune, a transforming fox, which in the film tries to convince the raccoons to stop their personal war with the humans and instead use their shape shifting abilities to change into humans and begin new lives. This decision is widely argued over in the film, partly because of the raccoons' inability to transform into convincing humans.I think a child would thoroughly enjoy this movie, however, here's where the warnings begin to come in. I had not been familiar with the Tanuki folklore before I watched this movie, so was surprised to discover that until about an hour through the movie, I had not noticed the raccoons' exposed genitalia. I later learn that this exposure is a prominent detail of the Tanuki in folklore, representing good luck financially. Though it may seem overly risque to the unknowing, their exposure is never, in the lore or the film, intended as sexual, and the film does not illustrate them sexually either. Rather, in the film they use what is referred to in the English dub as their &quot;Pouches&quot; to contribute to their shifting, such as parachutes which are seen later in the film.Other material in the film include the deaths of humans and several raccoons, and though there is occasionally blood, it is never graphic. Additionally, there is a short scene narrated by one of the raccoons talking about how, because of lack of food and sheltering, they must halt breeding. While the raccoon talks about the female raccoons making sure this rule is kept, we see male raccoons charging at female raccoons, some seemingly drunk, and the female raccoons using karate moves to fight back, which implies their attempts to cease reproduction. Some female raccoons also have exaggerated breast size with occasional cleavage.This movie I predict would otherwise be a delightful watch for children, even if they have to watch for 2 hours waiting for the conclusion. I extend yet another ovation for Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki. call on their elders, the masters of transformation, to teach them how to change their shapes.

This lavishly animated tale about raccoons battling for their homeland (which was the biggest hit of 1994 in Japan) isn\'t so much a heartwrenching tragedy as it is an interesting amalgam of humor, drama, and action--all delivered in a way that is daringly original for animation. At times, the viewer gets treated to scenes which recall the one-two-three emotional punch of ""Grave of the Fireflies"", but even though the tone of the movie is somber, a handful of lighthearted...moments elevate the overall production out of depression.As this is a Studio Ghibli film, production values are spectacular. Backgrounds are painted with a tasteful mixture of simplicity and art, and the raccoons are as cuddlesome as you would expect--especially when they shape-shift from ""ordinary"" animals to Saturday-morning-cartoon style critters in the style of shows such as ""Care Bears"". (If you\'re scratching your head while reading this, don\'t be alarmed--according to Japanese folklore, raccoons have the power to transform into anything--including human beings!) The actual animation is as colorful and imaginative as you might expect from a Ghibli movie--and there is one scene where we are treated to cameo appearances by Porco Rosso, Kiki, and Totoro.While ""Pom Poko"" has a story to tell and a meaningful message for one to think about, its character and plot aspects may come across as a bit off-putting to viewers expecting a typical animated feature. Indeed, while some raccoons identify themselves with distinguishable names and/or personalities (for example, Gonta is a burly, rough-and-ready raccoon who is always looking for a fight, while Oroku is the ""wise woman"" of the tribe), the story offers little in the way of character development. In fact, most of the action in the story is narrated (by Maurice LaMarche in English, Kokondei Shinchou in Japanese), which elevates the overall effect of the movie to that of a semi-documentary. For the most part, this approach works to a very interesting degree and is a refreshing change of pace. However, there were some scenes in the movie where I wished the narration could have been reduced a little bit, as it sometimes gets in the way of appreciating the beauty of the visuals onscreen.Aside from this, the biggest controversy about ""Pom Poko"" seems to be centered on several scenes where the raccoons can inflate and/or transform their testicles(!) for multiple purposes. One particular scene involves a raccoon flattening his testicles against a truck, causing its driver to crash. Such moments may be alarming to children, but it is important to remember that while we see the testicles at times, the movie is, after all, animated. Even still, while a Japanese audience may take such scenes naturally, squeamish viewers in America could react differently. In fact, as a solution to handling this kind of translation issue, the English language version (produced once again by Disney) refers to the testicles as ""pouches"". That\'s a somewhat awkward decision, but it sure beats digitally removing the testicles from the scenes they\'re in.""Pom Poko"" was obviously a nightmare for English dub writers Cindy and Donald Hewitt to translate (especially since much of the movie is rooted in Japanese culture), but I really have to commend them for their efforts. There is some Americanizing here and there, but there was little, if any, that I could find missing in their script. In fact, I was most impressed at how they handled the songs; while at least two of them come across as a little contrived and/or corny, others flow so naturally that you never would have sworn that these were originally Japanese folksongs.Another interesting aspect of the dub is the voice acting. With the exception of Jonathan Taylor Thomas (star of TV\'s ""Home Improvement""), the cast consists of veteran performers who are known for cartoon voice work; Tress MacNeille, John DiMaggio, Russi Taylor, Andre Stojka, and Clancy Brown, to name a few. Whether this was done to cut down on costs for big-name stars or for avoiding aural distraction is unclear, but when listening to the spirit and energy that the aforementioned voice artists give their characters, it really doesn\'t matter.""Pom Poko"" may be an unusual entry from Isao Takahata, and its foreign aspects may not appeal to everyone, but if given a chance, the film offers a colorful display of imagination and pathos as well as an experience unlike many that one will find from ordinary cartoons. moments elevate the overall production out of depression.As this is a Studio Ghibli film, production values are spectacular.

Led by Hayao Miyazaki and his lifelong friend Isao Takahata, Ghibli has come closer to batting 1000 then any movie studio I can think of. However, if you delve into the more obscure Ghibli films you can find some that while still good...are a little less than perfection. This is definitely one of those.SPOILERS!Plot:The plot of this 1994, Takahata penned Ghibli film is that a community of magical tanuki (raccoon dogs) are being threatened by deforestation and must fight back against the loggers. Basically take the plot of 1992\'s Ferngully and add massive hairy balls. The tanuki around...Tokyo are being driven from their homes, having to fight for food, and being killed by hunters and cars. Soon the various clans unite and start trying to chase away the humans using their transformation magic. The tanuki actually manage to kill several humans and celebrate their victory with a party...in this children\'s film! However, the humans just keep coming back and clearly a more drastic plan is needed.The tanuki manage to gather ancient tanuki transformation masters from around Japan. The plan is to use a massive series of illusions so terrifying that the humans are driven away for good. However, the amount of magic this requires kills one of the masters and the tanuki retreat. The humans all immediately dismiss what they saw as a bad drug trip or dream. A theme park then claims responsibility and everyone just accepts it without ever questioning how they accomplished the illusion.  None of the human characters in this film with the exception of 1 reporter EVER believe that magical tanuki exist. This is despite the fact that the tanuki don\'t exactly hide their powers. It is the same bullshit skepticism of the humans in DBZ or Seto Kaiba in Yugioh. TV Tropes calls it ""Flat Earth Atheism"", when a character refuses to believe in magic despite living in a world clearly filled with magic and personally see magic all the time.Next we introduced to the Kitsune fox tribe of shapeshifters. The Kitsune have learned to disguise themselves as humans and live among them. The kitsune that couldn\'t shapeshift were killed off, but the shapeshifting kitsune simply accept this as survival of the fittest. It is revealed that the theme park that claimed responsibility is actually run by the kitsune, but then the tanuki steal back their money and the kitsune vanish from the plot without ever really serving a purpose.It is at this point that different tanuki come up with different plans. One group of Tanuki pull a Lord of the Rings and sail into the afterlife. One group decides to fight the humans and we get easily the dumbest scene in the movie. Instead of using magic, the tanuki simply try clobber the humans with their massive scrotums. The humans don\'t enjoy being teabagged and start punching the tanuki in the nuts. The scene then fades to black and a narrator somberly explains that all the tanuki were killed...apparently by being punched repeatedly in the nuts. I think this scene was guest directed by Johnny Cage.The surviving tanuki that can shapeshift are forced to disguise themselves as humans and live like the kitsune, who of course are never seen or mentioned again after their brief introduction. The tanuki that can\'t shapeshift continue to try live their lives despite the deforestation continuing to get worse and the problem never being resolved. While Miyazaki\'s films tend to have an emotionally cathartic climax in which the characters learn a lesson, this film by Takahata just kind of...ends. We are however given a moment in which the main tanuki breaks the 4th wall and tells the audience to care more about the environment. Thanks Takahata! We never would have figured out the moral without Tanuki Deadpool. The end!Art:The art is excellent and has that Ghibli beauty. However, I\'m not sure this film needed quite so many giant balls. Given this IS a film about tanuki so some balls were expected. What we REALLY didn\'t need was tanuki titties. I\'m not just talking Lola bunny in Space Jam boobs, but fully displayed, large nippled, furry boobs aplenty. Thanks Takahata sensei!Music:The music is mostly traditional Japanese folk music and is among the highlights of the movie.Overall:This movie had some very cute moments, touchingly sad moments, and tried hard to teach the audience a lesson about environmentalism. However, like Takahata\'s more famous work Grave of the Fireflies, he drives his points home with all the subtlety and grace of a sledgehammer. He tries to forcefully milk tears from the audience and guilt them into supporting his message, respecting and listening to elders in Firefly and conserving the environment in this case. For all its faults, the film still does have its strong suits and I feel it wouldn\'t be fair to give it less than a 6/10. i would recommend watching, but only if you\'ve already seen all the Miyazaki directed Ghibli films. Tokyo are being driven from their homes, having to fight for food, and being killed by hunters and cars. Soon the various clans unite and start trying to chase away the humans using their transformation magic. The tanuki actually manage to kill several humans and celebrate their victory with a party...in this children\'s film! However, the humans just keep coming back and clearly a more drastic plan is needed.The tanuki manage to gather ancient tanuki transformation masters from around Japan. The plan is to use a massive series of illusions so terrifying that the humans are driven away for good. However, the amount of magic this requires kills one of the masters and the tanuki retreat. The humans all immediately dismiss what they saw as a bad drug trip or dream. A theme park then claims responsibility and everyone just accepts it without ever questioning how they accomplished the illusion.  None of the human characters in this film with the exception of 1 reporter EVER believe that magical tanuki exist. This is despite the fact that the tanuki don\'t exactly hide their powers. It is the same bullshit skepticism of the humans in DBZ or Seto Kaiba in Yugioh. TV Tropes calls it ""Flat Earth Atheism"", when a character refuses to believe in magic despite living in a world clearly filled with magic and personally see magic all the time.Next we introduced to the Kitsune fox tribe of shapeshifters. The Kitsune have learned to disguise themselves as humans and live among them. The kitsune that couldn\'t shapeshift were killed off, but the shapeshifting kitsune simply accept this as survival of the fittest. It is revealed that the theme park that claimed responsibility is actually run by the kitsune, but then the tanuki steal back their money and the kitsune vanish from the plot without ever really serving a purpose.It is at this point that different tanuki come up with different plans. One group of Tanuki pull a Lord of the Rings and sail into the afterlife. One group decides to fight the humans and we get easily the dumbest scene in the movie. Instead of using magic, the tanuki simply try clobber the humans with their massive scrotums. The humans don\'t enjoy being teabagged and start punching the tanuki in the nuts. The scene then fades to black and a narrator somberly explains that all the tanuki were killed...apparently by being punched repeatedly in the nuts. I think this scene was guest directed by Johnny Cage.The surviving tanuki that can shapeshift are forced to disguise themselves as humans and live like the kitsune, who of course are never seen or mentioned again after their brief introduction. The tanuki that can\'t shapeshift continue to try live their lives despite the deforestation continuing to get worse and the problem never being resolved. While Miyazaki\'s films tend to have an emotionally cathartic climax in which the characters learn a lesson, this film by Takahata just kind of...ends. We are however given a moment in which the main tanuki breaks the 4th wall and tells the audience to care more about the environment. Thanks Takahata!

The usual complaint is that the movie is not about anything especially, but some environmental overtones, and that it meanders, but has great visuals, especially during the festival scene. I stand before you right now and tell you not many many movies have made me cry. I am something of a tough guy, I like my heavy metal, I sport a beard at times. This movie had me crying, not once, but again upon rewatch, and I mean my eyes weren\'t just watering, I mean sobbing. I am going to take a...different angle in my approach in my review to this movie. One that is based on industry and the fragmentation of modern society.Pom Poko is a movie about the trials of a group of people (they are tanuki, mythical shapeshifting racoon people) as they try to survive the encroach of man on their forest they call home. The tanuki are a whimsical bunch, they try hard, but they are easily distracted by games and good food. They try to get along with each other, but they are often divided on various issues. However, when man starts to push in on their living space, various smart leaders in their ranks realize what is happening and that to survive they will need to unify in order to remain. This starts as general pranks and mischief on the construction workers and people moving to the area. This stalls progress somewhat, but the gears of the machine continue as people continue to move into the area and food begins to become scarce. The tanuki have to start controlling their population and their rations of food.At about this point the tanuki are forced to make one last stand something to impress and awe the visitors of that area and get their attention. They make festival of sorts using the help of a powerful elderly tanuki that had responded to their cry for help, something that says adamantly ""We are here, this is us, this is our way of life"". Unfortunately, this is cunningly misinterpreted by the news as a publicity stunt for a new theme park, and progress on the destruction of their homes continues.At this point, many in their ranks turn to violence, and they decide if it is going to end this way they would prefer to go out with a bang. Many of them are killed, some run away. At this point the few tanuki left, the very advanced shapeshifters, submit themselves to a life of living tiring lives as humans, essentially having at that point been conformed, an idea a smart shapeshifting fox presents to them who has long given up on maintaining his original way of life and now uses his abilities for himself in human society.The real heart clenching moment in the movie though is when just for a moment the magic of tanuki are able to reveal what the forest used to be. A boy and his mother step out of their house and examine the tanuki and is able to appreciate the forest as it once was.For me, this is a movie that shows what happens when even the best efforts of genuinely hard working and sincere people can fall straight through the cracks of a fragmented society. I think it is representative of how easy it is to get swept up in the machine and not to realize their is something very special right in front of your eyes. The movie doesn\'t condemn those that don\'t go out of their way to examine the world around them, as a matter of fact it acknowledges how tiring and how difficult it can be to live in human society, as the remaining tanuki shapeshifters find the hustle and bustle of daily life difficult to deal with and the pressures it puts them. But if I had one moral to draw from this movie, it wouldn\'t be cherish the forest or stop destroying the homes of wild life. No, it would be, take a look around you every once in a while. It is a call for conscientiousness. Don\'t allow those that live differently to get trampled underneath by a machine, and don\'t allow yourself to easily become swept up in deindividuated.Otherwise the film is a very good looking and sounding one. English dubs are excellent. The design of the tanuki is very characterized and far from simplified. Many tanuki have been given different personalities. It isn\'t something I would watch on a lazy Saturday morning, but I would recommend it to anyone for its general viewing power (PG rating), and its powerful message. different angle in my approach in my review to this movie.

Out of all the Ghibli films, Pom Poko is still the work that I have the most memories of (in terms of Miyazaki's work, I remember Kiki the most because it has the best Ghibli loli). In a way, it represents what Ghibli/Miyazaki could have been, but never was - because of their adherence to a certain frame of style. While Takahata's other works, like Grave of the Fireflies & Only Yesterday, were thoroughly grounded in the real world - Pom Poko showed me the possibility of...a Ghibli fantasy totally drunk off its ass and crass in the best way possible. Ghibli on drugs, in other words, headed by a cast of bawdy Tanuki with their flying ballsacks and mischievous metamorphoses - showing that 'dirtier' aspect of Japanese folklore that was missing even from gory works like Princess Mononoke. Yet, the crassness is never extreme, and there's still great beauty found in it. The Night Parade scene is etched into my visual memory forever due to how exhilirating it is, and even though Satoshi's Kon later take on dream imagery would be more insane and hallucinogenic - I felt that Paprika was lacking considerable... 'heart' I guess? Takahata simply knew better about things like creating a sense of robustness that escapes superficial sheen, or gives the sheen 3-dimensionality.Speaking of Princess Mononoke, I like the take on environmentalism present in Pom Poko more than anything Miyazaki - because there's a kind of mature balance and lack (or, rather, lessening) of the heavy-handed aspects that frequently drags down other Ghibli works. I like the snarky half-documentary approach that it takes. I like the rough edges more than the cleanliness of your standard Ghibli movie. I love how much they muted any romance aspect or riveting action narrative (even though there is some) in exchange for a more thorough look at a fantastic society. Ethnography over excitement. The jokes are the best kind of slapstick, and they fit the way the bodies bend and warp in infinite transformations. As time goes by, it's Pom Poko and Only Yesterday that ripens beautifully, while the rest of the Ghibli oeuvre starts to seem a bit too sweet for my liking (and Grave of the Fireflies too bitter) a Ghibli fantasy totally drunk off its ass and crass in the best way possible.

It had a rather unique and different view on the animals and had a vary good story. Its a wonderful movie about the raccoons trying to save there home from humans who are trying to destroy the forest, while the protect the forest they use shape shifting and other things to try and scare away construction workers and even the people in the city. ', 'It\'s not easy, staning in the shadows of a mastermind. Well, the same goes for Isao Takahata. He is not only one of the Co-Founder of the Studio Ghibli, he also is the man for the ""Different Works"". He proofed this with one of the greatest animated classics ever, Grave of the Firflies. It was the first time Studio Ghibli made a movie with such a thematic, and it was their last. That haven\'t changed, not even in 2014.But Takahata is not only known for ""Grave of the Firieflies"". He made other fine movies like ""Only Yesterday"" or the most unique Ghibli Work ""My Neighbors...the Yamadas"". To sad, all these movies are underrated. It\'s such a pain to see Takahatas work for Ghibli is not so much appreciated compared to Hayao Miyazakis work.For me, Pom Poko is equal to the great works of Miyazaki. Maybe, he surpasses Miyazakis work in this movie. The art ist stunning, I\'ve never seen in an animated movie (besides of Chihiro) so much love and magic. The dialogues are packed full of funny moments but it is the Story, the Moral itself, which stands out in this movie. Pom Poko is not an obvious Tearjerker like ""Grave of the Fireflies"". You have to go deep into yoruself to fully understand the Moral of Pom Poko. It\'s such a nice mix of traditional japanese lifestyle and pahntastic myths from the old Japan. And yes, I\'ve almost shed a tear at the end of the movie.At the time of it\'s release, Pom Poko was on the Shortlist for an Academy Award. And I will not debate, this movie deserved an Oscar. Maybe this is the most underrated Ghibli Movie ever created. Don\'t let all these disappointed Reviews disappoint yourself.

If you like Ghibli, no, if you like magic, animated movies and a great story, you will love Pom Poko.', ""Diving into the Ghibli works outside of Miyazaki comes with an inherent risk. However, I am usually the one disappointed by non-Miyazaki Ghibli films. That being said, Pom Poko is the non-Miyazaki film that proves itself.While many Ghibli films have an underlying environmental theme, Pom Poko addresses this theme with full force. Avoiding subtlety isn't bad. This is great. Watching Totoro and Spirited Away give us a nice warm emotional hug from the beautiful scenic displays of nature and old Japan, but then we walk away from it into each films fantasies, and then back to our 21st century lives. Pom Poko humanizes the tanuki...to turn a Japanese myth into an ecological looking-glass for the damaging industrial expansion of mankind. It is not suggestive. It is informative.The production quality is as expected of any Ghibli movie. Plus, the animation quality and musical score are not just stacked on top of the story but are actually quintessential to the development of the film: each tanuki varies in animated complexity throughout the film, and much of the music arises from moments of the film (the party music, and the parade for example).The development of the tanuki as characters is nothing short of brilliant. The use of their transforming ability allowed the artists to establish motifs across their different physical forms. These thematic forms act as an indicator for what type of creatures are in contact with the tanuki at any given scene. They have a comedic cartoony form, a serious battle form, even a mating form. Noteworthy among these is their realistic form, where they embody how we humans see animals in reality: they rely heavily on their instincts, and struggle to consciously analyze their environment. They usually take this form when they are being seen by humans, and thus it emphasizes that these moments are how we see tanuki, as opposed to how other beings in nature see them. The scenes with tanuki in their realistic forms tend to be the scenes in which we pity them most, and they are often hurt or patronized by the human world. In these scenes we directly see how our actions, which we have the ability/responsibility to make consciously and wisely, should be more considerate to the remaining world. This world of organisms may not be as inherently clever as we are, but still experiences the emotions that all humans and animals are endowed with.Throughout the film there are many key figures in the tanuki community, but the film never revolves around any particular character. This can be problematic for many films, but this works well for the themes of Pom Poko. Pom Poko is centric around the tanuki as a group, and it is another nudge toward being less ego-centric as human beings, and being mindful of our ecosystems as a community. By the end of the film we still end up being very attached to a handful of the tanuki who have experienced a coming of age throughout the story, without ever realizing that we were following these characters. The development of character and attachment to these characters is a reflection of how an honest community works. We don't choose our friends and loved ones at the beginning of our lives, but we build them as we go through our trials and tribulations. to turn a Japanese myth into an ecological looking-glass for the damaging industrial expansion of mankind.

Coming in around two hours, for the kind of movie it is, it will seem on the long side of it. The first half simulates a documentary narration and the second half having a bit more “action.”This film can come off as either having a major environmental message, the message saying to adapt to your surroundings, or even both. Reasons such as this are why Pom Poko could be regarded as one big political statement with talking raccoons sending the message.It is a story about a...mountain forest land in Japan succumbing to deforestation and the raccoons are trying to fight back best to their ability. The raccoons, when humans are not watching, essentially become intelligent creatures and have the ability to transform themselves (Japanese folklore). Due to the circumstances, the raccoons try to drive the humans out and protect their land through various means: transforming into ghosts or demons, sabotage, or even throwing a massive scale horror parade.All animation, art, and music are outstanding in true Studio Ghibli fashion. However, much can be lost due to all of the Japanese folklore, or even the extreme slow pace half of the film has.This is not one of Ghibli’s best works by any means. Much of the message is sad and takes away from the childish humour the anime is always trying to get across. The slow pacing is unbearable at times as well. Pom Poko definitely takes some patience to watch and ultimately could have been shorter with the same message. mountain forest land in Japan succumbing to deforestation and the raccoons are trying to fight back best to their ability.

It has the same basic plot of Hollywood kids' movie dreck like Over the Hedge or Furry Vengeance--animals trying to subvert humanity's march toward progress as their home is being decimated--but takes a much darker turn. This may be rated PG with the...MPAA somehow but it's most certainly not a kids' movie; the tanuki actively try and often succeed to kill humans destroying their forests, and the story isn't wrapped up in a nice little bow to make you feel good about the outcome.The animation, music, and voice acting is all superb, as is standard for a Ghibli production. The movie is distinctly Japanese but should resonate with any culture for its allegorical struggle between modernity and traditionalism, or its not-so-allegorical fight for environmentalism. It accomplishes all this by being both hilarious and heartbreaking, which is a feat few films can pull off.

Basically, I\'m not a massive movie-fan. I like movies, but, like anime, the huge volume means half the stuff is average, and the big time-scale to try and portray an epic tale just bores me sometimes. However...STUDIO GHIBLI.I came to find Studio Ghibili when my mums boss lent me Howl\'s Moving Castle, on DVD, and then Spirited Away. Fast forward a few years and I\'m a big anime fan, and Studio...Ghibli productions never cease to amaze me. And so I come to Pom Poko. Let\'s jam...:-STORY:- The story, in brief, is about a bunch of TANUKI. Many, including the narrator in the film, refer to them as raccoons, and they tanukis are ""raccoon dogs"", but raccoons, in the American sense, do not have the folklore surrounding them that the Japanese do. So, with the history lesson over, this is a story of many themes: family, destruction, regret, passion - well, you\'ll see when, not if, you watch the film. The tanooki are trying to save their home when constructors destory their land to make way for new home projects. There. I went off on a tangent, but that is the story. Sorted. 8/10.ART:- Art is traditional Ghibili affair, that is to say, beautifully hand-drawn and fantastically animated. The artists at Ghibli\'s dispirsal are of top-notch expertise, and I, as a massive fan, wouldn\'t have it any way. Kudos Ghibli, kudos. 9/10.SOUND:- Wow. WOW OH WOW! I mean, the sound would have scored high for the dub alone, as it is fantastically done. I cannot compare it to the Japanese original, but, I mean, you don\'t need to really. It\'s fantastic anyway. But what really did this for me was the traditional Japanese music. I mean, with the film being centered in Japan and on the old folklore tanukis, you have to expect a certain aspect of tradional Japan, but the taiko drums I think they\'re called, and the lutes for example, are just so harmonious and, just, brilliant. If you\'re a Japan buff/otaku like me, you\'ll love it. P.S. Loads of singing too. Very harmonious. 10/10.CHARACTER:- Ghibili are brilliant at creating characters. Not my favourite film due to this, but each tanuki, despite many seeming like clones, all to seem have their own character. It\'s truly brilliant. The humans are quite good too. I just... Can\'t seem to put my finger on it. Maybe because there\'s a massive group of tanuki there isn\'t the traditional character building of what Ghibli are known for, but, yeah, whatever, still awesome. 8/10.So, overall, I\'d like to give the film an 8.8, but MAL don\'t do .\'s, so, has to be a 9. The sound is fantastic, the story is whismical and, as is Ghibli tradition, has many underlying themes, and the character is fantastic. Another Ghibli stroke of genius, and a must-watch for any anime fan. And Ghibli fans? Should you need any convincing? Ghibli productions never cease to amaze me. And so I come to Pom Poko.

If you\'re a Japan buff/otaku like me, you\'ll love it. P.S. Loads of singing too. Very harmonious. 10/10.CHARACTER:- Ghibili are brilliant at creating characters. Not my favourite film due to this, but each tanuki, despite many seeming like clones, all to seem have their own character. It\'s truly brilliant. The humans are quite good too. I just... Can\'t seem to put my finger on it. Maybe because there\'s a massive group of tanuki there isn\'t the traditional character building of what Ghibli are known for, but, yeah, whatever, still awesome. 8/10.So, overall, I\'d like to give the film an 8.8, but MAL don\'t do .\'s, so, has to be a 9. The sound is fantastic, the story is whismical and, as is Ghibli tradition, has many underlying themes, and the character is fantastic. Another Ghibli stroke of genius, and a must-watch for any anime fan. And Ghibli fans? Should you need any convincing?', ""This movie follows many Raccoons as they struggle to keep there forest around with the humans huge increase of towns and housing for the multiplying humans. With no care for nature they cut down trees and level land at the loss of the Raccoons home.

With many losses and no home the Raccoons must learn to live along side humans with there ability to transform. Throughout this movie you learn that animals can still live and be happy...a long side humans and no matter if they lose there home Raccoons are still happy and playful creatures and go on living happy live.

This must be a joke.This anime is about raccoon testicles. Two hours of raccoon testicles. And some raccoon breasts for good measure. They talk of them; they sing of them; they use them as parachutes and weapons and as a...flying ship to transport the raccoon village to the afterlife.

I never intended on watching it, I never intended on caring about it, I honestly didn't think I'd like it, and I had other anime to watch. Plus, an anime entirely about tanuki just didn't appeal to me, and probably never will. I was so sure I would go through my life never watching this movie...unfortunately, I took a class on Japanese supernatural creatures in college, and on the last day of classes, my teacher made us watch this...and my fears were correct: not only was this movie disappointing, but watching it just made me feel...drained and uneasy. The only time I was happy was when this movie finally ended or was close to ending. Honestly, I can't stand this movie and I hope to never have to see it ever again.The story is about a bunch of tanuki who live their normal lives in peace...until humans come into their forests and knock everything down so they can make houses and a new neighborhood for humans. This makes the tanuki angry, and they try to fight off the humans as much as possible in order to preserve their homes, even going as far as to use their shapeshifting powers. Unfortunately, some of the tanuki have forgotten how to shapeshift and have to learn from the masters in order to do so. Some will stop at nothing to fight off the humans, some even suggest that they kill humans, and others just want to save their homes. Yeah, it's a pretty heavily environmentalist movie.Honestly, this movie could have been great, and it does have a lot of things people would like: animal characters, great Ghibli animation, a wonderful soundtrack, and an aesop about protecting the environment. Unfortunately, this movie fails so hard in so many ways. For one, the movie barely shows anything. All it does is jump from scene to scene for just about no reason just as people are getting to understand what the heck is going on. It doesn't help that there's an obnoxious narrator who is present throughout THE ENTIRE MOVIE who NEVER shuts up about anything! I think the movie would have benefitted so much had they cut out the narrator! Instead of having that narrator info-dump about the tanuki losing their homes, why not show the tanuki losing their home and their reactions to it! Well, technically, they do, but it's so forced in and heavy handed that the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters or their plight.Speaking of the characters, I'm not afraid to say this: the characters in this movie don't feel like actual characters. They feel more like props to force feed the audience the story's message than anything. All of them are extremely one note, bland, one-dimensional, and pretty much never develop throughout the entire movie. One character, Gonta, is especially terrible because all he does is whine about how he doesn't get to kill any humans. Almost all of the characters are incredibly mean spirited, and the ones who aren't don't do anything to make us care about them or like them. The only character I even remotely liked was the one tanuki lady in the red kimono. She was a strict teacher, but had moments where she was hopeful, told jokes, had fun, and genuinely cared about her elders and the students, so she wasn't being a strict teacher for the sake of being strict. But she didn't get enough screen time to make me like her. All of the other characters are just either ciphers or mouthpieces, nothing else.The animation is good as usual, and the music is the same, and...honestly, I don't have a problem with tanuki using their testicles in this movie. They're clearly using them for non-sexual purposes, and if they do use them for sexual purposes, its always consensual and never played for fanservice or ecchiness. I know some people would be absolutely horrified by this, but there are worse things out there than mythical cartoon animals using their balls to transform themselves and fight humans. Besides, animals using their sexual organs is common, and it's never portrayed as fanservice-y in any anime I've seen. I DO, however, have a problem with the movie's execution of its morals. It has a very heavy message about how humans hurt the environment with their housing projects and technology, but it's so heavyhanded and forceful that it feels like its force-feeding its message to us rather than letting us interpret it for ourselves. Above all else...the tanukis' struggle is all for naught. We pretty much know that they're not gonna win no matter what, so the question we should be asking is...was it all worth it? What should we even take from this? I honestly don't know, but I do want the two hours I spent watching this back.Want to know the worst thing? This was penned by Isao Takahata, the man behind Grave of the Fireflies and Tale of Princess Kaguya, among other films. He's usually a lot more restrained than this, so to see one of his works be so ham-handed and cringe-inducing is extremely unlike him. Needless to say, I didn't like this movie. At all. All watching it did was make me feel drained. Now I know what the TVTropes term Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy is, because this movie pretty much exemplifies it. Also, there's a random scene where a couple of ten year old kids are looking at a porn magazine. Really, Takahata?Not Ghibli's best work.

It marries environmentalism with Japanese folklore to create a wacky and colourful warning to industrial development. Without knowing Japan's folklore, this movie may not make sense because it relies heavily on the viewer being familiar with lots of different stories and tidbits. For a movie about the tanuki's home being destroyed so that commerical housing can be built, it is hilarious. My favourite joke is when all the tanuki are sitting on a mat which is actually their master's transformed testicles. The nuanced message that we have to adapt to our changing environment is refreshing compared to the...usual bleeding-heart tree-hugging or shame tactics that greenies like to use.Pom Poko is a fun way for children to learn about the effect humans have on nature and understand the positives and negatives that come with this. usual bleeding-heart tree-hugging or shame tactics that greenies like to use.Pom Poko is a fun way for children to learn about the effect humans have on nature and understand the positives and negatives that come with this."", ""Ponpoko in a word: CrapNow don't get all upset.

Huge balls. Very nice touch. The first thing you notice. Big part of the story too. This means these raccoons aren\'t raccoons. They are magical creatures, spirits from Japanese folk tales and they have huge balls unlike actual racoons who have regulars small balls. It\'s not only the raccoons but also foxes and cats too. Foxes and cats don\'t have huge balls but all of them represent the Spirit of Japan in its different forms.To make the long review short all I have to say is that this movie is all about the Spirit...of Japan fighting western ""modernity"". The story has heavy Shinsengumi vibes. The Spirit of Japan tries its best to defeat the changes brought by the western technocratic civilization. The story does have a documentary feel about it like the other anon mentioned in his review. That\'s because this movie actually describes, even though allegorically, what happened in real life.

The gentle forests will be replaced with infrastructure, cities, high rise housing, highways, the way of Samurai will be replaced with corporatism, the comfy village and impressionable farmers will be replaced with a supermarket and a wage slave employee. Modernity will not stop attacking the Spirit of the Old Ways until its all gone. Chaotic magical world of the past is replaced with orderly sterile routine of the future.

Solid 7/10. "", 'I  take back what I said about ""The Cat Returns"" being the weirdest Ghibli movie. ""Pom Poko"" gets that award instead.If you watch this movie, you should know beforehand that it is heavily based in old Japanese folklore about the Tanuki, magical raccoon/dogs capable of transforming themselves and other things who like to do mischief to humans (and yeah, they use their nutsacks). So if you don\'t know that before watching this film (like me), you\'ll have a really weird time.This movie\'s message is completely about deforestation and how animal life gets affected by that matter. They handle it well, but it\'s really on-the-nose...throughout the whole movie, and if it wasn\'t evident enough, they break the fourth wall to say it themselves. Anyway, they don\'t portray humans as some devilish, selfish creatures who want to destroy the raccoon\'s... eh, sorry... the Tanuki\'s home. Actually, the Tanukis are way eviler when it comes to attacking humans.As I said before, I had a really weird time watching this, and I was wondering if it was actually a kid\'s movie. Yes, it\'s entertaining, fun, and deep, but there are a lot of bizarre moments.Overall, for Ghibli fans, this is a movie worth checking out, due to its ecologic theme, entertaining story, and charming animation, but too bizarre for casual anime watchers (even though most anime nowadays are way more bizarre than this one). throughout the whole movie, and if it wasn\'t evident enough, they break the fourth wall to say it themselves.

It's just the ultimate crossover where raccoons prove they can out-horror anyone and still be kawaii....!!"", 'Pom Poko is one of the most bizarre feature films I’ve ever watched. Even in comparison to anime’s general willingness to push the boundaries of logic and reality, the way it carries itself and the directions it goes in are all so fascinatingly weird that I’m still working to puzzle out how much of the damn thing actually works. It’s a kid-friendly environmentalist polemic with a shockingly high body count, a spiritual exploration of Shinto faith as filtered through the lens of a nature documentary, a treatise on society where a good chunk of the characters fight with their magic expanding nutsacks. If nothing else,...you could never accuse director Isao Takahata of playing it safe; this is a bold, brazen experiment that swings for the fences on every pitch, and even when it ends up striking out, it’s so uniquely compelling that you can’t wait for it to step up to the plate all over again. This is a film I could watch a million times and have a million different reactions to, and at the very least, that makes it worthy of recommendation.The story, set in the 1960s, centers around a community of raccoons (or Tanuki, in the original language) living in rural Japan. But these are no ordinary raccoons; these are raccoons as envisioned by classic Shinto mythology, able to transform and perform many feats of magic, once they shake off enough of their natural laziness to actually put in the effort. They’re a society of roly-poly, bumbling couch potatoes living out their ordinary lives until their home is thrown into chaos by the arrival of humans. As Japan’s society grows ever larger, more and more land is being developed into suburbs, and the raccoons’ home has just become the planned site for one of the biggest land development projects in the country’s history. Thus, their community must come together and figure out how to stop this expansion from steamrolling their home. Over the course of years, their plans escalate and shift, their society develops and changes, and the constant threat of the forest being destroyed challenges them all in ways they never could have expected.Still, that plot synopsis doesn’t do justice to what a spectacularly odd movie Pom Poko is to experience in the moment. The best way I can describe it is “purposefully mismatched”, like a patchwork quilt sewn out of contrasting fabrics and textures as to make the experience of the thing a constantly shifting expectations. It’s presented with a near constant narration that treats the years-long struggle between raccoons and humans almost like a historical document, like something you’d fire up on the Discovery channel after hearing a bizarre factoid from a friend and wanting to learn more about this uniquely offbeat moment in time. There aren’t really any traditional character arcs to speak of; nobody grows all that much, or learns an important lesson, with the focus centered firmly on the growth and development of the raccoon and human societies themselves. In a sense, it almost feels like an anthropological document, an excavation of this fictional community that pieces together how and why it functioned, and how and why this outside challenged forced them to change in response to it. It even goes so far as to have one of the characters speak directly to the audience in the final scene, as if to drive home the lesson that should be taken from this moment in history. Hell, in the fictional world Pom Poko takes place in, I wouldn’t be surprised if this ended up as the kind of educational film teachers would show to their kids in history class. That’s the kind of vibe it gives off.And yet, in contrast, it’s also a film that at times feels surprisingly dark for being ostensibly aimed at kids. Now, I’m far from believing that we should sanitize children’s entertainment; they can, and should, be able to tackle media that goes to dark, uncomfortable places. Just look at Cardcaptor Sakura, a kid’s show that doesn’t shy away from just how overwhelming and agonizing being a kid can actually be. But the occasional spurts of violence that punctuate Pom Poko feel a lot more jarring, in a way that I wonder if it’s intentional or not. I mean, like I mentioned earlier, this is a film in which one of the weapons the raccoons utilize in their fight against the humans is inflating their nutsacks to ludicrous proportions and using them as blunt-force weapons, but it’s also a film where a not-insubstantion number of background characters die. In pretty graphic ways, with scars and blood and torn flesh visible. Yet it’s also a film that doesn’t really dwell on death all that much; an attack on a construction site leaves three humans dead, but the raccoons can’t get through a moment of silence for the lives they took without quickly dissolving into raucous celebration. It’s paradoxically both darker and harsher than a lot of kids’ media I could name and lighter and more carefree than plenty of its less-violent contemporaries. As a result, it’s a film that constantly left me question if what I was feeling was what I was supposed to be feeling at the moment, or if there even was an intended emotional takeaway. Perhaps this tonal confusion is the entire point of the piece, though to what end I couldn’t say.I will say, this, however: I don’t think I’ll even get tired thinking about the challenge this movie left me with. And it certainly presents a lot of questions for you to puzzle over. Is the raccoon society means to parallel or contrast human society at all, and to what extent? How deeply do the film’s intensely spiritual roots inform its depiction of civilization overtaking nature? Is the overall goofiness and light-heartedness of the production meant to mask the potential trauma of its darker moments, or is that dissonance supposed to be so prominent? And what should be made of all that in light of its surprisingly downbeat coda? The answers aren’t obvious, and I think that’s the point. Like Takahata’s earlier work in Grave of the Fireflies, it’s a movie that seems perfectly comfortable with you drawing your own conclusions from it, taking away whatever nuggets of value you can gleam from it and leaving behind everything else. His directing style acts as almost like a Rorschach test for the audience, presenting a complex, multi-layered situation and asking them to fill in the blanks. And I can’t help but be impressed at how cleverly he poses these questions.On that note, I’m not entirely sure what score would work best for Pom Poko. It’s a movie that I feel I’d need to see a couple more times and puzzle over a lot more to get a sense of what I ultimately take away from it. So it’s entirely possible that the score I give it here will change in time, or upon reflection. Thankfully, while I don’t have all the answers at the moment, I can definitely say that the puzzle of Pom Poko is one I would greatly enjoy returning to, thanks to its impressive scope, constantly imaginative aesthetic, and endlessly fascinating exploration of a million complex ideas. Plus, again, magic raccoons fighting with engorged nutsacks. If nothing else, you gotta give them credit for having the balls (no, I’m not sorry) to pull that off. you could never accuse director Isao Takahata of playing it safe; this is a bold, brazen experiment that swings for the fences on every pitch, and even when it ends up striking out, it’s so uniquely compelling that you can’t wait for it to step up to the plate all over again. This is a film I could watch a million times and have a million different reactions to, and at the very least, that makes it worthy of recommendation.The story, set in the 1960s, centers around a community of raccoons (or Tanuki, in the original language) living in rural Japan. But these are no ordinary raccoons; these are raccoons as envisioned by classic Shinto mythology, able to transform and perform many feats of magic, once they shake off enough of their natural laziness to actually put in the effort. They’re a society of roly-poly, bumbling couch potatoes living out their ordinary lives until their home is thrown into chaos by the arrival of humans. As Japan’s society grows ever larger, more and more land is being developed into suburbs, and the raccoons’ home has just become the planned site for one of the biggest land development projects in the country’s history. Thus, their community must come together and figure out how to stop this expansion from steamrolling their home. Over the course of years, their plans escalate and shift, their society develops and changes, and the constant threat of the forest being destroyed challenges them all in ways they never could have expected.Still, that plot synopsis doesn’t do justice to what a spectacularly odd movie Pom Poko is to experience in the moment. The best way I can describe it is “purposefully mismatched”, like a patchwork quilt sewn out of contrasting fabrics and textures as to make the experience of the thing a constantly shifting expectations. It’s presented with a near constant narration that treats the years-long struggle between raccoons and humans almost like a historical document, like something you’d fire up on the Discovery channel after hearing a bizarre factoid from a friend and wanting to learn more about this uniquely offbeat moment in time. There aren’t really any traditional character arcs to speak of; nobody grows all that much, or learns an important lesson, with the focus centered firmly on the growth and development of the raccoon and human societies themselves. In a sense, it almost feels like an anthropological document, an excavation of this fictional community that pieces together how and why it functioned, and how and why this outside challenged forced them to change in response to it. It even goes so far as to have one of the characters speak directly to the audience in the final scene, as if to drive home the lesson that should be taken from this moment in history. Hell, in the fictional world Pom Poko takes place in, I wouldn’t be surprised if this ended up as the kind of educational film teachers would show to their kids in history class. That’s the kind of vibe it gives off.And yet, in contrast, it’s also a film that at times feels surprisingly dark for being ostensibly aimed at kids. Now, I’m far from believing that we should sanitize children’s entertainment; they can, and should, be able to tackle media that goes to dark, uncomfortable places. Just look at Cardcaptor Sakura, a kid’s show that doesn’t shy away from just how overwhelming and agonizing being a kid can actually be. But the occasional spurts of violence that punctuate Pom Poko feel a lot more jarring, in a way that I wonder if it’s intentional or not. I mean, like I mentioned earlier, this is a film in which one of the weapons the raccoons utilize in their fight against the humans is inflating their nutsacks to ludicrous proportions and using them as blunt-force weapons, but it’s also a film where a not-insubstantion number of background characters die.

Even Princess Mononoke wasn\'t this blunt. Strap yourself in for 2 hours of Lorax level preaching about how bad deforestation and land development is.That\'s not to say this movie is terrible. If you don\'t understand anything about Japanese folklore it will probably feel like one of those fever dreams made in the drug fueled era of 60\'s animation, and even if you are familiar with tanuki and other forest creatures and legends it still feels a little trippy. If you can just put aside all sense of reality and enjoy this trip into a...fantasy land it can actually be pretty fun. Watching the carefree tanuki have parties and the games they make with their transformation abilities is great.There was a moment where I had almost forgotten that this was basically one of those nature documentaries meant to make you feel bad for living in a post-industrial society and I was having a good time. Then one of the tanuki literally turns to the camera and says ""only you"" or something similar and the movie ends. Really killed the mood. Anyway if I wasn\'t so jaded to the concept of anthropomorphized creatures telling me off for being human and killing the rain forest or whatever I might have felt something, but I\'m enough of a realist to know that in the grand scheme of things raccoons are just scavengers that don\'t contribute anything to our planet and we\'d probably be better off without them.7/10 tanuki balls. fantasy land it can actually be pretty fun.

I'm certainly no expert on Japanese culture nor was I raised in it, so a lot of the stuff involving the tanuki was a little bit uncomfortable. However, luckily I've heard a little about the mythology behind tanuki so I wasn't completely blindsided by the. eh, anatomically correct portrayals of the characters in this movie. To anyone who isn't familiar, portrayals of tanuki in Japan very often involve them bouncing on their testicles... This movie portrays that and has tanuki testicles visible throughout 95% of the movie. If that's not something you can get past, this movie isn't for you.Story:...6/10. The story is a pretty simple environmentalist tale following the tanuki who are trying to save their home. It's very creative with the different ways the tanuki use their transformation abilities to attempt to halt the humans' encroachment into the forest, from terrifying the construction crews by turning into themselves, to forming a massive parade of spirits and other creatures in an effort to convince the humans that they're making the gods angry. There were, unfortunately, a lot of moments where things didn't quite connect well. Events moved along without much to connect them at times, making it hard to follow what was happening, and towards the end there were three different things going on at once and I got completely lost. Still, the writing was enjoyable and fairly charming.Art: 8/10. The art was probably where the movie is at its best. The transformations of the tanuki are incredible, and the aforementioned parade scene is a visual spectacle and an absolute treat. There are some questionable choices, however, particularly with the character design (Did they HAVE to go the Disney route of giving the girl tanuki boobs to differentiate them?) Ultimately the art was still very good.Sound: 6/10. Honestly not the best. The music never caught my attention and the direction of the voice acting was mediocre. Just passable.Character: 5/10. None of the tanuki here are particularly likable. They play around a lot and don't focus and they can't ever seem to agree on a plan of action, and the indecision leads to a lot of inner conflict. This may just be some of the mythical qualities of the tanuki coming out, but it didn't make for good cinema.Overall: 7/10. I think the charm of the movie outdid some of the lesser Ghibli films, but it's nowhere near the level of some of their masterpieces. I'd recommend this movie if you're in for a more whimsical time, and okay with some of the more... uncomfortable usage of tanuki anatomy as portrayed in folklore. 6/10.

I was born in 1994, the year this movie came out and yet even with it being a Studio Ghibli movie, I've never heard of it, so I decided to watch it and was surprised that this was never recommended.This is yet another Studio Ghibli masterpiece. The movie has everything from a great plot, music, art and loveable characters. This is a standard Ghibli movie that leaves you loving and respecting nature more and the movie sports just the right amount of testicles to be funny, one more testicle would've been too much,...they killed it on that one.The movie takes place in Tokyo as it rapidly develops and has to destroy neighboring forests to make room to build accommodation for the rise in population. The story follows a gaze of tanuki (Racoons) residing in the forest and co-existing with humans.

They use it to their advantage to try and save their homes by transforming into humans and trying to sabotage the Tokyo expansion project. I'm not going to explain more as this is a review and not a summary of the movie.As a 26-year-old who doesn't get hyped for anything much, the 'Spirited Season' Pom Poko OST which first plays when the tanuki are at war with each other, made me feel warm, cheery and put a smile on my face every time it played.Final verdict, these trash pandas stole my trashy heart. they killed it on that one.The movie takes place in Tokyo as it rapidly develops and has to destroy neighboring forests to make room to build accommodation for the rise in population.

Directed by anime great Isao Takahata this movie is not talked about at all. The film seems to get lost in the ocean of great Ghibli films. Why is that? What is it about this piece that just never seemed to break through? Well, let\'s explore it further and see if you can find out.Pom Poko is about shapeshifting raccoons. These raccoons are actually the mythical creature ""Tanuki"" who you would have seen if you have watched the anime Uchouten Kazoku. These Tanukis are trying to...keep the humans around them from tearing down the forest in order to build a city. So it\'s a man vs nature kind of theme we got going here. From the perspective of nature.First, the things I liked. The Ghibli is great, you know it, I know it. There is really no need in discussing it further. The Shapeshifting itself is well done. It flows well and feels nice to watch. The movie is also kind of funny. It is not laugh-out-loud funny, but it gave me some chuckles. The humor is mostly connected to the act of shapeshifting. There is a parade-like thing toward the end of the film. And the visuals and feel of that scene are insane. The shapeshifting is, however, not clear at all. They can change form alright, but they can also manifest physical things like clothes. It makes little to no sense.The music is nice. Nothing special, but it does the job.The characters are hard to distinguish from each other. Some of the Tanuki are unique, but I can\'t say that I will remember them in a week. The visual design of the Tanuki masters is excellent and I enjoyed them a lot.The story is not that structured, the Tanuki are just going through the motion. It kind of makes sense since it follows ""wild"" animals. However, the film is kind of long, and the loose structure does not help it. I found myself looking at my watch more than I would usually do. The story is also only seen through the perspective of nature. It seems so hamfisted since the nuances are gone. Having a man vs nature theme only really works if you show both sides (like in Princess Mononoke). It becomes so bad that one of the Tanuki just looks at the camera and talks about the message of the film at the end. This is horrible and works against the film.There is also a narrator who more or less constantly talks throughout the movie and it becomes super annoying really fast. There is also a portion of the film dedicated to two of the main cast establishing a family. I thought this subplot took time away from the important part of the film. Mostly because the characters are so forgettable that it is hard to care.So yeah, the film is not talked about because it is kind of bad. It is funny Takahata´s other movies were very underplayed and subtle, whereas this film goes the other way.Hmm..... I feel like I have forgotten something..... I wonder what it could be. Oh yes, balls. Here I am talking about testicles. There are so many of them in this film, it\'s quite a feed. They shapeshift their balls and fight with them. At one point they fly with them. They make them to a carpet. The ways in which they use their balls in the film are kind of creative. All the males are drawn, his testicles just hanging out. They don\'t have a penis, so a creative decision was made to only draw the balls. I guess it\'s to show the feral part of the Tanuki but then go all the way. keep the humans around them from tearing down the forest in order to build a city.

Most of them have been quite good others have been more bland or even worse, Tales from Earthsea. This time around we're looking at 1994's Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko.Story:We follow a group of tanuki. Their mountain is in danger from human expansion and they plan to do something about it. Using their transformation skills and determination they set on a campaign to save their home from being converted into an apartment complex and a WcDonalds.The only real issue I have with the story is that it can drag on a bit. There...are multiple scenes where the tanuki will go over information they've already been over or they'll just decide that it's time to celebrate. Now, I do get the point of these scenes. They're reiterating information to demonstrate the hopelessness of their situation and how difficult it is for them to come up with any kind of solution while they party quickly to showcase their fun-loving nature. However, that doesn't mean they need to spend as much time with these scenes as they do.With that said, this film does an excellent job of presenting a hopeless situation in such a way that there's still plenty of room for light-heartedness and even hope that the characters you're spending time with might emerge from the situation and be okay while not actually diminishing from the seriousness of the situation. The whole film's aesthetic hinges on the treading a very fine line and they pull it off. I also do appreciate the environmental themes and the way they're handled with some actual nuance. If this was a Hollywood film from the same time period those same themes would have been preachy and had all the subtlety of a bullhorn.Characters:The characters in this are very endearing and a lot of fun. I also appreciate that the major tanuki don't agree on how to handle it. Some say that they need to just kill a bunch of humans, others favour trying to frighten them and they have some really interesting debates about what they should do. The characters may not be incredibly deep but the combination of endearing traits and interesting discussion does a lot for making them compelling.Art:This film is gorgeous. Probably not a surprise given that it's a classic Ghibli film and they all look amazing. The backgrounds are beautiful. The nature scenes are stunning. The tanuki are drawn as humans, fully detailed tanuki and an anthrofied version of tanuki and one of the interesting parts of the film is that the major characters have anthro and human versions that are very distinct to them. The scenes where they use transformations to try and scare the humans are incredible. There are such interesting and varied visuals in them.Sound:The acting in this is done skillfully. Nonomura Makoto, Kiyokawa Nijiko and Ishida Yuriko are especially good. Hayashibara Megumi is also in this with a very minor role and she also kills it. The music is very well composed and suits the atmosphere perfectly.Ho-yay:There isn't any.Areas of Improvement:Get to the point a little more quickly when you have a scene that's a bit repetitive.I'd like to see the news report that gets filmed towards the end of the film.Instead of repeating basically the same party scenes it would have been nice to see more of the major tanuki characters just having a laugh and bonding as friends.Final Thoughts:Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko isn't one of Ghibli's absolute best films. It's still really good with strong theming, endearing characters, amazing art and it definitely deserves credit for having some difficult subject matter to handle well and handling it well. I'm giving it a solid 8/10. are multiple scenes where the tanuki will go over information they've already been over or they'll just decide that it's time to celebrate.

Pom Poko follows a large commune of raccoons that are determined to reclaim their land from the humans that stole it. The raccoons engage in plenty of shenanigans to halt construction and screw with humans. The plot is all over the place and lacks character development and opportunities for emotional moments. Even though Pom Poko is advertised as a comedy, I found the “funny” moments to be forced and cringey.Art: 6/10The animation flow when the raccoons are transforming is excellent but the entire film seems stylistically desynched...to the other Studio Ghibli films. The scenery specifically is more angular compared to the generally soft look of most nature scenes in Ghibli movies. A lot of the scenes feel and look like a parody of Studio Ghibli movies.Sound/Soundtrack: 6/10The soundtrack is generally boring and doesn’t evoke any particular emotion or feelings of nostalgia that other Ghibli soundtracks accomplish.Character: 1/10The raccoons are lazy, unlikable, and underdeveloped characters. While in real life I often think about the impact humans have on the habits of other animals, I felt no sympathy for these annoying ass raccoons.Enjoyment: 4/10Honestly I was just bored watching this movie from start to finish. It’s difficult to watch a movie where none of the characters are interesting, likable, or even evil. The visuals in Pom Poko are definitely interesting but since I have no personal connection to Japanese folklore (i.e. I wasn’t raised on it), the film doesn’t really offer anything for the viewers to emotionally connect with or care about.Overall: 4/10I’m sure if I was more familiar with Japanese folklore and/or had a nostalgic connection to the legends in Pom Poko I would like the film a lot more.

Aa! Megami-sama!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49/Aa_Megami-sama,"['Ah! My Goddess OVA is the first screen adaptation of the long running manga of the same name.  Considering its over 15 years old it actually holds its age pretty well.  It manages to be a sweet and charming romance and is probably a fairly influential title in regards to the whole ""Sudden Girlfriend Appearance"" genre of storylines.If you’ve seen even a few romance titles you have most likely already seen a similar plot before.  Though in its time this may have been pretty original.  A college student Keiichi dials a wrong number trying to order food from his dorm and...is accidently connected to a Goddess helpline in which a mysterious girl Belldandy appears in his room promising to grant him any wish he wants.  The girlfriendless guy asks for someone like her to be by his side forever and thus the story begins.Usually in these kinds of stories there is a lot of echiiness but there is none of that here.  So if that sort of thing bothers you and just want to see a haremesque romance without the boobs and panty face plants then you will likely find this series appealing.  The relationship between Belldandy and Keiichi is the focal point of the series.  It’s for the most part sweet and satisfying despite the lack of any real intimacy.  This is always a peeve of mine in anime and I think it has something to do with the Japanese mindset.  The story does a great job of building chemistry and romance between the pair but they don’t act like a couple that is in love as much as we are lead to believe.  Not that I ever seem to expect it anymore but how can you be in love this much and get embarrassed still about holding hands and cuddling together, let alone kissing, after living in the same house for nine months?  It detracts overall from my score despite me liking this series a lot more than my score may reflect.The story\'s pacing also fluctuates and skips around quite a bit.  Many months will pass with really no way of even knowing this is happening without the dialogue telling us or from just visually seeing the seasons pass by.  But you would never know it from how little progress the leads make in terms of their romance.  The shortness of the series doesn\'t make having a really intricate plot feasible but it doesn’t really feel like its going anywhere until the last episode.  I don’t know how closely it follows the manga since I haven’t read it but overall the story and the ending are satisfyingly concluded.Keiichi is your standard male anime lead.  By standard I mean he’s not all that special.  Like almost all romance series the male love interest is usually uninteresting, weak, and not very manly.  Despite Keiichi being in college he looks like he should be starting the 8th grade.  Now this is played up in the story as to why he doesn’t have a girlfriend but still if you’re going to make a show around college aged people then make them look that age at least.  However despite not finding him very satisfactory as a leading man he does tend to man up at the key times and grow during the course of the story.Belldandy is basically your perfect Japanese girlfriend/wife.  She’s moe for starters though not to the degree that we see in today’s anime.  She’s beautiful, a perfect cook and homemaker, and great at school.  Though the revelation of her attending school with Keiichi was a bit confusing since they just suddenly dropped that on the audience without any real explanation.  That’s another issue I have with Belldandy.  Of course I loved her, who wouldn’t?  But she lives for Keiichi and everything she thinks of and does is only for him.  There seems to be no will or drive of her own.  I know this anime is intended for guys, but well I think guys need to see things that are more realistic as well.  We don’t live to serve you; a relationship should be a partnership.The rest of the cast is pretty small and of the supporting cast there are some memorable characters.  Frankly Urd and Skuld steal the show and are much more interesting characters than either of the leads.  I thought they complimented each other nicely, with each being very different personalities.  Additionally I was pleasantly surprised that as they grew into the harem of pretty girls surrounding Keiichi they didn’t try to become love interests.  Keiichi\'s sister Megumi had some early promise but she faded from the story pretty quickly.  Most of the rest of the characters are forgettable and don’t get much screen time.The artwork and animation quality is very good.  You would honestly never know that it was made in the early 90s without being told so.  The characters are very detailed and realistic looking.  My only issue with the characters would be the much to youthful look for Keiichi.  This is a minor annoyance though.  The magic and special effects are well done as well whenever one of the Goddesses uses her powers.The voice performances are the weakest link of the OVA.  Keiichi\'s weakness is brought home by his un-masculine voice.  Also Belldandy\'s voice is a bit irritating on the nerves too.  While I have enjoyed Kikuko Inoue\'s roles before there is just something I don’t like about the way she voiced this character.  Again Urd and Skuld steal the spotlight in the category as well.  The OP/EN music were good however and fitting.I was pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment of Ah! My Goddess.  If you’re looking for a little light romance that is high on sweetness with a dash of comedy and very little perversion then I would recommend this series to you. is accidently connected to a Goddess helpline in which a mysterious girl Belldandy appears in his room promising to grant him any wish he wants.

Must be because this is the forgotten child of the franchise. With the manga and tv series all being far more popular and fleshed out, its easy to overlook the OVA here. But to ignore it completely is a mistake. The OVA episodes here are without a doubt a re-telling of the same AMG story we\'ve come to know and enjoy over the years....but there are a few mildly interesting discrepancies.So lets get down to it. You got Keiichi, Belldandy, and the rest of the gang. In fact, all the main characters show up with...the exception of Marller. You got the \'sittin-at-home-waitin-for-a-phone-call-and-oh-shi-its-a-babe-in-the-window\' inciting incident. After a little fast forwarding they get their temple house set up and then everyone begins to make their entrances.This is where the aforementioned discrepancies begin. Sayoko and Belldandy meet on a beach five months later instead of at the university. In the same episode they pull the love potion Keiichi, Sayoko, and Belldandy story while switching out Marller for Urd as the antagonist of that situation. If that weren\'t strange enough, the third episode has them drag racing against Toshimas club for a bet that apparently be one-sided here.But its in the fourth episode where the story really breaks down. There is some kinda crazy that keeps Belldandy and Keeichi from being near one another. Whats worse is that Belldandy has to go back to the Heavens in three days time and probably won\'t be coming back any time soon. The source of all their problems? Some goofing looking tree that has a connection to both Keiichi and Belldandys childhoods. Hmmmm, I\'m sure I don\'t remember any of this in the rest of the franchise.But thats not all. They even took a couple chances on changing characters. Take Keiichi for example. He is usually very shy, gentle, and understanding. Here he is more courageous and confrontational. Belldandy is pretty much the same, though I would say her ""strong"" moments fell short, and Tamiya and Ootaki seemed to be dialed way down.As you can see, the OVA starts out as a missable re-tell, goes into a chopped up fast forward presentation, and finally evolves into a brand new story all its own. The names and setting remained the same, but the events and even the characters changed at least a bit.So if you\'ve skipped this in the past, re-think it. If you\'re looking for a different twist to the AMG series, check it out. The only thing you have to lose is about 2 and a half hours. the exception of Marller.

Can\'t say I was expecting much from it, and was pleasantly surprised as a result. This was in more ways than one the feel of this is similar to ""Onegai Teacher"" (the female leads are even voiced by the same actress). However, I thought ""Onegai teacher"" was a horrible anime... so how did this succeed where Onegai Teacher didn\'t, especially given the title of this was enough to make me cringe?Is it the animation? The animation for AMG (""Ah! My Goddess"") is only so-so, not as good as Onegai Teacher. The colours are a bit stale and though...I wouldn\'t go as far as to say it looks dated, it\'s obvious that it isn\'t a recent anime. Also, Belldandy didn\'t look as stunning all the characters makes her out to be. :PThe sound? I REALLY liked the music in this one... the end theme is just so catchy and charming. In hindsight, it probably did a lot to tame my attitude towards AMG. The only bit that was slightly off was the music being played during the climax in the last episode. It was a tad over dramatic, and would have been more suitable in a mecha battle or something. Other than that, I loved the music. Did I mention that I especially liked the end theme? Oh well, it\'s so good it deserves another mention :P  Even though I thought the voice acting was a little on the weak side, the sound department certainly went a long way towards making this a decent anime.The story... as you might expect from someone who thought the Onegai Teacher\'s story was ludicrous, I thought the story for AMG was ludicrous too, and it was definitely the weakest part of this anime. But for some reason AMG seemed a lot less so than Onegai teacher. It felt like it was flowed much better. Maybe it is because of the characters - I felt the characters in AMG were much better portrayed. Initially, I thought it was a little weird how Belldandy just took to the guy so easily, but as it went on, I actually found the relationship between the two main characters to be a lot more natural than in ""Onegai Teacher"". And what\'s more, I actually cared a bit about what happened to the main character in this. So this is another one of the major factors that lifts this far above ""Onegai Teacher"".AMG is far from being great, but I would describe it as a NICE anime, one of those that make you go ""awww"". It turned out to be pretty decent, and considering how I tend to hate anime from this genre, this is pretty high praise.

I got the chance to watch the 1st screen adaptation,the 1993 OVA this last weekend and then to conclude this adaptation i watched too the 2000 film,a sequel to the OVA.Ok people,1st of all,a screen or big screen adaptation don\'t need to be totally faithful to their novel/manga counterparts. I read Bram Stoker\'s Dracula and,Coppola\'s movie adaptation have some differences but was terrific,though.

This can make it more accessible for casual viewing but might not be as engaging for other viewers that look for a interconnected narrative, specially on the final episodes, it becomes a mess :/', ""Minor Spoilers.Ah My Goddess is simply put one of the most endearing and heart-warming romantic anime that I've ever watched.Ah My Goddesses focuses on the tale of Keichi who lives a relatively mundane college life and everything in his life is turned upside down when a desire to order food at his dormitory makes him dial a wrong number which connects him to the Goddess Hotline which brings a Goddess into his life by the name of Belldandy. This beautiful goddess tells him that he can have one wish that she will do everything in her power to make it come true. Despite Keichi...being skeptical towards the events that have just happened he wishes for the goddess to be with him forever and much to his surprise she grants him that wish. Ever since that day his life has never been the same.This anime would be mostly categorized as a romantic anime with some magical girl elements but the biggest thing I can praise this anime for is that despite its short length it really goes above and beyond to make you care for the two main characters in this series which is Keichi and Belldandy.I can understand why a lot of old school anime fans have a lot of fondness for Belldandy because for as much as she is a beautifully drawn character, she has such a warm and endearing personality without being labelled as naive or airheaded. She is very loving and innocent person that always believes in doing things for the right reason and thankfully she is not sexualized in this anime as far as I'm concerned minus a few slight scenes of fan-service that isn't a detriment to overall character development of this character. Her development is also strengthened by a respectful male lead that could of easily taken advantage of her and the situation he is in, but his morals won't allow him to because he does ultimately care about her and throughout the series we will easily see how much he is willing to endure to care about the woman he is learning and willing to love.Despite this anime being made in the early 1990's, the artwork for this anime is incredibly beautiful and the designs for the goddesses are incredibly detailed.The music fits the series incredibly well because when the anime wants to be heartfelt and cheerful the music accommodates for that and when the anime wants to be sad and depressing it has music that accommodates that as well. I want to highlight the ending song of this anime because it is incredibly adorable and really encompasses the entire aura of what makes this show so endearing.Despite this OVA only being 5 episodes, it really does a lot in those 5 episodes. The first 3 episodes have a more happier and carefree vibe while the last two episodes are very sad and somber but all 5 episodes are used to strengthen the relationship between Keichi and Belldandy without becoming overbearing and painful.Besides the two main characters other characters are brought into this anime, most notably Belldandy's goddess sisters (Older Sister Urd and Younger Sister Skuld) who definitely add some comedy to this romantic anime. Urd constantly pressures Keichi to grow some courage to tell Belldandy how he truly feels because Keichi is constantly at conflict with himself because even though he has a beautiful girl in his life, he struggles to know if its genuine or not because there are times he thinks she is only there because of the wish she granted him or if she really does have feelings for him. Skuld on the other hand is a very clingy younger sister that misses Belldandy in the Goddess world and thinks Keichi is at fault of why she doesn't return to the goddess world so that she can have Belldandy for herself. There are other characters in the anime but they have very minor roles and unfortunately are easily forgettable.Ultimately the overall plot fixates on the concept of forbidden love because we have two characters (a human and a goddess) that under normal circumstances would never work and it becomes apparent that close to the end of the anime Keichi may lose Belldandy forever. When this anime builds towards it conclusion he is going to do everything in his power to enjoy his time left with Belldandy because he learns that his relationship with her is causing problems in the real world.While people may get offended at the beginning that this relationship only exists because of making a wish come true, it ends up being a lot more complicated than that. No meaningful relationship should ever be formed by a forced contract, but we ultimately learn throughout this short ova is that if two people are meant to be together, they will find a way to be together regardless if its through a contract or not. Promises can go a long way after all especially if two people have feelings for each other even if they don't know it yet.Overall, this is a very heartfelt comical anime that hits your feelings in all the right ways and by the end of it you'll be happy that you watched it because it deserves its praise as a well respected timeless romantic anime.This makes me excited to watch the other iterations of Ah My Goddess.8/10Favorite Character: BelldandyLeast Favorite Character: Skuld being skeptical towards the events that have just happened he wishes for the goddess to be with him forever and much to his surprise she grants him that wish. Ever since that day his life has never been the same.This anime would be mostly categorized as a romantic anime with some magical girl elements but the biggest thing I can praise this anime for is that despite its short length it really goes above and beyond to make you care for the two main characters in this series which is Keichi and Belldandy.I can understand why a lot of old school anime fans have a lot of fondness for Belldandy because for as much as she is a beautifully drawn character, she has such a warm and endearing personality without being labelled as naive or airheaded. She is very loving and innocent person that always believes in doing things for the right reason and thankfully she is not sexualized in this anime as far as I'm concerned minus a few slight scenes of fan-service that isn't a detriment to overall character development of this character. Her development is also strengthened by a respectful male lead that could of easily taken advantage of her and the situation he is in, but his morals won't allow him to because he does ultimately care about her and throughout the series we will easily see how much he is willing to endure to care about the woman he is learning and willing to love.Despite this anime being made in the early 1990's, the artwork for this anime is incredibly beautiful and the designs for the goddesses are incredibly detailed.The music fits the series incredibly well because when the anime wants to be heartfelt and cheerful the music accommodates for that and when the anime wants to be sad and depressing it has music that accommodates that as well. I want to highlight the ending song of this anime because it is incredibly adorable and really encompasses the entire aura of what makes this show so endearing.Despite this OVA only being 5 episodes, it really does a lot in those 5 episodes. The first 3 episodes have a more happier and carefree vibe while the last two episodes are very sad and somber but all 5 episodes are used to strengthen the relationship between Keichi and Belldandy without becoming overbearing and painful.Besides the two main characters other characters are brought into this anime, most notably Belldandy's goddess sisters (Older Sister Urd and Younger Sister Skuld) who definitely add some comedy to this romantic anime. Urd constantly pressures Keichi to grow some courage to tell Belldandy how he truly feels because Keichi is constantly at conflict with himself because even though he has a beautiful girl in his life, he struggles to know if its genuine or not because there are times he thinks she is only there because of the wish she granted him or if she really does have feelings for him.

Since it's oldschool it's presented in a funny-enough way to not make it completely cringe, and since it's an OVA from the late 80s / early 90s it has fantastic animation. It's basically a fun little romance comedy, mostly episodic but turns more coherent and dramatic in the last couple of episodes.There are other characters as well, mostly girls, and they also more or less fall in love with the protagonist. Despite this it never becomes a competing harem, the main love interest stays clear from beginning to end and the...others are fine with that.The OVA is obviously skipping most of the manga's content but despite this it does a decent job at making the relationship develop mostly seamless. Only the sister of the protagonist so quickly accepting all these women suddenly appearing can come of as odd but it's covered up by it being an absurd comedy in the first place, so it's not a big deal.The last episodes are very dramatic and show a shift in tone in the animation. There is also a backstory reveal that serves as the big crux that eternally bonds the two main characters by destiny or some shit. I personally found this rather weak and forced. I'm a bigger fan of the protagonist caring because of the experiences they had together on screen, not because they knew each other in the previous life or whatever.

Megami-sama! or Oh! My Goddess is a 5 episode OVA series that released from Feb 21 1993 to May 17 1994. It's an adaptation of Kousuke Fujishima's manga of the same name. It was produced by studio AIC and directed by Hiroaki Gohda.The story follows Keiichi Morisato. He's a college student who's been left alone in the dorms as his friends have gone out. He ends up dialing the wrong number as he's trying to order some takeout and ends up summoning a beautiful goddess named Belldandy. She promises to grant Keiichi any wish he has, and he wishes for her to stay by...his side forever. Because of this, Keiichi gets kicked out of the mens only dormitory and ends up moving out to an old shrine, where more goddesses and other people show up to get involved in his love life.Keiichi Morisato is a normal college student and our main character. He has no luck with women because he is short, but somehow ends up getting a beautiful goddess as a girlfriend. He's also a part of his college's racing club.Belldandy is the goddess who first visits Keiichi and makes the contract with him to stay with him forever. She is kind, warm, beautiful and makes a lot of heads turn. She's also really good at cooking.Urd is the second goddess that shows up. She's the cupid of love and she is also Belldandy's older sister.

She is Belldandy's younger sister and has come to bring her back to heaven. She does not like Keiichi and wants to try to seperate him and Belldandy.The animation and visuals in this OVA is nothing to write home about. For the most part I would even say that it's kinda poor. There is a lack of concistency in the designs and characters proportions, even when it's not moving, and the animation itself is very basic. Not that there is anything wrong with basic animation, but it is also not impressing anyone.The music in this OVA is also not that great. It feels like it always overpowers whatever is going on. Like in a lot of the dramatic scenes. It's usually very light drama, but the music seems to want you to think that the world is ending tomorrow. It's very off-putting to say the least.Despite these flaws, I have to say that I enjoyed this OVA. It was very short and sweet, but it didn't stick around on pointless moments, and got on with it and let you experience a lot of what happened between the characters, making the bonds between them feel more real. Sure, it could have been a few episodes longer so as to avoid some of those pretty huge timeskips, but it didn't really bother me that much. I really enjoyed the characters, and none of them got on my nerves. That in itself is a pretty good feat, cause I always tend to find at least one character that annoys me. Overall it was a short and sweet OVA that I enjoyed watching. I would recommend people check this out. It's only 5 episodes at 35 - 30 mins each, so it's not a huge investment either. his side forever.

This anime version is a 5 episode OVA from 1993 that is loosely based on the long running successful manga by Kosuke Fujishima. Usually short OVAs are not much and don't contain much for character development, but this is a rare exception? Why? Well, let's delve deep into here and see why this anime OVA is a classic and favorite among many:Story (9/10): One day in a college dorm, a student named Keiichi Morisato calls on the phone to get some takeout for lunch, but accidentally dials the Goddess Technical...Help Line and is visited by a goddess from heaven herself called Belldandy, who is there to grant him a single wish. Keiichi, who's never been successful at getting a girlfriend, wishes that Belldandy could stay with him forever and it is granted. After being kicked out of the male only dorm, Keiichi and Belldandy begin a series of events where they find a place to live, try to help each other out, meet Urd and Skuld, two other goddesses who are sisters to Belldandy, and when Belldandy receives a call from the Almighty himself, the two discover that their relationship may be more than they thought it would be...While I am currently reading the manga and am not finished with it yet (I may update when I finish it), I will say this: this version is not accurate to the manga at all when comparing it (certain characters don't appear in the second chapter and events in the last two episodes are original to this OVA), but that doesn't mean that it's bad at all. The writers were able to do their own interpretation of the love story of Keiichi and Belldandy  actually make it work in two hours time, and have a satisfying conclusion, something that some other OVAs I've seen have failed to do.What also makes this story work is the balance between the romantic, drama and comedy elements. Even though this is only two hours long, the romance felt between our two leads feels very genuine and realistic, their relationship grows easily over the course of the five episodes and in the end you can truly feel that it was earned. The comedy is also hilarious, relying on fanservice but also some slapstick here and there. The dramatic parts shine especially well in the last two episodes where the show successfully manages to shift from comedy to drama without effecting it in a bad way, unlike shows like Voogie's Angel, you might need the tissue box at the end.It does have flaws though. The aforementioned fanservice part of the comedy may turn some viewers off, and some of the problems Belldandy and Keiichi deal with may only seem minor or stuff you may see in other romantic stories, and some people familiar with the manga may complain about it not being too faithful but whatever good this series has, far, far, far outweighs the flaw.Art/Animation (9/10): AIC, or Anime International Corporation, mostly has great, if not good looking anime in their library, and this is one of their best looking ones yet. The art and animation are absolutely beautiful for a 1993 anime and OVA; all of the characters are very well drawn, the clothes the goddesses wear are imaginatively lovely, there's lots of bright colors in the background and characters, the backgrounds look full of life and easy on the eyes, and the animation for the majority of the time is fluid and smooth. The comedic expressions aren't as hilarious as Fujishima's art, but they still do their job very well. Belldandy and Urd look attractive and ravishing (Urd especially looks sexy), Skuld looks adorkable and cute, and a lot of the minor characters like Keiichi's dorm-mates all look unique and you can tell every character in here has their own personality to them based on their looks, no two characters here look the same. I will admit though, I did funnily think that Aoshima looked like Harry Potter (sans the scar) if he were an anime character. The only minor nitpick I have with the art is that some of the sunny backgrounds have a lot of white in them to the point where they look unfinished or not colored in completely, but other than that this anime is one of the best to look at, I'd even hang a still frame of some of them on my wall. The endings are also all unique as they all have their own animations to them, I liked the ending animation with the super deformed/chibi versions of them best.In terms of fan service and such, there is a good amount, mostly in the second episode; Urd is seen posing in a sensual way when she first appears and has a skimpy swimsuit and cheerleader outfit in the third episode, and Belldandy is shown nude briefly when transforming into her goddess form in the final episode, but it's no worse than a naked Barbie.Sound (8/10): The voice acting is spectacular in this anime. Kikuko Inoue (Reika from Battle Skipper, Shiori from Voogie's Angel, Sailor Aluminum Siren from Sailor Moon Sailor Stars) practically IS Belldandy, she gives the goddess a lovely, sweet, angelic, maternal, practically perfect voice that is so beautiful and makes one charmed by her. I don't understand why some people think it isn't that great, this really is one of her best roles. Masami Kikuchi captures Keiichi's silly, but kind, friendly nature very well. Yumi Touma (Kisenian Flower from Sailor Moon R movie, Reiko Takagi from Graduation, Marriage and Sailor Victory) is perfectly cast as Urd, giving the second-class goddess a sultry, passionate voice that fits her character. Aya Hisakawa (Ami Mizuno/Sailor Mercury from the Sailor Moon franchise, Voogie from Voogie's Angel, Lisa from Bubblegum Crisis) captures Skuld's childish, bratty, yet likable characteristic. Other highlights of the cast are Junko Asami as Sayako, and Nobou Tobia (Kamille from Zeta Gundam) as Aoshima. All of the VAs in the Japanese versions are excellent, well cast and do a great job delivering their lines and becoming the characters they play as.I have not seen the English dub, but will update when I do. I've heard it's actually good.The opening and ending themes are excellent, being performed by the VAs of the three goddesses, but unfortunately the rest of the music is sadly forgettable. It isn't bad, but not particularly memorable.Character (8/10): The characters are where this anime also shines through, a lot of the characters, while they may seem stereotypical or just tropes, are more than just that, they all have their own unique personalities, grow over the course of this OVA and are mostly likable. Belldandy lives up to being a kind goddess, she is very kind, sweet, and caring for Keiichi, doing her best to help him out and be happy no matter what happens. She could be seen as too perfect by some people, but it's not in a horrible, bad way; she proves why she is such a lovable character and displays so much positive qualities and energy she's earned it. Keiichi may be clumsy and isn't always perfect, but he too tries to make sure Belldandy is always happy and shows that he loves her too. Urd (who in the manga tried to seduce Keiichi when she first met him) is impulsive and tries to come up with plans that don't usually succeed and meddles with things, but it's usually with good intentions and though she does anger easily she does soften up near the end. Skuld's dislike of Keiichi, childishness and clingy nature may annoy some people but I still found her funny and to be fair, she is a child and children tend to act out if they're feeling alone and she acts more caring towards Keiichi . She is basically the tech member of the goddesses, building inventions and using technology (kinda like Mercury). For some of the minor characters, Megumi, Keiichi's little sister, does act like a typical little sister but isn't as childish as Skuld is. Sayako is jealous of Belldandy, loving Keiichi himself but does change a bit towards the end, Aoshima is the typical cocky rival, and even Keiichi's dormmates are goofy, not the brightest bulbs but still likable, even after they kick him out of the dorm.Unfortunately some characters you see in the opening (the girl with the blond hair and Sora, the girl with the short brown hair and glasses) either don't appear in the OVA or have more minor rolesOverall (9/10): This has become one of my favorite anime series and makes me glad I discovered this amazing romantic slice-of-life comedy. The story is romantic and charming, the art/animation are wonderful, the characters are charming, funny, and sweet, it doesn't overstay its welcome and you don't even have to read the manga in order to watch this great anime, it is another perfect way to introduce you to this story. If you want a great classic anime series, like anime with magical goddesses, romance, slice of life, comedy, or any of those, check this one out, you don't wanna miss out. If that's not the case, then stay away.Now to check out the movie and hope, or in this case, pray, that it will be great...

The endings are also all unique as they all have their own animations to them, I liked the ending animation with the super deformed/chibi versions of them best.In terms of fan service and such, there is a good amount, mostly in the second episode; Urd is seen posing in a sensual way when she first appears and has a skimpy swimsuit and cheerleader outfit in the third episode, and Belldandy is shown nude briefly when transforming into her goddess form in the final episode, but it's no worse than a naked Barbie.Sound (8/10): The voice acting is spectacular in this anime. Kikuko Inoue (Reika from Battle Skipper, Shiori from Voogie's Angel, Sailor Aluminum Siren from Sailor Moon Sailor Stars) practically IS Belldandy, she gives the goddess a lovely, sweet, angelic, maternal, practically perfect voice that is so beautiful and makes one charmed by her. I don't understand why some people think it isn't that great, this really is one of her best roles. Masami Kikuchi captures Keiichi's silly, but kind, friendly nature very well. Yumi Touma (Kisenian Flower from Sailor Moon R movie, Reiko Takagi from Graduation, Marriage and Sailor Victory) is perfectly cast as Urd, giving the second-class goddess a sultry, passionate voice that fits her character. Aya Hisakawa (Ami Mizuno/Sailor Mercury from the Sailor Moon franchise, Voogie from Voogie's Angel, Lisa from Bubblegum Crisis) captures Skuld's childish, bratty, yet likable characteristic. Other highlights of the cast are Junko Asami as Sayako, and Nobou Tobia (Kamille from Zeta Gundam) as Aoshima. All of the VAs in the Japanese versions are excellent, well cast and do a great job delivering their lines and becoming the characters they play as.I have not seen the English dub, but will update when I do. I've heard it's actually good.The opening and ending themes are excellent, being performed by the VAs of the three goddesses, but unfortunately the rest of the music is sadly forgettable. It isn't bad, but not particularly memorable.Character (8/10): The characters are where this anime also shines through, a lot of the characters, while they may seem stereotypical or just tropes, are more than just that, they all have their own unique personalities, grow over the course of this OVA and are mostly likable. Belldandy lives up to being a kind goddess, she is very kind, sweet, and caring for Keiichi, doing her best to help him out and be happy no matter what happens. She could be seen as too perfect by some people, but it's not in a horrible, bad way; she proves why she is such a lovable character and displays so much positive qualities and energy she's earned it. Keiichi may be clumsy and isn't always perfect, but he too tries to make sure Belldandy is always happy and shows that he loves her too. Urd (who in the manga tried to seduce Keiichi when she first met him) is impulsive and tries to come up with plans that don't usually succeed and meddles with things, but it's usually with good intentions and though she does anger easily she does soften up near the end. Skuld's dislike of Keiichi, childishness and clingy nature may annoy some people but I still found her funny and to be fair, she is a child and children tend to act out if they're feeling alone and she acts more caring towards Keiichi . She is basically the tech member of the goddesses, building inventions and using technology (kinda like Mercury). For some of the minor characters, Megumi, Keiichi's little sister, does act like a typical little sister but isn't as childish as Skuld is. Sayako is jealous of Belldandy, loving Keiichi himself but does change a bit towards the end, Aoshima is the typical cocky rival, and even Keiichi's dormmates are goofy, not the brightest bulbs but still likable, even after they kick him out of the dorm.Unfortunately some characters you see in the opening (the girl with the blond hair and Sora, the girl with the short brown hair and glasses) either don't appear in the OVA or have more minor rolesOverall (9/10): This has become one of my favorite anime series and makes me glad I discovered this amazing romantic slice-of-life comedy. The story is romantic and charming, the art/animation are wonderful, the characters are charming, funny, and sweet, it doesn't overstay its welcome and you don't even have to read the manga in order to watch this great anime, it is another perfect way to introduce you to this story. If you want a great classic anime series, like anime with magical goddesses, romance, slice of life, comedy, or any of those, check this one out, you don't wanna miss out. If that's not the case, then stay away.Now to check out the movie and hope, or in this case, pray, that it will be great..."", 'This is the ""original"" and first Anime based on Kousuke Fujishima\'s ""Aa! Megami-sama!"" (Oh! My Goddess)  Manga, produced in 1993; only roughly 6 years after the first Manga release. It was originally sold on home video directly to customers; the target market would largely have been fans of the extant Manga. This series is only 5 episodes, all running around 30 minutes. However it is formatted like it would be if it were to actually be broadcast, including a mid-show ""break"" with an eye-catch (many direct-to-video OAVs of the era were designed that way both for fun and in case the videos were ever...picked up for broadcast).Having been produced in the early 90\'s, this is Anime in its original ink-and-paint form. Here that medium is used deftly, setting the tone in a way you rarely see in digital animation. Many of the background paintings are soft watercolors or vibrant – yet washed out. While some backgrounds are stronger, depending on the scene, on the whole this gives the Anime a soft texture, underscoring its whimsical romantic-comedy structure. As with many OAV of this era, the artwork on the cell animation is exemplary, as these kinds of OAV typically had limited budgets but were not quite  as production-time constrained and as such, what was produced was of general higher quality than what you\'d see in a TV production run. The lush detailing of the cell animation is proof of this, and is fairly uniform throughout. In fact, for me, coming back to this Anime is like re-watching a dream. Not just from the soft watercolor backgrounds and the now gone cell animation styles. More so because the manga was originally created in the late 80\'s and many sets and technology objects rendered into the Anime are increasingly anachronistic, but familiar to some of us who grew up in that era (as I did). For example the rotary land-line phone in the Nekomi Tech dorm (including its 10-yen coin slot) is decidedly foreign to many in our post-landline mobile smart-phone world today. Other subtle objects like the apparently miniature (but not really for its era) CRT television with channel dials, or the computer Skuld uses. There are probably other details only the Japanese would pick up, probably with dress, hairstyles, and the general nature of the college students (like the Auto Club) which are probably sorely outdated now.As to the story, as was also typical of this era of OAVs, it\'s adapted from the Manga but doesn\'t hew to it exactly. It also skips a bit in terms of chronology, due in no small part to the limited production and the need to put together something cohesive and satisfying. Remember most consumers buying this would have already read the Manga (so fans would fill in the blanks around the enjoyment of seeing key scenes in animation) or were to be inspired to do so by watching it (if you like the Anime, read the Manga!). Therefore the goal was never to ""animate the manga succinctly"". Indeed, often non-manga-canon alternate scenarios were done in OAVs as much to explore the characters and story in a new and exciting way as it was a method of ensuring the OAV could end satisfyingly without rushing through a long Manga plot (without doing it justice). Of course, it also gave the Manga fans yet another incentive to purchase it if there was new content that wasn’t in the Manga. So be thankful for all the manga and light novels that get turned into 12-13 episode half-seasons today, even if that\'s all you get. In the past, often all we got were a few (albeit really fun) episodes direct-to-video ""back in the day"" like this with years (or never!) before seeing anything else get animated.In any case, with this OAV we do get a number of requisite scenes which really aren\'t spoilers here; Belldandy\'s arrival and Keiichi\'s wish; their move into the Tariki-hongan temple, Megumi\'s appearance, the Auto Club and the Senpais, Urd\'s appearance (which is simultaneously wonderfully hilarious and embarrassingly sultry), Skuld\'s appearance, and a few scenes with both Sayoko and Aoshima as antagonists. There are also a number of supernatural elements in the story utilizing some pretty impressive-for-their-time analog lighting effects.However, it must be said, the later television series and its related specials and OAV which began in 2005, cover all the major elements shown in this OAV; most of it in the first 12 or so episodes of the first 2005 TV season and most of the rest in the second 2006 TV season. Therefore, in terms of a ""sequential Anime marathon"" this OAV is rendered obsolete. Thus it is best taken on its own, for its own sake and qualities. I often, personally either watch it just before or just after completing a re-watch of all the other Oh! My Goddess! Anime. However, because it doesn\'t tend to precipitate into hours of re-watching the whole Anime canon, it\'s also fun as a one-off...like if you get the hankering for a little SoL RomCom on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It\'s a little old but a lot charming, and definitely a fun little distraction, which is why it’s consistently remained high on my list since the time when I was a poor college student, much like Keiichi. picked up for broadcast).Having been produced in the early 90\'s, this is Anime in its original ink-and-paint form.

The chief problem lies in the fact that at 5 episodes this OVA barely has time to cover the principal characters and give passing notice to a few supporting characters before the climactic wrap-up in the final couple of episodes. Some supporting characters don't even get mentioned or seen, but considering that this OVA was made early in the manga run this makes sense. Fast forward a decade and the series saw a proper long-form TV adaptation, incorporating several manga story arcs. And although open-ended, did manage to feel complete...when taken in full with the Fighting Wings OVA & especially the AMG movie from a few years before, which used similar plot elements which later surfaced in the concluding chapters of the manga. Still in terms of visual and sound design, the series has aged remarkably well, even if the truncated narrative felt rushed due to the rather short run of the OVA. when taken in full with the Fighting Wings OVA & especially the AMG movie from a few years before, which used similar plot elements which later surfaced in the concluding chapters of the manga.

The premise is not realistic by any means but it is so over the top fun. There is a big cast of colorful characters that add to light and comedic tone. Both leads have a boy/girl next door personality that is very endearing to watch. The cel animation is so beautiful that your heart will skip a beat at the soft, romantic scenes.With such a short run time, however, there is...essentially no fluid story.

Disclaimer: I will be completely blinded by nostalgia goggles on this review.This was one of the first animes I saw. Maybe number 4 or 5 ever. Like the others I saw, it blew my mind. It was great. I thought the girls were cute, the music was catchy, and that it was great that a dull shrimp of an MC had a chance to be the center of attention with pretty women. For real though, if I had one wish at the time, it'd be that I'd have a magic girlfriend who was solely devoted to me no matter...how dopey I was.StoryA guy dials a wrong number and gets linked up with a magic girlfriend. I guess the setup has been done many times by now, but at the time, it felt original.The couple finds a house, has a beach episode, get into a motorcycle drag race, and then try to sort out a cosmic imbalance. All in 5 episodes too. It was a pretty brisk series. I like it when things move fast.I really liked the first three episodes. Everything was light, funny, and enjoyable. This is when the series was at its best. Our MC was mostly a chump but I will give him props for manning up during the motorcycle race.The last two episodes took a turn to the dramatic and missed the mark. Some business about being childhood friends, a ring, and working jobs to pay for stuff. Not the best stuff.Overall, 3/5 fun episodes & 2/5 cringey episodes.Is this series cheap male wish fulfillment? I wouldn't say it is cheap . . . It's not as bad as modern harem animes.CharactersOur main characters were on the boring side. Keiichi was the standard issue dopey beta guy. It bothered me that he was in college and looked and acted like he was in middle school. It was the body proportions and being such a chump. I guess he was meant to be the self-insert for most dudes watching this.And then Belldandy. The perfect, passive, domestic girlfriend who was unconditionally dedicated to her man. Dream woman? Nah. Kind of boring, actually. I was concerned that she didn't have her own desires (other than to be a perfect mate) and was completely content to be a slave-like wife. And then her name. Couldn't they just give her a nonsense name like her sisters?The side characters were better.There was the older sister Urd. She was the spicy one. I loved her entrance and the fact that she tried to push Keiichi and Belldandy together. She enjoyed being a wing-woman and that was awesome.The younger goddess sister was cute but annoying. It's anime so what's new, right?There were Keiichi's younger sister, his club mates, and a rival racer guy. Decent characters for a short series.All in all, it was an above average cast.Art & DirectionThe art was pretty good. The character designs were good. They were distinctive and told us everything we needed to know about their personalities at first glance. Stereotypical, absolutely, but I still I love it when they do that.It was the mid 90s so the colors and the details didn't pop the way they do now. But they were good for the time.Nothing special with the direction. It was straightforward storytelling without symbols, foreshadowing, or any of the high-minded English class snobbery.SoundThe music was really catchy, particularly the closing theme. It was cute, upbeat, lovey-dovey, and sung by the VAs of the three goddesses. It fit the series perfect. The OP was good too. Super bonus points for no loli voice.The voice acting was good for the subtitled version. The goddesses sounded the way I would imagine. Belldandy had too much of the single-energy sweet motherly voice for my tastes. It wasn't horrible but I would have gotten annoyed with it if I wasn't enjoying the show overall.

This is a very cheerful and comedic anime with a bit of drama in every episode to keep things interesting.Honestly the first episode failed to impress me because Keichii is your typical wimpy male protagonist who is easily shocked about everything and Belldandy is your lovely soft anime waifu who never gets angry about anything. It does get better in episode 2 though, more comedy, more drama, the characters experience growth and mature over each episode and become more relatable as a couple...with the challenges they face, like a being harassed by bullies/haters, jealous sisters and things like that though it does feel like an eternity for anything to happen between Keiichi and Bell.Belldandy's sisters, Urk and the other whose name I forgot are also part of the story and are quite likeable at first but you'll soon realize that their only purpose is to either make or break the relationship of Keichii and Bell. After their own character specific episode ends they become stale DBZ side characters where they really don't matter much to the plot anymore other than to be around the MCs. What's even worse is that they even lose a bit of the personality that made them so unique, they all become these generic caring and supportive side characters with no goals or real reason to be there.The story starts simple enough but the final episode adds a twist that kinda ruins everything and the ending is unsatisfying. The art style is very 90's, nice to look at but for some reason each episode looks worse than the previous one.The last episode looks absolutely awful, characters like Urk that used to look beautiful and hot look less detailed and rushed like the production team was on a very tight budget or something. The music isn't memorable.Overal, the show had potential but it was wasted by not taking it's time to develop it's characters more and keep them consistent.

High School Fleet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31500/High_School_Fleet,"[""Haifuri, one of the WORST promoted anime of all time. Okay that might be exaggerating, but not a lot of promotion is of this anime I have to say this season and to be absolutely frank (not Dave, we don’t talk about Dave), it was infuriating. Why? Because it’s completely the opposite to what people think it is and it was in my opinion absolutely fantastic.Okay, short rant over, let’s get down to it since I’ve been itching to write a review but I wanted to finish the anime first and now that’s happened let’s get going with the review.Story: 8Unlike some people’s first...impression of “this anime is a slice of life, loli anime with no plot (in both senses) at all”, Haifuri actually has an over arcing plot and story and it is introduced to the audience in the most dramatic way possible in the first episode. Now what is interesting about the story is the fact that it’s a semi-mysterious-esque plot line which is fairly fresh compared to say Girls und Panzer (I recommend that anime as well) which was a tournament based anime or KanColle, which has the generic story of “fight the bad guys because the narrator said so at the beginning”. Now there’s obviously the ideas of friendship power and team work in this anime as well which isn’t surprising but it’s not intrusive to the plot but rather helps the characters to overcome certain problems, which most of the time they can't overcome regardless of the friendship power and it’s these plot twists and subtle differences that make the story unique and interesting. However, I have to mention the fact that there are a two “filler” episodes in that there’s not really too much naval action and breaks the tension generated by the other episodes but they weren’t intrusive and helped to develop the characters so can’t complain too much.Art and Animation: 9The ships are really well animated and they do feel like the girls are on board a real ship with all of its related equipment and weapons. Explosions are also eye candy and pairs well with the sound effects. The ships move realistically, shakes and rides the waves like a ship would. The water animation is of note as well and makes you feel like they are at sea. If you just came for the battles and fights, you’ll be pleased as the weapons are also fairly well animated (torpedoes especially). If you came for the cute girls then you won’t be disappointed either. 31 cuties each with a different style to match their persona and all of them will leave at least some impressionable image in your mind. Although for some reason, it might just be me, but the ships seems to be in a higher resolution than the characters sometimes. However, it’s nothing too significant that can affect the enjoyment of the show.Sounds: 9OP is catchy and gets stuck in your head, ED is soft and calming. Both fits the theme of the sea very well. The sound track during the anime isn’t used to fill the silence but rather used to great effect adding lots of tension to the scenes. Those sound tracks can really get your heart racing during the fight scenes and your heart throbbing in some of the more emotional scenes, and trust me, the feels will hit you like a truck. Other sounds worth mentioning is the sound effects which are pretty good. You can hear the whistle of the shell getting louder as it get nearer to the ship, the heavy explosion during impact, the creaking of the ship under stress, the echo of detonations of torpedoes in the water and the list just goes on. All these sound effect adds more excitement, tension and action to the scenes and boy they feel satisfying.Characters: 7Now you might be asking why the low score with characters after the praises I’ve sung for in previous categories? Well it’s simple, the problem with casting 31 girls is the fact that there is definitely no way every single one will get developed to a significant degree that you can remember their names and their personas in a 12 episode season (hence this needs a second season please!). So some the supporting cast had very little to say and aren’t presented to us fully which is a downer. However it’s understandable and unavoidable with such a huge cast, but credit to where credit’s due, they did at least try to make every member of the crew memorable in the second to last episode. Now the positives is the fact that those characters that we do see often and remember more are developed very well. The MC, Mike-chan, goes through a series of transformations from slightly clumsy airhead at the start to full blown determined captain by the end, whilst the also uncovering some of the back stories behind her which was “interesting” (used “interesting” to avoid spoiling the feeling, go watch to find out). Shiro-chan, the deputy-captain, started off strict and harsh, but we all knew she was a soft person inside and eventually she shows it as the relationships between the characters grew. To name but a few more; Tama-chan, Rin-chan, Maron-chan, Mei-chan, all these had much differing personalities and each developed and grew in their own way as the story progressed and it really made the series lovable. Also there are two cats. (Personal favourite: Tama-chan)Enjoyment: 10The entire series was enjoyable to me. Each episode made me yearn for more. The tension was brilliant and the story flowed nicely. The action scenes and battles were the highlights for me and was full of excitement and a joy to watch. The characters are definitely lovable and undoubtedly cute. The series was definitely the highlight of the season for me and I want a second season so bad!Overall: 9If you like cute girls, this anime will be your piece of cake whilst also be surprising.If you like military and battles, this anime will still be your cup of tea since that is the anime’s focus which is different from say GirlPan.If you like moe, give it a shot, but it won’t be the main focus, but I think you’ll enjoy some parts of it at least.If you like suspense, well I wouldn’t say it’s very suspenseful but there are elements of it.If you don’t like cute girls, then turn around and leave via the door behind you because there’s no way I can convince you.If you are looking for FANSERVICE, this anime WILL DISAPPOINT you to no end! So follow the cute girl haters out as well and go watch Strike Witches instead.Full speed ahead! Steady as she goes! impression of “this anime is a slice of life, loli anime with no plot (in both senses) at all”, Haifuri actually has an over arcing plot and story and it is introduced to the audience in the most dramatic way possible in the first episode. Now what is interesting about the story is the fact that it’s a semi-mysterious-esque plot line which is fairly fresh compared to say Girls und Panzer (I recommend that anime as well) which was a tournament based anime or KanColle, which has the generic story of “fight the bad guys because the narrator said so at the beginning”. Now there’s obviously the ideas of friendship power and team work in this anime as well which isn’t surprising but it’s not intrusive to the plot but rather helps the characters to overcome certain problems, which most of the time they can't overcome regardless of the friendship power and it’s these plot twists and subtle differences that make the story unique and interesting. However, I have to mention the fact that there are a two “filler” episodes in that there’s not really too much naval action and breaks the tension generated by the other episodes but they weren’t intrusive and helped to develop the characters so can’t complain too much.Art and Animation: 9The ships are really well animated and they do feel like the girls are on board a real ship with all of its related equipment and weapons. Explosions are also eye candy and pairs well with the sound effects. The ships move realistically, shakes and rides the waves like a ship would. The water animation is of note as well and makes you feel like they are at sea. If you just came for the battles and fights, you’ll be pleased as the weapons are also fairly well animated (torpedoes especially). If you came for the cute girls then you won’t be disappointed either. 31 cuties each with a different style to match their persona and all of them will leave at least some impressionable image in your mind. Although for some reason, it might just be me, but the ships seems to be in a higher resolution than the characters sometimes.

Steady as she goes!"", 'You know, if there’s one title from the top of my head with a misleading promo poster, then High Fleet Girls would be the first title this year to be named. Initially, the series was promoted under the title ‘Hai-furi’ before the revelation that it’s more than just about “cute girls doing cute things”. Much, much more.Before starting the show, I think it’s also important to understand the background and setting of the story. It takes place in an alternate modern world although events from 100 years ago (shift in tectonic plates) has changed much of Japan. The country attempts to preserve territories and establish...costal colonies and cities. The primary focus of the story is about the Blue Mermaids, a group that is tasked to keep the sea safe and is also apparently every female student’s dream job.The series starts off quickly and reveals that a girl named Akeno Misaki (nicknamed “Mike”) with a big dream. She enrolls at an academy known as “Yokosuka Girls\' Marine High School” with the goal to join the Blue Mermaids. For the first episode, the show establishes that Akeno and her crew faces unexpected circumstances as they are accused of mutiny. Furthermore, Akeno becomes the captain of the destroyer ship Harekaze. Make no mistake though, the show has a rather serious vibe despite the misleading atmosphere. The crew faces against battleships armed with real firepower capable of destroying them. Furthermore, Akeno is a newbie with lack of experience and tries hard to earn the respect of her crew. In essence, the show makes it clear that it’s no joke and pushes the idea of naval warfare to a level that you may not be prepared for.Among the crew, there is a variety of characters. One thought that crossed my mind is how the show can fit characterization with so many. After all, introducing all the girls at once seems like a mistake because there’s nothing in particular that makes them stand out individually besides the main protagonists. Most of them seems to have generic characteristics as well ranging from being stubborn, class clown, nervousness, etc. It’s also hard to ignore the similarities between this and Girls und Panzer especially with how talent is developed from both series. In some ways, the show does a neat job at making each episode relevant with its premise. In other ways, I have to say that the character cast is perhaps just too big for its own good.Either way, you’ll probably find some characters from the series to be more noticeable than others. Besides Akeno, we have Mashiro Munetani, the deputy captain of Harekaze. Unlike Akeno, she seems more like the serious type that takes everything a bit too straightforward and even has a case of allurophobia. Then, there’s quiet girls like Shima Tateishi with elite gunning skills, Mei Irizaki with her passion to fight, Kouka Nosa with a theoretical mind,  and timid Rin Shiretoko with decent steering abilities. They make up the bulk of the characters’ screen time so keep in mind while watching their roles. What I also find insightful about the show is that it divides the Blue Mermaid crew well with division to make each of them unique. For instance, there’s the Bridge of the crew with their central command objectives, the combat unit with their fighting talents, navigation division with their abilities to navigate under any circumstance, engineering department for construct and repair, and Logistics for aid in operations. The point is that the show doesn’t neglect any part of the Blue Mermaid crew and makes each role important to ensure the team’s success. On the downside, there isn’t much concrete characterization. The sheer amount of characters for this one cour show just seems a bit too much and perhaps the most characterization we’ll get is between Akeno’s childhood with her friend.Between the story and the slice of life feeling, High School Fleet feels more like a marine school/military hybrid adventure. The show makes it clear that Blue Mermaid is in danger at times especially when combating other ships (the most prominent one being the infamous Musashi). At other times, it feels like a school floating on water. This is because of the inner storytelling that goes inside the ship with the girls living their dream job. They want to have fun while working so on occasions, there will emerge “breather” episodes to show their lifestyle. At other times, they must be prepared for what’s ahead. That is, one particular part of the story baffles me with the way it’s executed when it involves peculiar experimentations. I’m all in for surprises but that took me by storm, almost like the way that Akeno is taken by her unexpected role. For some, this could drive away viewers from further pursuing the series but for others, it may also spark more interest. In retrospect, High School Fleet is one of those shows that you’ll have to expect the unexpected.It’s an anime original first and produced by TMS Entertainment. For artwork standards, it’s fairly well done in terms of ship designs. This is important because it gives more viewers interest to see how they work. I’m also impressed by the way Harekaze is designed with its 12.7 cm/50 Type 3 naval gun turrets and MK 16 naval guns. The  5""/54 caliber Mark 16 and Mark 37 also looks surprisingly realistic. In terms of character designs, it’s generally moderate with a decent effort and budget poured towards making the girls look adorable and professional. Remember, there are at least 30 girls on just one ship alone! Like most shows that takes almost exclusively at sea, expect fan service with an even inevitable “beach episode”. However, the show itself excels the most at combat choreography. Even the night battles gives a strong impression of what naval warfare about. And in essence, the series knows how to expand its limits to make the fights believable.On the subject of soundtrack, the show is crisp and knows what it’s doing most of the time. This is especially true for the intense battle orchestrated OST that really gets the adrenaline pumping. Character voices are also accurately portrayed to reflect their personalities and expressions. Remember, these girls are practically part of the military so it’s interesting to see how they react under extreme circumstances. The voice mannerism does just that. OP and ED theme songs are catchy as well that gives the marine vibes and cool atmospheric feeling.High School Fleet is like the love child of Girls und Panzer and Kantai Collection. If you’ve seen either series, then you may find yourself quite familiar with this show. Still, as an anime original, the show has its own merits with the storytelling, characters, and overall style. For the majority, the show is perhaps a refreshing idea by taking cute girls and put them on a warship for their adventure. For others, it may be more of a forgettable attempt to revolutionize the female gender role. Still, I’d give this show a try because it’ll be an experience that sails with high spirit. costal colonies and cities.

Nothing particularly great or terrible comes to mind. The plot was intriguing, and the characters are developed enough that I can partially invest myself.Up until this point there have been hints of something sinister and nefarious running in the background, driving the plot. We've had some build up in tension, and we get a boat-fight as the climax of each episode. Doesn't really break conventions at all, but it doesn't drive us away. The third episode ends with a ray of hope that the protagonists might have some external alliesAnd then episode 4 rolls out. We start the...episode by completely dissolving all the dramatic tension. We are alerted that the school, where they can hopefully solve the conflict, is only 26 hours of sailing away. Just over a day's journey. That leaves a large window for something to go wrong, but gives the impression that they are close to success.And then the entire crew falls into disarray because they're out of spare toilet paper. Further dialogue suggests that they are not right out, indicating that there is likely some in the bathrooms currently. They suddenly break into worry over their dwindling supplies, and there is talk about stopping in a nearby town to restock, despite the current ban on their ship from entering all ports other than the schools. This is the premise of the episodeOn its own, the shopping subplot isn't terrible. What makes it so, is that they just affirmed with the audience that they'll arrive at the school (where the ship would normally restock) in 26 hours time. That means that at this time tomorrow, the girls will be 2 hours away from salvation.Why on earth would they go on a shopping excursion!? Surely they have enough toilet paper to last them a day if they all choose to be as conservative as possible. They already indicated they have plenty of food, and even if they didn't, 26 hours is less than the 30 hour famine that many people take on in support of starving communities! If they'll be at the school soon, why would they risk stalling their journey for another couple hours just so that they can wipe with as much as they want?The first five minutes of episode 4 just absolutely shatter the suspension of disbelief. There is no reason why these girls would make such a stupid decision. I can't even finish the episode now, but I'm fairly certain that attempting this risky excursion gets them caught, they enter into another sea battle (as that seems to be how every episode ends) to fend off the pursuers who found them, and the entire sequence makes it harder to return to the school (because solving a conflict before the end of cour would illustrate just how little content there is).If this is how they're going to try and keep things dramatic, it's not something I can watch. There is nothing more to keep me invested in the series, unless I just want to watch cute girls pilot a ship. episode by completely dissolving all the dramatic tension.

The majority of the character focus goes to...the captain, Akeno Misaki voiced by Shiina Natsukawa, the vice captain with bad luck Mashiro Munetani voiced by Lynn, the German stowaway Wilhelmina Friedeburg voiced by Hiromi Igarashi and Misaki\'s best friend Moeka China voiced by Sora Amamiya. However where the character development goes to are the entire Harukaze\'s teamwork thus the relational teamwork helps with the naval warfare of this anime. AAAnd if your wandering, LA\'s favourite characters were a tie between Akeno and Wilhelmina.Now why the naval warfare instead of just naval fair?, this anime actually has a Cerberus syndrome early on as this anime has a mystery element to it making this ""girls doing cute things"" rather dark and intense but still having the atmosphere of a moe anime.The battles?...is actually the best thing about this anime and reminds LA of Girls und Panzer in this sense, sure the battles that the Harekaze cast isn\'t off the rails like Girls und Panzer did, but to be honest they were on the borderline of doing utterly insane naval moves, not insane, more ""innovative"".The animation by Production IMS, is overall above average, from the character designs being ""moe"" and bright typical of the girls doing cute things anime genre but the battles are pulse pounding and gorgeously animated (sure it has CGI on the naval ships, but the CGI hardly ever irked LA).The voice acting range, well we have mostly ""moe"" voice actors, ironic due to the contrasting naval warfare, however there are some notable voice actors LA needs to point out, those being Hiromi Igarashi as Wilhelmina, not only because of her shy tsundereness, but her German accenting was rather outstanding, on the other hand we have the impressionist bridgehand navigator Kouko Nosa voiced by Yuuko Kurose as well as the ever-genki Maron Yanagiwara voiced by Natsumi Takamori the chief of the engine room came out as a standout and Natsumi Takamori took out as LA\'s favourite voice actor in Haifuri because of that.The ending gave a bittersweet yet impactful ending, the final battle was awesome with all regards with a small plot twist making that final battle even better, the yuri undertones helped immensely too. The bittersweet moment of the ending felt like a salute to the Harekaze as a character though. Overall the ending was just great.LA will be quick about the conclusion of Haifuri, if your a fan of Girls und Panzer and want something VERY similar, then watch Haifuri as that is the naval warfare equivalent of Girls und Panzer just with a mystery element to it.

If that statement interests you, Haifuri is set to sail for ya!', ""Kind of surprised by all the favourable reviews on this....Ok first off I love ships, lolis and moe so when I initially saw this I was delighted thinking it would be girls und panzer meets Kancolle! But god was it was far from it and a chore to finish....Basically I loved the ships, and the character designs but the characters themselves were all insanely annoying and the plot was just beyond stupid and so so frustrating at times. I would personally avoid and I'm going to go into some more detail on why.BEWARE SPOILERS!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok so the story goes that lolis arrive at...this school where they are to be trained as Blue Mermaids, Japan's naval defence force. In an alternate modern timeline much of Japan has been submerged and has become a major naval nation with a huge and powerful fleet. To assure the rest of the world that their navy is only for peaceful and defensive purposes they have the ships run mostly by young girls.So straight away the lolis are assigned to WWII ships and sent out to some far off location to commence naval exercises WITHOUT ANY instructors/teachers or anybody older than about 14 on board. While the main lolis are given a destroyer equipped with training and live ammo, another group is given the Musashi! Yes! The Musashi as in one of the most powerful battleships ever made! Again also without anybody older than about 14! Why were they given the Musashi when surely it's a bit dangerous to be letting new recruits who are lolis handle never mind how expensive it was to run??Anyway we could probably just go with the flow on this one and move alongSo all the ships go out to sea and somehow split up and then some rodents somehow get on board the ships that interfere with electronic devices within a mile radius when convenient and infect the crew with a virus that allows the rodents to exert mind control over them and thus cause them to become aggressive towards other ships and humans....Anyway my first beef begins when the destroyer with the lolis who are all the misfits and low achievers of the fleet get into their first battle. While being attacked with LIVE ammo they lampoon and try act all comical just like the girls in Girls Und Panzer except in girls und Panzer they establish that it's a sport and somehow safe but here they are in a real battle and having moe banter without the slightest bit of concern for their safety. Mind you I guess they don't have too much to worry about cause nobody in the opposing ships during the entire anime can hit them beyond one or two grazing shots.So they eventually fire a training torpedo at the ship and hit it damaging it enough to get away. It then transpires that they somehow sink the ship and have been declared a rouge ship! That's the end of the first episode and I was interested bu then next episode they decide to just sail about the place and eventually they start heading towards some port a day or two away without explaining why they wouldn't just contact home base and explain that they were attacked without warning.So yeah I won't go too much more into the story as I'll be here all day butThe characters are super annoying. The captain routinely leaves the bridge in the middle of battle to personally undertake dangerous missions often on her own while the ship is under attack. Surely the captain should stay on the bridge at all times during combat!? When this is pointed out, we're made to feel bad about it and that somehow the captain was right to do things her way. With a ship full of lolis wouldn't they have a team of girls to do these daring missions maybe led by the 1st officer?? At one point they actually do that when a ships is sinking and they have to perform a rescue mission but some asshole civilian on board the sinking ship tells the girls that there's still a little one lost in the ship without saying it was just a kitten. I love kittens but when a ship is about to sink I don't think it's a good idea to trick a loli rescue worker into risking her life and almost killing her. She seriously almost gets killed and when the loli and the kitten are luckily rescued, the person that told her to rescue the kitten tell her that they no longer want the kitten and dump it on her! >_=So the deputy captain or first officer is mostly useless and the girl they entrust with steering the ship is terrified of everything. I mean why would she be assigned to steering the ship with she obviously has serious mental problems?? It just gets really really annoying.But oh yeah conveniently for the lolis on the destroyer they have this genius doctor (who's 12!) on board who eventually figures out about the rodents and makes a vaccine. Why was this doctor there and not with the elite students? Never explained.So anyway on their way back to base they run low on  toilet paper and rather than survive for 24hrs they go shopping on a shopping mall ship where naturally they get caught. Again they make no attempt to contact base let them know all that has happened. Luckily for them they are not shot on the spot and somehow they adults believe that something odd is going on.So the rest of the anime is the lolis on the destroyer going around to the various battleships under mind control and somehow stopping them and rescuing everybody on board. All the while the adults essentially do nothing the entire anime except get beaten when they do engage the battleships in combat. It's not even like the lolis on the destroyer are clever cause they're shown to be almost clueless.The one ray of hope is a German loli that joins the ship and seems to have a clue on how to run things but after  a while they mostly ignore her and jokes are made about her being a German??Pretty much all the characters are OTT super happy and it just gets really annoying especially when they're in a dicey situation or just get news that friends are in danger.The story is just balls and they never fully explain how these rodents infect people or scramble electronic devices within a mile at certain times or why the cats are unaffected, or how they even got onto all the ships in the first place. There's no clever zany tactics like in girls Und panzer and even if there was the lolis are often in situations where if they get one direct hit they will all die and they lack of tension just drives me mad.Anyway my rant is pretty much over. The story sucks and the characters are too annoying. On the other hand the positives are the lolis look cute, the ships can be fun to watch at times, and it usually has decent animation and sound. For me this the worst anime I've watched in the last 6 months at least and I've seen a lot!

I have rarely found such kind of enjoyment in anime, I enjoy anime, but this kind is very different.The story is very engaging, looks like the girls mutinied and are being designated as a rogue ship and is being preyed on by multiple ships attempting to neutralize the ""threat"" they possess, this was some real hype stuff, dunno, I just felt it. It was really fun with the story, but while I found the infection part pretty corny, I still did enjoy it a lot, being a...turning point for the story, it was very fun!Art, ok, I get it. The artstyle of these girls are very, very cute. I know that\'s the point of the anime but it\'s really adorable. The animation is also top tier, CG girls were used in the anime, but only if you look close enough to notice.For the soundtrack... I can\'t believe I would have a song stuck in my mind for months!!!Haifuri OP introduced me to TrySail, easily became my favorite girl group or band or whatever you call that. High Free Spirits is very, very, very, catchy. It is too catchy it should be a crime. One of the best openings I\'ve seen and heard.I love Akeno\'s character, it\'s so cute, and then when she and her Deputy Officer chilled down, they easily had the best partner feels, and also that torpedo officer and the fire direction officer (sorry I forget names), also that secretary girl, all of them have really fun personalities, I love it.Enjoyment? 10/10 Of course, I really enjoyed this.Overall, if you love military things with cute anime girls, you will definitely love this. If you\'re in for the plot, you might enjoy this, if you\'re here for fanservice, or ecchi in a way, there aren\'t any, but if you\'re just looking for some lighthearted cute show? I don\'t think this is the right one, it does have some really hype up scenes and tense moments. But if you\'re just generally looking for anything to watch, I highly recommend. 10/10 turning point for the story, it was very fun!Art, ok, I get it. The artstyle of these girls are very, very cute.

The next day I checked it again and it was 7.33. Anyways, since this anime is now underrated, I will need to release my feelings that are about to burst here as this is the most thrilling and intense anime I\'ve ever seen in my life.Story: 9/10:The story overall is very thrilling and exciting, I was overwhelmed by every...episode including the filler episodes as well, the backstory behind the anime is also well explained and I like how they chose to use a realistic method to infect the crew in the ship instead of using supernatural method also makes the show feel more real although the action and strategies parts are the parts I enjoyed most in the show.Art: 10/10The art is also very good, there may be some tiny minor CGs that I spotted but I did not care anyways. The environment, the sea, the ship, the characters and most importantly, the battle were so beautiful and perfectly done. The sea\'s animation is stable, the ship moves realistically, the characters\' visual are good and the camera angles during the battle switches between both side\'s perspective so clearly that it makes me feel that I\'m in the battle with them.Sound: 10/10Tbh, I actually started watching this anime because I thought the op is the Kantai Collection\'s one and I liked it very much but when I heard high school fleet\'s op for the first time in 2nd episode I was blown away as I had low expectation for it since it wasn\'t the op I was expecting to hear but somehow it is even better than the Kantai Collection\'s op ( the climax is so gooooood). The soundtracks are also very suitable during the fight and the last episode\'s sound was indescribable.Character: 10/10I did not find any waifu here but I just want to say that there are so many characters in the show with each one having different unique personalities which seems quite hard to control all those character so perfectly. The characters all have a reasonable amount of screen time and their strong relationship and bonds makes the filler episodes are fun to watch.Enjoyment: 10/10I really enjoyed the anime and it was a thrilling ride for me and my kokoro was beating fast, I was completely into the show.Overall: 10/10This is the best action anime I\'ve ever watched so far and everything about it is very good, it even makes me want to read the Haifuri manga to know what happens next but I can\'t seem to find a manga website that has this manga in it. If you do know a website please tell me.

If you expect this one will be shallow happy go lucky high school girls show, you'll got slap on your face when you watch it. And without too much BS or fan service, the story will progress immediately starting from episode 1 and 2.The plot itself is quite good, the conflicts are intriguing enough too keep me interested. The gap between the cuteness and dire situations feels just right. You'll find quite amusing ship crews here, and each with their unique characteristics. For me, all...of them are likeable, and the entire crew get their screen time, some even showing character development, though it is not much. Of course some people will complain about how useless the adults here, or not so fond with loli solving everything, my advice is: look at the trailer or synopsis before watching, there are absolutely no reason to watch anime like this if you are allergic to cute girls.The best part of Haifuri is, the ocean battle! yes, this show is about battleship voyage after all (though it's supposed to be peaceful class training). Without spoil too much, the girls ship will face various type of enemies. And it's not about which one has the best weapon or bigger ship, various tactics will be involved, that's because our protagonist ship is not the best here. There are also other problems presented that might happen on the voyage (I'm not expert in this part, as people of the land), like lack of supply, etc. which bring more variety other than battle, and there also relaxing moment for you to feast at moe and cuteness.To summarize, this is quality anime which might be underrated. It's recommended for anyone who like action but bored of shonen anime, because this one will be cuter. Of course if I want to nitpick at some plot hole or weird situations it might lower the fun while watching this, but why would I? 10/10 for the enjoyment of them are likeable, and the entire crew get their screen time, some even showing character development, though it is not much.

I never expected a very good plot for the anime at all.Art: 9/10The art is good in general (especially well done on character design, but i'm putting these points to characters), but even if it's cute and fluffy, it doesn't exactly fit so well with the intense battles and it makes the fighting a bit less exciting (don't get distracted by the lolis)...Sound: 7/10The opening is very catchy (HIBIKE!) as well as a good ending.- not much to be said hereCharacter: 10/10.....There're a lot of lo- characters in Haifuri. All the characters have their unique points (similar to Assassination Classroom) and they are all adorable.Enjoyment: 7/10As much as i would love to give a higher score for enjoyment, I believe that the comedy is a bit shallow and hard to understand sometimes. There are some parts where i burst out in laughter but that's bout itOverall: 10/10Why 10/10 even though the average would be nowhere near it?It's definitely not because of the lolis, totally not.... totally :DThe main reason why I gave this series a high score is because of my personal preference, mostly.

But, i want start reviewing when my entry up to 150 animes. And this is one of my masterpiece scored anime in my listIntro :Haifuri a.k.a High School Fleet... A School, Military, Action. FYI, this anime is my first military anime that makes me hyped about military. And of course, Moe material !.... Seems like Kancolle ? You can say it... But this is 10x greater than Kancolle.Misaki Akeno (Favorites Character, and waifu !! >_<) enrolled to Yokosuka High School. One of naval school that makes their students to be a Blue Mermaid. And of course her osananajimi (Chilhood Friend) China...Moeka enrolled too. But, they are in the different warship. This because their test score. Akeno is going to Harekaze. A Destroyer Type warship. And Moeka in to Musashi. Battleship Type Yamato Class. Then, they start their naval training in the ocean.Just like that ? A normal CGDCT ?........ Of course not ! Remember Gakkou Gurashi (Scholl Life!) anime ? You will know how it feel if you had watched that.Story : 8/10I think... the story doesnt have any special things.... Normal plot, many minor twist, and filler are in there. The only things that makes this anime great is the unpredictable 1st episode. Firstly, i think i want to pick a millitary to my friend. But, when i got attached to the artworks. It can't flee from my mind. I enjoyed the story very much... And those CGDCT filler relaxed my eyes when the atmosphere is so serious. But many people maybe think... In which world, in the middle of big problem you lost all your tissue and then go shopping to get the tissue ?... Well, actually i dont care because i'm a moe holic... Many plot holes is filling it... But i too enjoyed with those great naval battle so i never mind itArt : 10/10I think, Production IMS caught me off... Same Illustrator as Non Non Biyori... i can't deny that the art is so great ! Full of Loli ! I GOT MOEBETES ! Not only that... The detail of the warship... Interior, Hull, Canon, and those special effect... The best of all time... The colour very good, full moe chara, perfect brightness, and those goddamned good naval effect made this anime one of masterpiece artworks. 4 Thumbs for IMSSound : 9/10OP High Free Spirit sung by Trysail succesed attach my ears. Make me listen it every time. ED ? I seldom listen it... But i dont hate it. OST ? Success makes me download it 90mb and played everytime i play World of Warship... And Sound Effect of course good. Maybe, nothing special. Many anime have same quality.Character : 8/10I could torture the illustrator about f*cking great artworks. But, 30 girls in a cour anime ? Of course the chara development doesnt good enough. You can see the development in Akeno, Mashiro, and Rin-chan. But, the director put many potential chara which can makes some people curious. Example, Kuro-chan. I see her as an antagonist because her sharp eyes everytime she look Akeno. But until the end of the show, it has nothing to do with the show...Enjoyment : 9/10This is my #1 airing anime spring... Im really hyped waiting it... The naval and the Moe... I like it... maybe if you are the same type with me, a moe holic person... you will enjoy it eventhough you didnt enjoy the navalOverall : 9/10 but my animelist 10/10Moe, naval battle, great music, beautiful art... I'm not naive but i appreciate the people in anime industry... some perfect score maybe not helped it but every things that makes me happy im highly salute it... Disagree ?

Sure the plot has flaws here and there but no matter how flaw it was, I still loved it for various reasons.Story:Remember folks! This is not a story about girls having naval tournament like senshadou in Girls und Panzer, nor its a Kancolle ""bizzarre"" animation sequence anime like one person thought it was. This is a story of students aiming to become Blue Mermaid, maintaining the safety of the nation\'s territory from invasion and other unwanted incidents. A certain dialogue...in an episode hinted they were trained since middle school, or perhaps even before that.So it means that what the girls are doing are for their future professional occupation and not for playing around. So believing that this is a funny-happy-go-lucky story especially like Girls und Panzer will leave you disappointed. Also this is not about saving a school, so don\'t get your hopes on that kind of thing.However there are flaws just like every other stories or animes. But I don\'t want to mention it here to avoid unintentional spoiler. But if you don\'t really mind it surely you can just brush it off. The story alternate between serious and casual. So if you want a hardcore stuff where everyone are arguing against one another in a ship, you might stop watching this kind of anime and start watching movie like Crimson Tide, The Yamato Men or perhaps real historical warfare.Characters:The reason I like Haifuri the most and put it in my lifetime favourite is the variety of characters; from the timid to annoying one. Surely there are a lot of anime that has this kind of variety. But having around 32 characters in a single place (ship) is a point for me because it showed how each of them compromised one another; they argue, agree, obey within the chain of command. It indirectly created the ""comrades of the sea is a family"" vision; they slowly become close to one another and become a ""family"". Almost all of them are being developed as the series went on. Only few had little development which is a little bit of flaw.How they were assigned to their post which seems unfit may be due to their exam scores (this is just a theory). Just like Akeno who are unfit to become a captain and she herself believe that. But she had to abide the position assigned to her due to being unable to decline and change her position directly in short amount of time. So rather than thinking the problem with the characters\' position you ought to see how they tried to developed their self-esteem and personality. in an episode hinted they were trained since middle school, or perhaps even before that.So it means that what the girls are doing are for their future professional occupation and not for playing around.

I eventually went and bought the Harekaze ship in game ( I believe in October) This is were it piqued my interest.It's kind of weird. You come into this expecting this to just be a silly cheerful show about anime school girls on ships. But within the first 2 episodes that expectation is completely destroyed.There is some things that don't make sense. Such as why would anyone put...High School kids in control of ships or why they would give a new student control of the Musashi the most powerful ship in the fleet.Things like this you can easily overlook. The show is good at keeping your attention. Especially with the size of the cast of characters. One of the biggest cast of characters i'v seen. They are all fun and entertaining to have. There are some characters that go together really well. Hell, Sometimes it seems like there is some Yuri action happening. In fact for the show to be about ships there is a missing sense of Shipping happening ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Characters go together really well such ( Some of them i even ship)ShiroxMikeMii-chanxKokoIt's also kind of weird cause one of the the first characters we are introduced too is Mike's friend when they are little but we see so little of her.Mike also has a sad past and i wish they would have done more with her. Such as one of her goals is to meet the Blue Mermaids that saved her as a child. Have the Principal set up the meetup as a surprise for Mike.There are also things that are kind of hard to buy for history buffs or just in general. Such as how no one is killed in all of this ( I do like that no one does, Cause it would have started making the show very dark and kind of ruining my opinion of it) How no modern day ships are even able to take out the Musashi. Also how a small little DD is able to take on so many of these ships.Also for some reason we see no Planes in this at all ( I think it might have been mentioned that planes don't exist in this world or something) But it seems weird when the reason why the Yamato (Musashi is a class of the Yamato ship) was sunk in real life was because of planes.It's also never explained why there is electrical interference with electronics on modern ships and modern weapons.The atmosphere the show makes with this being on one little boat is really nice and is probably why i like this so much.The last two OVA's were also really nice and gives hope of a 2nd season. I don't know what it would even be about but i would watch it without hesitation.In the final battle when the Principal was about to sail out on her ship to fight the Musashi i thought it would be a big reveal such as her ship being the Iowa ( USS Missouri) Something big and awesome like that happening i feel was missing from the ending.They use CGI at times and it helps with the feel of the episode. So that was a nice touch it also helps make battles look all the more badass.Overall a great show that i hope for a 2nd season High School kids in control of ships or why they would give a new student control of the Musashi the most powerful ship in the fleet.Things like this you can easily overlook.

In no way.The animation is not especially good, so is the music and backstory is just plain stupid, it did feel like the dumbest excuse imaginable to put schoolgirls on warships, it felt like Girls und panzer but even more poorly executed.However this anime is more than the sum of its parts, I really enjoyed it like I enjoy very few animes.I won’t spoil the story but characters do face high stakes like death, some bits are kind dark, it is question of treason, mutiny.Yet despite that the anime go from serious to plainly stupid. “We...face serious charges for mutiny, we may die because people are after us, oh yeah and now we are out of toilet paper, so let’s risk our life to get some” (no kidding, seriously it is part of an episode)However, despite this, it is surprisingly enjoyable, and the marine battle are just plain epic, it has been written by people who clearly know their subject no simple kancolle of World of warship fans but true warship otaku.Character development and relationship building between the girls if also quite enjoyable, little bit unoriginal and predictable but I still managed to like it and did grow fond of all the differents girls.This anime is worth watching for the final episode alone, the final is just plain epic. I mean, for me it was final episode of a original gainax anime in term of epicness, action and emotion. The final was so right. And that is part of why I rate this anime so high. I really enjoyed myself with Haifuri. face serious charges for mutiny, we may die because people are after us, oh yeah and now we are out of toilet paper, so let’s risk our life to get some” (no kidding, seriously it is part of an episode)However, despite this, it is surprisingly enjoyable, and the marine battle are just plain epic, it has been written by people who clearly know their subject no simple kancolle of World of warship fans but true warship otaku.Character development and relationship building between the girls if also quite enjoyable, little bit unoriginal and predictable but I still managed to like it and did grow fond of all the differents girls.This anime is worth watching for the final episode alone, the final is just plain epic.

Although retaining some aspects of a CGDCT anime, such as when the girls have some down time, the show creates a serious, fast moving environment that is a lot more serious than, say, Kantai Collection, for example. Also having a much, much larger variety of crew compared to Arpeggio of Blue Steel, the cast in Haifuri really feels like a real ship's crew. With characters ranging from logistics to artillery officers to the captain herself, the characters manning the ship take their job seriously, as would anyone in a...life or death situation. The art style is refreshing too, as the characters were designed by Atto, the creator of the Slice of Life Non Non Biyori. The OST is great, featuring an amazingly catchy OP by TrySail. The characters were extremely enjoyable too, but 1 cour to develop so many characters is hard to do, so it's understandable. Nevertheless, it was easy to remember each character, her role on the ship, and at least one defining trait. Personally, my favorite character was Irizaki, the ship's CTO. Overall, this show is great, and anyone who is looking for a serious Military show with some aspects of moe mixed in there, definitely give it a try. life or death situation.

It was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be, and it's probably exactly what you expect it to be as well. So lets get into this.Story: Whatever, the plot is stupid, who cares, it just serves as a vehicle for having the ship and crew do things. There are many major plot conveniences that don't really make sense, a number of threads and implications that go nowhere and ultimately the plot is kinda silly...and not well explained. But we know who's going to win from the start anyway. The plot does it's job just about, it's not so horrendous as to particularly offend me but it doesn't really stand up to much scrutiny and it's ultimately not that interesting. It makes the girls go places and do things in their ship and get into fights.Art: The character designs are all very cute, I just wish they'd had more chance to shine but we'll get to that later. The animation is pretty good and the 3D for the ships doesn't look bad. All in all the show looks pretty nice and is well presented with some nice details. On the other hand we're not talking really exceptional art on par with the best, but I think the show looks very solid. It's never really ugly and the main point, the cute girls, are very cute.Sound: I don't really remember much in the way of the music and I didn't find the other sounds in the show to be overall very impressive. I don't really remember how the voice acting was, which I assume means it was at least ok, possibly solid. The guns could have done with a little more oomph to them. Realistic or not, they just didn't sound that impressive especially in the big battle where lots of guns are going off.Characters: Oh boy, the characters. There are a lot of them. And few of them get any character development and for those that do it seems... a little incoherent. Aside from the captain and vice captain, they all really only get handfuls of screentime each and I never felt like I got to know any. It's a shame because I actually think a lot of these girls have potential. Which actually surprised me. But I think if there were some sort of spinoff shows that focused more tightly on sections of the cast (and gave them due respect), that could be a thing that I would actually like. I ended up wanting to like a number of these girls but a total lack of screentime and character exploration meant that I just didn't really end up caring. It says a lot that 7 episodes in to the show my friend and I had this exchange:17:16 - Person012345: what's the main character's name?17:16 - [XXXXXXXXXX]: i cant rememberThe main characters that really got any development were the captain and her vice captain. I feel like they were trying to show the captain becoming more mature and respectful, by learning that her place is at the bridge and not running off on crazy adventures whilst leaving the crew to handle themselves, but I wasn't really feeling the development, it felt kind of forced and then it also got contradicted by the main person pushing for it towards the end. I suppose that was to show her becoming more relaxed, but overall it felt conflicted and neither of these really felt like natural progressions of the characters. It again may be because they couldn't even explore their characters in any real depth so we didn't feel it. Also, everyone on the ship sort of felt like they bumbled into everything and the only character who was having appropriate reactions to everything happening was the girl who cried about everything (who I came to end up wanting to learn more of, but alas). Everyone else seemed more concerned that they might run out of toilet paper than the fact that they were wanted fugitives who faced god knows how long in prison, or a cold watery death.For me the characters are the core of any show, but especially one like this that is character focused and I feel like the ball was dropped. They tried to cram too many girls into the picture so that everyone could have a waifu and as a result, really couldn't do anything with any of them in adequate detail despite the characters actually having potential. I also didn't feel like they treated the characters with as much respect as they routinely had them dressing up in swimsuits or other outfits so we could gawp and when coupled with the lack of actual exploration of who they are as people, it leaves them feeling like objects to be fapped to rather than beloved characters who we're meant to care about.Enjoyment: Well, I mean, I managed to get through it. Though if I had been watching alone I would have dropped it without a doubt. It wasn't absolutely terrible, but I don't really consider it worth watching. Again, the show is what it is and if you're here you probably understand what it is and what it's trying to be.Overall, I'm feeling a little generous and it did have it's moments, so this show is a low 5 for me. On another day I might give it a high 4 but I think it solidly straddles the 5 line. Not really worth the time, but it also didn't ruin my week. and not well explained.

I thought it was going to be a typical schoolgirl anime with ships and they would go on missions, but then they have to fight a virus?? It felt like they were making it up as the story progressed and they were trying to drag it out.Art: 9/10I loved the art. It was consistent and the ocean looked very realistic, which was a nice touch. I also liked the designs of the ships, although some of them looked very similar.Sound: 6/10I liked the opening song and the battle music, but that was it.Character: 3/10Too many characters. I...felt like they tried to focus on too many at once. I didn't like Misaki as a main character. She was too indecisive and only cared about saving Moeka. I'll give her a pass, though because it didn't make sense how the school made first-year students the captains of some of the ships. How would the higher-ups know if they're ready to be leaders or not? It's obvious that she wasn't fit to be captain of the Harekaze.Enjoyment: 5/10I only enjoyed the action scenes.Overall: 5/10It was okay. That's all I can say. The anime tried too hard to be a moe and action anime at the same time and it didn't really work. Honestly, I would've liked it more if they focused solely on the action. There's also some drama that I wished could've been more explored upon, but it's either quickly resolved or never developed. For example, there are a few students that questioned Misaki's leadership and there were times where I seriously thought they were gonna mutiny. That would've made the anime so much better. But they didn't and that's disappointing. I would recommend this to people who like action as long as you ignore the stupid parts of the anime. felt like they tried to focus on too many at once.

The Anime had all my interests in one, Military (WWII/Mordern) School Uniforms pog and cute girls doing cute things. The story was odd but still funny in my opinion, I enjoyed all the battle scenes cause you rarely see good Naval Battle animes, in fact I really doubt there's multiple animes that is Naval Focused. At most it is there is Aerial Warfare or (Gate) which only includes the JASDF and the JGSDF [Aerial and Ground Forces of Japan Self Defence Force]. In Summary, I would love to see another season or...watch it over and over and over again. watch it over and over and over again."", ""I was surprised how enjoyable this series was to watch. I had somewhat low expectations, but I feel the show never dropped too far below being at least somewhat entertaining.The story on the whole is interesting, though it seemed at first as though it was going to be far more interesting than it ended up being. In the interest of not spoiling anything, I'll just say the show develops a premise that ensures that none of the characters can be considered bad guys, and it leads to an almost too tidy ending for my taste. Though the explanation for this is made somewhat interesting...and it's easy to understand thankfully, I don't know, just not what I was expecting. Themes of leadership and risk run throughout, and the tension is felt, but there could have most definitely been more.I did enjoy the art in this one, and only found certain things bothered me when I specifically studied certain shots. On the whole though, the designs are enjoyable and nothing really struck me as looking out of place or particularly bad, so well done.Being into military technology such as naval vessels and tanks, I wish the cannon fire in this had been a bit more punchy and booming. I get the main ship's cannons are meant to be comparatively like little pee shooters to most of the opposition, but the Musashi at the end still didn't sound quite as deafening as I would have liked. That's the only real gripe I have with it though, and if not for that sound would have had no real flaws at all for me.The characters designs and personalities are all entertaining to watch, with the bridge crew getting better with each second they're on screen. Development was good on some characters, but I would have liked to have seen more for others definitely. Overall, the show is pretty unapologetic in the understanding of it's premise, and for every battle scene or rescue scene, you get shopping and swimsuit scenes to match. Say what you want for what it does to the tension and pacing, but for me personally, none of it detracted too much from the narrative, and the restraint was appreciated because I feel they most definitely could have gone over board with that kind of stuff if they had wanted.Overall pretty enjoyable, with a satisfying ending. The show certainly had my attention, though I feel if it had dwelled on certain things a bit more and had more tension, I would have been far more engaged. Despite that it was never really a chore to start the next episode, and I'm glad I took the time to watch it. Not sure it'll have too big an impact on me or anything, but I can appreciate the message it had, and enjoyed it regardless. and it's easy to understand thankfully, I don't know, just not what I was expecting. Themes of leadership and risk run throughout, and the tension is felt, but there could have most definitely been more.I did enjoy the art in this one, and only found certain things bothered me when I specifically studied certain shots. On the whole though, the designs are enjoyable and nothing really struck me as looking out of place or particularly bad, so well done.Being into military technology such as naval vessels and tanks, I wish the cannon fire in this had been a bit more punchy and booming. I get the main ship's cannons are meant to be comparatively like little pee shooters to most of the opposition, but the Musashi at the end still didn't sound quite as deafening as I would have liked. That's the only real gripe I have with it though, and if not for that sound would have had no real flaws at all for me.The characters designs and personalities are all entertaining to watch, with the bridge crew getting better with each second they're on screen. Development was good on some characters, but I would have liked to have seen more for others definitely. Overall, the show is pretty unapologetic in the understanding of it's premise, and for every battle scene or rescue scene, you get shopping and swimsuit scenes to match. Say what you want for what it does to the tension and pacing, but for me personally, none of it detracted too much from the narrative, and the restraint was appreciated because I feel they most definitely could have gone over board with that kind of stuff if they had wanted.Overall pretty enjoyable, with a satisfying ending. The show certainly had my attention, though I feel if it had dwelled on certain things a bit more and had more tension, I would have been far more engaged. Despite that it was never really a chore to start the next episode, and I'm glad I took the time to watch it. Not sure it'll have too big an impact on me or anything, but I can appreciate the message it had, and enjoyed it regardless."", ""Grab your captain's hat and set sail for High School Fleet, the nautical equivalent of Girls und Panzer.What surprised me the most was the story. Summaries given for this series were vague and mostly explained the universe. I knew I was expecting cute girls in battleships, but not exactly in this way. Unlike Girls und Panzer, the battles here are real life-or-death situations. Of course, I should put out there that this is, by all means, not as dark as you may think. It just caught me off guard, that's all. The battles are pretty entertaining, and at times we get some down time where...we see more natural interactions with the girls.There is a large cast of characters, and that's to be expected of a fleet. Not only do we have the main fleet that we focus on more, but there are others shown as well. Obviously, we don't have much time to get to know everyone, so only the most important characters get any true development. As much as I understand it, I would have liked to see what type of personalities everyone else had. There's so many, that most of them I forget who they were and their positions.There really isn't much to say about the animation. For the most part, it was consistent with a few minor setbacks, but overall it was good. While we get the usual CG for the ships, I still enjoyed the battle sequences.I would give High School Fleet a pass simply for that fact that it surpassed my expectations of what the show would be. I think I probably would have liked it more if story continued for another season, enough to where there's more plot development and getting to know everyone on the fleet.

I would like to inform you that if you like what I have to say and agree with my opinion more times than not then you should check out my anime list here on MAL. I write reviews for some shows but I always write short \'blurbs\' about shows I complete.Characters / Development : 6.3Its going to be very hard to explain this without contradicting myself over and over. Its a area that had so much more potential than was actually taken advantage of. They characters themselves were pretty strong, but only until you limited their spotlight for a few minutes...or none at all for most. I feel like they could have concentrated more on the characters if they didn\'t have so many fan service episodes and scenes.Animation / Art : 6A mixed bag. The characters and armament art are both really good but I feel like what feel short was the actual ship and the water. In a anime about ships, you would expect great water right? Much to be desired. There was one scene that drove me insane. In the scene they said they only had one depth charge to use on the ship, and a few frames later there was literally two massive rows of them. All I can think is the script and art departments did not communicate on this one. People who know a little something about ships would notice.Sound (Music/Voice/Effects) : 9.5The strongest aspect to the show I think. High School Fleet has the same writer as Girls und Panzer and I will touch on this in the story more however I would have expected that the music would have the same person in charge, to my surprise, no. The music is fantastically timed to the action and pulls out feeling of excitement in the best cheesiest way.Story / Writing : 4.5Without spoils all I can say is the choices made for the core motivation for the show are pretty dumb... out of all the things they could have done. In the first few episodes you think ""wow, my mind is blown, where can this go?"" and only to epic fail in the next reveal episode. Not what I expected from the writer (Yoshida Reiko) from Girls und Panzer, I expected something more down to earth.Enjoyment : 9Out of all the bad things I have said about this show, all I can say is I feel like my time was worth it. When I found out about this anime and its ties to the writer who did Girls und Panzer I expected something cheesy but exciting, and I was not let down in that regard. Cute girls in doing battle will always get my blood pumping!Final Score : 7.06Final Recommendation : If you seen Girls und Panzer you will like this show and I recommend giving it a go. If you have not however I will give you a cautionary warning that its certainly not for everyone and unless you like cute girls doing battle or ship warfare you might want to give it a pass. or none at all for most.

That being said, High School Fleet dives (Pun intended) into a world in which roughly 75% of the Japanese navy isn\'t even old enough to buy cigarettes. The result from this isn\'t an economical boom in the naval industry or increased maritime production, it\'s a complete, utter mess in which no one really has any idea what the hell they\'re even doing on a ship in the first...place. But that\'s fine as long as you throw in scattered fan service, right?Wrong. High School Fleet (Or Hai-Furi if you\'re that guy) seems to have no idea what it\'s trying to do throughout its entire 12-episode voyage (Pun intended Part. 2). What starts off as an interesting concept (That totally wasn\'t piggybacking off the success of KanColle), quickly becomes a jumbled battle or friendly-fire and some girl with twintails that was completely misplaced in an aptitude test and should never be driving (Piloting?) a boat ever in a billion years. Oh, and it\'s all caused by an alien rat or something. Yup.Allow me to elaborate on that last sentence...Oh wait, I can\'t! High School Fleet never even attempts to clarify why there are weird alien rat creatures that are able to infect and consume the minds of Japanese schoolgirls and force them into attacking literally everything that they see. Instead, the mature doctor-type fifteen-year-old is just like, ""Hey guys, I figured it out. It was the rats, lol"" and everyone else is just like, ""Ohhh yeah, that makes sense"" and they just leave it at that. WHAT?! You can\'t just throw in a plot device like that and not ever explain anything about it! Did they leave that episode out or something? Or were the alien rats simply just a means of forcing teenage girls into naval combat with actual boats instead of just cute girls with cannons on their backs in order to tailor to the twenty-five people in the anime industry that are actually interested in that.If there is anything High School Fleet succeeds in, it\'s making naval combat look like a complete cakewalk. Misaki Akeno, the ""captain"" of the Harekaze, has literally no idea what she\'s doing and her entire crew knows it. Hell, even Akeno knows it and, at various points throughout the series, is just like, ""Hey can someone else do this please?"" but none of the others girls ever step up -- probably because, I don\'t know, they\'re teenage girls?! Instead of actually commanding her ship, Akeno just yells, ""Hard right rudder!"" over and over again until the series ends and the Harekaze still somehow manages to come out on top of every battle -- further proving that teenage girls shouldn\'t be in command of the navy.What High School Fleet should have done instead of relying so heavily on boring naval skirmishes would be to focus more on its characters because, in all honesty, most of them were pretty great. The Harekaze had an incredibly lovable roster with tons of unique, cute girls that could even compete with Kancolle in many aspects. This, of course, brings me to the question of, ""Would I have liked this series more if it was just a straight up slice-of-life?"" Strangely enough, the answer to that question would probably be ""yes"". The fact of the matter is that everything in High School Fleet apart from the characters is just flat-out bad. I think the real sin is that the writers actually knew this and threw in swimsuit-filler any chance they could get before reluctantly saying, ""Okay, time for another battle,"" and begrudgingly getting back to work.When the screen isn\'t completely taken over by the ocean (So probably around 30% of the series), the artwork is actually nice and refreshing. Character designs are clear, vivid, and overflowing with moe. The diversity of the girls is a huge plus and, I hate to keep making this comparison but you literally have to, harkens back to Kancolle and how its different artists were able to design different, specific types of boat girls. The only problem with this is that the majority of the girls in High School Fleet should have never set foot on a boat in the first place.In Summary:High School Fleet is essentially what happens when you try and turn Kantai Collection fanart into a full-blown anime series. While the characters are endearing and absolutely adorable, everything else (Particularly the naval skirmishes) falls flat. When you get down to it, this entire series is built on a plot that is not only confusing but straight-up stupid and inexplicable. If you take away the alien rat things, High School Fleet would have just been a bunch of teenage girls sailing around on boats all day which, in all honesty, would have been better than what it actually was. Even the niche fans that watched this show for all the boat-stuff will easily be able to decode how hard this series tried to cater to them.

This is one of the first military anime I\'ve ever watch and I\'d say that it was a pretty good introduction to the genre. The anime has fair character development for the main ones at least (keep in mind that the cast is huge). But what this anime really exceeds at is giving the me the thrills. As far as I can remember, there was only one episode where things went kind of stale, the rest were well paced and will ensure you excitement. This anime is probably the epitome of...what I called ""an anime that is fun to watch."" If you looking for a quick fun time (I ensure you that you will binge watch this) give this anime a shot. what I called ""an anime that is fun to watch."" If you looking for a quick fun time (I ensure you that you will binge watch this) give this anime a shot.', 'If you want to watch little girls doing stuff on WWII era ships and that\'s about it then this is the show for you. If you care about story or character development then stay away. I watched this when it came out so I\'m going off memory and it didn\'t leave me with any good ones.Overall: I gave it a 4, mainly because of a really bad plot and poor character development. This could have been a lot better if they went to another genre or cut down on the number of characters they used so they could develop them better.Story: I said it was...poor(3), things are explained away or not explained at all. Some of it makes no sense. It\'s kind of hard to talk about how bad the story is without adding in any spoilers. Think of it like the ""Aliens"" guy from History. Doesn\'t make a lot of sense but you just go with it.The way the ships are staffed is bad, they put a bunch of 15 year old girls on a ship with no supervision, no actual CO or XO, no Blue Mermaid, no nothing. This entire setup is a recipe for disaster, and it is because that\'s how they get the story rolling, a person with 0 experience commanding a bunch of people with 0 experience. The only person who seemed to have experience was the ""second"" in command, but she has ""issues"" so she\'s pretty much useless as well. I also think that they were way understaffed, we\'re talking about the 350\'s in war and 250\'s in peace for actual destroyers (Fletcher). I guess if you go with a skeleton crew and add in a bunch of automation you could get that number down, but the most advanced destroyer in the US (Zumwalt) has a crew of roughly 170. I know this is an anime and we shouldn\'t be comparing it to the real world, but it kills your suspension of disbelief by having like 30ish 15 year old girls running a WWII era destroyer.Last thing about the story. There is a surprising lack of aircraft, aircraft carriers seem like they would be even more important in their world than ever before. This was one of the things I was thinking about at the end, this would\'ve been pretty easy if you had aircraft, but I guess you need some way to fill up 12 episodes.Art/Sound: Nothing really comes to mind, the ships looked nice and that\'s most of what stood out. Gave it a 5 since it wasn\'t that bad.Character: Gave it a 3, way too many characters to try and develop in like 12 episodes. None of them very remember-able. I also didn\'t connect with the main characters either, they went the ""childhood friends care about each other so should you"" route.Some people have said this should have been a slice-of-life and if they went that route they could have gotten a lot better character development.Enjoyment: Gave it a 4, it\'s a good waste of time and that\'s about it. poor(3), things are explained away or not explained at all.

She doesn’t get much more dialog than the other characters, but it’s still distinctly her story. And the show achieves this because it turns the wheels of her mind without being overbearing. Through her actions and interactions with everyone else, the show knows how to reflect who...she is without making the mirror obvious. And that’s how character development should be; don’t let the puppet master’s strings be noticeable or it breaks immersion in the showAnd that attention to detail is especially important because of what the show deals in, mainly Akeno being called into action for a situation she isn’t entirely ready for. It achieves this balance of someone being competent at what they do, but illustrating she isn’t entirely there. Her way of thinking unbecoming her position and her lack of experience gets called into question several times in the story. And with each successive naval battle, her mental limits are pushed as her strategies are forced to be more uniqueThis also brings up another of the show’s strengths, that being its tactically driven battles. Not only is Akeno unprepared for this conflict, but the ship she commandeers, the Harekaze, is far from top of the line, with only its speed and agility being any advantage it has to the other ships. But despite being pushed into increasingly intense battles, the Harekaze never punches above its own weight. It’s often all it can do to neutralize or even escape other ships without outright beating them, and that’s the way tactics should go. The show knows strategy deals in exploitation, not omnipotenceThe show is also aware of who its main characters are, and doesn’t bother much with focusing on anyone else because it’s unwarranted. Mashiro Munetani is a great foil for Akeno and Rin Shiretoko has a nice character arc, but the rest of the crew are there to fill out numbers, be quirky, and deliver levity. And they work for the most part, not being as funny as they should be but knowing when to be humorous. They’re cheesy, one dimensional characters who are a lot of fun and do what they need to do. So kudos to Reiko Yoshida for writing great main leads with a fun side castUnfortunately, the show has a problem starting its story even though it knows how to keep it going. Certain plot elements used to ignite the fuse of conflict are bizarre to the point of breaking the suspension of disbelief. And these plot elements are brought up a few times throughout the story. Not enough to be overbearing, but enough to tell the show wants these elements to be taken seriously. And that’s really the only time where it’s easy to go “you guys are getting paid for this story and THIS was the best you could come up with? Seriously?!”And while certain plot elements are totally bonkers, the presentation for the show is totally…serviceable. Nothing looks beautiful but nothing is ugly, and the CGI used for the ships is noticeable but isn’t forced to share space with the 2D animation. The visuals shine in terms of what each shot conveys from Akeno, but the visual polish itself is nothing spectacular either way. The same goes for the soundtrack, which has a nice opening and ending number from TrySail and Luna Haruna and that’s about it. Production IMS’ work on the aesthetics is unremarkableBut the way battles work in this show, gorgeous animation would’ve been a nice bonus when passable is enough. Don’t go into it expecting top of the line production values, but do expect some great leads, tactical combat, fun characters, and mostly solid storytelling with a few very stupid elements here and there. It doesn’t promote to Generally high ranks, but it’s a Major blast to watchI’m going to give High School Fleet a B she is without making the mirror obvious.

But by god, not only does Haifuri earn its place in the Land-Air-Sea trio (That's GuP, Strike Witches, and this), it surpassed my expectations entirely. I swear, it's not the most ambitious project ever, but Haifuri is damn near perfect in my eyes.Like GuP and Strike Witches, Haifuri takes place in a very different world from our own, one which gives prominence to cute girls doing military things. In this case it's about boats, so it's Waterworld out there, and the men are stuck with...submarines.Every single thing about Haifuri is good, but I'll try to be orderly. The plot of the series is very unique for the setting,giving a sense of mystery where things only gradually becoming clear. The anime is careful about what it shows outside the Harekaze (the main ship), keeping you in the dark along with the characters. The movie plot is simpler, but in this way it's a perfect departure from the series that allows it to complement it perfectly.I don't think I need to tell you that the characters are adorable, but I have more to say than that. Like both Strike Witches and GuP, you can tell that a very large cast of characters was thought out, but only one (albeit fairly large) group gets the focus. The crew of the Harekaze is an absolute joy to watch; there's never a dull moment with these girls, and as they get to know each other and their roles they change as well. This is especially true of our main duo Akeno and Mashiro, though my personal favorite is Mina~. I will note that Haifuri is somewhat lacking in the yuri department compared to the other two, but it more than makes up for it with the genuine, heartfelt friendships you see form. (If it interests you, it also doesn't have much fanservice, though that's not to say it has none)The animation, music, and general quality are on point as well. If battleship sakuga is of interest to you, you'll find it in spades here.What I found most relevant to my enjoyment of Haifuri, however, was just the way the show is structured. It keeps a perfect balance of slice-of-life to action, getting you impressively acquainted with the characters given the show's runtime. Not only that, but the way the action scales up leads to an immensely satisfying climax, in both the show and movie, made better by tying it off with a moment between the girls.In conclusion, Haifuri is incredibly underrated and deserves the same level of attention as GuP and Strike Witches. I want to see these girls grown up as Blue Mermaids. submarines.Every single thing about Haifuri is good, but I'll try to be orderly. The plot of the series is very unique for the setting,giving a sense of mystery where things only gradually becoming clear. The anime is careful about what it shows outside the Harekaze (the main ship), keeping you in the dark along with the characters. The movie plot is simpler, but in this way it's a perfect departure from the series that allows it to complement it perfectly.I don't think I need to tell you that the characters are adorable, but I have more to say than that. Like both Strike Witches and GuP, you can tell that a very large cast of characters was thought out, but only one (albeit fairly large) group gets the focus. The crew of the Harekaze is an absolute joy to watch; there's never a dull moment with these girls, and as they get to know each other and their roles they change as well. This is especially true of our main duo Akeno and Mashiro, though my personal favorite is Mina~. I will note that Haifuri is somewhat lacking in the yuri department compared to the other two, but it more than makes up for it with the genuine, heartfelt friendships you see form.

As you know Haifuri or High School Fleet, is about high school girls piloting warships because Japan sunk in a war so now people learn to pilot ships or something like that. From watching it at first glance, it\'s basically ""cute girls piloting battleships"" but it does have some battle elements so it can be interesting at times but they are few and far between.Story: 2/10EASILY THE WORST PART OF THE ANIME. It goes from something simple of cute girls learning how to pilot battleships to them fighting rogue ships from their school with the STUPIDEST...reason ever...not going to spoil it other than a virus but the reason how they get the virus is really, really dumb.Each episode has roughly 15 minutes of nothing happening with some action sprinkled in. The action scenes are kind of interesting but other than it\'s just a slice of life on a battleship.I also wonder some reasoning for things like how and when did Japan sink? They do mention a ""war"" that caused the country to basically become flooded but when did the war take place? With who? For how long? Why do all boys schools only learn to operate submarines and all girl schools only learn to operate battleships? Do they not want girls in subs and boys on ships? Why were high school students given very powerful battleships (You will see what I truly mean towards the end).Art 7/10:Things like the characters and boats look pretty, so I can\'t hate on the art here. Pretty enjoyable on the eyes.Sound 7/10:From the fire of the cannons to the roar of the boats, the sound here is quite good. Music is ok, nothing too memorable. The OP is more or less generic anime music that is supposed to get you excited which is fine. The ED is forgettable really. Overall the sound is nice.Character 3/10:I don\'t give a damn about any of these characters. There are too many they try to make important in too short of time. Then, they try to go through the backstories of Shiro, Mike and Rin (fun fact, Rin\'s seiyuu is Yurika Kubo, famously known as Hanayo Koizumi from Love Live! Funny enough she\'s voicing the same name of her best friend in the show but like Hanayo in Love Live, Rin here is very shy). Honestly I wasn\'t invested in any of them so why they are training to become Blue Mermaids does not interest me in the slightest.Enjoyment 4/10:At first I enjoyed it but then after the VIRUS I was just under the impression of how dumb this really was. It felt more like a chore to finish which is never good.Overall 4/10:There are many anime involving cute girls, there are many anime which involve cute girls doing X. Honestly speaking there are many anime which can fulfill your cravings for cute girls anime girls and there are plenty of anime which involve cute girls doing various things. Save your time and go ""full speed ahead"" away from this show. reason ever...not going to spoil it other than a virus but the reason how they get the virus is really, really dumb.Each episode has roughly 15 minutes of nothing happening with some action sprinkled in.

It\'s fun... but... REALLY??"" (Paul ""The Mighty Jingles"" Charlton)It\'s supposed to be a winning combination: Make a new anime, sort of like the hit series Girls und Panzer, only with warships. Surely it\'ll be better than KanColle because it\'s not flippin\' ridiculous!Or so I thought.The characters are cliche, but mostly in a good way-- uber optimist airhead skipper, straight-laced XO (cue manzai combo), quiet gunner, scaredy-cat helmswoman, ""kill \'em all"" (""hot-blooded"" as they say in Japanese) torpedo officer and chief engineer. Yeah, they kinda seem one-dimensional at first,...but in a way that you could have fun with it and laugh at them. The Harekaze captain and XO\'s conflict could have been better written (too cringeworthy and a little overacted), but honestly, I\'ve seen much worse. I really wanted to like the log officer, but unfortunately the dramatizations/impressions got way too old (I yelled, ""YES!!"" when her shipmates told her it wasn\'t funny-- I\'m glad the writer doesn\'t take himself (herself?) too seriously).I do like the character designs, even though some of the girls look too young to be in high school. I\'m not a huge military history buff, but the ships looked really good and well-modeled to my untrained eye, and the battle scenes were well-animated. Seeing the refit of the Harekaze from old IJN guns to USN 5-inch guns was a nice touch, I think-- subtly hinting that there was no Pacific war because Japan didn\'t need to expand (yeah, it\'s fantasy, I didn\'t say it was believable). Watching the bridge crew members discuss armor penetration oddly reminded me of Star Trek episodes, so that was fun.The show\'s premise and story are a little weak for a production that\'s shooting for more of a drama than a comedy. The idea that this alternate universe never developed powered flight is poorly told (a couple of lines of dialogue and probably the website), and is designed to set up a mano-e-mano showdown between a battleship and a destroyer. That\'s really sloppy writing-- find some other way to put the carriers out of the picture, thanks. Better yet, come up with a good story that involves carriers. I feel that, along with a battleship shrugging off salvo after salvo of modern torpedoes, took a lot of air out of the climax\'s sails, so to speak. The show seems to me to have had a lot of difficulty trying to balance out the serious drama and the humor, never really knowing whether to take itself seriously or not. One moment it\'s ""OMG we\'re wanted for mutiny!"", the next, ""Uh, girls, aren\'t you a little too relaxed for a ship on the run?"" Then there\'s the final scene of the show, which makes Girls und Panzer\'s tank physics look downright realistic.Despite that, I really liked the ""antagonist"" of the show, and I wish that the mousers got more action, if only to hear Tsuruoka (Huh. He sounded like Jouji Nakata. Had me fooled.) act like a cat in his own unique way.The greatest weakness, IMHO, is the soundtrack. Come on, guys, after hearing the soaring melodies of Strike Witches and the fun marches of Girls und Panzer, you couldn\'t find someone who could write decent music that didn\'t depend heavily on the synthesizer? The ""derp"" scenes are too accentuated by the BGM (this is a serious anime... right?... guys??), and because there wasn\'t enough work put into matching the digital instruments with the tunes, the battle music stuck out like a sore thumb as a result. It\'s frustrating as a musician to hear this. I watched an AMV of High School Fleet set to Anchors Aweigh, and frankly, I\'d prefer that to the soundtrack even though none of the ships featured are American. There\'s only one tune that I could listen to, and it\'s the one that was worked on the most: the BGM played when the fleet sets sail.Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the show, and the follow-up OVA was a wonderful way to tie up loose ends. but in a way that you could have fun with it and laugh at them.

I find myself in the middle of the night thinking about Haifuri. Did I like it? Did I hate it? Remember when that thing happened? etc. This show has managed to occupy my every thought process and I need an outlet. Normally I like to keep reviews spoiler free but that simply cannot be the case this time. Get ready for my longest review yet.I’m gonna start...with what I enjoyed from the show. The animation is solid, each character is unique and recognizable, movements are fluid for the most part, the battleship design is cool, and the interior shots/settings are really neat. The battle scenes are surprisingly well done; we see each compartment of the ship performing their individual tasks and coming together to overcome hardships (pun intended). What I enjoyed even more was when battles aren’t happening. Much like Girls and Panzer, the show excels in its amusing slice of life moments. Dealing with problems like running out of water and putting on festivals give depth to the show and personality to the crew. “That girl who fires the torpedo” “Those three that does the cooking” and “Trumpet player” start to have names that you remember, friends they hang with, emotions they express, hobbies they enjoy…etc. Whoever wrote this show understands that supporting characters with personality is the difference between a fictional world that’s alive and one that’s not.Now on to the parts I didn’t particularly enjoy or is straight up confusing. Last night I compiled a list of things in Haifuri that bothered me, spoiler ahead.1. Mike (me·keh) and MokaMike(Misaki) is our main protagonist and captain of the ship, and Moka(Moeka) is her childhood friend and captain of another(much bigger) ship. The story mainly revolves around the fact that Moka’s ship is in distress and Mike wanting to save her friend. The premise is fine… Except I literately don’t give two shits about Moka. Moka is a prime example of why the “childhood friend” trope is one of the dumbest things in anime. In the first episode we have Mike and Moka as children and it shows the two of them sharing the dream of becoming “Blue Mermaids” who protect the sea. In subsequent episodes we get some flashbacks of Moka expressing her view that “everyone on the ocean is family”, an ideology in which Mike adopts. We get excessive shots of Mike looking worried about Moka. And that’s it. Moka literately have no personality other than “childhood friend of Mike”. Imagine being at a party and the people you talk to only talk about their other friend who isn’t at the party. That’s what it feels like when it comes to Mike and Moka. Mike on the other hand, does get some character development. That being said, out of every character on the ship (there’s 32 total including the cat), Mike managed to be the most bland and brain dead of them all. She’s in the protagonist role simply because it’s easy for audiences to project onto her blank personality and insert themselves into the show instead. Her most notable trait is that she’s afraid of lightning due to a tragic event in the past. Luckily the show tend to give more screen time to more eccentric characters in the grand scheme of things.2. One-liners“The wind is blowing, the wind of hope” said Moka in a room with the windows closed and door barricaded. This line of dialog completely ruined what’s otherwise a decent action sequence. “Tama, fire with your soul” (it’s a pun when spoken in japaneses) and “With this shot, we’ll grab our chance” are just some other glorious eye-rolling one-liners in this show. Anyways, these really don’t detriment the show all that much but are still worth mentioning.3. FlashbacksFlashbacks, when used correctly is one of the best story telling mechanisms out there. Sadly, it’s been used much more frequently as a way to avoid actual good story telling. If something truly important had happened in the past then it’s almost always better to show it in the beginning rather than in the middle. If you did it correctly the audience wouldn’t even need a reminder in the form of a flashback. I’m referring to Mike afraid of lightning and her relationship with Moka. Instead of sprinkling bits of flashback throughout the series and frequent reminders of who Moka is; I truly believe the story would flow a lot better if we got the whole first episode dedicated to Mike’s past and Moka, where Haifuri begins in the present time should be mid-episode 2. This way I might connect better with Mike as a main character and give a damn about Moka.4. Why things went wrongThis is a major spoiler point. This whole mess is due to some virus carried by rats that infected the instructor’s ship and surrounding ships. This magical virus controls the host to be hostile against the uninfected and disrupt electronic devices. The doctor character, due to her trait as a genius finds the antibody/cure in a matter of days. Oh, and in early stages of infection spraying the infected with sea water will also cure them. Like… wtf. It’s not how viruses, geniuses, antibodies or seawater work. But, whatever, it’s a show that’s meant to be entertaining so this is just me nitpicking. Still… Wouldn’t the instructor purposefully sabotaging the students in hopes of framing the principal to gain power made for a slightly more logical and dramatic plot?5. LogicWhoever wrote this show doesn\'t understand logic at all. Assuming you have any common sense then there will be points in the show where you’ll go “Why?”, “How?”, “What??” and “k, that just happened.” or a mixture of those reactions. The most notable one is in episode 4 when a crew member got infected and is going crazy so the German deputy captain straight up throws her into the ocean. Ok… the impact should’ve killed her. However not only did it not kill her, she just magically gets shot back up onto the ship by the ocean “Moana” style and is no longer infected due to being in contact with saltwater. (O.O) HOW??? That sequence of events has kept me up at night, I’m so baffled by it that I’m losing sleep. Another lesser wtf anime moment is one of the Blue Mermaid captain got these robotic looking cat ears on her head. Like, why does she have those? Nobody else in the entire show is wearing robotic cat ears. Is it a fashion statement? Do those serve a purpose? The show doesn’t even acknowledge them once but they’re there!! Again, I’m left wondering.6. Marketing/OtherThis anime is so poorly and confusingly marketed. It’s initially called “Haifuri” but on MAL it’s “High School Fleet” so people looking for ""High School Fleet"" probably won\'t find this show anywhere. It was released just last year and I somehow completely missed it till now. It’s a ghost of an anime. Several sources have conflicting information as to if it’s an anime original or based off of a manga. The VA for the main German character that threw the indestructible girl off the boat has voiced several characters in hentai. <–This isn’t a negative point, just something interesting I wanted to mention.7. Right things at the wrong timeThere were several instances of this in the show but I’ll only mention the most aggravating one here. So the Blue Mermaids has this oath that they chant which goes “Live on the sea. Protect the sea. Sail the sea”. It’s honestly kinda cool. Anyways, Mike and Moka always say this to each other as kids and it’s real sweet and cute and stuff. At one point mid-battle Mike and the other main characters each say a part of the oath and it actually sent a chill down my spine. This was such a cool/symbolic moment for these characters. Mike only ever said the oath with Moka but in that moment you realize she’s no longer saying to herself but with h̶e̶r̶ ̶c̶r̶e̶w̶ her new family. This fantastic moment only happened once, and it wasn’t even that big of a battle. Instead of something like this during the finally we instead get Moka’s “The wind is blowing, the wind of hope”: a shitty one-liner from a character with no development.8. GermanI don’t speak German, and I don’t need to in order to wince at the German spoken in this anime. I can’t really fault anybody here since it’s probably asking too much for native Japanese speakers to nail German lines.9. No introductionOut of the 32 characters on the main ship in Haifuri, only like 8 of them got somewhat proper introductions. This is not an objectively negative point toward Haifuri but I can easily see how it might agitate viewers. I personally found it neat that I got to know side characters over time through familiarity, but for others this may be a hassle. At some points I had to pull up the wiki after seeing a character and wondering “what do you do here again?”. For me this is actually a positive trait, the show wasn’t going to introduce 32 characters one by one so it instead did something neat and gave you the “first day in a classroom” feeling.10. ExpositionThe world setting of Haifuri is lazily given through exposition in I think it was episode 3. However it was a neat moment I had upon realizing that the city beneath the ocean at the coast is the sunken remains of modern day Japan and not Atlantis.You might think that with all these negative points I must have had a terrible time with Haifuri, but it’s quite the opposite. I for the most part very much enjoyed watching Haifuri. It’s madly entertaining compared to the majority of animes out there. These negative points are more so pet peeves of mine than real negatives that truly ruins a show. And to be honest, I derived quite a bit of enjoyment from these nitpicks. In the end the ship crew of Haifuri really made an impact to me and it’s an anime that I’m unlikely to forget. 7.5/10 It really don\'t deserve an 8/10 but I never expected to think this much about Haifuri so I\'m not going to round down. with what I enjoyed from the show. The animation is solid, each character is unique and recognizable, movements are fluid for the most part, the battleship design is cool, and the interior shots/settings are really neat. The battle scenes are surprisingly well done; we see each compartment of the ship performing their individual tasks and coming together to overcome hardships (pun intended).

I for the most part very much enjoyed watching Haifuri. It’s madly entertaining compared to the majority of animes out there. These negative points are more so pet peeves of mine than real negatives that truly ruins a show. And to be honest, I derived quite a bit of enjoyment from these nitpicks. In the end the ship crew of Haifuri really made an impact to me and it’s an anime that I’m unlikely to forget. 7.5/10 It really don\'t deserve an 8/10 but I never expected to think this much about Haifuri so I\'m not going to round down.', ""Caution! My first review! Also I am Finnish so not the most perfect English! so Excuse me please.The story was something I didn't really care off when I watched this anime, as I found out about it when I started playing a lot of World of Warships. I just wanted to see some sweet naval action. But the story altough I didn't care about it, it was pretty bad. This is one anime I like to refer to as Girls und Panzerish anime, where bunch of loli-ihs girls take control of Ships, Tank etc. And like GuP, the story is odd. I didn't catch up...why do they train these girls in naval warfare and stuff but the main characters want to be these Blue mermaids who do some naval missions.Art was fine, it looked satisfying especially when the warfare was at hand. But otherwise it looked very, Dull. Thats the best word I can define it.Sound, well I don't remember a single track from the OST as it was the typical goofy anime music most of the time, and the Opening and the Ending I skipped. They were boring.Characters are the worst part by far, No enjoyment out of the characters what so ever. For me they might have even ruined the anime for me. I know its not actual military or anything like that but I think key to succesful crew (or one of them) is discipline, wich the ship Harekaze has none. The crew memebers can pretty much do anything and the Cpt doesn't care. And many characters were annoying overall. Only redeeming character was Munetani Mashiro who had some sort of idea how command structure works. (Also the German girl... The German naturally was awfull)Enjoyment overall I would rate 6 as the characters were shit, Story was boring, animation when there were no battles was dull, But when battles came along the anime became enjoyable. Or atleast when the Cpt wasn't jerking around.So the overall rating would be 5. As that is the average. why do they train these girls in naval warfare and stuff but the main characters want to be these Blue mermaids who do some naval missions.Art was fine, it looked satisfying especially when the warfare was at hand.

Spoilers ahead!)I’ve taken a cruise in the past. A couple of them.The second time I was fine, but the first time I did get nauseous. I remember my family bringing with them those placebo accessories. A wristband that claimed to set my pulse or brain or some such nonsense at ease, thereby eliminating any feeling of sickness.What helped instead was taking my mind off where I was: going to the pool, grabbing something quick from the food court, walking around the halls.Of course, a cruise is nowhere near the same as a battleship. The former has...fireworks at night and dance parties. The latter has missiles stockpiled and crew ready for warfare. Although, in High School Fleet, a blend of the two is certainly not out of the question.STORYFleet (as it will be called from here on out) begins with the happy Akeno Misaki, a girl who has managed to join the path of the so-called Blue Mermaids, a group of women who (as they would put it) live on the sea, protect the sea, and sail the sea. However, Misaki and her crew quickly find themselves in perilous waters.But such peril was not immediate. Indeed, the anime somewhat tricked its audience into thinking it would be “just another cute girls doing cute things” show. It was partly that, but it also had this ever-so-slightly darker edge which took many people by surprise.And it helped, for it’s nice having contrasting qualities. Meaning, one episode may involve the cast running around in their swimsuits for fun, and the next will have them evading mines entrenched in the ocean floor. By having both sides, the show grants a bit of back and forth. Happiness and suspense crash over one another like waves in the ocean.Those waves were smooth sailing thanks to the narrative purposefully withholding information, such as the history leading up to reliance on ships, the establishment of the Blue Mermaids, and so on. Fleet doesn’t waste time in explaining these more extraneous points, leaving the audience to fill in the gaps and thus increase engagement in the show overall.Granted, some details that are skipped lead the narrative astray. For instance, the cure for the mind-altering, interconnected virus essentially gets made and used everywhere without much of a problem. The lack of world-building – an inherent byproduct since almost everything takes place at sea and away from populated areas – also makes the plight at hand and even the Blue Mermaids themselves feel irrelevant.Regardless, Fleet does its best to spice up its action through differing naval conflicts. Using a paravane as a fishing hook, forcing another ship to run aground, and boarding another one to engage in close-quarters combat made each battle slightly different, preventing each fight from becoming a repetitive outing of ships firing at one another.If the anime turned its rudder the wrong way anywhere, it would be in the lead up to the finale and the finale itself.For starters, the altercation between the Blue Mermaids and Moka’s ship, the Musashi, comes off as silly. Mostly because the Blue Mermaids are touted as these stalwart protectors. So, when four of their ships are unable to take out just one other, it raises one’s eyebrow.Now, to be fair, the Musashi is a formidable opponent, and it makes narrative sense to have Misaki and the Harakaze defeat the ship and save Moka (meaning it was inevitable that the Blue Mermaids would lose). But it still doesn’t align with the show’s constant praise and admiration for the Blue Mermaids who, apparently, cannot perform their duty.Worse still, saving Moka does not have the required emotion since the relationship shared between her and Misaki is not exactly fleshed out. In fact, the last scene is rather lame. Despite fully succeeding, it is not shown where the crew goes, they lose their ship they’ve been with the entire time, and it all simply misses the satisfaction mark.It’s a lackluster finale to say the least.This investigation is the extent of Fleet. There may be a grander message of never giving up even when the whole world seems against them, but it is not explored. And it doesn’t have to be. Because, overall, the show set a course to be a bunch of cute girls dealing with sea battles and a serious subplot – something it executed well enough from port to starboard.ANIMATIONPerhaps expectedly, the show has many different character designs to help differentiate the myriad of girls aboard the Harukaze. Mii wears a red-and-black-and-yellow outfit that accentuates her braided, blond hair, blue eyes, and high attractiveness. Mei sticks to her orange sweater-jacket. And Momo’s beret and glasses makes her easy to spot.Almost all the girls wear the same set of clothes: a blue skirt, a white shirt, and a red bow-scarf. And they each have detailed eyes to boot. It also helps that the anime will regularly give them different expressions or comedic reactions, helping the show’s slice-of-life side.Fleet also uses a lot of CG segments for its ships and their battles. Not only does the CG work, but this decision makes sense. The ships are bulky, moving masses, housing missile launchers, cannon guns, smaller boats, giant pillars, and other miscellaneous mechanical gear. Meaning animating them in the traditional sense would be too much of a burden.The rest of the artistry, though, is not the best. While the bridge is filled with bells, knobs, and doodads, the rest of the ship is not as detailed. Plus, the open ocean does not always create the best scenery around. Certain shots, like a setting sun, a high-rise depiction of one of the islands, or even a nighttime, glowing reflection, can prove otherwise. But these more interesting depictions are not the norm.Actual animation anchors somewhere slightly above average in quality. Once again, the show decides to use a mixture of pure hand-drawn animation and pure CG animation. The former is set aside for the girls and their actions: running around, hugging, flowing hair. The latter is reserved for those ship battles: torpedoes, a rotating gun, a skipper on the water. While not gorgeous, the animation remains both consistent and pleasing to the eye.CHARACTERSFleet is yet another anime where its cast is gargantuan.According to available sources, the show contains seven or so main characters and thirty-seven or so side characters. That’s a lot of cast members. Naturally, this amount means that many, many of the cast members will not be receiving much time at all.And that’s what happens, for the show cannot possibly give equal attention to all the girls. As such, the girls become, for the most part, their singular trait. Satoko adds “zona” to most of her sentences. Mimi’s role model is Machiko. Mikan and the Kinesaki sisters are the cooks.Unfortunately, some girls get even less. Characters like Hikari, Megumi, and Hideko (as well as a slew of others) feel more like placeholders than actual people.An argument exists for why this direction is okay. On a ship (of any kind), people have a role to fill. Some work in the engine room. Some man the deck. Some act as the lookout. In a similar fashion, the girls of Fleet likewise have their own “roles.” Mei loves to shoot the guns and use the torpedoes. Shima doesn’t speak much, and she shows what happens when someone gets infected by the new virus. Kaede really knows how to wield a sword.Obviously, these “roles” are, in reality, their personality and character quirks. But it goes along with the idea that these girls not only help the ship in their own way but also act individually, too.Still, these side characters simply do not do enough. They will maybe have one scene centered on them, but, beyond that, they exist to be little more than cute characters. This statement is not just aimed at the side cast; the main characters also fail to have much of an impact.Take Mii, the German girl that the group saves. Her time on the ship consists of having the girls envious of her bosom, being grossed out by natto (a type of Japanese food), and escaping a collapsing, shipwrecked boat. Worse still, once her original ship is saved, she leaves uneventfully, making the audience wonder what her purpose even was. To be fair, she did provide some guidance early on, but having one instance over several episodes is certainly underwhelming.Kouko can be seen in the same light. She is there for comedic relief, but, arguably, so is every other side character.Rin controls the wheel and only the wheel, but she at least ends up better than both Mii and Kouko. Rin grows as a person, learning to overcome her fears and trepidation, using her newfound courage not only to pilot the ship but also to push forward in times of duress.That leaves Mashiro and Misaki.Mashiro comes from a long line of Blue Mermaids. More specifically, her mother and her other sisters have taken up the seaside mantle, so she was almost destined to do the same. However, she has horrible luck, netting her a splash in the water and a spot (due to an exam mistake) among the lowest-scoring students’ ship: the Harakaze.Much of her character revolves around Misaki. The relationship they share as well as the actions that need taking. Simply put, Mashiro feels that Misaki’s way of captaining is flat out wrong, a detriment to herself, to the crew, and to the Blue Mermaids.Misaki (obviously) sees it differently. Growing up with her best friend Moka, she has always wanted to be a Blue Mermaid. But, even more than that, she values her friends first. When her crew needs help around the ship, when someone is stranded at sea, or when she sees those close to her in danger, she prioritizes them over both her position and herself.Thus, they butt heads. A lot. Misaki is quite cheerful, so she does not let the friction between them get to her initially. However, after Mashiro constantly laments about Misaki’s disregard for her own welfare, the two find themselves at odds with one another, eventually waning their friendship (as heard by Misaki using the formal “deputy-captain” title for Mashiro).Yet it is not for long since the two learn from one another. Misaki comes to understand that being the captain is more than just taking on the whole burden alone. As for Mashiro, she comes to understand that risking one’s life for others takes a lot more strength than she originally believed. All the while, the two share small moments together, such as Mashiro taking her sister’s “guts infusion” in Misaki’s place or when Mashiro declares that she’ll be Misaki’s “mayonnaise.”It’s their bond and the rest of the crew’s roles that tie Fleet’s whole character message together.As it is with ships of the regular and relation variety, it takes more than one person to make it work. The girls perform their duties separately and together to keep their ship afloat, and they respond to and learn from one another to keep their relationships afloat, too.Granted, Misaki and Mashiro’s relationship is the only one that has any actual exploration during the season, but it was nice to see something from the cast beyond being there for cutesy purposes.SOUNDThe opening track for Fleet starts off almost ominous but quickly shifts into more of a rock piece. While the vocalists do well in tandem, and it sounds hearty enough, the OP is particularly unassuming, doing nothing noteworthy. The ending track is similar. Prominent trumpets, a floaty feel, and a couple of fast lyrics give the ED some strength as a standalone offering, but it’s not enough to make the piece anything more than passable.The rest of the original soundtrack performs (once again) similarly. Given the maritime setting, many of the tracks are filled with rolling drums, woodwind instruments, and cymbals to simulate a navy environment. Other tracks, like dainty slice-of-life tunes, foreboding, atmospheric pieces, and tense trumpet-and-violin compositions make up the rest of the music. Like the OP and the ED, however, the OST is by no means subpar. It’s just acceptable for what it is.Finally, voice acting within Fleet does not see any notable performances, but some characters do deserve a small shout-out. Namely, Yurika Kubo as Rin for her always-worried voice and Natsumi Takamori as Maron for her loud, energetic way of speaking.ENJOYMENTI would not say that I was fully entertained by this one, but I did like the bouts of cuteness.Misaki was perhaps a bit too carefree and overly kind at times (stopping to help a child who got knocked over while she and the others were running away is just one example), but I liked seeing someone on the ship simply looking out for the others.Mashiro getting embarrassed or miffed, through people discovering her stuff-animal-filled room or getting too many responses at once, made her a fun character (when she was not being mean to Misaki). Her getting her own tiny cat – despite her apprehension on bringing cats aboard – was a nice touch.Rin’s worrying, Kouko’s reenactments, and Maron’s energy also had me smiling here and there.Again, though, much of the show didn’t. The action involving the ships was not anything special. The drama did not have much weight. And many of the characters were either too boring or too forgettable. Even the moe moments, at times, were not cute enough to get much of a reaction out of me.But if I had to choose my biggest gripe, it would be how underused Mii was. I liked her design, her difference in origin, and how she can take a kick to the head without flinching. Sadly, however, the anime did not have her interacting with many of the other cast members (Kouko was the only other one), so she never had enough screen time to my liking. And while reasonable, I was not a big fan of her leaving her new friends behind in favor of her original ship, for it reinforced how disconnected she felt from the rest.High School Fleet encounters choppy waters. A serious side to its story and a character theme on working together are hindered by a weak ending, a lame side cast, and a handful of other issues. To be fair, the art and the music can be strong at times, but they are not exactly exceptional. Altogether, it was not a nauseating experience but it was also far from cruising.SUMMARYStory: Fine, cute girls engage in differing naval warfare, using avoidance of detail to its advantage yet botching its endingAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, nice CG usage, okay character designs, slightly above average actual animationCharacters: Bad, low-impact side characters and mishandled main characters get in the way of Misaki, Mashiro, and the relationship they shareSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, while the cuteness was there, not much else was, and it needed more MiiFinal Score: 4/10 fireworks at night and dance parties.

There are other subjects far more intriguing and compulsory yet too grand for me to review well thus I kept postponing them.Concisely this anime lacks accuracy for most of the dedicated military fans, offers no real fan service for those who intended to seek it from, and sometimes sacrifice logic and continuity for the sake of moefication, which by may be dismiss-able or even encouraged. However this is a fairly contrived subject of military exercise and the ships' complement even include an onboard accountant. Yet when compared to say Classroom X...Crisis, it lacks realism.So if you want a show similiar to Girls Und Panzer, this one is similiar enough (heck the production overlaps with Non Non Biyori). If you want to have a show with mostly daily routines on a ship this is not quite helpful (most of the dull deck washing has been stripped). If you want to know more about Japanese pop culture and geography of the older times this show provides a fair amount (I was able to acquire those thanks to fan-subbing group 花語&千夏字幕組). The battle sequence is fairly accurate but not as traumatizing as those in say Zipang (girls taking it easy when ship is taking water with only 3, pardon me, 2 damage control personnel). You can also compare this show to Miniskirt Pirates since they both have a rag tag crew on the run, but not enough jokes to be compared to Nadesico.So I recommend High School Fleet on basis if you want something pleasing and laughable to watch and acquiring pop culture references. I finished it in 1 day.____________Spoiler Containing longer rant____________List of ships I have visited: USS Pompano, RCMP St. Roch, Some Torpedo Boat near the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution (Not quite that much But it is enough)I visit every military / aviation / maritime museum when I got the chance. This list is long and I will not list it here.Now begins the pecking. First of, forgot which episode (I know it is more than 2), those gals spend quite some time in shower; (heck) the captain use the shower time to think. It is a troupe but on real training ships you won't get that much fresh water (I wonder how did they not ran out of water from those 3 measly tanks on the first week; and only collects rain water much later). O and don't use salt water in fresh water pipes, it corrodes them.Speaking of rainwater, do you EVER see the deck being cleaned? Or do you ever see one paints on ship that is not a picture? Those are steel boats. Salt will shorten the life of the boat. A full complement of Kagero is 200+. Granted a lot of the task has been automated yet we don't see maintenance task carried out by a crew of 30.Who uses 12.6m of TP? Or even 1.26m? Do you know anyone do? A typical roll is about 40m. I thought it was a joke about the cat.They have radar, but it seems even worse compare to IJN radar circa 1943 (the spotter sees the ship before the radar warning). And the gals have cellphones and tablets (when it showed on StarTrek TNG people think it was futuristic)!The type 13-Go has a range of 100km and only weighs 110kg. Your cellphone tower has about 70km of range (at most, but typically 30k). A modern AN/SPY-1 radar (part of Aegis combat system) has a maximum range of 324km. A modern OPS-28 or TAS mk23 radar has a range of around 370 km. It is about 3300km from Yokosuka to Truk. Thus it become very baffling how they could not find a giant slow (18kt or 33km/h or 20mph) Musashi that is not sunk. Heck they even have flying drones.The schnitzel puffs because of the composition of the batter and light preparation. Not necessarily the amount of flour.Seifuku are cute, fine.

I speculate it has a top speed no faster than 16 knots due to damage. It is clearly towed by several ships. Why didn't they tow it to dry dock directly? The scene felt staged as the ship sinks on queue and efforts to save it prior seems lackluster (You survived 2 direct hit, rammed Musashi and performed little of damage control, you deserve to sink). Crisis, it lacks realism.So if you want a show similiar to Girls Und Panzer, this one is similiar enough (heck the production overlaps with Non Non Biyori).

However, Haifuri is a very plot driven series that follows the protagonists onboard the Harekaze destroyer ship as they learn what it means to be a functioning unit through a flurry of dangerous engagements and unforeseen circumstances. There are elements of drama and tension which provide an experience...outside of one you'd expect.Story 7/10:The story of Haifuri is unique in its approach, and because the synopsis barely gives any idea of just what happens, I won't spoil the overarching plot. In short, the Harekaze is a destroyer ship that's part of the Yokosuka Girls' Marine High School fleet in which all of the students that had barely managed to pass are put on; with the exception of the Deputy Captain, Mashiro Mutetani, an honor student that was placed aboard the ship due to her unbelievably bad luck. After a run in with a ditzy student that makes her fall into the sea, she later finds that this clumsy, bubbly girl is the Captain of the Harekaze. A large portion of the story follows the development of these girls and their crew as they learn how to cooperate with each other and bond through the trials and tribulations they will unexpectedly face. This ragtag crew of misfits manages to find their way through their many battles, both internal and on the sea.Art 9/10:The character designs are all great and the animation is fluid. The ships look great and watching the action unfold is a rewarding experience. While there isn't much in the way of backgrounds (because it's the ocean), the series makes up for this by placing the crew in a variety of situations and scenarios where the art team expresses their creativity.Sound 8/10:The VAs for the characters all do fine jobs, even so much so as having VAs in character reciting movie lines. The sound design works for most of the series and the music is military inspired but never over the top.Character 7/10:There's a lot of character development that takes place throughout the course of the series for the crew as they learn to adapt to their situation.The one-sided rivalry between the Deputy Captain and the Captain, the eccentric hotheaded Engine crew, trigger finger Torpedo Officer, insecure Chief Navigator, child genius Med and the unique personalities of the rest of the crew make for enjoyable character interactions.Enjoyment 8/10:Overall 8/10:Haifuri is unique in its story and developments, which, while not complex is a breath of fresh air. Using the full potential of the cast on the little destroyer and pacing itself fairly quickly throughout the first half makes Haifuri feel like a much faster watch that doesn't lose its momentum. While the drama is played down a bit to keep things family friendly, it was still enough to keep the ever-changing situation for the Harekaze and its crew engaging and entertaining. outside of one you'd expect.Story 7/10:The story of Haifuri is unique in its approach, and because the synopsis barely gives any idea of just what happens, I won't spoil the overarching plot.

Girls und Panzer but with boats instead of tanks, right? Well, not quite. In this series, the warships are actually used for patrol and defense of the now-flooded world and their now-flooded and now-ship-based islands. Neat concept right? Where's the story going to go?The story starts off as the previously mentioned cute girls doing cute things on the Harekaze, a Kagerou-class Japanese destroyer, a ship that was never made. By the end of the first episode, the tone shifts to a more...serious tone, throwing out really strong Hunt for the Red October vibes, but then by the next episode everything is cheery once more. Near the end of almost every episode, the tone gets darker, the episode ends with a cliffhanger, and the next episode starts off cheery. It's a common theme.Unfortunately, the vibes go from Hunt for the Red October: cute girls edition to a much less serious, much less intriguing, and infinitely more infuriating plotline that completely killed the series for me. Surely there was some sort of saving grace, right?There was. In the form of naval battles. The naval battles in the show were actually pretty enjoyable, even if they were completely CG and almost completely without any danger to the main characters. They were still cool, though!The 2D portions of the series, which consisted of everything that wasn't the outside of a ship, really, were actually pretty well animated. The ship designs and some of the other designs were interesting as well, but the goofy speedboat looked dumb.The music, however, was awful. It was almost entirely unenjoyable and completely forgettable.The characters were relatively well designed and some of them were pretty interesting, but there are 2 main problems in this series. First, a destroyer crew would require a LOT more people than there are on the Harekaze. Second, almost everyone wears the same outfit and the only way to tell characters apart is by their hair and voice, and even then, sometimes you have to try and remember who exactly they were.I actually almost dropped the show because of how boring and bland it seemed, and the CG was incredibly jarring for me. Then the plot started, and I figured, what the hell, one more episode. Eventually the cool plot dropped in favor of the much less cooler plot and I figured I'll stick around until the end. In the end, I did sort of enjoy it but honestly felt a little disappointed that, at no point, American ships showed up. Just German and Japanese with a couple of generic modern destroyers and trimarans.Overall, I'd say that the series was a bit of wasted potential. If you're looking for The Hunt for the Red October: Cute Girls Edition with any solution to the plot that stays with the theme, this isn't your anime. If you just want to see cute girls doing cute things on naval warships, then this is probably your anime. serious tone, throwing out really strong Hunt for the Red October vibes, but then by the next episode everything is cheery once more.

The main protagonists pilots a destroyer, and they will face enemies of larger ship classes as the series progresses, making one go wtf sometimes with the bravery of our main protags.Story:The story kicks off with much tension sucking one into the story with some interesting naval facts intertwined in it. Tidbits like supplies, naval armaments, the boilers as well as the observational language used will be most interesting to ww1 - ww2 naval warfare fans. Some notable warships would make their appearances, so...famous that they also appear in World of Warships. More fanservice for naval historian fans. Yet the tension is lost halfway through the series in slice of life episodes which were unpleasant to stomach. It picks up the pace at the end making the trudge through the slice of episodes well worth it.Art:Character movements are fluid and expressive, which is palatable. That is to say the art is enjoyable. But that’s not the main focus isn’t it? It’s the warships. They are gorgeous, the rigging, armaments and overall design is bloody gorgeous. Looks of focus is put into it, the attention to detail is amazing. It makes you just go woah looking at the ships.Sound:The voice actors convey the character’s emotions well, their personalities working well with the voices given. But the best part was the sound of the naval armaments! It sounded really realistic and was very good asmr to relax to. The fscchhww of the torpedoes, the BOOM of the naval guns. And the it sounded different, the bigger the guns, the louder the sound gets and different the sound gets. I can’t put it into words but it just sounds like a bigger gun. The sound of the torpedoes travelling in the sea just sounds so right and realistic. So yeah sound is great.Character:Characters brought nothing new to the table. Individually, they can be found in other animes, the pairing up of the characters together was nothing refreshing and could also be found in other animes. The anime just dumps like 30 over characters in your face and you are expected to familiarise yourself with them. Some of them stood out with some development through the series, but the rest were left to linger in the back and be forgotten. The anime will pull off some drama between some characters that you are supposed to be familiar with but you will be lost and wonder where did that came from? But those are once in a blue moon occurrences. The characters are nothing special, but the thing that made them unique is the reason why they chose to serve in the navy instead of doing something else. That would be one of the few things that made the characters stand out. Characters? Meh.Enjoyment:As mentioned in the story section of the review, the first few episodes caught my interest. But the slice of life blew my enjoyment out of the water. But as soon as that was done with, the payoff with the ending made this anime pretty memorable. One can derive pleasure from viewing this anime, but if one seeks to focus on the action, skipping the slice of life episodes would be great.Overall:As a naval warfare nerd, it was a fun watch seeing the warships duke it out with one another.

High School Fleet is about a class of first year high school girls running a battleship to become ""Blue Mermaids"", kind of like the Navy. Already the concept is interesting. But as you go on into it, it reveals itself to be a moe, ""cute girls doing cute things"" type of show.despite this, you must remember, this is an actual battleship. These girls are actively doing all the things that you must do...to run a battleship. Maintenance, communication, even ship battles with real torpedoes and ammunition. What I find entertaining about this show, is that there is no semblance of symbolism anywhere. The ship isn\'t a metaphor for school or friendship or anything. The things they do like loading a torpedo, or doing trigonometric functions to get around, or fixing various things on the ship is exactly what they say their doing. These high school aged 15-16 year old girls are doing these things by themselves. I just thought it was funny. Another one of the things they do in the show is ship battles. Where, again, is exactly what it sounds like. Real ammunition, real torpedoes, everything. despite these very real weapons, there doesn\'t seem to be any danger or tension anywhere in the show. I suppose this fits into the cute girls doing cute things moe aesthetic, but at the same time they are doing a real battle using real battleships.I like this show because of how it deviates from the normal moe formula typical to slice of life. High School Fleet has a good amount of action along with the cute girls. Unfortunately, the show was quite terrible from a technical standpoint. Art is nothing to look at. Animation is nothing much either except for the battleship battles, which are only decent in and of itself. Music is forgettable. The characters are pretty cool in respect to there roles on the crew.In conclusion, I did not enjoy my time with this show. The ship battles, cute girls, and my personal entertainment with the fact that these high school girls are doing these things, only held me over for a short time. I give this show a 4 out of 10. I recommend it to whoever is into watch a cute girls doing cute girls show. Because quite honestly, that\'s all its good for.

This has been your spoiler free but not really review on High School Fleet.', '******** SIMPLE AND SPOILER-FREE ********You stumble upon this anime and you think about it and ask yourself if whether this would be in anyway interesting or some complete waste of time. Well, if you like the cute girl doing ""cute"" stuff or military stuff or even liked Girls und Panzer for reasons not like the before-mentioned, you\'re already assured of a good bang for the bangbangs and boombooms the action will give us.But not without some flaws, in my opinion.High School Fleet features few classes of ships with different names (not so much of a ship porn, unlike GuP in both broadcast and the theater...which featured many tanks; fanboys are certainly satisfied).Military tactics and inside views of the workings of the warships are in generous amounts, although if you find yourself flabbergasted in the replicability of anime logic to real life and then rage about unrealism. . . just contain it.The huge cast would be a pain to remember, many given only a few time to show up, fewer to get the focus (some don\'t even get to have it). But at the very least, character development is present and ongoing.The cutegirl=cutestuff formula have been altered in the anime, it now includes some ""grim moments"" (think of Madoka Magica for the popular example). But conflicts tend to be repetitive, the only differences are the degree of how badly messed up the balance is and the tactics . The plot would somehow go into nowhere that makes real plot sense, and some will bait you into thinking that there will be stupid choices and unnecessary drama that will follow suit but thankfully there are only few, so bear with them.To sum it up, High School Fleet should be something to watch if your interests align to it.It managed to deliver what it looks like on the tin can; the story is not so original but delivered well with some decent changes (and also some stupid events) although better can be desired; action is plentiful.I find that it doesn\'t have that one quality that makes it a esoteric masterpiece in the sphere of fanboyisms but is good enough, very good enough. which featured many tanks; fanboys are certainly satisfied).Military tactics and inside views of the workings of the warships are in generous amounts, although if you find yourself flabbergasted in the replicability of anime logic to real life and then rage about unrealism. . . just contain it.The huge cast would be a pain to remember, many given only a few time to show up, fewer to get the focus (some don\'t even get to have it).

This was a very unusual anime indeed, putting high school girls in charge of huge ships capable of real battle and warfare.This is my first time writing a review, so please bear with me and my writing. If there are any spoilers, I will write a warning message just in case, but for the most part, I will try to avoid any spoilers that lay past the first episode of the anime. Also, my overall score is not based on an...average of story, sound, art, characters, and enjoyment. I suggest taking a look at the bio on my profile for the complete explanation of how I rate anime. With that out of the way, let’s get to the main review.-----Story----7The story follows Mike (Akeno Misaki), a young girl who aspires to one day be a part of the Blue Mermaids, an organization that protects and journeys across the vast sea. Along with her friend, she enters Yokosuka in pursuit of that dream.On the surface, the anime seems to be following the general structure for a comedic slice of life, but as the anime continues, it becomes anything but. When ships begin disappearing and reporting various issues, the show becomes a true diamond in the rough with how well the mystery entices and intrigues the audience.When you\'re watching this anime, it is highly recommended to suspend whatever disbelief that you have and to expect the unexpected in order to enjoy the most out of this show. There will be a lot of things that you question and may not understand, but what surprised me above all else was the execution of the plot. A mixture of mystery, a unique approach, and action really intrigues the audience, though the story is somewhat inconsistent as the anime continues in its 12 episode adaptation.If you are an avid fan of military warfare, the navy, or anything similar, this anime will most likely become a favorite considering the amount of related concepts there are. Even if you’re not an avid fan, the sheer ingenuity of the characters and the combat between ships is definitely something worth watching.While there are several pluses to the show in terms of story, it similarly has its downsides. Attempting to contain this kind of a plot within 12 episodes was not an easy task, and it became quite noticeable that this was the case as the show continued. Firstly, the inclusion of a few filler episodes was not very appreciated as the plot could have been developed more using those episodes (at least in my opinion), but there is some comedic character interaction that you can enjoy. Secondly, using deus ex machina in order to advance a plot is by far one of the most desperate devices I have ever seen used, and this anime does make use of it in a rather painful manner that I did not enjoy. Many may be able to look past this device, but in my opinion, it really takes away from the realistic nature of the anime. And for me, realism and consistency of plot are paramount when developing a plot.-----Art------8Given that this anime was aired in 2016, the art style of the characters is quite consistent with general expectations of art at this time—fluid, solid, and not particularly distracting. Generally speaking, I won’t rate art higher than a 7 solely based on character designs since backgrounds are integral components to the overall art (take a look at the background art for Nagi no Asukara or Clannad for art that I would consider a 10). The reason for the slightly higher art score in this particular case is how well the ships were designed and animated—really capturing each aspect of these military ships (and this should be expected considering how the anime revolves around this). Background art was not particularly significant or breathtaking in any way, but in no way was it distracting.-----Sound-----7Sound was rather generic for the most part, nothing impactful enough for me to go back and listen to it. The opening and ending was fine, nothing really notable about them. The sound got a fairly average score since the heart racing music complemented the action scenes quite well and conveyed the intensity of the situation as well as the tension of the characters.-----Characters-----6The characters are a plus in the show as they truly embody a wide diversity of characteristics, adequately demonstrating ""uniqueness"" that draws the attention of the audience. Unfortunately, the design of the characters draws a sense of disbelief as the majority of the characters look like they are either in middle or elementary school when they are clearly stated to be in high school (part of the reason this anime draws such disbelief when watching it). Subsequently, it becomes rather difficult to really empathize and to believe that these characters are truly “real”. Additionally, the character designs do lack some uniqueness in that the female cast is never given any real distinguishing features other than hair color; the structure of the face maintains the ""ideal"" perspective of the animated female.While the characters do embody a wide array of characteristics, there is not adequate development to provide depth to their already one-dimensional characters with the exception of 2-3 characters. Mike arguably has the most development of them all, but the development is entirely predictable given her personality in the very beginning of the anime.Even with these negative though, the characters are quite refreshing and provide a sense of peace even when the anime takes dark, dramatic turns.-----Enjoyment-----7I actually enjoyed the anime a lot more than I thought I would, especially since I went into this anime with zero expectations. The exhilarating action sequences and the marginally thrilling mystery really drove me to watch and finish the anime despite the flaws I was not happy with. The only thing that was hardest for me was suspending my disbelief completely, but over time I did become acclimated to the nature of this show.-----Overall-----6.7I would recommend this anime to those who find a fascination with military warfare, boats, a (semi) thrilling mystery, and something truly unique. Although not certainly one of the better animes out there, it has its good points and is worth watching.I will briefly mention again that my overall score is based on an average of these scores with different weights attributed to each one. Look at the bio on my profile for more details on the specifics and the weights I give.Story: 7Art: 8Sound: 7Characters: 6Enjoyment: 7Overall: 6.7 average of story, sound, art, characters, and enjoyment. I suggest taking a look at the bio on my profile for the complete explanation of how I rate anime. With that out of the way, let’s get to the main review.-----Story----7The story follows Mike (Akeno Misaki), a young girl who aspires to one day be a part of the Blue Mermaids, an organization that protects and journeys across the vast sea. Along with her friend, she enters Yokosuka in pursuit of that dream.On the surface, the anime seems to be following the general structure for a comedic slice of life, but as the anime continues, it becomes anything but. When ships begin disappearing and reporting various issues, the show becomes a true diamond in the rough with how well the mystery entices and intrigues the audience.When you\'re watching this anime, it is highly recommended to suspend whatever disbelief that you have and to expect the unexpected in order to enjoy the most out of this show. There will be a lot of things that you question and may not understand, but what surprised me above all else was the execution of the plot. A mixture of mystery, a unique approach, and action really intrigues the audience, though the story is somewhat inconsistent as the anime continues in its 12 episode adaptation.If you are an avid fan of military warfare, the navy, or anything similar, this anime will most likely become a favorite considering the amount of related concepts there are. Even if you’re not an avid fan, the sheer ingenuity of the characters and the combat between ships is definitely something worth watching.While there are several pluses to the show in terms of story, it similarly has its downsides. Attempting to contain this kind of a plot within 12 episodes was not an easy task, and it became quite noticeable that this was the case as the show continued. Firstly, the inclusion of a few filler episodes was not very appreciated as the plot could have been developed more using those episodes (at least in my opinion), but there is some comedic character interaction that you can enjoy. Secondly, using deus ex machina in order to advance a plot is by far one of the most desperate devices I have ever seen used, and this anime does make use of it in a rather painful manner that I did not enjoy.

The theme of this anime is action : Action, Military, School yet this anime is much more focus on comedy.When compared to ""war theme"" anime such as Girls Und Panzer, it has a better balanced of action to comedy. Therefore, Haifuri has such dissapointment despite the fact it had its potential.Considering the fact that you can\'t afford to mess around with only 12 episodes, you have to get straight to the point. The equator event arc was not needed for the...anime version as it serve as a filler like previously mentioned. anime version as it serve as a filler like previously mentioned.', 'Becoming Blue Mermaid is a goal for Misaki & Moeka since they were young. They adore Blue Mermaid so much and want to become part of those notable units. They adore them as well as they love the sea. Blue Mermaid beginning is after Russo-Japanese war period. As Japan becomes Maritime Nation, most of the military ships are utilized for civilian use. Blue Mermaid is a symbol of those ships that won\'t be used for war and only women are permitted to be captains. It explains why all the characters here are (moe) girls with high spirit to sail the sea.These youngsters\' story, who wish...to be parts of Blue Mermaid, starts in Yokosuka Girls\' Marine High School. After the enrollment, all of the students are filtered into several classes of ships (with different tasks as well) based on their grades on the selection process. Our heroine and her childhood friend, Misaki & Moeka, successfully enter this high school they are dreaming of. The students here will be trained to be competent Blue Mermaid. They will do their first task as students in this Marine High School. Their nautical training is the beginning yet it needs a lot of hard work.\u200bAs inexperienced persons in maritime, this show surely makes a lot of people believe that they are trying their best in first two episodes to overcome the obstacles as part of the nautical training. They strive to cope with incoming issues. Although they are barely known each other and just becoming a family in the same ship (ship\'s crews), I can feel their burning wish to be Blue Mermaid currently on the same line. You will find common problems like other series with tons of characters in this anime, in which Haifuri characters make the introduction so damn fast. I can\'t enjoy the introduction one by one. Still, you can set your eyes on few outstanding characters amongst them. Haifure\'s beginning of the story has too much babbling. (phew)\u200bI don\'t know if it\'s just me or....well...few series I watched so far this Spring have slow pace for its beginning. It\'s like I had to get bored first before see the fabulous ending. It\'s so rude -sobs-The turn-over is placed unseemly. I can get the point that high school students also need time to relax and refresh their mind by having fun together, but the good time they create sometimes feels wrong. It might be harsh, but the messy plot is not pleasing much (at first). Static sequence of fun and ended with issues.The messy plot at first..is not a big deal anymore when you survive to keep watching Haifuri. It becomes more organized after the real threat discovered (however, I won\'t tell the truth, it might be a spoiler lol). The story improves and the goal of this anime exposed. You can enjoy the moe moe show from those girls, it is enough to save you from drowning by the boredom. After that, the show is going to bombard you more with the expansion for both of story and characters.

Especially their last mission *w*!\u200bI don\'t have much knowledge of maritime, I can\'t tell how good it is regarding to the information about the ships they offer. For me, they already explain the ships well. Like the capacity of the ships (amount of weapons, strength, communication methods and so on). Quite plenty I got information from this anime. When they make plan, they make it out well with carefully developed strategy.\u200bThe animation is well-built. I even adore it. From the animation, I sense that whenever I watch this, I really am boarding in Harekaze for real. The details for the ships are solid. I can picture what\'s on the deck, the kitchen in a ship, weapons, the surrounding like blue ocean, ships war, and moe girls! You\'d better not forget the moe part.OP ""High Free Spirits"" by TrySail is a powerful one. Got pumped one listening to this one, rarely to miss the OP when watching Haifuri. It\'s properly fit the given theme of ships in war (?) lol The ED theme ""Ripple Effect"" by Luna Haruna is calmer and somehow uplifting, but not much appealing. The music aspect boosts my pleasure for Haifuri. Eventhough the ED isn\'t much, but the OP itself is one of the best this season followed by insert original songs which perfectly match to intensify the tension whenever Harekaze in a pinch.It\'s surprisingly good and exciting by the episodes go by.

That navigation girl\'s voice is one of the single most annoying thing going on. She\'s on a military training personal position for god\'s sake yet she squeaking like a mouse. While we are on the topic of mouse who would pick an unknown mouse and put it on their cheeks? Putting something on your face just because it\'s cute is a very bad example to present it to an anime that suppose to be kids friendly and might give them some bad ideas somewhere down the line. ', 'When it comes to naval animes there\'s generally 2 takes. On one side, you have animes like Kancolle and Azur Lane, who take the Anthropomorphize approach and give human girls ship-like qualities, and on the other side, you have Haifuri, which seeks to faithfully recreate what naval action truly is about.Haifuri is one of the biggest baits in anime history. You watch its trailers and think its just more ""cute anime girls doing cute things"", but just like its land-based counterpart Girls Und Panzer AKA Garupan, it is so much more than that.Haifuri, in my opinion, is closer in similarity to Girls Und Panzer than...it is to Azur Lane. It doesn\'t give their ships a face and tells us why they fight, they give their crews a face and tell us why they live. Haifuri, like Garupan, successfully and faithfully recreated the best parts of the glory of military service. Their showcase of the naval fleet is absolutely banger, and their plotline roots deeper and is more compelling than both Garupan and Azur Lane.General PlotOne of Haifuri\'s biggest strengths is the fact that the action starts right off the bat. On episode 1 the crews are assigned, the ships sail out, and the first combat already sets the overall plotline in motion, and this plot will span from the opening episode to the last moments of the final episode. I will admit that it does lose sight of the overarching story sometimes, but overall, the overarching story is brilliantly executed and only makes the prospect of seafaring even more attractive to us and these girls.CharactersNaturally ever good ship needs a good crew. Haifuri takes on this task in a interesting style: dividing the class of 30 girls operating the Harekaze into their departments, and giving them overall tropes and also unique tropes in each department.(Side note for my fellow history buffs, the Harekaze is a Kagerou-class destroyer. It never existed in the real world so its completely fictional. All the other ships featured in the anime are accurate to their real world counterparts though)Sure, the girls in charge of the Kitchen share similar qualities, but they still feel unique overall. Very unique way of dealing with the problem.However, there\'s no possible way you\'re gonna flesh out 30 characters in 12 episodes, and thats not even counting characters like Moeka and Wilhelmina, who don\'t belong to the crew. To counter this, naturally, an emphasis is placed on the characters in the Bridge of the Harekaze, throughout the 12 episodes, we dive deep into the conflicts of Akeno\'s tendencies to jump headfirst into the fray and leave the ship in disarray, Mashiro\'s conflicts with her inner thoughts and what\'s good for the crew, and other things. This provides the bridge themselves the shine they need to elevate the rest of the crew into being a well-rounded cast, because a ship is nothing without its administration.Art and MusicOhhh boy.Normally speaking, CGI isnt exactly smiled upon in anime, because it feels unnatural. However, on the open seas, especially if you\'re displaying the military might of the fine engineering that is naval combat craft, the CGI proved to be a powerful ally. The sway of the Harekaze in the storm and wind, the powerful blasts of the Musashi\'s cannons and the Harekaze\'s zigzagging response. The flow of the torpedoes and the rumbling of the engines. All of this was created with such pinpoint accuracy it can make any history buff wet their pants right there and then. Just seeing the Musashi stand as a floating fortress in the open seas is a sight to behold.As for the music, it hits in the peak moments of the show, splashing you with a virtual water that leaves you feeling like you were physically plunged into the unforgiving marine. The OP and ED also are very well made, very impressive.As a lover of military history, I love how Haifuri opted for the faithful recreation path and succeeded in doing so. Even though as of writing this the studio adapting this series has long since closed down, I hope that someday, another studio will pick up Haifuri again.

If you like anime with an ocean atmosphere like listening to the waves, seagulls, storms and the scenery. And also ship knowledge such as its operation and giving the captain's orders to the crew. I think you should watch this.This anime is approximately 85% of the scene in this season is in the middle of the sea. Not only the sea and shipping, but also the daily lives of girls who struggle to survive because they are considered school rebels because there is an unknown cause of chaos that is happening in this story. Don't forget their cuteness is a...part of this anime. When asked which part is more dominant between serious and having fun. I think the fun part is a bit more. But I enjoyed it, seeing their daily cuteness and the way they steered the boat.A little disappointed about the sound of cannons and explosions, too slow so the atmosphere of war is less pronounced. part of this anime.

But I enjoyed it, seeing their daily cuteness and the way they steered the boat.A little disappointed about the sound of cannons and explosions, too slow so the atmosphere of war is less pronounced."", 'I watched High School Fleet, also known as Haifuri. I watched the TV anime, OVAs, and the movie. Here are my thoughts:This is basically the maritime clone of Girls und Panzer, which I didn\'t enjoy enough to watch more than the first season of. It\'s been years since then, but I think one of the main reasons I dropped GuP was because of the crappy characters. I remember also thinking that the battles were very drawn-out and often boring. Anyway, enough about GuP — I only bring it up because the comparison is so common.High School Fleet involves battleships which are operated by crews of...cute girls. This is a winning combination, in my view. Watching the girls working together in their various naval roles is entertaining. The girls are enrolled in a naval academy for training to join a military organization called the Blue Mermaids (Blue-Mers LOL). It\'s unreasonable of me to expect this, but it would have been nice if a bit more attention was given to the technical aspects of the battleships. Although, anime is probably the wrong medium for that. Regardless, if you like military stuff then there\'s an okay amount of that here. Admittedly, I\'m kind of a military dork so I\'m probably a little biased in this regard. The ships featured in the anime resemble WW2-era battleships.In terms of animation, CGI is frequently used to animate the battleships. The CGI can sometimes appear crude, even by anime CGI standards. However, the character animation is often surprisingly good (although inconsistent). I\'m fine with this resource allocation as the high-quality character animation does enhance the cuteness appeal of the show. Both the art style and character designs are fairly generic. Although I will say that a disproportionate degree of attention is paid to the characters\' hair, both in terms of design and animation. I enjoyed this subtle aspect of the show since I just really like hair (OMG I\'m such a weirdo) and think it\'s an important feature. There are lots of cute hairstyles among the cast! Anyway, it\'s not really the character designs themselves that evoke the feeling of moe within me, it\'s the \'gap moe\' of the girls operating warships that really amplifies the cuteness.The cast is very tropey, unsurprisingly. Some of the characters are pretty funny though. I don\'t have any significant complaints about the cast; this isn\'t the kind of show that requires character development. The cast is enormous, making it difficult to implement individual character arcs anyway. None of the characters are annoying, thankfully.In terms of voice acting, there\'s a fair bit of variety. Some of the VAs do an exceptional job (ex. Rin), although they are diluted by the enormous size of the cast. As for music, I liked the OP song (the vocals are pretty good). The OST was nothing special. I would have liked to have seen a more military-like soundtrack for this. Could you imagine a well-produced military-inspired OST with lots of brass instruments used in a show like this? That would be awesome. There was a mild military theme to the music, but I would have preferred it be stronger (I realize this is kind of a silly complaint). Regardless, a more creative and talented OST composer could benefit this anime a lot, especially considering that there are plenty of moments without any dialogue. However, I will say that the sound effects during battle scenes were pretty nice.There was a healthy mix of plot and lighthearted silly scenes. It was sometimes a fun show to watch. However, one of my biggest issues with this anime was the plot itself. The battle scenes were usually fun and entertaining, but many other plot-related scenes were tiresome. Without giving too much away, the story involves a dumb mystery. A lot of screentime gets wasted on eyeroll-inducing scenes related to this mystery phenomenon. Just know that it was really dumb, and not in an enjoyable way — I sometimes felt like I was watching a one-star horror movie. Even beyond the mystery, the writing in general is just poor. The plot doesn\'t completely dominate the show, so I don\'t want to overstate its impact on my viewing experience. Still, it was pretty bad and I would have preferred a completely different story or, better yet, no plot at all. Seriously, I even would have preferred that everyone just sat around painting their nails and drinking milkshakes, while occasionally firing some torpedoes and 400mm cannons. In any case, for maximum enjoyment of this anime, I think the best thing to do is shut your brain off.My overall rating for the TV anime: 6/10I pretty much got what I expected. It was fun and cute, but there was room for improvement. It felt like this anime \'played it safe\' in a lot of respects. Aside from the naval setting and the sometimes-strange plot, it was a fairly stereotypical moe show. I actually would have liked to have seen the maritime theme embraced more than it was. Meaning, a greater emphasis on naval operations, naval warfare, and general seamanship (I realize this is an unrealistic expectation for anime). As opposed to tropey character interactions that we\'ve already seen play out in countless other settings. Due to its setting, High School Fleet had a chance to be truly unique. This chance was somewhat squandered. I also think that this show would have really benefited from a higher animation budget. There was tons of opportunity here for gorgeous visuals that would have enhanced the viewing experience, but this wasn\'t fully capitalized upon.I\'m not sure if it had any effect on this anime production, but apparently the studio went bankrupt not long after it aired (the movie was made by a different studio). Maybe there\'s a story behind that.I\'ll also include my opinion of the two OVA episodes: they were bad. The plot was bad and they didn\'t even take place on the ships, which removed a significant driver of my enjoyment of the show. The OVAs were considerably worse than the TV anime, in my opinion (OVA rating: 4/10). I wouldn\'t recommend watching them unless you adored the TV anime.As for the 2020 movie, here are my comments on it:- the same crude jarring CGI is used to animate the ships, unfortunately. In fact, the visuals in general are barely a step above the TV anime, which is disappointing. As I already said, this anime could benefit a lot from better visuals.- again, not enough focus on the maritime theme of the show. Not nearly enough cool battleship content. To my stark disappointment, the first ~50 (FIFTY) minutes of the movie did not have a single battleship scene (so, basically half the runtime). High School Fleet continues to squander its potential by not focusing on the things that make it unique and entertaining. It still continues to be ""Generic School Anime but Sometimes On a Boat This Time"" (which unfortunately isn\'t unexpected).- again, another ridiculously bad plot that feels like it came out of a grade-school creative writing class. Literally the kind of thing I\'d expect in a one-star movie. Not that I care that much about the plot anyway. Please just show me some cool battleship stuff and accompanying gap moe; at this point I don\'t even care what storyline you need to justify it.- when the battle scenes did finally arrive, they were pretty underwhelming, particularly for a movie. Sound effects were alright but could have been better. I was also disappointed by the lack of any ship-vs-ship skirmishes.- the sense of novelty that kept me interested in the TV anime has since worn out. I\'ve already seen 14 episodes of this anime, and the movie isn\'t really bringing anything new to the table.- the characters are still just as cute as they were during the TV series. This is one thing that High School Fleet consistently does an okay job of.- overall I simply didn\'t enjoy the movie as much as the TV series. Spending ~half the screentime onshore was a major reason for this. It\'s called High School FLEET, okay?! FLEET. As in, on ships at sea in the flipping water! That\'s all I\'m asking for!My overall rating for the 2020 movie: 4/10Rin and Tama are the cutest!!There\'s another thing I want to say about modern anime more generally, even though this review might not be the best place for it, and I\'m probably stating the obvious anyway. A lot of modern \'moe\' CGDCT shows will add a theme to their story or change the setting or do something to try to distinguish themselves from all the other similar shows. So many of these anime will, in concept, have a totally unique and interesting theme that could make for a memorable show. Upon implementation though, the show will squander this unique potential by deferring to the same tired formulaic CGDCT material — the same tired character interactions, the same stale comedy, the same character types and tropes. High School Fleet is yet another example of this (and hardly the most egregious). It doesn\'t fully commit to the elements that make it unique, and instead plays it safe, so what you end up with is Generic School Anime (sometimes on a boat this time!). Admittedly, High School Fleet has a unique plot (and unfortunately it\'s quite bad), so it\'s not even an ideal example of this phenomenon. cute girls. This is a winning combination, in my view. Watching the girls working together in their various naval roles is entertaining. The girls are enrolled in a naval academy for training to join a military organization called the Blue Mermaids (Blue-Mers LOL). It\'s unreasonable of me to expect this, but it would have been nice if a bit more attention was given to the technical aspects of the battleships. Although, anime is probably the wrong medium for that. Regardless, if you like military stuff then there\'s an okay amount of that here. Admittedly, I\'m kind of a military dork so I\'m probably a little biased in this regard. The ships featured in the anime resemble WW2-era battleships.In terms of animation, CGI is frequently used to animate the battleships. The CGI can sometimes appear crude, even by anime CGI standards. However, the character animation is often surprisingly good (although inconsistent). I\'m fine with this resource allocation as the high-quality character animation does enhance the cuteness appeal of the show. Both the art style and character designs are fairly generic. Although I will say that a disproportionate degree of attention is paid to the characters\' hair, both in terms of design and animation. I enjoyed this subtle aspect of the show since I just really like hair (OMG I\'m such a weirdo) and think it\'s an important feature. There are lots of cute hairstyles among the cast! Anyway, it\'s not really the character designs themselves that evoke the feeling of moe within me, it\'s the \'gap moe\' of the girls operating warships that really amplifies the cuteness.The cast is very tropey, unsurprisingly. Some of the characters are pretty funny though. I don\'t have any significant complaints about the cast; this isn\'t the kind of show that requires character development. The cast is enormous, making it difficult to implement individual character arcs anyway. None of the characters are annoying, thankfully.In terms of voice acting, there\'s a fair bit of variety. Some of the VAs do an exceptional job (ex. Rin), although they are diluted by the enormous size of the cast. As for music, I liked the OP song (the vocals are pretty good). The OST was nothing special. I would have liked to have seen a more military-like soundtrack for this. Could you imagine a well-produced military-inspired OST with lots of brass instruments used in a show like this? That would be awesome. There was a mild military theme to the music, but I would have preferred it be stronger (I realize this is kind of a silly complaint). Regardless, a more creative and talented OST composer could benefit this anime a lot, especially considering that there are plenty of moments without any dialogue. However, I will say that the sound effects during battle scenes were pretty nice.There was a healthy mix of plot and lighthearted silly scenes. It was sometimes a fun show to watch. However, one of my biggest issues with this anime was the plot itself. The battle scenes were usually fun and entertaining, but many other plot-related scenes were tiresome. Without giving too much away, the story involves a dumb mystery. A lot of screentime gets wasted on eyeroll-inducing scenes related to this mystery phenomenon. Just know that it was really dumb, and not in an enjoyable way — I sometimes felt like I was watching a one-star horror movie. Even beyond the mystery, the writing in general is just poor. The plot doesn\'t completely dominate the show, so I don\'t want to overstate its impact on my viewing experience. Still, it was pretty bad and I would have preferred a completely different story or, better yet, no plot at all. Seriously, I even would have preferred that everyone just sat around painting their nails and drinking milkshakes, while occasionally firing some torpedoes and 400mm cannons. In any case, for maximum enjoyment of this anime, I think the best thing to do is shut your brain off.My overall rating for the TV anime: 6/10I pretty much got what I expected. It was fun and cute, but there was room for improvement. It felt like this anime \'played it safe\' in a lot of respects. Aside from the naval setting and the sometimes-strange plot, it was a fairly stereotypical moe show. I actually would have liked to have seen the maritime theme embraced more than it was. Meaning, a greater emphasis on naval operations, naval warfare, and general seamanship (I realize this is an unrealistic expectation for anime). As opposed to tropey character interactions that we\'ve already seen play out in countless other settings. Due to its setting, High School Fleet had a chance to be truly unique. This chance was somewhat squandered. I also think that this show would have really benefited from a higher animation budget. There was tons of opportunity here for gorgeous visuals that would have enhanced the viewing experience, but this wasn\'t fully capitalized upon.I\'m not sure if it had any effect on this anime production, but apparently the studio went bankrupt not long after it aired (the movie was made by a different studio). Maybe there\'s a story behind that.I\'ll also include my opinion of the two OVA episodes: they were bad. The plot was bad and they didn\'t even take place on the ships, which removed a significant driver of my enjoyment of the show. The OVAs were considerably worse than the TV anime, in my opinion (OVA rating: 4/10).

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49520/Aharen-san_wa_Hakarenai,"['I started watching the series because the main character looks like Kanna, I keep watching it because of Raidou’s antics, and I ended up witnessing an emotionally relatable ride through the personal growth of two characters that I could not but cheer for. During its 12 episodes, Aharen-san Is Indecipherable delivers an honest yet comical representation of awkward socialization, portraying how the flaws and abnormalities outlines the beauty of human relationships. The strength of its routine, the constant usage of popular references, the coherence of its foundation, the texture of the cognitive distortions, the weight of the self-love messages, each element fuses to create a...healthy and positive experience that portrays an engaging journey of honest friendship and relatable small conflicts between a charismatic and unforgettable castEach episode of the series follows a similar structure, where the viewer assimilates the experiences of Raidou, a socially distant guy whose mission is to connect with someone in High School but overthinks any situation that he is in (Awfully accurate social anxiety btw), and his relationship with Aharen, a timid character that barely expresses herself as she is afraid of being too invasive because of her past experiences. While both are the predominant figures of the series, the anime also tends to switch from Raidou’s perspective to the point of view of different characters that embrace different stages of life or social cliches, like an intensively romantic teacher that gets heated by their relationship, an elementary schoolgirl called Futaba that sees Aharen as her rival, a nervous and awkward childhood friend who stalk Aharen, or apparently standard classmates who portray an ordinary read of their relationship.The attachment to the structure brings one of the strengths of the anime, the story trusts the premise. Aharen as a character is permanently subject to the perspective of each one of the characters, bringing to life the idea of being truly indecipherable to them. Each perspective forms a new source of relatability, a new layer of human irrationality and incomprehension, delineating a diverse empathetic array of emotions and experiences. The dialogue, the behavior, the gestures, everything comes from observing the real-life extension of each character, portraying both the ugly and the desired, creating awkwardness, comfort, and concern, as it can transgress the own viewer experiences. The siblings act like siblings, the friends act like friends, the kids act like kids, Aharen is Aharen, Raidou is Raidou, it is as simple and powerful as that.The outcome of this trust to the premise and the attachment to reality is an experience that has a unique sense of life and personality, a journey through the connection between Aharen and Raidou, where each perspective represents a clear and engaging identity, where the viewer is allowed to do interpretations about the relationships, reflect on the characters decisions and its roots, and even develop a better understanding of themselves. The anime delivers a human mystery that is carefully revealed as the story progresses, it allows surprising turns and healthy inferences, it delivers a human voice that is not trying to escape or excuse the flaws of each character but search the beauty on their core. The beauty of insecurity, the courage of a first step, the love of a let it go.However, the main strength from the anime is how it portrays everything through comedy. One of the potential criticisms that could arise from this anime is that the gags are repetitive, as they follow a transparent pattern for each character. The wrongness of such idea is that it abstracts the details, as the formats are nothing but simple templates that allows the generation of a diverse set of jokes (Like any other comedy, by the way). Indeed, while the patterns are prevalent, the reiteration of them should not be an issue at all, because the comedic blueprints are constantly evolving for the purpose of surprising the viewer with a new form. The comedy never overstays its welcome, it is always striving for new elements that could bring diversity.The main example of such evolution is Raidou’s overthinking. The overthinking normally follows the “Raidou see thing -> Raidou overthinks that thing -> Reality is disappointing” flow, but the content and the punchline of each inference vary enough to keep it completely fresh, creating a memorable gag that by just existing delivers something, be it frustration, be it amusement, be it tension.How does the overthinking vary? The overthinking variations come from changing the placement of the joke itself. Sometimes the punch is the thought itself, a conclusion completely derailed from reality that just lead to believe that Raidou should seek a psychiatrist, sometimes the punch is the outcome of a delusion, the reaction of Raidou to the impending reality disappointment, sometimes the punch is a reference, how Raidou use popular fiction to parallelize his fantasies or create a social commentary on credit for apparently no reason, or sometimes the gag is not even a joke, it is just a honest representation of how Raidou cares about Aharen and his friends. The gag itself creates expectations, can Raidou be correct once? How wrong is Raidou in this one?The diversity and similarity allow the comedy to be fantastic, it uses the gags to approach multiple concepts supported by a careful study of the comedic factor of each idea, a fantastic sense of how to build up elements on top of another to create hilarious outcomes and generate iconic gags. How to make a joke about Raidou carrying Aharen funny? Deliver a bunch of frames that represent an absurd extent of Raidou’s extrapolation and put an unexpected moustache on an elderly Aharen. How to make a joke about Raidou being bad at swimming funny? Deliver the most typical technical error of novice swimmers after a juxtaposition to Raidou’s relatable perception of motion. How to make fun of Raidou’s failed youtube channel? Just display a capture of the video statics of Raidou’s past venture to accompany Raidou’s concerns. The anime is overflowing with visual jokes that are both clever and carefully inputted, whether it is to stop a crescendo of absurdity or to play with the expectations of the viewers or illustrate the characters wild imagination. It is smart.If the anime just had the comedy as its main strength, then it would be an excellent anime, but it goes beyond that. As the series progresses through each one of its gags, the characters quirks coherently evolve into their development, defining their own ambitions and insecurities, elaborating a rich characterization that allows both dramatic and hilarious moments to flow without friction. Raidou’s overthinking develops his genuine caring nature and his own anxieties, Aharen’s supposed indecipherability allows herself to express her insecurities naturally, Ooshiro’s protective anxiety develop into a wonderful read of self-esteem issues, Futaba’s childish perception of love and confrontative attitude develop into a character that you cheer for. The peculiarities of each character progressively evolve into an interesting and unique singular entity, it allows the audience to care for the characters beyond their own comedic personality as they are the same person whether it is light-hearted comedy or a serious matter.The consequence of this consistency is that it allows piecing together meaningful messages and themes, themes that could be felt shoehorned if it were not because of its excellence on the characterization department. From helping each other to being able to receive help; from embracing with pride the uniqueness of each one to being able to accept the diversity; from the importance to be confident on our own abilities to the importance of being able to express our own sentiments and concerns. Each character is cleverly attached to the messages that it is trying to portray, it creates a natural path to organize romance, comedy, and a meaningful and positive purpose. There is no need to display bland or uninteresting scenes where they explicitly state the purpose of the situation, instead, it delivers weighty ideas with emotional subtlety by adopting its characteristic identity, and it makes you care for it. Engaging entertainment, the show delivers the relaxing and healing atmosphere while portraying impactful ideas.As it creates meaningful messages and portrays interesting relationships, one of the issues that could emerge from the comedy is a lack of sensibility towards some subject matters. Fantastically enough, that does not happen. A character of this series uses the clothes from his sister, but the series goes out of its way to clarify that it is not an issue and that the joke was just Raidou’s interpretation by adding a cute after credits. Raidou’s get fat, but the joke is not his obesity, it is Aharen’s incapability of telling him that he looks fatter because she was the one who did the overthinking this time. It is sensible and aware of what it is trying to portray, and that is wonderful.While one can criticize the quality of the adaptation, principally by its extensive usage of jarring CGI or its off-model characters, my argument is, who the fuck cares. The anime perfectly captures elements that some other adaptations with extravagant and bombastic animation just can’t, it captures the mutual care of Raidou and Aharen, the dramatic twists of Raidou overthinking, the enthusiasm of Aharen’s classmates, the awkwardness of the teachers. The comedic aspect works perfectly because the timing is polished, it is one second about to fall off the cliff and being unfunny, which is the downfall of plenty comedy adaptations, but it just performs spectacularly in that regard. The romantic aspect evokes a strong aura and sensibility, obviously attributable to the great characterization, but also to how it gives itself the time to fully capture the tension and importance of the moment, the gestures of the hands, the head movements, the voice pauses, they are just enough to convey the intended idea and capture the viewer.Could it be better? Of course, but I honestly prefer having an extremely horrendous Pokemon-like battle that captures the point of the joke and develop the FEAR reference instead of having a full-blown action scene that just completely ignore the purpose of the scene and just ends up being praised by redditors and easily impressionable people. Aharen looks Futaba for 3 seconds, tilts her head to look Raidou for 3 seconds, then watches the floor for 3 seconds in dismay, to then get embarrassed by an elementary schoolgirl observation, that tells a fucking lot without any sort of ridiculous paraphernalia, get real people.Aharen-san is then just a fantastic experience with a lovely and refreshing thematic approach to romance and friendship between flawed and socially awkward characters. The comedy works perfectly if you let yourself flow with it, as there is care of each meaningful detail, and the series follows strong necessity to display the facets of cognitive distortions. The anime doesn’t derail into fantasy and search the beauty on its own cores, and as such, is able to create meaningful relationships with characters that will grow on the viewer over time. It is extremely funny, convey relevant and captivating messages, it is a unique voice, it surprises you, the romance is cute, and it has a golden retriever that retrieve things, what else do you need?“Even if we ended up in different classes, there are all kind of people. Not just in the school, but in the world. A lot of good people. People you can get to know. I’m sure of it” healthy and positive experience that portrays an engaging journey of honest friendship and relatable small conflicts between a charismatic and unforgettable castEach episode of the series follows a similar structure, where the viewer assimilates the experiences of Raidou, a socially distant guy whose mission is to connect with someone in High School but overthinks any situation that he is in (Awfully accurate social anxiety btw), and his relationship with Aharen, a timid character that barely expresses herself as she is afraid of being too invasive because of her past experiences.

Not just in the school, but in the world. A lot of good people. People you can get to know. I’m sure of it”', 'This is easily one of the funniest anime I have come across in a while. It is a little funny that I like this so much because I wasn\'t the biggest fan of the series when I first picked it up. Something about watching this made me realise just how great Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is.It\'s a gag comedy about two strange people doing strange things in the most normal way (there are other strange people too). It\'s hilarious. The number of times this anime can create a scenario for the main two and elevate it into surrealism is seemingly neverending. I do find myself laughing...at a lot of things, but Aharen-san is a little different, with it being able to make me laugh more than other comedies have made me do so. The contrast between everyday life and just downright nonsense is not to be underestimated. Like, who the hell thinks doing a spider-man in the corner of the classroom is a good idea? But it is funny because no one seems to give one, as well as it being in the array of choices for these two. But wouldn\'t you know? They are strange people in gag humour. Lol…I\'d imagine people would be *very* quick to point out how this is generic or some ""criticism"" like that. I\'d argue that is not (entirely) the case with Aharen-san. Sure, the usual plots used in episodic anime do find their way to the anime, but it\'s not like Aharen-san then became devoid of what makes it good in the first place. It just uses its skill to create something with a touch of itself. So even if it did indeed lack plot originality, the quality of this show is simply amazing anyway and it still feels like you are watching Aharen-san wa Hakarenai instead of some rip-off of a 2015 school comedy or whatever.The main two are something that I like quite a bit too. The relationship doesn\'t have a bias on one of the two, you know the one, the whole ""everyone cares about her more than him"" sometimes vice versa, or in other words, one character being more interesting/important than the other. We have Aharen, the one with terrible distance comprehension, and Raidou, the one who overthinks literally anything beyond belief. The chemistry between them just goes through the roof. In addition to making everything, they do way funnier and more enjoyable than the norm. It\'s a relationship that makes sense, one that you want to see bloom into something more meaningful and more wholesome because these two are simply meant for each other. Who doesn\'t like sweet stuff like that?A little on the side characters, whilst the attention isn\'t focused on them, I did find it that they are respectable people too. For example, Ishikawa and Satou behave like genuine people in this moderately strange world, to the funniest of the lot Toubaru-sensei (bless her) who, well, does the most amazing gags. So hey, there\'s more to love here.I don\'t really have much else to say honestly, I\'ve said everything that needed to be said. The story of this whole thing is just well… everyday life, an absurd one at that. This is easily the best thing in the season of Spring 2022 too, so another good feat to point out if you want to go and watch this. It\'s nice to see this get a pretty good adaptation too although I guess everyone anticipated this would happen soon with other similar titles getting the anime spotlight. at a lot of things, but Aharen-san is a little different, with it being able to make me laugh more than other comedies have made me do so. The contrast between everyday life and just downright nonsense is not to be underestimated. Like, who the hell thinks doing a spider-man in the corner of the classroom is a good idea? But it is funny because no one seems to give one, as well as it being in the array of choices for these two. But wouldn\'t you know? They are strange people in gag humour. Lol…I\'d imagine people would be *very* quick to point out how this is generic or some ""criticism"" like that. I\'d argue that is not (entirely) the case with Aharen-san. Sure, the usual plots used in episodic anime do find their way to the anime, but it\'s not like Aharen-san then became devoid of what makes it good in the first place. It just uses its skill to create something with a touch of itself. So even if it did indeed lack plot originality, the quality of this show is simply amazing anyway and it still feels like you are watching Aharen-san wa Hakarenai instead of some rip-off of a 2015 school comedy or whatever.The main two are something that I like quite a bit too. The relationship doesn\'t have a bias on one of the two, you know the one, the whole ""everyone cares about her more than him"" sometimes vice versa, or in other words, one character being more interesting/important than the other. We have Aharen, the one with terrible distance comprehension, and Raidou, the one who overthinks literally anything beyond belief. The chemistry between them just goes through the roof. In addition to making everything, they do way funnier and more enjoyable than the norm. It\'s a relationship that makes sense, one that you want to see bloom into something more meaningful and more wholesome because these two are simply meant for each other. Who doesn\'t like sweet stuff like that?A little on the side characters, whilst the attention isn\'t focused on them, I did find it that they are respectable people too. For example, Ishikawa and Satou behave like genuine people in this moderately strange world, to the funniest of the lot Toubaru-sensei (bless her) who, well, does the most amazing gags. So hey, there\'s more to love here.I don\'t really have much else to say honestly, I\'ve said everything that needed to be said. The story of this whole thing is just well… everyday life, an absurd one at that. This is easily the best thing in the season of Spring 2022 too, so another good feat to point out if you want to go and watch this.

Tho I\'ll admit that I haven\'t read it\'s manga so I don\'t exactly know what\'s coming ahead but I can say that it\'s simply going to be boring and generic the way it is right now.The main character of this anime is a loli looking girl (Aharen) with blue hair. She can\'t speak too loudly and is pretty...much introverted. Then there\'s this another guy name Raido who\'s kind enough to accompany the loli. Also there\'s this another girl who is always stalking Aharen cuz she wants to spend time with her. All of them just seem to be plain asf.About the storyline, I know I\'m writing this review at the time when only 3 episodes of the anime have aired but so far it has been nothing but complete randomness. There\'s no real progression. The humour in it is just cringey like hiding someone\'s unzip pants and doing headbutts. The only decent thing about this anime is probably it\'s sound.Ofcourse, some people might actually like it if they didn\'t watch anything similar before or they just want to watch something chill. I can\'t appreciate this anime when there are literally tonnes of other slice of lifes with same generic content. There\'s nothing remarkable about it.That\'s pretty much it for my review.

Aharen-san seemingly comes as an answer to such sentiment. The entire content of the show from its first to its last second is absolutely nothing but a progressing romantic relationship. The caveat is, it's not an anime rom-com kind of progress, but rather a real-life-romance kind of progress, much...to the bafflement and dismay of the rom-com crowd.A guy and a girl meet in a formal setting and strike up a conversation, then they talk some more, then they start hanging out together in their free time. Eventually, they introduce each other to their friends, and then - to their families. Over time, they progress to being a bigger and bigger part of each other’s lives, becoming closer and closer emotionally, until a realization comes that they live rent-free in each other’s heads, so they formally state their feelings to each other and inform their social circle that they are an item. Which isn’t treated as a “mission accomplished” moment like in a typical anime rom-com, the only thing that changes is now they are a tad more open in showing their physical and emotional affection, and also they start considering their long-term future plans with being together in mind. As most people outside of their mom’s basement normally do. This is what Aharen-san portrays.One of the most important aspects of a real committed relationship, by the way, is communication - and the show shines in driving this point home. The full title is “Aharen-san Is Indecipherable,” the fact is, both leads are eccentric “indecipherable” weirdos with a tendency to jump to conclusions. Dozens upon dozens of misunderstandings arise throughout the course of the story - and they all get solved within minutes by talking things out like normal human persons do. Another rarity in the realm of anime romances.Speaking of, the male lead has an outstandingly unique personality, and *his* antics are the main driving force of the series’ plot and comedy, in contrast with a typical rom-com template of a blank straight man reacting to the quirkiness of a female lead.The comedy of the show, as mentioned above, is of the distinctive British sitcom variety. Weird people being weird while other weird people refuse to acknowledge anything weird is going on because they don’t want to make a scene. I can easily imagine seeing Simon Pegg’s and Edgar Wright’s names in the credits. Again, it’s almost the exact opposite of the usual boke-tsukkomi, where exasperated calling out of the weirdness is the whole point.As a source manga reader, I can tell that the adaptation does everything right - streamlines the early parts of the story to give it a more deliberate direction that matches later developments, connects isolated chapters to frame them as a continuous narrative, casts all the right VAs for the roles, goes for a tonally perfect for the intended atmosphere visual/audio design, and ends the season on a right story beat.Also, this show features the second-best dog in all of anime (the best one is Dog from Aho Girl).Also, it makes fidget spinners look cool.10/10 for an objectively perfect rom-com. to the bafflement and dismay of the rom-com crowd.A guy and a girl meet in a formal setting and strike up a conversation, then they talk some more, then they start hanging out together in their free time.

This is what Aharen-san will give you each and every episode. It honestly reminds me of My Senpai is Annoying, but in more of a school setting, and just pure wholesomeness. We can have our action packed shows, our high tension dramas, but all we need sometimes, is a wholesome, and pure show just like Aharen-san, that you should be watching and here is why!Story and characters: 8These two blend together of course, Imagine Raidou, someone who struggled to make friends in his previous years in school, now has...the courage to try this time round. Only issue is, he's trying with the quietest girl in class in Aharen-san. Will he pull it off, and will he succeed? Simple and sweet stuff, But with it's story, comes very wholesome and sweet moments, like when the childhood friend is watching over, worried over Aharen-san, but she can't approach for her own reasons. She's just adorable in her own right. To Raidou's own sister, who isn't afraid to poke fun of him at times, but it's all in good fun.All the characters in general as well are super sweet. You'll find loving them like I said in My Senpai is Annoying super easy, as they each come off great in their own way, and there isn't a bad one among the bunch.

It really is a treat.Art and sound: 7The art has a really nice touch, and the characters animation and the world that it presents itself in, is really neat and good in detail. Much like the sound of the overall show that capture each and every moment perfectly. Which really fit in with not only the pureness of the show, but the comedic timing as well. Really well done.Aharen-san is really a stand out this season, and honestly deserves way more attention then its getting. You should be watching it for sure. the courage to try this time round.

You should be watching it for sure."", ""Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is Komi-san wa Comyushou desu if it wasn’t trying, and even that show only really tries for a single episode. It’s a school-life gag comedy where every character is a joke, and none of them are funny. Every character is introduced and you unenthusiastically realize, “oh…there’s a punch line coming here, isn’t there?” And then it comes and you go, “oh…I guess that was it?” And the answer is always yes, and it always makes you roll your eyes or simply yawn. Komi-san wa Comyushou desu has a thematic core in the idea that appearances can be deceiving, and despite what you...may think about someone based on their looks, their social status, and the assumptions which you may be lead to make about them based on those things, everyone has problems, and you’re never alone in your feelings of anxiety and self-doubt. It has a cast of gimmicky characters, but each one—whether you find them funny or not—is thematically relevant because they each display an archetype which they later proceed to subvert, thus reinforcing the idea that much like Komi, the stunning beauty who everyone admires yet who has paradoxically no self-confidence and no friends, everyone is a book whom you cannot judge by the cover. This show, however, is about nothing, and no matter how many scenes of forced sentimentality and piano music it throws in to try and trick you into thinking it’s about something emotionally worthwhile or any of its characters are growing or changing, this is not and is never the case. Actually, that last bit isn’t true. The characters do grow and change, but only after the entire show undergoes a dramatic yet ultimately underwhelming evolution and becomes something totally different than it was at the start.For the first major chunk of the show, everything I just said is true, and it feels like an uninterrupted stream of Vines, or Snapchats, or TikToks, or whatever dystopian Chinese social media network you people use nowadays. Everything that happens just feels like an attempt at generating stale memes. Aharen is just another #smol anime girl for people to farm terabytes of reaction images out of, and Raido, the MC, is just another expressionless meme boy. It just feels so condescending to me, because not only does it come across as an insult to my intelligence, but it also comes across as actively standing in for basic elements of the production. This show is mostly boring and ugly, and while that’s nothing new with modern seasonal anime, at least others will market themselves with more benign shit like fanservice or waifubait, not this embarrassing meme garbage. From the atrocious CG classmates to your usual dogshit backgrounds and hideous colors, this show suffers form everything modern anime are constantly accused of suffering from, and its clunky production eats into the script as well, because nothing makes a bad joke land even worse than being accompanied by the single most obnoxious “funny music” you’ve ever heard. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hit that perfect Nichijou-style sweet spot every once in a while, where the sheer suddenness and absurdity of the physical comedy actually catches you pleasantly by surprise, but there’s hardly enough of these moments to justify enduring the slog.However, somewhere along the line, things change, and while the change is certainly for the better, it doesn’t save the show, and it just feels annoying in retrospect. For the longest time, the opening theme felt totally inappropriate, because while the show itself was nothing but a lifeless meme factory, the OP felt like something you’d see for a more typical romantic comedy, not so much a gag comedy. It’s all pink and peachy, and it really suggests to you that the main duo are going to become love interests. But then you watch the show and it’s completely dry. There’s no romantic or sexual tension of any kind, and, at least at the time, this was the only thing about the show I actually liked. I mean, just think about how many highschool anime you’ve seen where entire episodes are dedicated to characters blushing and feeling embarrassed about making eye contact or having any physical interaction with the opposite sex. For many of us, there are probably hundreds of examples, so seeing Aharen and Raido conduct fucking circus acts all over each other was extremely refreshing. As the show began approaching its final episodes, though, the dryness faded away; characters who were once totally one-note memes began to act more generic and normal; the physical comedy got less overblown and absurdist; and before I knew it, the OP actually started feeling appropriate. There was blushing as early as episode seven, but I didn’t really take that as a change in tone, because not only were they still all over each other at that point (in a way that seemed to invalidate the “I love you, so I’m embarrassed to touch you” angle), but the characters up until that point had been fucking memes, so the idea of the show toning itself down and blossoming into a romance just felt bizarre.When Aharen kisses Raido out of fucking nowhere in episode ten, I just threw my hands up and said, “But you didn’t earn this?!” It’s not until episode nine when Raido meets Aharen’s sister that anyone actually starts seriously implying any romantic intrigue in a way that’s explicitly disconnected from the jokes, and before you know it you’re watching an uglier, more poorly directed version of Kimi ni Todoke or something. At the end of the day, there are still jokes—comedy still exists in “romantic comedies,” after all—but the tone and attitude the series begins with is completely different than the tone and attitude it ends with, and by far the worst thing about this is that after the evolution occurs, the show is so much better! I mean, it’s just a generic romcom, but it has cute, endearing moments, and if you actually enjoyed the lifeless meme factory episodes and therefore actually liked the characters, then I imagine this change in tone must've been truly cathartic. The one single moment which best encapsulated this experience of fully comprehending and wrapping my head around how the show had changed was during the final episodes when these two characters who, up until this point, had been nameless, faceless, indistinct non-characters that would react to Aharen and Raido’s wackiness every now and then just suddenly became part of the friend group. When the four of them went camping, it really threw me for a loop. I was like, “why are they here?” And yeah. Why WERE they there? When did they all become friends? Whatever the answers to those questions are, they became part of the group, and in episode eleven, just the two of them finally got to have a real conversation in the cafe when Raido walked away and Aharen was passed out on the table, and that scene pissed me off so much.WHY DID IT TAKE ELEVEN EPISODES FOR THIS TO HAPPEN?! Why did we spend episode after episode after episode after episode doing God damn fucking FORTNITE DANCES and #epic memes when we could’ve been watching a real show with real characters?!?! Please remember, I’m totally overselling this, because it’s like I said earlier. It didn’t become a masterpiece or anything. It just became a generic romcom. BUT AT LEAST THE GENERIC ROMCOM WAS WATCHABLE! Gosh, the frustration makes me want to pull my hair out. I’m sorry, but I cannot recommend this show at all. The later episodes are decent even though Raido remains an absolutely nothing character, but it is not worth watching the first phase of the show to reach that point, because it only improves enough to be mediocre. That scene in the cafe with the two friend characters was such a fucking tragedy, because it’s easily the best dialogue scene in the entire show. Raido got up to go take a shit or something, and then it cut to just the two of them sat next to each other in the booth, and that alone was enough to throw me off, because the guy turned his head and looked at the girl to speak to her directly. Understand what I’m saying here. These two have been nothing but cardboard reaction faces the whole show. Pretty much every shot of them is just their faces looking off screen, commenting on what Raido and Aharen are doing. But this time he finally looked at her as if she was real, and he spoke as if he was real. They conversed, we learn they were childhood friends, he teases her a bit, and it was cute. Before I could even get mad about having been robbed of this for so long, I first had to take a step back and realize, eleven episodes in, that I still didn’t even know their names. Indeed, I still don’t.Thank you for reading. may think about someone based on their looks, their social status, and the assumptions which you may be lead to make about them based on those things, everyone has problems, and you’re never alone in your feelings of anxiety and self-doubt.

Let me explain: In the trailer of the anime we are shown things that were popular back in 2017-2018 (When the manga\'s first Issue appeared) like Fidget Spinners and Fornite dances, so things that were popular back in 2017-2018 are now shown in a 2022 Adaptation... at first, I thought that was not the best idea, but now watching the first 4 episodes I can say that this anime is worth watching!Being an introvert (kinda) myself I love watching things that I can relate to, so this anime was...kinda calling me out to watch it because both of the main characters are introverts, even if I had to witness Fornite dances in an anime, but it was just one segment, now I\'m fine, thanks for asking!Also, I think it is worth mentioning that everything in this anime is simple (Story, Characters, Humor)... btw I recommend not to watch it if you expect a masterpiece because it is not. Aharen-San is just an anime you can watch after a hard day to forget about your daily problems and put a smile on your face before going to sleep.Sometimes when I feel down I find myself watching random clips from this anime on Youtube, a thing that rarely happened to me before. kinda calling me out to watch it because both of the main characters are introverts, even if I had to witness Fornite dances in an anime, but it was just one segment, now I\'m fine, thanks for asking!Also, I think it is worth mentioning that everything in this anime is simple (Story, Characters, Humor)... btw I recommend not to watch it if you expect a masterpiece because it is not.

It will either make you cringe hard or do a Mutley laugh, there is no in between, the comedy is very very subjective and if it doesnt click for you, I’d suggest dropping it. Me, personally? I do Laugh out loud at fart sounds so well, I am pretty easy to please.Review time *clap clap*Story (6/10)It's a gag manga, most of the plot is straight-up ripping off the most recent trends xD, Be it Beyblade, Fidget spinners, Rap battles, Demon slayer, JOJO, spiderman, etc. There isn't to find in terms of the story that can be found here and it isn't A CGDCT either. There are hints of romance and a bit of a serious arc towards the end (which wraps up rather quickly and is quite wholesome and realistic).Characters (7/10)Obviously the main part of any gag manga but in This case, it is a hard topic to elaborate on so ill just make it as simple as possible.The characters will either be a 0 to 2 /10 or 8 to 10 /10 depending on the person and their sense of humor, this is very subjective, for me they are quite fun and a 7/10 but if you find yourself not being able to enjoy the characters this show is gonna be a hard sell.Sound and VA (7/10)The general OSt is standard and forgettable. The op and ED are pretty incredible however but the art in them is rather weak.Art and animation (6/10)Standard Loli with standard straight man is what it feels like at first, but there are some good scenes where you can see the animators clearly having fun with their characters. A bit of CG that looks awkward here and there.Give the first few a shot! If you enjoy them it'll be a great ride, if not consider dropping the show because what follows is just more of the same. hairstyle of Shinobu, Jousuke, Katzosky kicks Aharen, Gojira, Beyblade, Aharen Arale from DB universe and many more!The central part of the show is Straight face / absurd comedy, you know the chunnibyou kind, Raidou has the wildest of fantasies and sometimes they turn out to be true!Aharen and Radiou do some wild shit and/or Radiou has the weirdest and the most insane premonitions.

Have them spend time together and who knows, maybe they can discover more about themselves. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is very clear about showcasing two main characters who are socially awkward with wild imaginations that stretches beyond common logic.There's actually plenty of logic in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai but it's how you approach the anime that defines what you get out of it. For instance, we are immediately introduced to Raidou and his social akawardness around others. But looking beyond his stoic face and personality, you can actually see that he is a...friendly person. Upon meeting Ahraen, he wants to help her in any way he can. Our main protagonist Aharen has an even more stoic face who seems to be misunderstood for her expressions. In the first episode, their social interaction can be described as particularly strange. Let's face it, both characters have trouble expressing themselves. So when you have two characters behave in a similar matter, it looks like you're watching a mirror image of the two.I must also inform that there's no complex story revolving around the two main characters. It's really about the two spending time together in a slice of life adventure. In other words, you shouldn't come into this show expecting some deep storytelling or even in-depth characterization. What should you expect is the non-linear sitcom like segments that we see from each episode involving the cast. Yes, Raidou and Aharen carries this anime on their backs with their personalities and wildly imaginations. In every epsiode, you can see from their point of view and their imaginations come to light. This is more evidenced in Raidou who often pictures Aharen in some wild fantasy. Don't get me wrong though. It's mostly innocent and stems from his perceptions of Aharen's character. There's no shock fan service or ecchi that misleads the viewers.With the countless amount of humourous gags, it does make you question what the author was thinking when they made this series. And it's simple: to entertain. There's no hidden motive about this show at all. When it comes down to it, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is a comedy slice of life that loves its cast and characters. Even outside of the main cast, we have characters such as Mutsuki, Futaba, and even Aharen's family members that connects with the audience. Let's face it, you shouldn't be watching this show if you're not ready for some popcorn entertainment and laughter. When I watch a slice of life comedy, the very first thing I look for is the humor and that's what this anime is all about. HUMOR.Based on the manga, each episode is decorated with simple yet effective designs. The most prevalent is how characters react in the case for Aharen and Raidou. They express themselves with curiousity yet are also very socially awkward. It's in human nature that they react in their own personal ways, just as we do. But make no mistake, their personal imaginations can go beyond the limits at times. Yet, the show is able to capture the magic of these imaginations with fluid and creative style of animation.Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is probably not an anime that you'd pick up easily as your first show. Even as relaxing and simple as it is, the anime can be quite bizarre for a slice of life. But does it work as the author intended? I believe the answer is absolutely. With each daring episode, I was entertained. By trascending beyond common sense, this anime is on a level of its own. friendly person. Upon meeting Ahraen, he wants to help her in any way he can.

The things she does can set me overthinking about 1001 scenarios, from something as simple as sleep to even animals, in the most extreme of ways. Examples like: Why is she sleeping in class, did she get a scuffle with the Yakuza at night, only to reach home so late that she couldn\'t get a wink?...Or why is she always ordering her pet dog around, did she develop personalities overnight so that she can be like a blatant master torturing her own servant?Also Raido: Oh, Aharen has a big family to take care of, so much so that she couldn\'t sleep at home. And she\'s teaching her pet dog to obey simple commands. I see.Me: Ooh, I see. *Showing the Resting Bitch Face*It\'s this blatant, unassuming comedy and humour that makes mangaka Asato Mizu\'s 2nd anime adaptation through Aharen-san wa Hakarenai a.k.a Aharen Is Indecipherable (or Unfathomable, rather) really enjoyable, and for a very good reason. Asato Mizu is not just your typical author as he/she has no less than 15 series to the name, albeit only some that are worth mentioning like the 2014\'s Doujinshi ●Rec and 2011\'s manga Denki-gai no Honya-san (which already had an anime adaptation in 2014). If anything, Asato Mizu is the epitome of this quote: ""Don\'t judge a book by its cover"", something which\'ve been refined since ●Rec, and it has worked well for this prolific author enough to use this quote as the core workaround of this manga, especially between the characters since this is a character-driven show.Communication Disorder: It\'s a condition where a person has problems communicating with other people. This person is an example of someone with such a condition. An important thing to remember is: just because the person has problems communicating, doesn\'t mean that person doesn\'t want to communicate with others.Wait, wait, wait, CHOTTO MATTE KUDASAI, why in the hell is Komi-san\'s driven dialogue here in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai??? The reality is very simple: Raido is like Tadano, starting off his first year in high school, but unlike the latter with his averageness that doesn\'t concern anyone, Raido possesses a naturally unfriendly face (or as the modern day culture calls it: RBF or Resting Bitch Face, which this unironically cracks me up, no shit xD), so much so that its hard to get to know him as a fellow classmate. Reina Aharen, on the other hand, she is similarly like Komi to the fact that she doesn\'t know how to communicate (initially), but at least she is aware of her surroundings to help Raido understand her intentions, which as I\'ve already mentioned at the beginning of the review: tell Raido 1001 things and he\'ll still be overthinking about the possible scenarios which frame Aharen as anything and everything but herself. I sometimes wonder if this ongoing gag will get old pretty fast, but nope, Raido is always adapting to the situations that he is in every step of the way with Aharen, that this gag evolved to actual jokes and plays that are just plain ridiculous to watch, sometimes evolving to hilarious scenarios with things that have cemented themselves in pop culture a.k.a the fidget spinner (clearly shown in the ED) and Pokemon GO! (which is period accurate to the manga\'s release in early 2017). And this redonculous premise is what actually helps Aharen to propel the fact that while ""comedy is subjective"", it can be fun too, and this show embraced all of that and more, AND I LOVE IT. Shirorin!Not to be outdone, what\'s the main cast of characters without the supporting characters. And let\'s start off with Aharen\'s childhood friend, the inadvertently huge-sized Mitsuki Oshiro who\'s tall, nervous, a crybaby and has androphobia (fear of men). Despite her nervous nature and with the stalker obsession of protecting Aharen from Raido for fear of contaminating her pure soul (like many other childhood friends do...in anime, that is), Mitsuki\'s a warm-loving and trustful friend that is able to confide in Aharen when she is down. But I\'d say that she works really well on the basis that when Raido and Aharen are doing things together, her stalker senses are up to 100. Yet another childhood friends duo of Ishikawa and Hanako Sato, they haven\'t been around with the main character cast much, but one could speculate that they would be a couple, or at best a ship anyways. On the topic of Aharen\'s family however, everyone looked exactly the same as her, so much that the genetics are truly one-of-a-kind. The eldest in the family that is Reina, the youngest brother Ren and the middle sister Eru, everyone in the Aharen family is such a delight, but the one thing in common is not to infuriate the sisters when they have a knife in their hands, they can do harmful things out of jealousy (at least on Eru\'s case). But, BUT, if there\'s one set of characters I WOULD LOVE to have more of them, it\'s gotta be the homeroom teachers, mainly Aharen and Reina\'s teacher Toubaru ""Momo""-sensei and Miyahira-sensei. These pair of teachers can be a subvert comedy gag on their very own, as Tobaru-sensei is even more wilder than Raido by fantasizing countless lovey-dovey delusions between Raido and Aharen in the most esteemed fashion possible, and losing countless heaps of blood from the resistance to wholesomeness. Also, Tobaru-sensei voiced by HanaKana just puts the icing on the cake much more worthwhile to display Death by Esteem. ESTEEMED, ESTEEMDER, ESTEEMDEST! Shirorin!The relatively new director Tomoe Makino only has Spring 2020\'s Kitsutsuki Tanteidokoro and this year\'s Netflix ONA Kotarou wa Hitorigurashi a.k.a Kotaro Lives Alone to his name. So, being an inexperienced director, they had to call someone for help, and that person is chief director Yasutaka Yamamoto (famous for 2013\'s Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?). He is a very versatile director who\'s been directing lots of shows that showcased different degrees of genres, and it definitely ain\'t a surprise that he directed the anime adaptation of the infamous adult visual novel Nekopara at studio Felix Film (which only started producing Nekopara content to begin with years before the 2020 anime). And I\'d suppose that if not for Yasutaka Yamamoto, Aharen wouldn\'t be adapted as great as Asato Mizu\'s manga made it out to be, and it\'s an enjoyable feat through and through that\'s a blast to watch with the chill vibes. Really bright and colourful visuals with soft animation that still punches to the gut, also in a chill way that\'s easy on the eyes that makes Felix Film\'s production values really well done, considering that the main producer is the Chinese anime conglomerate licensor Bilibili, which means that this is a Chinese-Japanese production mix. Shirorin!The chill vibes don\'t stop there, as the music is thoroughly the same as well. TrySail and HaKoniwalily\'s OP/ED OST is also enjoyable to listen to, as do the peppy BGM that makes Aharen sound like a jokester syndrome prank of a show that\'s playing with the audience of its gag contraptions. It\'s lighthearted and doesn\'t grate on your ears much, while maintaining the subtlety that this is SoL at its best and most calm. Shirorin!It\'s safe to say that while Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is marketed as a rom-com of all things, it also isn\'t really one per se, as the comedy is more straight-laced and the SoL vibes are pretty much strewn all over the place to make this a cute and wholesome show. And no doubt that Aharen soothes the soul as you start the weekend to a relaxing gaze, just wanting to watch more seasonal mainstream anime that anyone and everyone can just pick up and watch, and not have anything to complain about. There has been too much action lately, why not try something more chill instead? To that I say: Aharen has got you covered, and this is comedy at its finest. Shirorin! Or why is she always ordering her pet dog around, did she develop personalities overnight so that she can be like a blatant master torturing her own servant?Also Raido: Oh, Aharen has a big family to take care of, so much so that she couldn\'t sleep at home.

The cast gets bigger but they're mostly insignificant characters. The show...mostly follows the story of the 2 main characters and their development. They try their best to understand each other and it's cute.Art: 4/10My real complaint lies here. Pretty basic art, obviously low budget. Cgi for the most basic of things. The classroom itself was full of cgi students who are literally sitting still. No life forms can be detected in that class. Desks are also cgi but at least they look normal with the environment.Enjoyment: 9/10I guess that's what this anime's real strong point is. It has no goals no ambitions, just purely random. The comedy is pretty decent, it's so innocent yet unfiltered it achieves being natural. The main duo are cute and funny. Mc also manages to always assume the worst and most nonsensical scenario's when he's confused.Overall: 5.4/10Pretty low score objectively but if you're bored with nothing to watch, this is for you.

Also, the friendship between tall guy and short girl did give such comedy and romance substance that...the said genre weren\'t boring to watch.Art-Decent 4: Well, give that this anime doesn\'t show a lot of fanservices and the illustration were that erotic, such rating is just.Sound-Good 7: At first we were goanna be give another female character like that of Komi but as it turn out the timid female character\'s voice wasn\'t a disappointment, even though she has to sort of whisper what she has to say, nevertheless, the seiyu who did the female lead\'s voice wasn\'t wasted.Character-Good 7: Ok, so let\'s go over each character;Aharen Reina- Ok, so she\'s the short girl who is indecipherable, why she was called that, even thought the one who often has a lot of wild imagination about her is her partner , Raidou? Is a big question in fact I really don\'t get as to why the original creator , Mizu Asato, has portrayed her like that, even though she can be deciphered.Raidou, Matsuboshi-Now, him being this person which such fantastic way of understanding or misinterpreting Aharen, does give this anime it\'s pizzazz cu\'z without his bizarre way of interpreting Aharen this anime would\'ve have been boring.Ooshiro, Mitsuki- She\'s the villain around here , even though she a girl with anxiety problem. But it was her stalker\'s personality that makes her the antagonist around here, despite of her being this weakling that any bully can take down.Enjoyment-Good 7: Honestly, this wasn\'t really bad and it wasn\'t that annoying.Overall-Very Good 8: Overall, this was just good, so season 2????Hummm, maybe yes or maybe not, but why not. the said genre weren\'t boring to watch.Art-Decent 4: Well, give that this anime doesn\'t show a lot of fanservices and the illustration were that erotic, such rating is just.Sound-Good 7: At first we were goanna be give another female character like that of Komi but as it turn out the timid female character\'s voice wasn\'t a disappointment, even though she has to sort of whisper what she has to say, nevertheless, the seiyu who did the female lead\'s voice wasn\'t wasted.Character-Good 7: Ok, so let\'s go over each character;Aharen Reina- Ok, so she\'s the short girl who is indecipherable, why she was called that, even thought the one who often has a lot of wild imagination about her is her partner , Raidou?

The dynamic of the cute, highly talented Aharen-san and Raidou; an average high-school boy with a vivacious imagination, works surprisingly well. I wouldn’t say the show is a masterpiece or that it outclasses other shows in the romantic comedy genre, but it holds up as a decent choice. It’s solid, but not very noteworthy unless you categorize yourself as someone who:...1. Highly enjoys gratitude from an innocuous girl2. Highly enjoys references to pop-culture from half a decade ago. ‘Blasts from the past’Story:Mostly episodic but has an overarching romance developing between the main characters. The show is simplistic and showcases both original and cliche characters. The pacing is fine for the most part, but there was a span of 3-4 episodes where the story seems to ramp up. If you pick up the show, you are watching entirely for the comedy, with the romance and other story elements being kept in the background.I was satisfied with the ending, though I wouldn’t be surprised if another season was in production.Comedy:The jokes grew on me after 5 or 6 episodes, falling under formulaic humor with a few running gags. Often, Raidou will jump to outlandish conclusions from the smallest things. Raidou’s thoughts are shown through various scenarios in his mind, complemented by the neat art style. This constitutes a majority of the show’s humor. While a decent portion of the jokes seem “outdated”, they come across as refreshing rather than antiquated, due to the nature of the show’s general vibe.Characters:The characters aren’t too fleshed out and remain relatively traditional until the end. In a year from now, I won't remember anything about the characters besides the basic trope they encapsulate. If you’re looking for realistic or relatable characters, I would turn away immediately. The supporting cast is mediocre, if not mundane, except for the hilarious little girl who carries around a child safety whistle. Overall, the main team of Aharen and Raidou heavily carries the show’s enjoyment with their cute and funny dynamic.Now for the bit that nearly made me drop the show. They introduce a character who spies on the main cast and doesn’t contribute well enough to the story to require her presence at all. I don’t think she fits in the story too well, when the author could have replaced her with a funnier character. Instead, she acts as a recurring gag for the entirety of the show and wastes screen time. They heavily detract from the humor and shift the mood of every scene possible. In all fairness, she is not completely awful. She does get a small amount of backstory, but it does not justify her character at all. If you are like me, you might have the urge to skip the scenes that she is involved in, but I would suggest powering through it anyway. 1. Highly enjoys gratitude from an innocuous girl2.

Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness.Aharen-san is a girl who doesn’t know any personal boundaries. When associating with anyone, she constantly gets way up close, physically clings onto them, and stares deep into their soul without flinching. Our male lead, Raidou, is conveniently accepting of this personal quirk, but not without some initial hesitation. The story begins with Raidou getting to know this strange girl, while also incorporating some tactics to help with her “condition.” After...a little while, this premise is completely dropped and everything goes straight to Hell. Just how I like it.I’ve purposefully said very little about the male lead, Raidou. Based on what I’ve described of him, what do you think he’s like? Docile, but accepting? Nervous and fidgety? Blushes tremendously whenever Aharen gets anywhere near him? I’m sure you imagined this to some degree. Raidou is, one could argue, weirder than Aharen, the blunt chemistry these two share as a comedic duo, with Aharen partaking in weirdly intimate things and Raidou observing it completely objectively. Both characters often are drawn with completely blank expressions that hide their inner feelings, making everything vaguely cynical, which makes the humor all the more effective.A lot of it comes from misunderstandings, which is commonplace, but the active imagination of Raidou makes everything so blissfully weird. Aharen is constantly hiding her face? Raidou believes that she recently got into a scuffle with a tiger and wants to hide the jagged scars from the world. Aharen can’t focus in class? She’s not getting enough sleep due to the multi-billion dollar corporation she runs suddenly coming under fire for money-laundering schemes. (These are fake but similar scenarios.) It is that imagination, however, that makes him, and the anime, so charming.Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the character's CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. The chill vibes hooked me instantly. Perhaps they're what you need too. a little while, this premise is completely dropped and everything goes straight to Hell.

Read at your own risk--If I were to summarise how good Aharen-san wa Hakarenai in one sentence, I would say this: ""The ingredients of the coffee were spilt all over the table"". I will admit that I enjoyed Aharen-san wa Hakarenai at first, but it ends up boring and repetitive or it just fails to introduce genius and well-thought ideas for a new chapter.--Story--The story follows our two main characters of the story (Raido and Aharen). The story takes place in the first few days of Raido and Aharen\'s...high school life. Raido plans to be friends with the person next to him. They sit and chat to each other until they become friends. This is the starting point of their high school life.The story does get a bit calming at first, but it eventually gets repetitive and boring. As each episode passes, it just keeps on getting worse, until the author decides to mark an early confession at EPISODE 10. That\'s right. It only took 9-10 episodes for them to fall in love with each other. That was just stupid. The two lovers have to develop feelings for each other at a certain point; but I know that the point is not episode 10. Plus, after Raido and Aharen kiss, there was literally little to none change in story. Raido and Aharen just keep on acting the same. And then, we have       Oshiro suddenly think that Raido rejected Aharen, despite seeing a kiss right on the bat. So she gets really mad at Raido despite not trying to clear up what truly happened. Nothing makes sense in the story. Everything is being thrown around and it\'s just stupid. A dreadful 2 out of 10 for story.--Art and Animation--The art and animation from Felix Films is surprisingly good. It\'s consistent and it\'s a change of pace from your usual-looking romcom characters. However, there\'s something I just can\'t get of Aharen\'s art. It looks to relatable to another character I know. Beside that, The rest look pretty good. Besides that, there\'s really not that much to criticise because the art is actually pretty good. 7 out of 10 for art, and an 8 out of 10 for animation.--Sound and OST--The sound  is nothing to be amazed at or anything, but I think it works pretty well with the story. It may be simple sound effects but it\'s good for a story like this. I can\'t imagine Aharen-san wa Hakarenai having spectacular sound effects.For the OST, it\'s really well made. It has bright animation, and the singing works out. There\'s not really that much to comment besides that. A fair 6 out of 10 for sound and an 7 out of 10 for OST.--Character--Oh boy...This is probably the worst aspect of the show besides the dreadful story. Why? Because Aharen Reina is a literal copy of the character I mentioned before. There are some differences, but Aharen is mostly a copy. She doesn\'t smile. She acts more passive. Ishikawa and Hanako are just NPCs. There are rarely scenes where I can seriously think they aren\'t an NPC. Ishikawa says ""Lets go to the camp"" and just plain smiles. He just feels like an NPC. And for Hanako, she just feels like an NPC too. Oh, and I haven\'t forgotten about Raido. He somehow goes to some unrealistic conclusion. Oshino is the exact same thing as Raido when it comes to their stupid thoughts. A very low 2 out of 10 for character.--Enjoyment--As I\'ve previously mentioned, I did enjoy Aharen-san wa Hakarenai at the start, but it eventually gets bored because of how weak it becomes. I\'m not even surprised because lots of the slice of life school anime usually end up this way. A poor 3 out of 10 for enjoyment.--Conclusion--Slice of life school always end up this way. Fun at the start, but ends up rushed with terrible ideas for a new chapter or episode. In the end, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ends up as a rushed story with forced romance which happens too early.

What a disappointment.', ""Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, also called Aharen is Indecipherable is just so adorable.The series is a school comedy kinda slice of life anime, that is really relaxing after a hard day of work or if you don't know what to watch a good series.Plot and Main-Characters:The show revolves about the school life of our main characters Aharen and Raido generally two really quiet and conversed people and how they experience daily events in school together, while strengthening there bond of friendship. Aharen is very cute , flimsy and overall very adorable. While everybody in this show is friendly and you get really good along...with everybody makes this a quite enjoyable watch in my opinion.Sound and Visuals:The entire series has a calming atmosphere with little and quiet soundtrack with some good sound effects as well as a just adorable ending with Aharen dancing reminding me of Chika out of kaguya-sama.The visuals including the animation style is simplistic but well done. It portrays is a more clean and modern anime style.Overall I really enjoyed Aharen- san wa Hakarenai till this moment and it's a really relaxing and freaking wholesome anime to pick up and watch when you have some free time to spare or don't really fell so good to bring a smile on your face. :) with everybody makes this a quite enjoyable watch in my opinion.Sound and Visuals:The entire series has a calming atmosphere with little and quiet soundtrack with some good sound effects as well as a just adorable ending with Aharen dancing reminding me of Chika out of kaguya-sama.The visuals including the animation style is simplistic but well done.

This isn’t your normal run of the mill rom-com, it’s more a slice of life of two classmates, and then it gets a little romantic. Raido’s vivid imagination and Toubaru-Sensei nose bleeding just makes me smile, and I don’t know why. Maybe I’m just a sucker for deadpan humour, but this was better than some other big rom-coms this season. Yes, I’ll say it, I think it was better than Shikimori and Komi this season. Also, a comedy where the romance actually kinda gets somewhere? Who knew that was possible? This was a joy to watch throughout for sure, not because it...became more romantic in the second half, but just how consistently funny it was for me.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 17/25There’s really not a whole lot going on in each episode, since it’s pretty episodic for the most part, and there’s not a whole lot to talk about in the plot department. Glad that the characters had some development and the comedy was pretty decent throughout though.ART: 8.2/10It’s pretty basic, but it is colourful and vibrant, and fits the atmosphere welL.MUSIC: 8.7/10Big fan of both the opening and ending. TrySail and Hakoniwa Lily did a great job. The soundtrack itself isn’t too noticeable but from what I heard of it, it fit the vibe of the show well.CHARACTERS: 17.2/20This show benefits from having a good main duo, but also a bunch of very fun side characters, which not every show has. Obviously Reina and Raido are fun to watch. Reina is a very small girl who doesn’t really know social boundaries and talks very quietly, but quickly this theme became obsolete as the show progressed. Raido is someone who is also pretty deadpan and doesn’t show much emotion, but has very vivid imagination about Reina’s antics, ranging from thinking she was a killer, even making a Kill Bill reference along the way, to thinking she was a sumo wrestler when Reina ate too much and got fat. The imagination was pretty enjoyable to watch, since it was very different each time.Now, the side characters. My favourite side character has to be Toubaru-Sensei, since she’s all about esteem, and when Reina and Raido do something cute, or weird, she reacts in the form of nose bleeds, and the sub plots about her and Miyahira-Sensei being together was just honestly hilarious.And what’s a rom-com without a little side romance? Futaba and Atsushi’s little thing together was so fun to watch too, and how Atsushi regards Raido as “king” was so funny to me too.Finally, we got Reina’s siblings. They all look like her. That’s basically the gist of it.ENJOYMENT: 14.5/15Even though it’s pretty bare bones in terms of production, I still really enjoyed this show, and it gave me a lot of laughs along the way.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 17/20The comedic themes were handled great, really loved the deadpan comedy they went for, and it works. The romance themes were a bit sudden, felt like the source material, which I haven’t read, was probably slower paced in terms of romantic developments, but that’s just a guess. Overall, just very enjoyable.OVERALL: 82.6/100It’s not the prettiest out there, it’s not a “loud” or “fast-paced” show, it’s iyashikei done very well. The comedy definitely intrigued me more than the romance side of things, but all things considered, there’s not much to complain about. It’s definitely not for everyone, but it was definitely fun to watch every single week.Oh, one more thing, fidget spinners in 2022?

That, I did not expect.', '""Can you match my speed, Aharen-san?""-- the following is a brief paragraph on my overall thoughts, followed by spoilers of formula and those last few episodes. reader discretion advised. --Inoffensive fluff is what I\'d probably call Aharen Is Indecipherable. It exists and therefore it is, nothing more. It isn\'t very funny, the leads are enjoyable, it\'s formulaic, the majority of side characters are bad, etc. A show that obviously brings heavy comparison to Komi, this suffers from similar and different problems.Aharen\'s main focus is the chemistry between the two leads, the titular character and Raido. Both of them are brand new high school students and...Raido decides that this is the point in his life where he\'ll be more sociable which starts with befriending his seatmate. A friendship forms. The formula of the show is usually as follows:Aharen is attempting to do something in a way that attracts Raido\'s attention.Raido assumes the activity is something deeper than it is like she\'s an assassin or training to be a sumo wrestler or any other outlandish possibility.He discovers it\'s something fairly normal and assists her in success.The assistance consists of bizarre methods rather than the straightforward one or just a flurry of ideas. We need to make an art project, let\'s try sculpting, modeling for one another, etc. It\'s hard for us to communicate, let\'s try morse code, communicating via falcon, etc.They succeed in some way, she shows gratitude for him, end arc.It gets repetitive after multiple episodes but stays, as I said, just something slightly fun to keep you entertained for the 20 or so minutes it\'s present. There are sideplots to spice it up, but all of which I found boring and, well, unfunny. A teacher that finds their relationship so \'esteemful\' she passes out whenever they do something, a little girl who sees her as a rival for her crush, a childhood friend that has to watch from a distance, and the Aharen family being confused by Raido as Reina.Over the course of the majority of the season, it seems to be fairly standard slice of life. Yet, it takes on romance near the end. Everything beforehand seemed to just be of a friendship forming and how Aharen acted with everyone, anything romantic could usually just be dismissed as her failure to interpret distance. It goes on to be a thing of more blushing, friends and family telling Raido how she talks about him, all culminating in a confession that\'s well done visually and conceptually. A friendship can grow to be something deeper. I thought the problem would be ""where do we go for here?"" as if these antics couldn\'t continue in such a way if they were dating, but the last episode seems to reaffirm that everything will be the same with Aharen noting that her new partner is ""dense"".As I will repeat for the third time in a slightly different manner, it\'s light and easy to digest anime. Will you be laughing consistently? Nah. Will you be filled to your heart\'s content with emotion? Nah. Will you grow attached to the characters? Nah. Does it occasionally strike gold and surprise you? Yeah. Shouldn\'t be at the top of your watchlist, but not a worthless addition to the catalog. Raido decides that this is the point in his life where he\'ll be more sociable which starts with befriending his seatmate. A friendship forms. The formula of the show is usually as follows:Aharen is attempting to do something in a way that attracts Raido\'s attention.Raido assumes the activity is something deeper than it is like she\'s an assassin or training to be a sumo wrestler or any other outlandish possibility.He discovers it\'s something fairly normal and assists her in success.The assistance consists of bizarre methods rather than the straightforward one or just a flurry of ideas. We need to make an art project, let\'s try sculpting, modeling for one another, etc. It\'s hard for us to communicate, let\'s try morse code, communicating via falcon, etc.They succeed in some way, she shows gratitude for him, end arc.It gets repetitive after multiple episodes but stays, as I said, just something slightly fun to keep you entertained for the 20 or so minutes it\'s present. There are sideplots to spice it up, but all of which I found boring and, well, unfunny. A teacher that finds their relationship so \'esteemful\' she passes out whenever they do something, a little girl who sees her as a rival for her crush, a childhood friend that has to watch from a distance, and the Aharen family being confused by Raido as Reina.Over the course of the majority of the season, it seems to be fairly standard slice of life. Yet, it takes on romance near the end. Everything beforehand seemed to just be of a friendship forming and how Aharen acted with everyone, anything romantic could usually just be dismissed as her failure to interpret distance. It goes on to be a thing of more blushing, friends and family telling Raido how she talks about him, all culminating in a confession that\'s well done visually and conceptually. A friendship can grow to be something deeper. I thought the problem would be ""where do we go for here?"" as if these antics couldn\'t continue in such a way if they were dating, but the last episode seems to reaffirm that everything will be the same with Aharen noting that her new partner is ""dense"".As I will repeat for the third time in a slightly different manner, it\'s light and easy to digest anime. Will you be laughing consistently? Nah. Will you be filled to your heart\'s content with emotion? Nah. Will you grow attached to the characters? Nah. Does it occasionally strike gold and surprise you? Yeah. Shouldn\'t be at the top of your watchlist, but not a worthless addition to the catalog.', ""Kinda comedy that slowly transforms into romance/comedy. First episode is lame and almost made me drop this anime but I am really glad that I made through it. Whole thing of socially non-functioning Reina is a hard sell because of how bad it is first pictured, but it doesn't lasts and after couple episodes this theme is almost forgotten. When you get into the story, it flows pretty good - simple and enjoyable. But structure of generic gags doesn't really change throughout series so it can become stale and bothersome at the end.Story does have school setting which could be a minus, as it is...highly overused, but thankfully it is kept to a minimum of plot importance. Generally story revolves around pair and does not put much into highschool stuff so it is kinda ok.There is strong Kanna-san vibes from Reina (which is nice?). highly overused, but thankfully it is kept to a minimum of plot importance.

No spoilers this is all so wholesome.I haven't kicked my feet giddy like a teen girl in a while but this did it. No spoilers"", ""TLDR: it’s good. uniquely generic. comfy show. do recommend. scroll down for summary of scores.A rom-com where the main characters just completely ignore the “rom” part (for the first half at least) and simply have as much fun as they can? Count me in.Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is perhaps the most uniquely cliché anime you will ever see, so much so that I chose it to be the subject of my very first review.There are two very common tropes when it comes to the female rom-com protagonist: overly expressive clingy tsundere and overly introverted dandere. Somehow, Aharen-san, our main girl, manages to be both and neither...at once. Basically, she was once the clingy type but then people stayed away from her because she didn’t understand personal boundaries, leading her to be the quiet introvert in the corner of the room (literally; she sits on the leftmost seat at the last row) so that people don’t start hating her again…Until Raidou-kun comes in.Raidou, our main boi, is desperate to make friends in high school because his intimidating, stoic demeanor drove people away during middle school. Luckily(?), his seatmate is just as unapproachable.As they say, opposites attract, and we can clearly see it in this anime. People disliked Raidou-kun because he looks hostile and unapproachable, while people disliked Aharen-san because she gets too chummy and close. When these two seemingly boring personalities are seated beside each other, they suddenly become one of the most interestingly weird duos you’ve ever seen. Raidou doesn’t care about her clinginess and Aharen doesn’t care about his unemotional appearance (because that’s how she looks, too).With more chemistry than the periodic table, Raidou-kun tries his best to understand Aharen-san, comes up with ludicrous theories along the way, and tries to solve her problems with the most bizarre solutions, while Aharen just nonchalantly puts up with his absurdity. Despite their very unexpressive faces, you just know that they have fun with all the weird shit they do. Not a single awkward moment is shared between these two, they’re just so close like they’ve known each other for decades, which is a breath of fresh air when it comes to rom-coms.She’s exactly what he needed: a friend that is not afraid to approach him and hang out with him. He’s exactly what she needed: a friend that doesn’t mind her clinginess and instead helps her with her social problems. It can’t get more perfect than this.-------------Story - 7The story is not amazing. There is no substantial, cohesive plot apart from ‘main character tries to help out unsocial girl.’ It’s more like short stories contained within individual episodes. Although there is a lack of ‘plot’ per se, the stories that are being told in each episode are interesting enough to make you stay.Art - 9Great art style and character design, smooth animation. Basically just standard slice of life art. You can’t really go wrong with that.Sound - 9Expressive voice acting, sound effects are on point, and the soundtrack is nothing special but pretty good. Again, just standard slice of life. You can’t really go wrong with that.Character - 8Raidou-kun and Aharen-san carry the show, as they should. I just hoped the side characters were more interesting, but they’re really not too important because they just enhance the story-telling of Raidou and Aharen’s shenanigans.Enjoyment - 9A good show to watch if you’re bored and just want some wholesomeness. The nature of the main characters make this anime's comedy quite unique. They don't depend on the usual anime gags that involve excessive screaming and borderline physical abuse. But it may still be unfunny for edgelords who just can’t laugh at anything but multilayered jokes that require superior intellect about ancient history or sum shit like that, but their cuteness will compensate. Oh wait, edgy people hate cuteness too. Just watch it if you like cute stuff. It’s definitely underappreciated.Overall - 8.4This series is far from being the best, but it will most certainly go down as one of my favorites. Even though I’ve only seen a third of the episodes so far, I don’t see any way this anime could mess up. I believe my rating wouldn’t change much as I watch more episodes.

But before I take the time to talk absolute garbage about the anime, let’s take the time to encapsulate what the whole series is like.Warning: Spoilers ahead.So, it’s a tale about a dull high-school man named Raido, who struggles to express his emotions because of how expressionless his face is and just sticks with his stone impression for everyone he meets, whether it be his sister, classmates or even random strangers. It unsurprisingly changes...like in every high-school slice of life ever when he meets a strange girl named Aharen who also wanted to be his friend, though as the title says, she can’t seem to decipher how to approach someone. Now the word indecipherable defined by the first episode shows Aharen, seemingly coming in too close to someone’s face, can’t seem to speak loud enough for the other person to hear, and has no way of knowing boundaries other than being told enough. What’s amusing is that moments of Aharen being indecipherable doesn’t happen anywhere after the first few episodes and just decided to show cutscenes of Aharen and Raido hanging out together.First of all, the story weaves around Raido unconsciously knowing more about Aharen as time flew by, closely sharing lunches together, playing board games or even chilling by the bench at the park, gazing at the sunset. In other words, it’s just compilations of them hanging out together in an episodic formula. For the comedy, can be amusing at times but most often for me, it was unfunny at best. It recycles the same jokes over and over. For example, Raido lets his mind go crazy about the weirdest things that Aharen would do only to have it all crumble after Aharen just cleared up the misunderstanding a minute after Raido’s ludicrous misunderstanding. It even brought back dead trends like the stupid fidget spinner which I would never expect in a million years to see in a 2022 anime.Now, the characters, are not exactly the kind of vibrant and fun characters that any slice of life authors would try to replicate in any of their works, they’re quite… bizarre. Like our main couple, the side characters don’t hold back in terms of how creepy their actions can get. Ooshiro, the supposed stalker who watches them at everything they do, Toubaru, the sensei renowned for getting subsequential nosebleeds to the point of fainting in class, or Futaba, who jealously follows her crush because she thinks Aharen is her love rival.The main duo don’t go too far in terms of… weirdness, but I would say they were refreshing to watch. No screaming, no physical harassment from the heroine, no mean insults from one another, it’s just them being socially awkward people finding each other and having fun in their own way. Every character in this anime is just way too weird and simple to follow, but having a normal love relationship like this for once was a nice surprise this anime pulled.As for the art, it looks all fine, there are times when it does fall off in terms of production quality, especially the times they use CGI though. But the minimalistic character design grew on me the longer the show went on. Despite that, I would think that the studio served a well-done job to adapt Aharen-san and enough it did.The music is good though I would say that the opening and ending are alright when I listened to them the first time, it fits the tone of the show, being calm and soothing but I have to say the best part of it was when you hear the recorder. The tune you would listen to when there is something peculiar happening in the everyday life of the main duo, sounds childish yet so addicting to listen to, I wouldn’t mind listening to this almost every day.In terms of enjoyability, Aharen-san does an alright job to entertain me, not good enough to keep me at the edge of my seat, and not bad enough to make me pause at every moment that is happening due to second-hand embarrassment. If you’re the guy who just wants a wholesome anime that doesn’t make you want to rage or basically avoid melodrama, then you’re in luck with this one. The standard slice of life anime with its culture festival, walking together and looking out the window of your classroom except there are no toxic moments. So have fun with this series.In the end, it’s a fine anime, one thing I can assure you is that this is definitely a show you won’t regret watching. like in every high-school slice of life ever when he meets a strange girl named Aharen who also wanted to be his friend, though as the title says, she can’t seem to decipher how to approach someone.

First time making an anime review, so please forgive me if I write badly.To me, if an anime series can make me feel something, be it happiness, sadness, or even anger, it will have become the greatest anime I have seen in my life. While Aharen-san wa Hakarenai doesn\'t have quite the same emotional impact as does other anime I\'ve watched, this series was still a gem that I never thought I would come to appreciate until the last episode.Honestly, the...plot wasn\'t anything to be flaunted and proud of. In fact, I kept drawing parallels between Komi can\'t communicate and this series throughout the entire 12 episodes. However, what this series does, it does a lot better than Komi can\'t communicate. For Komi, the 12 episodes was a bit rushed; the writers added ""friends"" at the last moment for her to make, and the ending just...felt incomplete. While I respect the fact that there may be another season, Komi can\'t communicate did not hit me with the same oomph that Aharen-san wa Hakarenai did.For the characters, I could draw parallels between them as well. Shoko Komi and Aharen Reina both have quite a bit of stuff in common, notably their inability to communicate properly, while Raido in my opinion is a mix from both Hitohito Tadano from Komi can\'t communicate and Nishiikata from Teasing-master takagi san. But, even though I can draw parallels, it didn\'t change the fact that both characters formed the soul of this entire series; I watched the series all the way because of a willingness to continue seeing ""What funny, stupid crap Raido\'s Come Up with This time"", and the romantic part of this series was executed perfectly by Aharen Reina: what she lacks in quantity, she makes up for it twofold in quality. A look, a gesture, an expression; the romantic part of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai was well thought out, well fleshed out, and most importantly, not rushed. This series embodied the essence of rom-com animes; a solid base of laughs and snorts with subtle, loving toppings on top.The only sticking point about this anime is the side characters; while I understand Oshiro\'s place in the anime (in fact, she plays an integral part in the climax and ending), the others aren\'t so clear. In my opinion, the side characters are supposed to compliment the two main characters in the series, not draw attention away from them by getting together and flirting themselves. Of course, this has the happy side effect of the bandwagon; THESE side characters ARE GETTING TOGETHER, WHAT THE FRICK ARE YOU GUYS DOING!Overall, I went into this anime unsure and confused, and I stood there silent for a solid 10 seconds after the ending credits played. I didn\'t cover the music because honestly, its subpar, but the roundness and liveliness of Raido and Reina, as well as the gags, laughs, and romantic gestures sprinkled throughout the anime makes up for it.Review: 9/10 (I\'m still waiting for that perfect anime; however, this does come close to it) plot wasn\'t anything to be flaunted and proud of. In fact, I kept drawing parallels between Komi can\'t communicate and this series throughout the entire 12 episodes. However, what this series does, it does a lot better than Komi can\'t communicate. For Komi, the 12 episodes was a bit rushed; the writers added ""friends"" at the last moment for her to make, and the ending just...felt incomplete. While I respect the fact that there may be another season, Komi can\'t communicate did not hit me with the same oomph that Aharen-san wa Hakarenai did.For the characters, I could draw parallels between them as well. Shoko Komi and Aharen Reina both have quite a bit of stuff in common, notably their inability to communicate properly, while Raido in my opinion is a mix from both Hitohito Tadano from Komi can\'t communicate and Nishiikata from Teasing-master takagi san. But, even though I can draw parallels, it didn\'t change the fact that both characters formed the soul of this entire series; I watched the series all the way because of a willingness to continue seeing ""What funny, stupid crap Raido\'s Come Up with This time"", and the romantic part of this series was executed perfectly by Aharen Reina: what she lacks in quantity, she makes up for it twofold in quality. A look, a gesture, an expression; the romantic part of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai was well thought out, well fleshed out, and most importantly, not rushed. This series embodied the essence of rom-com animes; a solid base of laughs and snorts with subtle, loving toppings on top.The only sticking point about this anime is the side characters; while I understand Oshiro\'s place in the anime (in fact, she plays an integral part in the climax and ending), the others aren\'t so clear.

I wasn't expecting a whole lot from it, but it's been a pleasant surprise so far.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Story and Characters: 7/10(I'm putting these in the same category because the only story is the progression of the two main characters' friendship)The one word I would use to describe the characters is 'goofy'. Usually when I use that word, it's used in a negative way, but it isn't in this case....I mean it in the best way I can. They're goofy, and they do goofy things.Raido, the main male character is an early high-schooler, so he's presumably around 15 years old, but man, he does not look the part. He's probably about 6'10, and looks like a 30 year old business man. He acts and looks like he's about a decade older than everyone around him. The main female character, Aharen is the exact opposite of him. She's the same age as him (I assume, at least), but she looks like an 8 year old, and she can't speak beyond a quiet whisper. It's a pretty interesting dynamic between the two of them.Most of the time (at least at the time of writing this), the story is simply Raido trying to find new ways to successfully communicate with Aharen, which causes wacky shenanigans to ensue. In the most recent episode, Aharen buys a rap CD at a music store, inspiring her to freestyle to Raido the next day (why she has the confidence to freestyle rap, but not talk a little bit louder isn't exactly clear lol). This causes Raido to practice rapping overnight, and they spend the entire next day conversing solely through freestyles.That's basically what every episode is like. It's silly. It's goofy. But it's good.Sound: 7/10The voice-acting does what it needs to. I can't really say whether it's good or bad, since you never really hear any of the main characters show even a shred of emotion lmao. The voice actors do fit the characters and their roles quite well though, I must say.Art: 8/10I like the art style a lot. It's not anything crazy, but it's cute. You can pretty much tell exactly what the show is going to be like just from looking at the promotional images, which says a lot.The animation is pretty solid too. I've never watched anything else from this studio, but they did a good job here. The show I would most compare the animation in Aharen-san to is Love is War, just because of how they handle the comedic scenes, if that helps to give you a bit of a visual.Enjoyment: 8/10Something about this show just clicked with me, and I enjoy every second of it. It's not the best show ever made, or even the best of the season, but it really is a joy to watch. I find myself looking forward to new episodes of this even more than some of the bigger shows of the season, which is a a big compliment coming from someone like me who generally sticks to more mainstream animes. The characters are fun, the skits are fun, and the animation is fun. Fun is the perfect word to describe this show as a whole, really.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm writing this review just 4 episodes in, so it might be a little pre-mature. The quality of those 4 episodes has been fairly consistent so far though, so I think it's probably fine.Aharen-san is wholesome, cute, and pretty hilarious sometimes. I don't think there's much more you could ask for from a slice-of-life comedy. It doesn't take itself seriously, and is just pure fun for 20+ minutes straight every episode. That's something I can respect.I'll probably update this review after the show finishes airing, but this is all for now.First 4 episodes: 7/10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update after episode 12:Everything I said in my original review still stands true; the show is funny and the dynamic between Aharen and Raido was so entertaining to watch throughout the whole series. There were no bad episodes, and it just continued to get better every single week.It's not a perfect show though, and I do have some small issues. The cast outside of Raido and Aharen is pretty awful. I can't remember a single side character's name, much less anything about them, yet they treat them like they're well developed, fleshed out characters. Half of the last episode was dedicated to giving a backstory to one of these characters, which I felt was a bit of a strange decision. The weak cast can be forgiven though, since the majority of the show is just about Aharen and Raido's relationship, like I said towards the beginning of the review.When the show first began, I was really hoping that they wouldn't take the show in the romantic direction that it looked like they were going to, but in hindsight, I'm glad they did. The last few episodes were really good, significantly better than anything I could've expected when going into this show.The last thing I want to say in this review is that I hope this show gets a season 2, because it really deserves one. This is one of those shows that I'm pretty much purely rating off of enjoyment (which I tend not to do very often). From a quality perspective, obviously it's not better than a lot of shows that I have at a 7 (One Punch Man, AOT, etc.), but I just loved watching this show, so I think that has to count for something.Overall: 8/10 I mean it in the best way I can.

Imagine the directing of jokes from the most funny show you’ve seen. Now degenerate the main character’s thought process into ludicrous absurdity, and sprinkle in bits of caring affection. Bam, I present you, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai.The art style is simple yet minimalistically attractive, and the cgi was not too intrusive - only having a few bits in the background. We’ve all seen the high school setting a hundred times, and we will continue to see them a hundred times, but this show stands out in that despite the premise of the female mc being physically close enough to the male mc - enough...to make Issei blow a vessel in his nose - there are only wholesome and innocent vibes.There’s no time wasting in romance, as there’s a heavier focus on unpredictable, crazy comedy. Of which the two deadpan mc’s only help accentuate when they’re doing or thinking something maddening. This show genuinely made me laugh out loud, and the soundtrack boosted this experience by at least 3 times. I can only describe it as comedically mind-degenerating or melting in mental chaos, namely the atypical melody played by an out of tune flute(?). And do expect a slight charge of pace around halfway through the show, no spoilers but it will develop in a decently unexpected way from its origin. Overall a ball of ridiculous fun and a heartwarming experience. to make Issei blow a vessel in his nose - there are only wholesome and innocent vibes.There’s no time wasting in romance, as there’s a heavier focus on unpredictable, crazy comedy.

Each episode was like a few mini stories so the episode wasn't all about one thing, they usually did different activities and it reminded me of a short like 3 to 5 panel manga where the story is short and sweet but this anime didn't break the episode into separate parts it was more cohesive and one situation usually led to the next.Art:...7.5/10 - the art and animation were good, it really wasn't to flashy but more stylized to be more subtle. It took place mostly at school in the classroom but when they did venture out the different backgrounds were well done and helped bring life to each episode.Sound: 7/10 - the sound was good, I enjoyed the OP & ED, they are very upbeat and it was one of the few I didn't skip past most of the time. The SFX was also very good, in my opinion SFX and source music (background music) can really help an anime and bring texture and emotions to even the most basic of scenes in anime. It also helps hammer in the point of dialogue certain characters may have.Characters: 8/10 - the characters were great, the female MC and the male MC were the best part and the students and teachers really helped in making it more enjoyable. I especially liked Reina's little brother and sister and their teacher Ms. Tobaru was really funny, also little Futaba was pretty funny with her rivalry. All the characters were well designed and the voice acting was really good, I watched the original with English subtitles and I will check the English dubbed one soon and I will update the review when I finish.Enjoyment: 8/10 - I enjoyed this anime a lot, it was really funny and had a few cute romantic moments in it. At first it was a bit different but once I got to know the characters in the first few episodes, it got better and by the end I was hoping a second season will be greenlit.Overall: 7.5/10 - I really liked watching this anime and will watch it again sometime. I would recommend this anime for people who have a decent sense of humor and that enjoy cute comedy anime with a few awkward moments thrown in. It's definitely worth watching once, and if you only watch it once then watch the original with English subtitles because in my opinion most of the original with English subtitles are superior to the English dubbed. 7.5/10 - the art and animation were good, it really wasn't to flashy but more stylized to be more subtle.

Although not as popular as Kaguya and Komi, Aharen is for sure funny in its own unique way.I still remembered how much I laughed watching the first episode. The situations where Raidou tried to comprehend Aharen was exaggerated in such dorky ways that got me cracked up. There was so much fun with such weird humor.The subsequent episodes were more of less the same, but I still enjoyed them because I realized that I loved the bizarre humor of this show. It did get a bit old though. I don’t think...a newbie to romcom would laugh that much watching Aharen. So it depends on how much you can tolerate humor.The romance aspect was unexpectedly good. It wasn’t focused on as much until near the very end. Similar to the humor, the romance is not usual like other anime. It was both subtle and direct. This is mostly because of the odd dynamic between the two main characters. My critic here is that I would like one or 2 more episodes to build the romance further. It’s adorable nonetheless tho.The side characters is another dorky aspect of the show. Each has their own quirks. Although not all of them cracked me up, I was still amused at how weird they are.Overall, the show is just as incomprehensible as Aharen, but I loved it. 8-8.5/10 a newbie to romcom would laugh that much watching Aharen.

It does have some romantic elements, yes, but all in all, it is a pure comedy. Where do I even begin with this series? It\'s one of the best comedies out there, right next to Kaguya-sama in terms of comedy. But instead of milking the misunderstandings between lovestruck teenagers for content (which is amazing in its own right), it milks the collective imaginations of our main protagonists: Raidou and Aharen.Story (6):There\'s not much in the way of story. Just 2 colourful characters with an equally colourful side cast. Then again, as a pure comedy, it doesn\'t really need a...story.Art (9):Not gonna lie, this anime actually looks really good. The character designs are good and I really like the colour pallette. A pure comedy SOL anime didn\'t need to go this far, but like Nichijou, it definitely uses its medium to the fullest.Sound (10):As a musician, I absolutely adored the soundtrack. Sure, it doesn\'t have that unbridled hype or emotion shown in the big shonen anime out there or Mushoku Tensei, but the soundtrack in this anime does its job perfectly. It enhances the comedy, sets the tone, and overall sounds really nice. Also the OP and ED are bangers go listen.Character (10):When you begin the anime, you think that Raidou\'s going to be the docile, constantly blushing ""ordinary guy/straight man"" and that Aharen\'s going to be an overly clingy kuudere and ""the eccentric one"", right? Well, if you thought so, you\'d be dead wrong. The way that these characters\' deadpan personalities bounce off of each other and result in comedy is just absolutely magnificent. What\'s more is that because both characters are so quiet (thank god, anime\'s needed more of that recently) and there\'s no fanservice, the show actually needs to rely on real gags and real humour rather than just screaming or boob gags. The way that Raidou\'s unshakable delusions skyrocket Aharen\'s relatively normal interests into massive undertakings is just the greatest and never ceases to amuse me. What\'s more is that Aharen enjoys these experiences enough to just go with Raidou\'s delusions, and both of them have genuine chemistry and enjoy their time together.Enjoyment (10):As a pure comedy, I can only think of a few anime that reach this show\'s level of comedy. In fact, this might even top Nichijou levels of comedy its so good. All in all, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai had me rolling on the floor with laughter, loving the art choices, and listening to the music on repeat. This is one of the few anime which doesn\'t change the story or events of the source material yet elevates it so much that I can\'t wait for each Friday to come as quickly as possible. Aharen-san expertly uses its medium to elevate its source material and I couldn\'t be happier while watching this anime. 10/10, would recommend to anyone who would listen as long as you don\'t really care about the general lack of a plot. story.Art (9):Not gonna lie, this anime actually looks really good.

After a certain something happens in episode 9, they really drag out revealing what actually went on, but it was all worth it in the last episode as it was so sweet, plus we get hints of them setting up a next season in the end as they move into the second year of high school. This was just really sweet and it was nice to switch off to - it was primarily kind of episodic and just a series of gags, but it didn't require too much brain power and the characters were endearing...which made it perfect for me. I think I would have liked it even if it didn't have a romantic twist at the end, but that was definitely nice twist. which made it perfect for me.

The gems available are having some cute and funny scenes which they are fine.You can see I give this a 5 because again, its fine it’s pretty much almost the same as other anime released previously.

YEAH THEY\'RE CUTE TOO GODDAMN, this show has a huge amount of cuteness.The songs used in the anime are pretty basic and the same for every episode.CHARACTER: 6I won\'t talk about the support characters because I have nothing to say, so I\'ll just talk about the two mains.Both Reina and Raidou have no facial expressions, they\'re the same for the ENTIRE FRICKING SHOW!At first this is kinda funny, especially Raidou, but after some episodes it gets really repetitive and boring.There isn\'t an actual development in their personalities, they stay the same all the time.ENJOYMENT: 6Unfortunately I didn\'t really enjoy this show, even if the last episodes were slightly better than the first ones.There\'s comedy but most of the time it isn\'t funny, especially because of those cardboard faces and 2017/18 jokes like the fidget spinner.Also, we probably won\'t get a season 2 because the ""thing"" already happened so... yeah, I honestly didn\'t expect that to happen so soon.So, if you are a fan of Rom-Com Anime and slice of life you should check it out, but if you\'re here just for the romance... I don\'t know what to say, they\'re cute together but those faces kinda ruined the show for me. is good, the backgrounds are pretty much the same almost every episode but they\'re done well.The animations are also nice and the style is kinda cute.SOUND: 7The OP and the ED are good...

Iyashikei or wholesome anime isn\'t the rarest genre but it\'s fairly uncommon and it\'s mixed with a kind of... weird dry humor style. Speaking of weird, usually when you think of weird characters in anime they\'re usually from bombastic, over the top comedy anime. In Aharen though? Most of the main characters are certainly quirky, a few characters even comment so but since it\'s still a relatively down to earth slice of life it feels like they got as quirky as \'normal\' school kids could be.And you...know what? That\'s what made it great. Raidou and Aharen, the two main characters, are certainly a quirky duo. Raidou is a nice guy but also has quite the imagination and can be a bit dense. Reina Aharen has 0 sense of distance, and could easily be mistaken as bein on the spectrum. But she\'s also a good nice quiet person, and is doing in what her eyes is a way of being useful and making friends.Most of the anime revolves around the two of them and their quirky interactions. There does tend to be a kinda expected conversation flow between them. Either Aharen gets too close and Raidou comments on it. Aharen is doing something, Raidou is imagining her doing something super crazy, but it turns out Aharen is just doing normal things. The humor style around that CAN be a bit predictable but it can be pretty funny. Thankfully there is a decent handful of side characters as well, who provide their own comedy when needed to break up the flow.As mentioned in the first paragraph, this is still a iyashikei or wholesome slice of life anime. This aspect of the anime, in my opinion, is easily the best parts, and what make the show for me. Since Aharen is a relatively quiet and kinda strange person, she doesn\'t exactly  have a lot of friends. Thankfully Raidou is not only nice to her but partakes in actively hangs out with her. Any moment where the two do something nice for each other, or Aharen makes a comment or face showing how much Raidou means to her are easily my favorite moments in the whole show. This show is worth watching for these alone, though the comedy is still decent otherwise.This anime SHOULD be a much watch for wholesome slice of life fans. Sadly based on in its MAL average score I\'ve determined many people consider this ""mid"" and therefore have bad taste, considering other slice of life shows that are either higher rated, more highly watched, or both. know what?

You're telling me, that these two end up romantically involved when there is no fucking build up whatsoever to their relationship? The scene where Aharen kisses Raidou and ends up crying in the sleeping bag. How better would this scene be if it was actually a fucking rejection instead of a confession on the part of Raido? After the rejection, they could start building up their relationship from scratch or start developing feelings for one another after they start becoming more conscious of one another. But no,...this anime goes for the most ridiculous copout I've seen ever since fucking Charlotte. Like, what the fuck do you mean that Raido likes Aharen? There was absolutely nothing to elude to that fact during the entire fucking runtime of the anime. Neither does he change when they start dating either. So there was absolutely zero fucking point or reasoning for there to be romance involved. You could just have them do comedy hijinks together as friends and gradually start to develop their relationship from there.Speaking of the comedy, let's also talk about that. I have never laughed at any of the fucking jokes presented in this anime. Raido's delusions are absolutely fucking pointless and made me want to bash my head into my table every, single, time. And these delusions take up a significant amount of the anime when there is zero fucking reason to have them in there. They aren't funny, neither are they in character for Raido since we're introduced to Raido as this sullen but persistent dude. Not this delusional fucking idiot that we're forced into as this anime trudges on.And the side characters, god the fucking side characters. They're so absolutely pointless to the story and honestly are more of a hinderance than anything. Oshiro makes absolutely no fucking sense. We're introduced to her as Aharen's childhood friend that can't approach her anymore due to the fact that Raido is present. Yet she acts the same exact way towards Aharen even when they're alone. Like, what? What the fuck do you mean she can't approach Aharen when she's alone? THEY'RE FUCKING CHILDHOOD FRIENDS THAT HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WE CAN SEE THIS FROM THE FLASHBACK THAT OSHIRO HAS BACK DURING THE LAST EPISODE. God, it's so fucking stupid and pisses me off so much. Oshiro takes up so much time for no reason, just like Raido's delusions.Imagine for one second, that the side characters and Raido's delusions didn't exist and they instead focused on the comedy centered around Aharen's antics of not being able to gauge the distance of their relationship. And while they get used to each other, Aharen gradually starts to realize that what she does is fine as Raido wouldn't abandon her or judge her for her actions and thus from there maybe we can have Aharen start to develop a crush towards Raido. With Aharen becoming more conscious of Raido and thus not being able to do the same things she did in the past such as clinging onto Raido, with Raido noticing this and thus also becoming conscious of the fact that maybe he liked the fact that Aharen was so close to him and thus we can maybe establish a mutual attraction towards the two characters that wouldn't be unusual if one or the other confessed to the other with it developing into a relationship. But no, we're forced into the shit that the anime gave us and it pisses me off because I can see how this anime could've been fine.Another issue that I have with this anime is the art and the music. The art is so fucking inconsistent concerning the background characters that it's not even funny. Like in some scenes the background characters look like those shitty 3D animations you see in the Berserk series or in Overlord and it's honestly so jarring to notice because of how well animated Aharen herself is. Not to mention the scenery. Who the fuck did the background for this anime? The art for the characters in the first half or so of the anime seem off in comparison to the background and I can't help but notice it. The background is just way too different in comparison to them and it's just so weird. For some reason, they start improving the art for the side characters and the main characters in the second half of it where the background seems to blend in better with them and it feels like they're trying to fucking trick me into thinking that this was always the case.Now the sound. The opening and ending music for this anime is good, I have no complaints. Hell, it's even tailored towards this specific anime which is a shame considering that this anime is shit. The soundtrack for this anime on the other hand is so fucking weird. In the first half of it, the soundtrack seems out of place and doesn't match the tone of the situation. Like, I genuinely believe that if they removed the soundtrack entirely from this anime it would've improved the viewing experience. Which is fucking weird to even consider. In the later half of the anime, they gradually start to notice their fuck up and implement music that matches the tone of the situation better but there are still scenes where you wish the music was just removed entirely still.Overall, I hated watching this. It was honestly a slog to get through. I literally started to make noises reminiscent of a tortured seagull in order to try and entertain myself in the midst of watching. I don't recommend watching this anime. Aharen is cute yeah, but that's it. This anime has nothing to offer you. If you want something cute or has a premise that reminds you of Aharen, go watch Kobayashi Dragon Maid or Komi San. this anime goes for the most ridiculous copout I've seen ever since fucking Charlotte.

It surrounds Aharen, who doesn't have a grasp on personal space due to her soft voice and depth perception issues, and Raido, who wants to helps but has one heck of a dramatic imagination. The basic premise is that they go about their day together and Aharen does things and Raido imagines some crazy theory based on what she did only to be debunked immediately. The status quo is maintained because they both have unbelievable poker faces, so Raido's inner musings are not made known.Honestly I dropped the anime at first because there is not much going on...and my attention span couldn't handle it. Coming back to it about a year later, I put it on while I cleaned my house. Having it on in the background was nice. And then a little past halfway, there is actual character development that made it all worth coming back to it.So, I am glad I watched it. It is the slowest of burns, so I recommend it for a chill watch. Maybe when you are too tired to think about complex plots and action, or when you are doing something else at the same time. and my attention span couldn't handle it.

We look forward to seeing what kind of characters Aharen's younger sisters will become in the future, including Aharen's younger brother, who, unlike Reina, is very expressive and adorable. The friend who watches over the taller Aharen is a bit annoying, but you will soon get used to it.

Just by watching the first episode you're basically exposed to what you'll see for the remainder of the show. It has some light humor with some cutesy art and some very basic characters and is overall a pretty mediocre show I'd say. After watching the first episode I was a bit hesitant whether the show was worth watching or not, but after giving it a chance I found it to be a very relaxing and enjoyable show altogether.The show isn't really anything unique, it's pretty much just another cute school rom-com anime. Depending if you like the humor and...the character's it could be a hit or miss. I personally really liked Raido with his bizarre imaginations and catchphrase he would always use. Other than my own liking for this specific character I wouldn't say the show is anything special. It's an ok show and I had fun watching it.For me a rating of 5 means average/mediocre, so I'm gonna give this show a 6.

Besides, many characters in this show have only one job in the show, and that's to observe and talk about the main characters.The show has a teacher who nosebleeds a lot from romanticizing the MCs, so it's somewhat entertaining, but there is also Friend A and B who are just there to talk about Raido and Aharen-san; the show implies they have a thing going on, but that's it. It's good to have more screen...time with the main characters, but sometimes it just gets ridiculous.The op and ed are forgettable, especially the soundtrack.

Raido is a large and imposing boy who often comes off as stand-offish, so he doesn't develop many relationships. These two high schoolers go from uncertain of each other to joined at the hip, and this series actually develops its romances rather quickly, though its side characters range from forgettable to frustrating.In all, it’s a cute production with decent art and a sweet relationship at its heart. Unfortunately, it’s milquetoast. The central joke runs its course early, becoming rote rapidly, and while the series does have a good deal of heart...by the end, most of the characters are too underdeveloped or one-note to care about beyond the central pair. The titular Aharen is adorable and I like her characterization, but Raido just seems dense most of the time with a couple of moments where he shines.

As he begins school, he befriends class/seatmate Reina Aharen, an extremely soft spoken and shy girl who does not know the meaning of personal space. When Raidou picks up an eraser that Aharen drops, she...decides that they are now best friends and the story begins from there.Honestly, the first few episodes are extremely cute as Raidou attempts to figure out how to converse with such a quiet person. Simply watching him put in the effort to try and communicate with his adorable seatmate is enough to warm your heart. From there on, it is a typical Slice-of-Life/Comedy of the duo doing everything together, to the point where it feels odd to see one of them on screen without the other.One of the cutest things of the series, is Raidou collectively gaining an army of plushes to watch over him as he sleeps since Aharen is dangerously good at crane games.Beyond this, the series is nothing too complicated, the two just go throughout their normal lives as close to one another as possible, and their friendship blossoms into one that is really inseparable while managing to be humorous and wholesome at the same time. Aharen might honestly be one of the cutest main characters of a series, and reminds me very heavily of Kanna from Miss Kobayashi.

However it doesn\'t feel as engaging and the novelty of it wear off after 2-3 eps. Love is war is great because the voice acting, the narrator, the simple scenarios going over the top, and the amount of characters with their own unique personality. Komi is great because the side characters are over the top and that enhances the silent komi, then we get the normal reaction through tadano. The main 2in aharen-san barely interact with anybody else even when they do weird shit in class...and nobody seems to react to them ever so it feels out of place. Throughout the first 5 eps we\'ve met 4 characters iirc. The only 2 we meet (outside of the 2 MCs) is an extremely timid girl ""watching over"" aharen and she is kinda funny at times but her personality never changed once so she doesn\'t add much. And a teacher who is obsessed with love and is the ONLY person to react to the weird shit the 2 MCs do in class but never actually talks to them and it\'s just internal dialogue. So we basically have 2 MCs who have basically the same personality and are both extremely monotone  and 2 side characters who have prob 30 minutes combined of screentime throughout 5 eps.TLDR: Show is like komi and love is war but without the parts that make those 2 shows funny and nobody seems to react to them ever so it feels out of place.

The show tells the story of how their relationship slowly develops as Aharen learns to open up and be more comfortable around people with the help of Raido.Sound familiar? Yeah, it's basically Komi-san Can't Communicate, but somehow it still feels original enough and is definitely entertaining in its own way. Despite its similarities to Komi-san, Aharen-san is able to set itself apart with its general style and overall vibe.STORY - 9/10Aharen-san is a pretty traditional romcom/slice of life. Its main plot is centered around its characters...and their relationships with each other. However, what I really liked about the story of Aharen-san is the pacing with its introduction of new characters. While Raido and Aharen are always the main focus of each episode, supporting characters are constantly sprinkled in and introduced to keep each episode fresh and something to look forward to. From Oshiro's sneaky and Solid Snake-esque hiding techniques to Sensei's spontaneous nosebleeds to the touching story of Aharen's siblings to young Atsushi and Futaba's odd relationships with Aharen, they always bring some new and fun aspect to the dynamic of the show.Also of note is how entertaining Raido's over analyzation of scenarios can be. It leads to Kaguya-sama-esque animations and situations that are fun and genuinely funny.ART/SOUND - 8/10The art has a distinct light and bubbly tone over all their characters which I quite like as it really fits the general theme and vibe of the whole show. It complements perfectly the wholesome nature and the heartwarming relationships throughout each episode. However, I feel that there are frames and moments that seem to lack detail over others. Almost low-poly like. I guess it may be part of the art style, but it is just something I had to take note of.CHARACTERS - 9/10As already mentioned earlier, I really like the characters in this show. From Raido's dense nature and tendency to overthink situatons in his head to the contrast of Aharen's sweet, quiet, yet fierce and competitive attitude, they form an entertaining duo. As mentioned, the side characters are superb and is able to keep the show fresh.ENJOYMENT - 8/10I quite enjoyed this show and would be among one of the first that I would watch each week simply for its wholesome and relaxing vibe. There are a few moments where it may feel a bit draggy and stale, but these are very few and far between. Generally, each mini-arc is entertaining and often ends with a heartwarming conclusion.OVERALL - 8/10Aharen-san is a very solid 8 out of 10. While the comparisons to Komi-san cannot be avoided due to the similarity of the 2 female leads, make no mistake that this show is able to clearly set itself apart. While not superior to Komi-san, it doesn't try to be Komi-san in any way, shape, or form and is able to carve itself into a fun and wholesome watch. It provides wonderfully wholesome and heartwarming moments as well as genuine comedic scenes that will surely have u grinning.I also almost forgot to mention that I love how it was able to pace itself and conclusively wrap up a coherent story in 1 season. No loose ends but with some snippets of what may come in the future to get viewers excited and even look to reading the manga. and their relationships with each other. However, what I really liked about the story of Aharen-san is the pacing with its introduction of new characters. While Raido and Aharen are always the main focus of each episode, supporting characters are constantly sprinkled in and introduced to keep each episode fresh and something to look forward to. From Oshiro's sneaky and Solid Snake-esque hiding techniques to Sensei's spontaneous nosebleeds to the touching story of Aharen's siblings to young Atsushi and Futaba's odd relationships with Aharen, they always bring some new and fun aspect to the dynamic of the show.Also of note is how entertaining Raido's over analyzation of scenarios can be. It leads to Kaguya-sama-esque animations and situations that are fun and genuinely funny.ART/SOUND - 8/10The art has a distinct light and bubbly tone over all their characters which I quite like as it really fits the general theme and vibe of the whole show. It complements perfectly the wholesome nature and the heartwarming relationships throughout each episode. However, I feel that there are frames and moments that seem to lack detail over others. Almost low-poly like. I guess it may be part of the art style, but it is just something I had to take note of.CHARACTERS - 9/10As already mentioned earlier, I really like the characters in this show. From Raido's dense nature and tendency to overthink situatons in his head to the contrast of Aharen's sweet, quiet, yet fierce and competitive attitude, they form an entertaining duo. As mentioned, the side characters are superb and is able to keep the show fresh.ENJOYMENT - 8/10I quite enjoyed this show and would be among one of the first that I would watch each week simply for its wholesome and relaxing vibe.

Thanks to the character art and animation the character has come out to be very heartwarming and adorable.Also the male MC Raidou-kun although very bland has a different vibe to him as he continues his interaction with Aharen-san...and we eventually see there's more to the character than just plain blandness.Adding the side character Mitsuki also adds to the story development quite a bit as protective girl-friend Aharen-san has.All in all the its very interesting to watch the comic daily lives of Aharen-san and Raidou-kun , the fun and adorable moments is a delight if you're looking for a getaway from your daily hustle. and we eventually see there's more to the character than just plain blandness.Adding the side character Mitsuki also adds to the story development quite a bit as protective girl-friend Aharen-san has.All in all the its very interesting to watch the comic daily lives of Aharen-san and Raidou-kun , the fun and adorable moments is a delight if you're looking for a getaway from your daily hustle."", ""Terrible adaptation, the manga was so great and funny all the characters were amazing and interesting I would give the manga a 10/10 easily but the anime adaptation is soo bad it's so plain and missing the charm and the stuff that's great about the manga.

Basically - a spectacular insight into what I absolutely consider to be neurodivergent friendship-building. It also shows, surprisingly, a lot of positive ways how to interact with people, who struggle with social norms either due to being neurodivergent, or just not fitting in. Raidou does not force Aharen-san to communicate the 'normal' ways (unlike how in Komi-san she is always pushed to become a part of the 'normal' society, even though it makes her feel very uncomfortable), and instead really tries to find a way that works for her (smoke signals might not...be high on my list, but I would appreciate the effort!)It's also just beautiful to watch how both of them are entirely outside of the 'normal' and they embrace it, and create their own little world without any judgement towards each other (it's also hilarious, and heartwarming, how Raidou perceives Aharen-san as this super-human being with all kinds of fantastical adventures to be had).It's really not about having 100 friends, but rather having those precious few who appreciate (and participate) in all of your existence, and who you feel comfortable with.The only thing that kept bothering me is how they made Aharen-san so child-like, it's really a bit uncomfortable and unnecessary, I felt. be high on my list, but I would appreciate the effort!)It's also just beautiful to watch how both of them are entirely outside of the 'normal' and they embrace it, and create their own little world without any judgement towards each other (it's also hilarious, and heartwarming, how Raidou perceives Aharen-san as this super-human being with all kinds of fantastical adventures to be had).It's really not about having 100 friends, but rather having those precious few who appreciate (and participate) in all of your existence, and who you feel comfortable with.The only thing that kept bothering me is how they made Aharen-san so child-like, it's really a bit uncomfortable and unnecessary, I felt."", 'As you might see from my previous reviews, I have very little tolerance for anime that phones it in.  Whether it be an anime that takes itself seriously and falls flat, or that doesn\'t take it seriously but can\'t deliver, I\'m usually pretty hard on anime when they don\'t measure up.This is one I actually really liked and don\'t have too many negative things to say (but there are a few).This is a comedy.  There are ordinary situations taken to absurd lengths for comedic effects, and then those absurd lengths become part of ""canon"" and are lampshaded by other characters.  This is...something that\'s very difficult to pull off and can be very annoying when done wrong, but in this anime, it\'s not done wrong.  The absurd situations are just absurd enough to be funny and somewhat unrealistic, but not absurd enough to take you out of the story.The story centers around an expressionless boy\'s efforts to get close to his expressionless (and indecipherable) classmate, Aharen Reina.  They quickly strike up a close friendship - very close, because Aharen can\'t judge distance well.  Physically, as well as socially.  As the story progresses, it becomes something closer to a sweet romance rather than just a friendship, but it\'s still really cute and the trevails their relationship encounters are believable enough that it doesn\'t take you out of the story.For the most part, I enjoyed this anime, enough so that I bought the manga.As with nearly all anime, though, this one\'s not perfect.  My biggest complaint about this anime comes from a tsundere child character who is, well, in Japanese they\'d call her a mendokusai (pain in the rear).  She keeps accusing the MC of SA, or threatening to, for no reason, and that\'s amazingly annoying.  She\'s also interested in a little boy who\'s, well, a boy, and, well, it\'s an arc (and character) that I kind of could do without.  Aharen does kind of become a big sister to her, though, and that\'s a little cute.  And there\'s also a female teacher character who gets *absurd* nosebleeds for reasons that are a little, um.... creepy.  I won\'t go into more details to avoid spoilers, but she\'s supposed to be a comic relief character and that just falls flat.  There\'s another character who is, I think, Aharen\'s childhood friend who is pretty much the exact opposite of Aharen in almost every way - including physically, and is somewhat prone to violence.  I\'m still trying to figure out why she wears a different uniform, but, maybe it\'s just because Aharen\'s wouldn\'t look as good on her.  That\'s kind of a bad reason for character design inconsistency, but I guess that\'s a small complaint.  And then there\'s Aharen\'s brother, er, sister, er... ummm...Basically, many (nearly all, come to think of it) of the supporting characters are useless and add nothing to the story, in fact, they often detract from it.

Like the MAL synopsis suggests, it’s a tranquil slice-of-life anime that explores a new friendship between two oddballs. The first episode does a nice job establishing these characters, their quirks that make them compatible, and the start of a wholesome friendship. However, the next 3 to 4 episodes are quite the rough experience…Initially, it seemed like the anime had no idea what type of comedy it was aiming for. At first, we got a taste of overexaggerated stupidity by showing both MC’s having the physical and...mental functionalities of a comatose zombie. Then it switches to pure awkwardness as it's clear that neither Raidou nor Aharen have any idea how to interact with each other. Most jokes bounce between these two styles of comedy for a while before eventually settling for a mild-mannered blend of both. The result of this blend works really well with the tone of the show in the second half. We end up getting enjoyable running gags, funny situations caused by harmless misunderstandings, and more natural interactions derived from a strong chemistry.Side characters were another element of the show that were really hit or miss. I would say the majority of the cast have terribly bland personalities or cringy attitudes. The bland characters have absolutely no distinguishable characteristics to them. They only serve to progress the plot by conveniently creating a strange situation or introducing their own version of stale comedy when things are getting slow. The ones with cringy attitudes are just overused character types (e.g.: tsundere or siscon) that keep more bad than good traits. However, despite all these annoying characters, there are a couple that are gold. They introduce a fresh style of comedy and, sometimes, give us a different perspective on the shenanigans that our MC’s get into. Sadly, these characters aren’t used very often, but their presence has definitely made a couple episodes better than others.The final thing I want to talk about is the second half of the season. I would argue that around episode 6 is where the anime finds its stride and sticks with it. It makes good use of comical situations in everyday life, keeps character personalities in-line with the tone of the show, and completely avoids cheap gags. That’s right, this show doesn’t resort to pointless fan service, overused sexual jokes, or dumb tropes that seriously need to die out already (e.g.: girl hits guy because of a misunderstanding).Overall, I will say that “Aharen is Indecipherable” is an excellent show for relaxing and getting a few good laughs. While the start may not seem like much, I believe the quality of the show improves over time to deliver a unique and enjoyable Iyashikei themed anime. I will be expectantly waiting for a second season in hopes that I can see this relationship blossom one day. mental functionalities of a comatose zombie.

Drama? It\'s not very dramatic. In fact it\'s about as far from dramatic as can be. Slice-of-life? Perhaps, but most of what\'s happening on screen is so stupid it bears little resemblance to anything that can conceivably happen in everyday life. I see some sources have it down as ""comedy"" but I think that must be some sort of mistake as there\'s hardly any jokes in the show. Most of the time it just lumbers along lethargically while the main character Raido provides monotonous, droning commentary about what\'s going on...- which, for the most part, is nothing.What is Aharen-san wa Hakarenai about? Well, it starts off with a boy-meets-girl template set in highschool. The girl in question, Aharen, suffers from the triple threat conditions of Age Stunted Syndrome, Emotionally Challenged Syndrome and Facial Paralysis Syndrome. While these are common afflictions for anime characters, for some reason no anime ever comments on themThe typical Aharen-san wa Hakarenai episode comprises a series of sketches, the majority of which are extremely formulaic and come in a three-parter like this- Act 1: Aharen turns up looking strange, or she does something strange (and unfunny).- Act 2: Raido\'s imagination runs wild as he cooks up some ridiculous (but unfunny) speculations, which are illustrated on screen.- Act 3: The extremely predictable (not to mention unfunny) conclusion is revealed! In addition to the anime showing it, Raidou also describes it in a deadpan voice. In case you didn\'t get it.This look almost like an archetypal joke format, which is perhaps why people have tagged this as comedy, but with an actual joke you\'d expect a punchline to be delivered in act 3 and most of the time here there is none. It\'s like seeing a street with rows of scaffolds on either side but hardly any actual buildings within the scaffolds. Very strange indeed. Did the writers forget to write the jokes? Was this generated by an AI?! I don\'t know. I guess it\'ll just have to go down as one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time (cue Raido-esq exaggerated speculation imageries involving pyramids, aliens, illuminati symbols etc).To be fair to Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, funny moments do exist, though sparse they may be. Occasionally the anime turns its usual narrative formula on its head which provides a rare moment of surprise; the sketches relating to a bunch of local kids can also be quite cute and good for a chuckle or two; also the shipping teacher makes an amusing first appearance but she turned out to be a one-trick pony and the same punchline was practically copy and pasted into all her scenes.The show also sometimes reaches for emotional poignancy, but it took a long time for me to scrape together enough of a fuck to give. That said, I did eventually warm to a few of the characters, and some of the relationship dynamics shifts unexpectedly quickly towards the end, which made things mildly interesting.If that sounds like I\'m damning the show with faint praise, then, well, that sounds about right.  The writing is not witty enough; the stories are not varied enough; the visual gags are not good enough to be funny. Almost the best thing I can say for Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is that I didn\'t end up hating the characters. Though considering the titular character\'s half-her-age appearance and clingy, helpless mannerisms are designed to pander hard to the moe crowd, that in itself can probably count as an achievement.Personal rating: 0.0 (meh) - which, for the most part, is nothing.What is Aharen-san wa Hakarenai about?

It is as follows: if at first you can't take a quirky highschool theme/plot such as that of Komi-san, then don't try again. Mind you, I do think this is better than Komi-san in that it is often better thought-out and more quietly executed, thus less grotesque. However, it ultimately seems like I'm past the time in my life where I could enjoy the 'highschool of the absurd' setting when it's turned to any level lower than Seto no Hanayome.There's also the added issue of there being just too much material to choose from this season.

Not much, really! The premise is very simple, there's not much story going on either, the art is okay, sound is okay, characters are fun...

Its wholesome, its funny, its ridiculous, a little over the top, and its also very light in all senses of the word.

It's tagged as comedy but the anime and the manga are both unfunny though. I criticized sono bisque doll for the fact that 95% of it's interest is fanservice but actually there was a story and a sort of character development.The main issue with animes/mangas like aharen san wa hakarenai or komi san cant communicate is that it doesnt show anything.

Both shows are of the same exact romantic comedy genre, with the same exact premise of an eccentric girl that\'s cute, but has lacking communication skills, and is aiming to become more proficient in making friends. On the way, there\'s the male lead, who is the girl\'s first friend, and potentially even more than that.Well, to be honest, I though that Aharen-san was a lot less annoying than Komi. First of all, she\'s not idolized like crazy unlike Komi, who is basically the hottest girl on the planet that everyone...simps for. This show\'s male lead is also not a simp either, pretty good so far.The manzai between Aharen and Raido is quite refreshing. While Raido is technically the Tsukomi, he\'s also the boke that you react to. You\'re only given access to his monologuing, so you get to see his misunderstandings and reactions. Aharen functions as a good counterpart to Raido, who already has a weird personality and she accentuates that more with her well, weird actions as well. It\'s definitely not a typical manzai, and was pretty funny. Raido\'s a deadpan fellow, but the voice actor for his role is anything but. While the delivery of his lines tend to follow his facial expression, which is more apathetic/neutral than normal monologues go, but there\'s definitely a lot of times where Raido\'s monologue has a lot of emotions. II especially like his habit of saying the ""ne"" (ね) suffix that Raido tends to use in a lot of his questions, which highlights his personality.Side characters wise, there\'s basically none that are too important. Futaba and Atsushi are fine characters and probably the best side characters, when they appear. Ishikawa and Satou are pretty generic, and don\'t get a lot of screen time, and also are just there to fill the side character slots. Toubaru sensei is kind of another archetype, but she\'s fun in her own way, with her interactions with Miyahira pairing well. However, they don\'t really make or break the story.Oshiro, on the other hand, is a pretty pathetic character. She\'s the done to death stalker trope that\'s obsessed with Aharen, and crushes on her. Here\'s the problem. Oshiro is barely tolerable in a rom-com setting where the relationship between Raido and Aharen never actually progresses. The problem is, that it does. She kind of doesn\'t even put up a fight with Raido, and gives up on Aharen. Her character just doesn\'t really make sense when she just gives up despite her entire personality being that she likes Aharen.Besides that, the entire story gets less and less funny the more romance there is. The first like 8 episodes were pretty good, but the last 4 were a hell of a slog. The show was pretty funny because you had two eccentric people have comedic interactions. Pair that up with Raido\'s tendency to make up scenarios in his head and misunderstand, and his monologuing, and the comedy is good. I guess when the romance becomes the forefront, they act like normal couples, with Aharen blushing or being embarrassed in certain situations with Raido. That\'s not really funny, that\'s just like, generic romance?I guess I just found the romance to be unnecessary in a clearly comedic show that doesn\'t take itself too seriously.

Before starting, I want to apologise for any big mistakes I may do writing this review since I\'m not a native English speaker. Now, without further ado, let\'s get into the actual review. There will be (what I think it is, but it may not be) a minor spoiler at the middle of the review, which I will mark again so as to stay clear.Slice of life animes are generally characterised for having a set of characters interact within...the same environment over and over again, so creators need to be original so as to keep viewers / readers truly invested in whatever is happening in the work. Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, unfortunately, clearly fails in providing a refreshing take on the genre or any way of comedic creativity whatsoever. We are again in front of a common case of the typical school Slice of Life show that actually did quite well in terms of popularity, which is the reason behind people picking it up, I guess. As far as I\'m concerned, this anime fails in two very primordial points in order for any work of the kind to actually work as intended. The result of not doing so is a cluster of overly repetitive joke formulas which might take away any viewer attempting to immerse themselves in the world of Aharen. Let\'s see which two main points I\'m refering to.First of all, it blatantly fails in joke creativity, which is a common issue in SoL animes, but in this case, the matter is even more severe than usual. The formulas they usually use (and this is not a spoiler) are generally the following: either Aharen, using her passivity and funny face, makes a reference to something else (which could be to another anime, for example) or simply emphasizes one of the traits descrived previously, or Raido just makes a whole film over the most simplistic matter, generally concerning something Aharen did (or even not did). While it is true that during the first few episodes the formulas provide a fair amount of laughs (which, let me repeat, it\'s the end goal for any comedy anime, as the genre implies), the repetition of these make the comedy of the show wear out rather quickly.Secondly, we have the overexaggeration of things, which is constantly used to crack a smile on us. Don\'t get me wrong - I really do enjoy a well-done exaggeration, even to a point where a situation is so absurd it just becomes incomprehensible, but when the quality of the jokes doesn\'t accompany, it tends to backfire, which is the case. The fact that their exaggeration is not only absurd, but also non-constant, as well as coming from out of nowhere, it really puts me off, but this may be just personal preference.This pretty much sums up the whole interactions between the two main characters, seriously. Both have the trait that, for some reason, they cannot show a sign of emotion on their faces (I acknowledge that, at first, this is kind of funny), both overthink every single tiny event that happens in their surroundings and involving them and both just happen to sit next to one another. Once again, for a slice of life and a comedy, you don\'t need much more than that, but even then, the conversations they have feel a little meaningless, just enough to help the ""joke"" progress, rather than actually having a conversation. A more appropriate thing would be hiding the joke inside their sentences so that the chatter between them felt more full.Now I could just end the review here with a brief statement of each mark and a small TL;DR, but there\'s something I would like to point out that is quite worthwhile. *Minor Spoiler coming ahead* During the last third or so of the anime, the main characters start to develop their relationship a bit more, which is more than welcome, but that alone is not enough to palliate the issues I\'ve just said and, in addition, this really came out of nowhere (although small signs could be interpreted throughout the show). What makes this last third way better is the small shift in tone and the decrease of the exaggeration, alongside the new, let\'s say, ""plot addition"". The two main characters have always been aware of each other in the anime, at all times, although in a more indirect way, but from that point, that turns up to eleven, making their interactions quite more fitting and, honestly, more entertainging to watch. It actually seems like now, they actually have a reason behind the jokes and behind all the reactions. This last bit is what probably saves the anime from being completely mediocre to just being average. *End of Minor Spoiler*I will structure my reviews like this, first I will talk about what the anime does good and/or bad and, secondly, I will justify briefly the marks.- Story: 4I really feel like it\'s quite unfair to evaluate the actual story of a SoL (since most of them have zero story), so I interpret it as storytelling (which is different from story) and setting. As I\'ve said, the setting is more than enough, but the storytelling in kind of awkward (except for final third).- Art: 8I actually enjoyed this anime\'s art and animation. I strongly believe that this is its stongest point by far as all the colors have a nice palette, character design is ok and the whole animation is fluid.- Sound: 5I\'m quite picky with this topic. Probably out of I don\'t know how many songs this anime may have, I probably only enjoyed one song (of course, I didn\'t go specifically to listen to the whole OST, I only say this as I was watching the anime), but the rest are just passable. In terms to sound, I thing it was ok.- Character: 6I\'m taking into account the final development, of course. Although their concept is interesting enough for this genre, it is not fully exploited (at least not in a ""correct"" way) until the end.- Enjoyment: 4For an anime of this kind, this is the key component everyone strives for. Yes, it is true that all the other components helps, there\'s no dennying that, but this is the pillar that can sustain a whole show. Unfortunately, this was not the case for all the reasons above and, therefore, deserves to fail in this category.- Overall: 5, specifically a 5.4TL;DR: While the fact remains that this show could serve as a time killer if one just wishes to simply watch two students doing a bunch of random things, this is certainly not enough to mitigate the repetition of jokes and, as a consequence, the unnecessary exaggeration on every little action they perform. the same environment over and over again, so creators need to be original so as to keep viewers / readers truly invested in whatever is happening in the work.

This last bit is what probably saves the anime from being completely mediocre to just being average. *End of Minor Spoiler*I will structure my reviews like this, first I will talk about what the anime does good and/or bad and, secondly, I will justify briefly the marks.- Story: 4I really feel like it\'s quite unfair to evaluate the actual story of a SoL (since most of them have zero story), so I interpret it as storytelling (which is different from story) and setting. As I\'ve said, the setting is more than enough, but the storytelling in kind of awkward (except for final third).- Art: 8I actually enjoyed this anime\'s art and animation. I strongly believe that this is its stongest point by far as all the colors have a nice palette, character design is ok and the whole animation is fluid.- Sound: 5I\'m quite picky with this topic. Probably out of I don\'t know how many songs this anime may have, I probably only enjoyed one song (of course, I didn\'t go specifically to listen to the whole OST, I only say this as I was watching the anime), but the rest are just passable. In terms to sound, I thing it was ok.- Character: 6I\'m taking into account the final development, of course. Although their concept is interesting enough for this genre, it is not fully exploited (at least not in a ""correct"" way) until the end.- Enjoyment: 4For an anime of this kind, this is the key component everyone strives for. Yes, it is true that all the other components helps, there\'s no dennying that, but this is the pillar that can sustain a whole show. Unfortunately, this was not the case for all the reasons above and, therefore, deserves to fail in this category.- Overall: 5, specifically a 5.4TL;DR: While the fact remains that this show could serve as a time killer if one just wishes to simply watch two students doing a bunch of random things, this is certainly not enough to mitigate the repetition of jokes and, as a consequence, the unnecessary exaggeration on every little action they perform.', ""*****SORTA SPOiLER*****this is an adorable show! Aharen is the cutest little character. Her development throughout the show isn't really growth, but more like peeling away layers that no ne else was allowed to see, simply because of shyness and disbelief that anyone would/could care. She's relatable to so many in so many ways.The are fantastical and outlandish visions seen here about 3 times an episode by multiple characters are way out of control and get on my damn nerves. it truly brings down my pleasure in this. I get the imagination is a powerful thing, but somehwere there has to be a line that's...drawn to preserve the progression of the story. One line is outside of the main story and does provide some comical relief, but even that goes too far after a while.Nonemtheless, the show on the whole is cute and rather wholesome, I would  recommend it nonetheless. drawn to preserve the progression of the story.

But it can be a bit formulaic at times. Heard this one before? The cast is quirky and the socially inept boy has the highschool’s hottest girl teasing him. What does she see in him? Doesn’t matter, the point is, he's like us spergs, but managed to hit the jackpot. Anyways this will go on for at 100 chapters, gets an anime adaption, and it’s great. The Mangaka can finally eat more than one small meal a day, and more fans are introduced to the series. Fast forward one year later,...let's check up on that source material. Little to no progress is made, the jokes are getting old, the cast is now huge, and the fanbase is dwindling. 200 chapters of just teasing the nerdy highschool boy gets annoying. Initially, when Aharen-san came on my radar, I said screw that noise and didn’t pick it up for the first few weeks of it airing. But word spread around, and people were praising it.  I figured why not try it out and proceeded to watch. What was in store for me, was this show really that much different and better than its contemporaries?I fell head over heels for this anime after watching just the first episode. Because even the smallest adjustments to overdone genres such as highschool romcoms (rc's) can make it stand out tremendously from its competition. In this series we follow the relationship between Raido and Aharen-san. Two socially peculiar highschool freshman who make a vow to themselves to not let their quirks stop them from having a social life like it did in their preceding years in school. Raido is a stone faced, but extremely kind natured and well mannered, young man. People are often put off by his serious looking demeanor and no pan face. He suffers from over analyzing everything and being reserved. Aharen-san is a tiny pale japanese girl who looks more like an elementary school kid than a highschooler. While not completely mute, she is extremely soft spoken and unable to properly express her emotions through conventional means. Despite this, after Raido talks to her since she sits next to him in class (by the window in the corner of course) they both become friends with a mission to help understand one another. Neither character are flustered, nervous nancies, and are genuinely interested in making the effort to make the most of their highschool years despite their quirks. Throughout the development of their relationship we find out that everyone else around them from their other friends, family, and acquaintances that no one in this series is “the straightman”. Everyone is an oddball, and that’s why I love this romcom so much.I would’ve called this the romcom of the season (which it is) for just having an MC who doesn’t piss himself when his love interest makes eye contact. Instead we have two characters who are legitimate weirdos, and this isn’t exemplified through them saying, “Oh geez, what do I say, this is so bad I can’t believe I’m so awkward!” This is instead shown through example. Due to the miscommunication between the two, Raido usually assumes that the most extreme scenario to be the reason for something he doesn’t understand. For example, Aharen doesn’t show up for school? Spec ops mission. Making tea? Well she’s the reincarnated spirit of an old chinese shogun of course! You get the picture. This is a recurring gag yes, but here’s the key component as to why I’m not complaining, it’s because it has plenty of other jokes as well. The banter between characters, the gags, the characters themselves, the situations, the reason behind something happening. It’s all cute, funny, heartwarming and refreshing.I genuinely enjoyed all the gags, characters and situations so much that we’d be here all day if I told each and every one of my favorite gags/episodes. But by far, my favorite episode has to be the rap episode. Though the fidget spinner bit after the rap part wasn’t as funny, I still found it to be a cute addition to the episode. But Aharen and Raidou finally discovering an effective means to converse with each other through the art of rap was not only endearing, but their rhymes were fire! But Raidou thinks this will backfire since now that every convo they have is a rap, he feels that they always have to battle each other to see who’s the better rapper instead of having a legitimate conversation. The teacher confiscates their mic and their hip hop beat and now they can no longer rap at school. Earlier while at home Raido practiced his rap on his younger sister who initially dismissed him as being weird, but after he comes back from school she feels bad and tries to compliment him, through rapping herself. He’s confused, she’s flustered and runs away giving him a fidget spinner leading to the next arc of the episode. That was a perfect segue! It’s not taking the 4-koma like gag structure of a series like Lucky star or Azumanga. In those, it doesn’t matter what order you watch the series and you can cut and replace gags from one episode and replace it with another. It has a narrative and unlike other contemporary Rc’s, it is committed to making legitimate progress not only in their relationship but also the plot of the story itself.The characters all slayed me too. From aharen’s younger brother who looks exactly like her but is more genki and up beat (Raido accidentally confuses him for her at an arcade and spends the day being creeped out by a cheery version of Aharen-san) to her older sister who’s extremely protective of her sister to the point that she constantly threatens Raido. She loves her sister so much that she’d rather him deliver goods to her even if she bought them herself, because she knows how much Raido means to her. This is too sweet for me to handle. Then you have their classmate friends like Oshiro. A girl who stalks Aharen because she feel indebted to keeping her safe and happy and feels jealous and threatened by Raido. There’s also their two other chad and stacy like friends who are the closest thing we have to a “straightman” they just want Raido and Aharen to get together by any means. There’s two teachers, one of which constantly passes out at the sight of something she deems “high esteem” (pure, cute, lovely would be better words but they chose esteem for some reason) and the other looks after her. There’s an elementary school girl named Futaba who’s my favorite character, always making each scene she’s in funnier than it was. She’s jealous that the boy she likes looks up to Aharen as a king (no romantic implication at all either) and despite hating both Raido and Aharen, she still considers them acquaintances. Even wanting Aharen to teach her how to cook to impress the boy she likes.The animation and score are nothing to write home about, but I do love the style. Characters all have this roundedness to them and no one in this show is particularly angular in their design. Every character radiates a glow of the lighting and colors that inhabit that background and environment. Speaking of which, the camping episode at night is the most visually remarkable episode. You feel the coldness of the night as Aharen tries to confess her feelings to Raidon over a glistening lake, reflecting the moon’s light, with whispers of the wind flowing from one ear canal to the next. Maybe that last bit was me since I wear earbuds while watching anime, but I digress. The visuals fit the vibe perfectly and it was a very attractive show to watch.The spring 2022 season of anime is the season of subverted expectations. I went into this with no inkling of enjoying it as much as I did. Aharen-san managed to captivate me with its unique twist on the highschool RC genre that’s popular to pump out like hot cakes these days. It managed to keep me engaged with the variety of gags, memorable characters, and a romance plot that makes legitimate progression between two unlikely individuals. Did this show live up to the hype I read in those threads? Absolutely, modern and future highschool RCs take note.

Aharen-san deserves that rating and here\'s why.The most common mistake you will make when watching Aharen-san is comparing it to Komi-san. They\'re very similar, but surely anyone will agree that this isn\'t just a reskin; you can fully appreciate Aharen-san as a good show in it\'s own right without doing a diff check with Komi-san.That said, what made me like this anime so much? Probably because it manages to avoid some very common...pitfalls for SOL shows. Repetition is the bane of comedy, and while Aharen-san does use the same gags frequently, it\'s always with a different setup and punchline for lack of a better term.  Any slice of life has to reuse some laughs unless it wants to become ridiculous and ""hakarenai"" itself, and for me, Aharen-san manages to avoid the territory of the patently unbelievable. The characters themselves are plausible; the laughs come from the exaggerated behaviours. Just like Raidou loves to take things to logical extremes, the show likes taking viewers near comedic extremes.One example I can think of is the ""esteemed"" teacher gag which takes up 2 or 3 half-epsiode segments. The moment I have in mind is the front half of episode 4. While the joke itself - the teacher\'s reaction to Aharen and Raidou - is the same, the comedic rise comes from separate but connected ""esteemed"" situations which aren\'t ridiculous per se (though their combination could be seen as such) but as a group it provides ammunition for the joke. This sort of setup and application of the characters is what makes me think that the writers really put effort into making a unique show with a unique brand of comedy rather than going for a typical ""cute and funny"" SOL.Another thing I should mention is watching this show really felt like reading a collection of short comics. Before the penultimate few episodes each one is essentially split into a self-contained half that may have little or nothing to do with the other half of the episode. For lack of a better way to describe it, these half-episodes feel like reading a short webtoon and add to the sense of variety and crispness of the show.Lastly, let me note that the OP and ED are both ABSOLUTE BANGERS. I absolutely loved them and I thought that they fit the character of the show very very well. Even if you don\'t like the show there\'s no way you can hate on the music.In summary, I highly recommend this show to anyone who\'s looking for a wholesome and unique SOL. 7/10 pitfalls for SOL shows.

Romantic progress: How many slice of life romances involve an infinity of hesitation, self-questioning, bullshit reasoning for why they aren't together, and lack of any progress over the course of multiple seasons? (screw you Uzaki-chan) This anime has real progress that doesn't get walked back or extended forever because of greed or bad writing. The leads are amusing and compatible as complete weirdos, they act like they're dating most...of the story, and the show doesn't blueball the audience with wishy-washy emotional drama that just prolongs the courtship stage.2. Humor: the main two are bona fide weirdos and the ML is well-written for magnifying the humor with his delusional scenarios and explanations for Aharen's oddball behavior and reticence. They go on dates, compete at silly games and sports, while ML hypes Aharen up and supports her for who she is. She is drawn to his open-minded kindness and treats him well. Just what I want to watch.3. Supporting cast: not as strong as the other two, but we get straight man characters who amplify how strange the leads come across and support their burgeoning romance. Aharen's childhood friend isn't the most engaging or interesting character, but she works for showing Aharen's personality and a third person view of what's going on. There are a couple of other who try to match-make or determine if they're dating, which again succeeds in providing an outside view of their romance. Aharen's siblings also show up and offer a bit by way of side character flavor. For a show so centrally focused on its main two characters, I think the supporting characters work to make the most of what matters: romance and comedy. While not perfect, at least there aren't any pointless or distracting characters that steal episodes and screen time from the main couple (ahem Horimiya).I think it's hard to find shows like this that deliver in the ways they should (1 and 2). I consistently enjoyed their goofing around antics and thought they worked really well as a romantic pairing. I hope there's another season, because this show knows how to deliver with what's actually good about this genre, rather than focusing extremely hard on giving the illusion of progress while actually forcing nothing at all to happen the entire time (the goal of a lot of slice of life romances--again, screw you Uzaki-chan). of the story, and the show doesn't blueball the audience with wishy-washy emotional drama that just prolongs the courtship stage.2.

The characters were well drawn, and so were the backgrounds. However, cg background characters and objects were pretty frequent, and although well drawn, the backgrounds were pretty basic. The main characters were very likeable, but the side characters didn't really add too much and I found them kind of annoying. On top of that not a ton of depth to any of the characters. The story is pretty basic, but is good enough to support the show, but gets a little repetitive. Pacing is... slow. This combined...with the repetition made the show suffer when it came to it's ability to consitently hole my attention. Voice acting was good. No characters were constantly annoying, and the casting fit the characters well. The soundtrack was occasionally great, but mostly average. Although, the ed and op were very good. Overall, the show is cute and funny, but unimpressive.

Was kind of disappointed to learn that it’s a romance which doesn’t make much sense, there’s not much of a build-up towards some kind of romantic plot or any plot for that matter.I love a good SOL and a good romance but it’s kind of boring to see almost every SOL become a romance if the two main characters are a boy and a girl. Sure, these two have a good chemistry but it feels purely...platonic and it was oh so fresh to see for the first 2 or 3 episodes.At some point it felt kind of boring and repetitive, there’s not a lot of discussion about issues that most teens go through and if there is it’s given close to zero screen time. Both main characters are kind of flat, they both had a goal and reached it within the first episode, not leaving much room for character development. The jokes repeat themselves a lot as well.I kind of hated all of the side characters so far, they are annoying and serve no purpose in any kind of attempt to create an engaging plot. Both the teacher and Aharen’s stalker (whatever her name is) just act creepy (or as the kids say nowadays - mad fucking sus) towards both protagonists for no reason.There are a few ‘uncomfortable’ things in this series as well, the fact that Aharen is so small and childlike despite being a high schooler kind of gives me the creeps. I really tried to brush it off but something in the back of my mind tells me that this whole thing’s a little fishy. There’s also an unnecessary shot of Aharen’s stalker (I genuinely don’t remember her name) in the pool in episode 6 that had a bit too much focus on her butt and chest and it felt really gross, especially because she’s supposed to be 15-16.Sure, I’m not expecting a mind blowing, coming of age story from a mid-budget SOL anime but it feels like there was an attempt for approximately 10 minutes and than the writer just gave up.In conclusion - This anime had some cute moments but it’s not worth the time. platonic and it was oh so fresh to see for the first 2 or 3 episodes.At some point it felt kind of boring and repetitive, there’s not a lot of discussion about issues that most teens go through and if there is it’s given close to zero screen time.

It's one of those simple sketch rom-coms where each character has one gag, but it gets a good amount of mileage from them. Aharen speaks so quietly that she can't be heard without invading someone's personal space. Raidou has a hyper-active imagination and jumps to the weirdest conclusions about things he doesn't understand. Aharen's childhood friend is a well-meaning stalker who is always hiding somewhere in the scenery. Aharen's family are... well, I won't spoil that.The whole show has a charming and adorable tone to it, which only escalates when it shifts from comedy to rom-com later on....It also makes more plot progress than you would expect for a single-cour adaptation. Between that and the situational jokes feeling like they've been played out enough after 12 episodes, it's a rare case of an incomplete anime adaptation that works well as a self-contained story. It ends by teasing characters who appear later in the manga, but that feels unnecessary. 12 episodes was all this show really needed.

This anime is okay.CHARACTERS = 5/10The two MC's in this anime, Raidou-kun and Aharen-san, are somewhat likable. If you like small, quiet, cute girls, then Aharen-san is the character for you. The MC's pretty much stick to their initial characterizations and don't show a lot of variety in who they are. While I understand this anime is not to be taken too seriously, it leads to the MC's becoming somewhat boring/repetitive in their interactions with each other. There are other simplistic characters introduced who provide some additional comic relief to the show, but even then they pull the same joke over...and over again.STORY = 4/10This series presents itself as a sort of romantic comedy, with more emphasis on the comedy. It also takes a more slice-of-life form in that there is no real plot pulling the series forward -- which is totally acceptable. This is all to say that what you're in for is a form of situational gag comedy in which the gags are almost always presented as Raidou-kun overthinking a situation -- it becomes very repetitive and old. Some situations repeat over and over again, such as playing the crane machine in the arcade. The story takes a turn towards the end, which feels rushed and almost random given how things had progressed before then, making it feel a bit forced.SOUND = 5/10The sound design in this anime is pretty basic. There was some nice background music variation here and there, and cute sound effects -- all very appropriate, which is great. The voice-acting seemed a little monotonous. Part of this is because of who the character of Aharen-san is, but even the gags of Raidou-kun overthinking a situation fell a little short in their delivery. The voiced-out anxieties of many of the characters didn't feel too evocative. The OP and ED songs were fine, very cutesy, a little like they didn't fit the comedic nature of the series.ART = 6/10It's hard to judge the art in a series that feels very intentionally simplistic. Don't expect much from it as far as the art and animation goes.ENJOYMENT = 5/10I'll admit, I get the wholesome, somewhat cute nature of this anime. The gags made me chuckle a few times. But -- and perhaps this is biased/controversial -- part of me felt uncomfortable with the idea of romance between the two MC's, sort of like this anime perpetuates the infantalization of women as small, quiet, helpless, cute things to look at who can cook for you.CONCLUSION = 5/10Would I recommend this anime to a friend?

On the other hand it is mainly comedy so romance isnt heavy(or even clear) before nearing end.After middle point comedy quality dropped in my opinion a bit. there is couple jokes that repeat a bit too much, even one episode that was almost only repeat of one scene.So I'd say...watch from 3 to 5 episodes, drop, rate 9 or 8. watch from 3 to 5 episodes, drop, rate 9 or 8.""]"
