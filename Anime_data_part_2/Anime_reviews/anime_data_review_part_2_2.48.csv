Kaitou Joker 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28869/Kaitou_Joker_2nd_Season,"['This is the Season 2 review. After Season 1, Queen is now a Kaitou Thief like Joker and Spade. ""Kaitou Queen !!!"" But she is still easily the weakest Kaitou and doesn\'t steal often, relatively minor compared to Joker or Spade.The plotline advanced heavily and the anime doesn\'t disappoint giving us even more awesome episodes! In Season 1, only Joker and Queen\'s background stories were covered, the rest were funny heists. In Season 2, we learn the background stories of all our other characters, Spade, Dark Eye, Hachi, Master Silver Heart, Oniyama and his daughter Haruka, and most of all Shadow Joker. These are...heists and important character background stories that all come together, and leads back to Professor clover manipulating it all, It connects our Kaitou\'s fates all to Professor Clover.The dude is the BEST VILLAIN, just look at the guy, he looks so evil and menacing! HE WILL KILL, and don\'t forget, this is a children\'s show! In season 2 you can really see he came from that pit of evil, he is the darkness, once he even traveled to the past to torment his past self to remember the pain of defeat and he was already a bad guy then LOL.  Queen was filled with hatred in the beginning because of a misunderstanding caused by Professor Clover, he the real evil. Ok simply , it\'s the Professor Clover manipulating the lives of the Queen and Shadow Joker, (call him Shadow) to turn against Joker, Spade, and the Master. heists and important character background stories that all come together, and leads back to Professor clover manipulating it all, It connects our Kaitou\'s fates all to Professor Clover.The dude is the BEST VILLAIN, just look at the guy, he looks so evil and menacing!

Keroro Gunsou Movie 2: Shinkai no Princess de Arimasu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2408/Keroro_Gunsou_Movie_2__Shinkai_no_Princess_de_Arimasu,"[""reviewthe gang go on vacation to an exotic  island on  the caribbea, completely unaware of the lurking danger. Maru,a self proclaimed princess abducted natsumi in order  to make his princess. at  first Natsumi  was hesitant, but maru had a kero ball that  makes all of his dream comes true. Pay attention  to the choice of word,  Maru used the word princess and not queen.It's 20 minutes longer than the first movie  which means   thereare more rooms for story development and tension building.It contains spoiler so read on your own riskI must...remind  you that  this is nonetheless a japanese made movie,  so no matter how cruel and  regardless of damages the damages they have down  bad guys are easily  let off the hook dan don't take any  responsibility.Maru  tried to  absorb Natsumi and was going to destroy the planet when  Keroro and friends interfered. Just like that , Natsumi let Maru go.  To me the story would have been perfect  had maru died, because he was the villain.  The maker might have reasoned that  this show for kids and maru was still a kid,  heck do you want kids  to think  that they can do whatever want and would still be forgiven. that's not educating.Personally  i lke ts better than the first movie because my favorite duo  Koyuki and dororo  had more screen time  and bigger role in the story.   sweet  because Koyuki rarely appeared in the tv series.This time moa also saw some action ,  however there is a thing that made  unhappy. Moa had to  use the full power of harmageddon to  block maru's energy beam.  How  can  the same force that could  destroy planets unable  to defeat Maru's beam.  It means Moa is not of the strongest  being in the galaxy, but what make moa interesting as a character is that what you call don't judge the book by its cover this girl is very dangerous . She couldn't defeat a kid.The solution  to me is the reason it happened was because Moa only used 1/1000000 of her power  because she didn't wat to destroy the whole city remind  you that  this is nonetheless a japanese made movie,  so no matter how cruel and  regardless of damages the damages they have down  bad guys are easily  let off the hook dan don't take any  responsibility.Maru  tried to  absorb Natsumi and was going to destroy the planet when  Keroro and friends interfered.

Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED Special Edition,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2269/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_SEED_Special_Edition,"['The main problem I have with pretty much all the Gundam series is that they are far too long for what they are.  The release of the movies pretty much guarantees that I can watch these shows without being bored by useless drama and filler.  All of the Gundam movies have done a great job of rounding out the series into a succinct bundle that allows a viewer who doesn\'t want to parse 50 episodes to sit down and watch a set of movies.That being said, I first was recommended Gundam SEED from friends who thought the anime was groundbreaking and excellent....After watching a couple of episodes of the series, I could tell I was going to have to deal with the ""Gundam Drag"" in this show, as well.  Instead of writing off the show as too slow, I decided to watch the much more concise movies.I will admit, I wasn\'t terribly impressed by the story.  The plot was very much scripted from previous Gundams, which is pretty much understood to be the norm for any Gundam series, but I felt some of the character interactions let it at least stand alone as a separate entity.  If you have watched another Gundam series, except for a few of the lesser projects, then you will not be superbly impressed by this one.  Both the start and end of the plot are near carbon copies of other Gundams, only the culmination of events is slightly different.Even so, the films still seem to deliver.  In the little time that the series of movies has to capture your attention, it is easy to get attached to or disgusted with any of the characters.  As the events unfold, nearly every moment is enjoyable and feels somewhat fresh.As long as you don\'t start role-casting from other Gundams like I found myself doing, you should be able to enjoy these films in their entirety and not have to worry about far too much time spent watching the entire series.

Things like who was rusty?, the fifth member of athrun's team, or what were kira's thoughts about his mother, or even the biggest bombshell of all- what does Rau La Creuset's face look like? If you want to find the answers, than these movies are for you. "", 'So Seed is one of those really divisive series.  It was really popular among the general anime crowd when it came out, but has a mostly poor reputation among Gundam fans, who complain that it\'s largely a rehash of the original series.  I\'m a long time Gundam fan who got out of the fandom for a bit when this was popular, but I finally heard there were digest movies that supposedly did a decent job condensing the series, so I figured I\'d give it a shot and try to give it a fair chance.Gundam fans are right about it borrowing a lot from...earlier shows.  Like most of the first film seems like it was based on a loose outline of the first Gundam series, and there are characters who are basically Amuro, Char, and Ramba Ral with the names changed.  And I do feel like I would have enjoyed these parts more if I were new to Gundam, but they didn\'t do it poorly enough that I hated it or anything.  And during the second movie, the plot does veer off into its own unique thing.  Sadly, by the third movie, that thing is mostly ""everyone\'s either Kira\'s friend or a puppy kicking, mustache twirling genocidal maniac.""  One big theme in Gundam series is that there are good and bad people on both sides, even if one side is clearly worse overall than the others, and during the first two films, Seed embraced that, so it was sad to see it dropped for seemingly no reason.Most of the characters were sadly rather bland, though this may have partially been due to how they chose to condense the TV series into these films.  But in any case, I can only judge what I\'ve seen.  Most of the side characters are just there, Kira is boring and generic, and the villains in the last film are pretty interchangable aside from who they wanted to exterminate.  On the plus side, I rather liked Cagalli and her relationship with Athrun.  To the point where I think it would have been a much better series if it focused on them.Art wise, this is sadly was made during the awkward transition from painted cels to digital ones, and to make it worse, it embraced the ugly style of character design that was popular in the late 1990s.  The result might be the ugliest Gundam series ever made.I don\'t hate this, but I can\'t really say I\'d recommend it to anyone.  There\'s a good chance you\'d enjoy it if you haven\'t seen any Gundam series before, but then why watch this instead of one the original series, 08th MS Team, or Iron Blooded Orphans?  I really don\'t know who this would be for aside from people who are nostalgic for it now. earlier shows.

The first movie is....well terrible, in comparison to the actual series, the whole movie is just a bunch of clips from the series, with a few new scenes here and there. If you have not seen the series, I would recomend watching it instead of this movie only because they cut out so much from...the story that you are not able to connect with the characters! Its seems that all these caracters have no depth to them at all, which is not the case! The story suffers much as well, with so much cut out.The only reason I finished the movie was to see then new scenes and see if I would learn something new about the characters or plot, but sadly that was not the case.This movie crams about the first 20 episodes or so into a short lifespan(95min), so what would you expect?bottom line, make time for the series if you have not seen it and skip this movie. You should really only watch this movie if you are a die-hard fan and you MUST see anything Gundam SEED/Destiny related. the story that you are not able to connect with the characters!

It is a sequel to Inazuma Eleven GO which is also a sequel to the original Inazuma Eleven. So, at first, to watch Chrono Stone you first need to watch the Inazuma Eleven and Inazuma Eleven GO series.Chrono Stone is said by Level 5 to be the best of their works on Inazuma Eleven and is very clear that this is true.Story (7): The story is original in contrast to its prequels where we only have football tournaments without anything else (not counting the Aliea arc and Inazuma...Eleven GO).It has elements of time-travel that have done very well, with some explanations about how time works in the Inazuma universe. Also have a plot twist in the final part, which I will not explain to not spoil anyone.It is true that it has less action and more dialogue than its prequels but, it is a bad thing? Chrono Stone, instead of this ""pieces of shit"" tournament arcs, has a focus on the plot instead of the soccer matches, although there are many matches as well that are not specially necessary to the plot.Character (5): Inazuma Eleven is not a series where the characters are well developed and Chrono Stone is not an exception. Although Fei, Kinako and some others have their respective development, the great majority of them have very poor development or not any at all. This apply to the old characters which doesn\'t have a lot of new things for their development.Art (8): The design of the characters and the animation is done well with no problems or ""ugly things"". Avatars and hissatsu are animated well with art that sometimes left you with a good taste, so in general, the art is one of the best things.Sound (8): The sound of Chrono Stone, as well of the other series in Inazuma, is mostly based on the soundtrack in the games. So, basically, normally it fits to all the circumstances because it was done specially for specifical scenes in the series.Enjoyment (8): I enjoyed this series the most of all in the Inazuma Eleven company.Overall (7): I think it is not a dissapointing sequel to the series so if you are a fan of the Inazuma Eleven franchise, it worth watching a lot.

It has a needlessly confusing plot that keeps twisting into sideplots like a puppy on cocaine. An inbred puppy. The main plot is confusing enough, involving time travel and parallel timelines. We don't need random missions like going back in time to break Tsurugi's brother's spine (seriously) so that the proper timeline can return. Or when they need to fight to restore the team's love of soccer. Or when they get magically summoned to an island to get help from the soccer god in the middle of an oddly interrupted battle with...the enemy. I'm pretty sure there are times when the writers forgot what was going on too because the plot shifts gave me whiplash.Random sums up this show pretty well. Random characters show up to help with no explanation given (Including a talking teddy bear. Yeah). Random abilities and techniques appear unexplained only to fail. No set up appears needed anymore. When they do set it up it seems half-hearted. There's a new technique called mixi-max which is introduced when the teddy bear lets out a T-Rex and then gives it's power to some dude. Characters simply know things they couldn't possibly know with no explanation given. And the new Avatar Armed just gives them the opportunity to put on silly dresses in overlong animations that don't get shortened even in flashbacks. The battles are short and uninteresting, the characters keep getting switched, the plot is a mess, and the new characters are annoying. But most serious of all its flaws: it just isn't fun.Now quit it guys. You're making soccer cry. the enemy.

Animation-wise, it sticks to the familiar art style from the Inazuma Eleven Go series. Avatar designs and hissatsu shooting effects maintain their greatness, but there's a glaring flaw in the animation. Certain major scenes, which should have had a high impact, suffer from a noticeable lack of animation, feeling more like PowerPoint slideshows.The story doesn't diverge much from the Inazuma Eleven, sticking to the theme of a mysterious entity threatening soccer, and Raimon's determined efforts to protect it. The storyline doesn't offer anything particularly special.When it comes to characters, the new characters...designs are excellent, and the introduction of Miximax and Avatar Armed adds an interesting dimension. However, character development feels rushed and inconsistent, with some characters making unrealistic progress or unrealistic turnover point in just one episode.

That made pacing in Chrono Stone is inconsistent, with rushed character development and power imbalances.The theme, shifting from normal soccer to fantasy time travel across various eras, may seem overly fantastical but is executed reasonably well.The soundtrack, including the opening and ending themes remains fantastic, effectively using background music to enhance impactful scenes.

Chrono Stone introduces exciting new characters, including Fei Rune, Clark Wonderbat, Goldie Lemmon (Kinako Nanobana), Sor (Torb), and Zanark Avalonic. Moreover, it features historical figures such as Joan of Arc, Oda Nobunaga, Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang, and Sakamoto Ryoma, as well as myths and legends such as King Arthur and the Dragon Queen.The introduction of the concept of Fighting Spirit Armed (Keshin Armed) and Mixi Max adds an interesting strategic dimension to football matches. Fighting Spirit Armed is an ability that allows a Fighting Spirit...user to equip their Fighting Spirit to increase their strength, speed, and the power of their Special Techniques tenfold. Moreover, several Fighting Spirit users can merge their Fighting Spirits into a single, more powerful one. This technique is called Fighting Spirit Fusion (Kenshin Fusion). As for Mixi Max, it is a technique that allows the merging of the auras of two characters, their skills, and abilities to create a super-powerful player. This adds an element of surprise and strategy to matches as characters can fuse with historical figures or other players, offering an infinite variety of combinations and special skills, including with dinosaurs in the Jurassic era! Mixi Max plays a central role in the story as it is linked to the protagonists' quest to restore the course of time and save the world of football. Mixi Max are essential to fight against antagonists and restore balance in the football world.

However, it is precisely this creativity that makes the anime memorable! The storyline offers a wide variety of characters, eras, and places.

I particularly love the quirky humor of the plush coach and the exaggerated reactions of historical characters when confronted with totally improbable events!Regarding the second part of Chrono Stone, I think this part of the storyline is very interesting and captivating.

Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1288/Kidou_Keisatsu_Patlabor,"['In my opinion a very good introduction to the patlabor anime saga and  WAY lighter content compared to the movie, as well the early mecha designs that later on would be praised via movie 1 and overall. The persona in here is quite good , the 1st meeting with some collegue´s , their backgrounds and involvment in everyday life , as well the villians story´s and out come of it, bit too bad that the serie´s was short but that makes it all up with 3 more movie´s and more serie´s inbetween! ', ""“For Pete’s sake, this isn’t some Mecha anime” - Goto KiichiThere's a multitude of Mecha shows that are talked about now and before, Gundam, GitS, and with this year we had FranXX, Gundam (again) and Planet With. As is obvious to an avid anime fan, Mecha shows are very big in Japan and as such we see a lot of buzz on such shows. Sometimes though, some shows do not get the love they deserve, especially when they're in many ways superior than most, this is where Patlabor comes in.Patlabor is perhaps the best sense I found for Mecha, in policing and the law, no,...I'm not talking about Code Geass esque law enforcement, Patlabor is far better in showing how and why the Mechs called Patlabor are necessary for the country and the police. Not to fight Klaxosaurs, but to fight crime. And this Patlabor showed us effectively. Despite being a 7 episode OVA that's 30 mins long for each episode, we saw a good amount of information and not a second was wasted, that too despite being a little shorter than a single cour anime, which goes to show length doesn't always factor for quality at least for anime.Patlabor's biggest selling point is how the police are depicted. They're not gruff individuals who always rush off into life-or-death situations. The police aren't always involved in such cases, but neither are they always in jest. We saw the fun our characters had in the first four episodes along with the crime dealing as well, making for a nice blend of both seriousness and light humour, something less seen since striking a balance is so tough. Light humour obviously brings us to the colourful cast. Since this is a police anime, we see young adults as our main cast and this shows Patlabor is another of those few mechas with an adult cast and not teenagers. Getting into the details, the characters were bright, distinct and amazing in their own way, they felt real. Noa was our female protagonist who was in love with her Patlabor Alphonse, showing she's a cute mechanics lover and she had her fun moments. Though Patlabor is anything but romance, we did get a few nods with Asuma, a fellow police officer. Oota was your average short-tempered gun lover. Kanuka was the fun American transfer student who thankfully knows English and not Engrish (a huge plus point to the Voice Actor for doing well) along with Hiromi who wasn't seen talking much as he's a rather silent individual. Gotou was a relatable depressed looking man who would play an important part as the captain of the group and his role in episodes 4-6 were amazingly done.The rest of the cast was a playful bunch who was serious when they needed to be and hilarious when the situation demanded it too. Why did I spend so much time on the characters? It's because they were well done, we didn't see any major development over the course of the 7 episode OVA but that could be excused because their establishment AS a character was brilliant. Something else that was brilliant was the OST. The simple but intricate background music complimented the situation effectively and the Opening theme song was something I think will be stuck in my head for a few months, catchy and cute, it is an excellent way to start off a fun show. Since it was somewhat of a semi-slice of life show, the OVA had an episodic nature with the exception of the 2 part “Longest Day” arc which was in episodes 5-6. Despite being episodic, the independent episodes stood up for themselves and were all well done. The first three were an introduction to the Patlabor world and it introduced us to the daily life of the police, combining fighting crime and topping it off with light humour which as I covered above was an excellent blend of both. I never felt out of place with the plot or this approach but it being episodic meant things aren't tightly held up and so we couldn't see a long underlying plot although episodes 5-6 scratched that itch to a certain extent.Another thing I didn't feel out of place with was the artstyle, despite airing over 30 years ago it's artstyle was something I didn't find hard to watch and actually enjoyed and appreciated the art direction. From the character design to the emotions of the character to the action scenes involved, Patlabor’s artstyle was consistent, easy to watch and attractive despite it's age. As a comedy fan I always look for fun comedy shows to watch but I do step out of the comedy bubble a lot and when I tried Patlabor after a friend recommended it to me, I didn't just get a well done Mecha, I also got some comedy added as well. “Why do you call this a good Mecha?” you may ask. It's because the premise was explained clearly, it wasn't an obscure explanation with any external influences or aliens or whatever, Japanese technology evolved to the point that Labor could be used, but this could be used for crime as well, and so to monitor this, Patrol Labor, therefore Patlabor was implemented. Easy right? Apart from that even though it was episodic, it was a GOOD episodic show because each episode stood up for itself and there was still a small line connecting the episodes together.A lovable cast, interesting developments and a perfect blend of seriousness and comedy show that Patlabor Early Days is how a Mecha can be made fun, approachable, and funny. I haven't watched enough Mecha as most Mecha fans would but I really doubt I'll find something as fun as Patlabor Early Days. Definitely a show worth trying out, it's shorter than a single cour anime and yet covers a lot, an excellent introduction to the Mecha series and genre!Story: 8Animation: 7.5Sound: 7Character: 9Enjoyment: 9Overall: 8.1 I'm not talking about Code Geass esque law enforcement, Patlabor is far better in showing how and why the Mechs called Patlabor are necessary for the country and the police. Not to fight Klaxosaurs, but to fight crime. And this Patlabor showed us effectively. Despite being a 7 episode OVA that's 30 mins long for each episode, we saw a good amount of information and not a second was wasted, that too despite being a little shorter than a single cour anime, which goes to show length doesn't always factor for quality at least for anime.Patlabor's biggest selling point is how the police are depicted. They're not gruff individuals who always rush off into life-or-death situations. The police aren't always involved in such cases, but neither are they always in jest. We saw the fun our characters had in the first four episodes along with the crime dealing as well, making for a nice blend of both seriousness and light humour, something less seen since striking a balance is so tough. Light humour obviously brings us to the colourful cast. Since this is a police anime, we see young adults as our main cast and this shows Patlabor is another of those few mechas with an adult cast and not teenagers. Getting into the details, the characters were bright, distinct and amazing in their own way, they felt real. Noa was our female protagonist who was in love with her Patlabor Alphonse, showing she's a cute mechanics lover and she had her fun moments. Though Patlabor is anything but romance, we did get a few nods with Asuma, a fellow police officer. Oota was your average short-tempered gun lover. Kanuka was the fun American transfer student who thankfully knows English and not Engrish (a huge plus point to the Voice Actor for doing well) along with Hiromi who wasn't seen talking much as he's a rather silent individual. Gotou was a relatable depressed looking man who would play an important part as the captain of the group and his role in episodes 4-6 were amazingly done.The rest of the cast was a playful bunch who was serious when they needed to be and hilarious when the situation demanded it too. Why did I spend so much time on the characters? It's because they were well done, we didn't see any major development over the course of the 7 episode OVA but that could be excused because their establishment AS a character was brilliant.

The first six episodes were directed by the grand master himself, Mamoru Oshii, who would also direct the first and second film adaptations. The seventh episode served as a bonus with a different director by the name of Naoyuki Yoshinaga. From what I took of it, the seventh episode tried to make up for a lack of action evident throughout the OVA. I was fine with that, but the sixth episode still serves as a fitting ending.The premise...of the anime is near-future, as Oshii puts us in a world where the advancements of technology have made science fiction a reality. Humanoid robots known as Labors are a result of that, and they serve as the most important medium for Japan's expansion as a techno logic civilization. However, there's a bad element in Japan's society that leads to crimes committed by Labors piloted by insidious individuals. This leads to the creation of a Special Vehicles Division under the Tokyo Police Department, where Patrol Labors(Patlabors) have become the standard weapon to Labor crimes. This is where our main characters assume their roles and deliver fun adventures under the badge of the Section 2 unit of Special Vehicles Division in Tokyo.The OVA's plot for each episode, besides 5 and 6, followed a stand alone format as each episode creates a new setting with a new adventure for the main cast to endure. This cast includes the main characters of the films such as; Izumi Noah, Shinohara Asuma, and Goto Ki'ichi. These characters, and many more supporting characters, are integral to the plot as they bring something new to the table with their varying personalities. A fine example would be Yamazaki Hiromi, one of my favorite characters of this OVA, who's a giant of a man with a gentle side to him. As some of you might know, the 3rd episode had a strange ending, and Hiromi was inserted as the main point of interest for no apparent reason. It was pretty funny, but also there was no predictability to it... and that felt amazing. It wasn't for the hell of it, mind you, but rather,to make the audience ponder the meaning for themselves. It is my favorite episode of them all.In order to compliment the atmosphere of Patlabor, Kenji Kawai provides a beautiful score that really sums up certain moments with pizzazz. Then there's the Japanese voice overs, which were really well cast, as they've been with the franchise up to the second movie. That's not the case with the English dub cast, which was probably the only screw up with this OVA, as they were very miscast and just plain bad.Other than that, this anime was a riot to watch.

Most notable among these names is director Mamoru Oshii, the philosophical tech-mind behind other works such as Ghost in the Shell, Jin-Roh, and The Sky Crawlers. Being both fairly convinced of his talent and a mecha fan, I dropped in to give the much lauded Patlabor franchise a try. The Early Days OVA starts one of two anime continuities which the first two movies continue.This 7-episode 1988 OVA is a brief but effective peek into the world of Patlabor. A Japanese rookie police squad is...transferred to a new district where they’ll uphold the law with the help of their Patlabors – giant mechanized Patrol “Labor Units” created to combat rising Labor crime. Patlabor is among the closest a mecha series has come to being a “slice of life” show, with little to no overarching plot and an episodic structure that details the daily life of the SVD2 squad and the environment they have to work in. It’s primarily a mix of comedy and drama, but is not beholden to both, knowing exactly when to divide and redistribute the mix to make its individual stories more fun or more emotional. It’s a show that’s convincingly capable of doing anything thanks to having talent great enough to know how to handle anything.It’s difficult to not undersell Patlabor because on the surface it’s a modest, unpretentious series but with excellent, tactful craft that overcomes its simple premise. The world construction is extremely similar to Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (despite Oshii not working on that) in the sense that Patlabor has a very well-defined setting that’s constantly and gradually built on in the background through the broad range of subjects its cast has to deal with in their adventures. Despite Patlabor’s mostly light-hearted tone and humor, its surrounding is revealed to be a prescient future society rife with environmental concerns, increasingly concealed upper class bureaucracy, and red-tape clashes between the police, military, and government. It’s borderline dystopian without rubbing it in your face, but being able to both acknowledge that border while not succumbing to overbearing themes of pessimism and nihilism is why the series is so successful and unique. It’s a struggle of optimists in a world that’s increasingly not welcoming them, and Patlabor manages to have its cake and eat it too regardless of which tone it chooses to put on.Still, this OVA is largely a fun comedy driven by likable characters with strong personality traits that aren’t exaggerated to the point of having them become caricatures, and not overused to the point of making any of them annoying. Among the SVD2 squad is central character Noa Izumi, a tomboyish Labor fangirl who joins the police in order to pilot a mech. Her closest comrade is Asuma Shinohara, the spoiled son of a leading metal manufacturer’s president. They’re joined by the trigger-happy and sexually repressed Isao Oota, nerdy “whipped” husband Mikiyasu Shinshi, and peaceful giant Hiromi Yamazaki. They’re soon joined by an American transfer named Kanuka Clancy, an ace police officer who’s by far the most serious and intelligent of the squad. Squad captain Kiichi Gotou reveals himself to be the strongest member of the cast, a perpetually depressed-looking man with an unprofessionally sullen demeanor. What’s at first seemingly a personality played for a joke becomes the most important part of making Patlabor’s serious tone believable. Gotou is the weary cop who’s been worn down (but not broken) by the technicalities of the law and justice, and the suspicious self-serving nature of the higher-ups he serves. The only one who comes close to understanding him is Shinobu Nagumo, a more professional but ultimately more naive fellow captain. When the OVA climaxes in episodes 5 and 6, it’s Gotou’s presence in the storyline that hints at something beyond Patalbor’s usual comedic conceit, and since his character bears the weight of the drama the lighter tone most of the series has is not jeopardized. Gotou is Patlabor’s main connection to the more serious side of its story and yet he’s still funny in his complete frustration and exhaustion regarding his job while also being startlingly intelligent and competent. In summary, Gotou rules.That two-parter mentioned above is an exception in this OVA, however. It’s a little odd how the OVA doesn’t conclude on those episodes since they’re clearly the climax and the final episode completely skips over the implied consequences of the previous one which is puzzling and begs an explanation. The 7th episode could’ve and should’ve been placed before those two episodes. The majority of Patlabor: Early Days is effectively funny episodic comedy starring an easily lovable cast with well-animated action sequences. The pacing of every scene is always pitch-perfect, slow and natural when capturing the malaise of the bored squad members who celebrate being suspended from work, and slick and uplifting whenever action is required. Oshii knows what he’s doing in a consummate sense that’s extremely easy to overlook if you don’t consider how mediocre a lot of otherwise fine anime are directed. Patlabor isn’t a lazy production, constantly switching frames and camera angles so that its mundanity somehow isn’t boring to watch. When the objects on screen aren’t moving around a lot, the camera always is and no frame is sloppy or unfocused. Episode 4’s ghastly ghost story uses uniquely garish coloring over many scenes that sells the clash between Patlabor’s tone and the sort of horror it’s parodying, and Gotou and Nagumo’s relationship with the majority of it being told through facial expressions and things unsaid is always refreshingly mature among the more frantic cast.Yutaka Izubuchi’s mechanical designs are sleek but utilitarian. The Patlabors are literally giant police officers, armed with over-sized handguns and nightclubs. At first this may seem tacky, and yet it’s more plausible than your usual Gundam’s reliance on vaguely explained beam technology. Kenji Kawai’s score is typical for the time, a mixture of bright synth build-ups to electric guitar solos. Anyone who’s seen a fair amount of 80s anime will recognize the style, and while very derivative it’s a kind of style I personally love and I’ve already found myself humming a few of its tunes after finishing the series. Every credits sequence having its own unique theme is a nice touch, and the opening theme being a love song from Noa to her Patlabor (nicknamed “Alphonse”) is a cute and appropriate lead-in to Patlabor’s general tone.Patlabor: Early Days is not going to please a broad audience. It’s inevitable some people are simply going to find it boring. For others such as myself, its seemingly simple construction won’t feel empty at all and instead an honest, restrained approach that makes any of its more ambitious and potent moments much stronger. It’s made with a class that boosts its modest interests above many other series that wear their ambition on their shoulder but have a much less realized premise. For people who like the more commonly easy-going anime of its era and want a particularly solid-written series that never trips over any of its concepts, it’s easy to recommend Patlabor: Early Days. transferred to a new district where they’ll uphold the law with the help of their Patlabors – giant mechanized Patrol “Labor Units” created to combat rising Labor crime.

The term comes with a lot of responsibility, and believe me, I truly do not like to take or give it lightly, but throughout the years Patlabor has cemented its name as one of the more well recognized and critically praised mecha franchises of the 80s. Managing to stand not that far away in terms of importance and influence, to the likes of Gundam or Macross. Sadly, my experience with it has been nothing short of underwhelming, basically making for a highly frustrating disappointment overall. On this analysis I will attempt to shed some light to what I consider to be...the pivotal structure problem with the series, the characters, which are my main reason for never managing to connect with some of its entries. As references for this I will be using mostly the ova series Mobile Police Patlabor, with some additional commentaries on its continuations, Patlabor Movie 1 and 2.My issue at heart here is actually philosophical one, on the writing of this OVA. The main ideal of characterization this series seems to be going for is something I fundamentally disagree. On the OVA’s first episode, there is a line by Gotou that describes perfectly, said ideal of character writing. On said commentary he points out how his subordinates, the main guys we follow through most of the episodes, are not the autistic pilots of Gundams, dangaios, Mazingers. This commentary lands a pretty decent joke and reference (you would have to kill me, to make me remember an instance where the jokes in this Ova actually made me laugh) but is also indicative of a bigger view on how these characters were purposefully created. It references a logic of taking out eccentricities, extreme aspects of personality, in order to portray their personalities as more mundane, normal, you could say as “realistic people”. Even in this case where the personas are a bit more expressive and show a wider range of emotions than in pretentious crap like Kara no Kyoukai. The problem being, this attempt at streamlining does not lead necessary to what I would call better characters. In fact, I think it plays the contrary effect on this franchise, the personalities are streamlined, to the point they really lack basic aspects of really basic character writing like engaging conflicts, arcs, motivations, depth, psychological introspection, making they really way less interesting as people to the emotionally unstable autistic pilots, who were portrayed in really exaggerated ways, that were kind of a genre cliché (blame Zeta Gundam for this). This for me is a clear example of confusing subtlety, in having the character aspect being more nuanced, having it to be implied through details and small actions rather than literally explained, for dullness in having barely  anything in terms of content to these personas. Patlabor is an obvious attempt of going for the latter, but forgets to give the meaning on the small, in having a good grasp on ideas they were trying to imply, to give us a good enough of a sense as to whom these people really are.Credit where it is due, at the very least the cast here contains a variety of personalities. Each character has its own unique reaction and characteristic be it Oda’s aggressiveness, Nagumo’s rationality, Noah’s childishness. Such characteristic may never portray or give comprehension to a deeper true character, but the very least they serve to create scenes; each persona adds a unique facet and reaction to situations, which in turn makes for dynamic scenes. The developments in history are made on the basis of their unique personality, not on convenient character writing. But when we look to the foundational aspects of good writing, the characterization quite literally falls apart. How many of the main characters in Patlabor have well stablished and portrayed motivations and goals? The answer is two, them being the guys who have pretty much already accomplished their goals at episode 1(firing guns for Oda, being with Alphonse for Noah). So yeah the joy of seeing someone attempt for a goal, an objective, a thing of desire, and work his way through complications to get to that is completely gone here. This issue is only elevated by the complete disconnect between the conflict and the cast, the conflicts being presented through the OVA (with the exception of episode 5) have completely none personal stakes, they have absolutely no relation with whom they are, what they want, being that their repercussions only matter on a social scale (which also does not matter since the OVA has really bad world building, but this is a topic for later). It is a weird case where characters are not moved from desire, worldviews, personal issues, traumas, but because it is their job, they are paid for that and they just sort of have to do it. I usually prefer characters where the reasoning for their actions are explained and have more to them than simple duty, but hey that is just me. It also creates a weird instance where the lack of stakes or interest for the conflict in the characters themselves, also leaves me really disengaged on what is being presented, since it is through their eyes and perspective that we as audience members experience said events. You would think that in Ova where everyone lacks urgency completely, they would try to get us interested on them as people instead, develop those guys to be really compelling, well written. Which is completely not the case, throughout this entire fucking Ova most main characters never grow much from the way they were initially introduced. Take Shinshi for example, he is a main in this Ova and in the first movie. Throughout the course of both the only things we get to know about him is that he is a really passive scarred guy, and the fact he is married (which manages to be his most notable “trait”). At the end of the day we learn absolutely nothing new about the guy, he is still the same person he was in episode 1 (I would argue he is a worst character at this point, because now we know his existence is limited to that). I am not saying Patlabor needs to give ample characterization, depth, or psychological introspection to everyone, the kinds of basic layout which were being used here can work for simple secondary character. Take Sakaki for example he does not need much more than his gloomy obstinate and oozing in authority personality to work for his function, for the screen presence he occupies, and his relevance in the story, that is good enough. Giving this treatment to a main one or I would argue even less to some, is completely unacceptable though. The instances of character development that do happen are also so bizarrely handled. On its first movie Patlabor sets up what should be Noah’s most important flaw, an aspect that was a clear build up for a future arc in my vision (which I think the OVA was also trying to set up, but they were so incompetent at that I am not sure). Said flaw being her dependency on external objects, she named several things throughout her life as Alphonse, and implies her happiness can only happen in terms of being together with said objects. Of course the narrative has absolutely nothing to do with this flaw (it never does in Patlabor, because who needs conventional storytelling of tying conflict with characters flaws, and making arcs about overcoming those flaws, right). But then what happens in movie 2 really gets the cake as most awkward character moment ever. Said continuation literally starts with a scene of Noah saying she does not need her freaking Alphonse anymore and she is over it. Her infatuation with Alphonse the most important aspect of her personality, being built up and reiterated for an entire OVA series and a movie, and the resolution to all of that is part of a time skip, where what is shown is only the aftermath of said change. This movie in general also has this issue of presenting character change from previous entries with time skips, with barely any context, but it as least gives them new situations to react to and aspects of personality, which was more than I can say for most of the OVA, so well done, I guess.The bigger issue here is not really the personas sucking (which they do). But in how Patlabor needs way stronger character writing for the narrative it is attempting to work (the films 1 and 2 are exceptions for being a detective mystery and political thriller respectively, more focused on plot). There is a great focus on detailing the day to day of these people, the way they interact and play with each other (was this supposed to be comedy), those moments were really more important than the conflict and surrounding narratives at hand in some episodes. There is a focus on character here, which is really not paying off, and comes mostly as a waste of time. I also do not think Patlabor understands what makes said slice of life like scenes functional. Scenes without conflict are great to show the personality of the individuals, showing how they truly act in the absence of an external force, these are the moments where we truly see characters’ act, instead of react to things like threats to their lives. Those can also be great to show people in a great variety of circumstances, or how mundane habits and values can shape or show the true personality besides facades. It can also be a way of stablishing relatability with characters, showing them as normal humans, which engage in the same kind of regular activities as you do. Patlabor barely uses those to any of those functions, instead opting for repeating the same traits (how many times did we need to see OTA wanting to shoot in his spare time?) repeating the same facts about the characters, repeating the same kind of interaction between them ad nauseam and also the most repetitive and obnoxious attempts at banter and humor I have ever seen. During the entire OVA, the only moments where I felt it put those scenes to great effect was in the start of episode 5. In 13 minutes this episode manages to do more for the characters, than the show had done so far in its entire run. By having they start the episode going home, meeting their family connections, or other relations they are inserted into, giving then an entire new situation, portraying a completely new aspect of their lives, even when one of them choose to do not go and stay at the district, that choice also tells a lot about them, especially in Gotou’s case. We even see hints at motivation and desire being drawn for Shinohara in this episode. It is this entire new, really mundane environment the characters go through this episode, that allows we to know way more about them, than any of their repetitive gibberish banter and constant reaffirmation of traits (because of course when we know something about a character we have to see it repeated eternally to understand he is really like that). Despite this instance of effective character writing being no life saver for the OVA (nothing could at this point) and never translating to some bigger exploration in further episodes, it still leads along with the more personal objective(finally) of a long lasting rivalry, to episodes 5 and 6 having the more engaging moments in the show. Those were the key difference of those episodes, not the change in tone (Ok not having those jokes happening so often surely helped). the pivotal structure problem with the series, the characters, which are my main reason for never managing to connect with some of its entries. As references for this I will be using mostly the ova series Mobile Police Patlabor, with some additional commentaries on its continuations, Patlabor Movie 1 and 2.My issue at heart here is actually philosophical one, on the writing of this OVA. The main ideal of characterization this series seems to be going for is something I fundamentally disagree. On the OVA’s first episode, there is a line by Gotou that describes perfectly, said ideal of character writing. On said commentary he points out how his subordinates, the main guys we follow through most of the episodes, are not the autistic pilots of Gundams, dangaios, Mazingers. This commentary lands a pretty decent joke and reference (you would have to kill me, to make me remember an instance where the jokes in this Ova actually made me laugh) but is also indicative of a bigger view on how these characters were purposefully created. It references a logic of taking out eccentricities, extreme aspects of personality, in order to portray their personalities as more mundane, normal, you could say as “realistic people”. Even in this case where the personas are a bit more expressive and show a wider range of emotions than in pretentious crap like Kara no Kyoukai. The problem being, this attempt at streamlining does not lead necessary to what I would call better characters. In fact, I think it plays the contrary effect on this franchise, the personalities are streamlined, to the point they really lack basic aspects of really basic character writing like engaging conflicts, arcs, motivations, depth, psychological introspection, making they really way less interesting as people to the emotionally unstable autistic pilots, who were portrayed in really exaggerated ways, that were kind of a genre cliché (blame Zeta Gundam for this). This for me is a clear example of confusing subtlety, in having the character aspect being more nuanced, having it to be implied through details and small actions rather than literally explained, for dullness in having barely  anything in terms of content to these personas. Patlabor is an obvious attempt of going for the latter, but forgets to give the meaning on the small, in having a good grasp on ideas they were trying to imply, to give us a good enough of a sense as to whom these people really are.Credit where it is due, at the very least the cast here contains a variety of personalities. Each character has its own unique reaction and characteristic be it Oda’s aggressiveness, Nagumo’s rationality, Noah’s childishness. Such characteristic may never portray or give comprehension to a deeper true character, but the very least they serve to create scenes; each persona adds a unique facet and reaction to situations, which in turn makes for dynamic scenes. The developments in history are made on the basis of their unique personality, not on convenient character writing. But when we look to the foundational aspects of good writing, the characterization quite literally falls apart. How many of the main characters in Patlabor have well stablished and portrayed motivations and goals? The answer is two, them being the guys who have pretty much already accomplished their goals at episode 1(firing guns for Oda, being with Alphonse for Noah). So yeah the joy of seeing someone attempt for a goal, an objective, a thing of desire, and work his way through complications to get to that is completely gone here. This issue is only elevated by the complete disconnect between the conflict and the cast, the conflicts being presented through the OVA (with the exception of episode 5) have completely none personal stakes, they have absolutely no relation with whom they are, what they want, being that their repercussions only matter on a social scale (which also does not matter since the OVA has really bad world building, but this is a topic for later). It is a weird case where characters are not moved from desire, worldviews, personal issues, traumas, but because it is their job, they are paid for that and they just sort of have to do it. I usually prefer characters where the reasoning for their actions are explained and have more to them than simple duty, but hey that is just me. It also creates a weird instance where the lack of stakes or interest for the conflict in the characters themselves, also leaves me really disengaged on what is being presented, since it is through their eyes and perspective that we as audience members experience said events. You would think that in Ova where everyone lacks urgency completely, they would try to get us interested on them as people instead, develop those guys to be really compelling, well written. Which is completely not the case, throughout this entire fucking Ova most main characters never grow much from the way they were initially introduced. Take Shinshi for example, he is a main in this Ova and in the first movie. Throughout the course of both the only things we get to know about him is that he is a really passive scarred guy, and the fact he is married (which manages to be his most notable “trait”). At the end of the day we learn absolutely nothing new about the guy, he is still the same person he was in episode 1 (I would argue he is a worst character at this point, because now we know his existence is limited to that). I am not saying Patlabor needs to give ample characterization, depth, or psychological introspection to everyone, the kinds of basic layout which were being used here can work for simple secondary character. Take Sakaki for example he does not need much more than his gloomy obstinate and oozing in authority personality to work for his function, for the screen presence he occupies, and his relevance in the story, that is good enough. Giving this treatment to a main one or I would argue even less to some, is completely unacceptable though. The instances of character development that do happen are also so bizarrely handled. On its first movie Patlabor sets up what should be Noah’s most important flaw, an aspect that was a clear build up for a future arc in my vision (which I think the OVA was also trying to set up, but they were so incompetent at that I am not sure). Said flaw being her dependency on external objects, she named several things throughout her life as Alphonse, and implies her happiness can only happen in terms of being together with said objects. Of course the narrative has absolutely nothing to do with this flaw (it never does in Patlabor, because who needs conventional storytelling of tying conflict with characters flaws, and making arcs about overcoming those flaws, right). But then what happens in movie 2 really gets the cake as most awkward character moment ever. Said continuation literally starts with a scene of Noah saying she does not need her freaking Alphonse anymore and she is over it. Her infatuation with Alphonse the most important aspect of her personality, being built up and reiterated for an entire OVA series and a movie, and the resolution to all of that is part of a time skip, where what is shown is only the aftermath of said change. This movie in general also has this issue of presenting character change from previous entries with time skips, with barely any context, but it as least gives them new situations to react to and aspects of personality, which was more than I can say for most of the OVA, so well done, I guess.The bigger issue here is not really the personas sucking (which they do). But in how Patlabor needs way stronger character writing for the narrative it is attempting to work (the films 1 and 2 are exceptions for being a detective mystery and political thriller respectively, more focused on plot). There is a great focus on detailing the day to day of these people, the way they interact and play with each other (was this supposed to be comedy), those moments were really more important than the conflict and surrounding narratives at hand in some episodes. There is a focus on character here, which is really not paying off, and comes mostly as a waste of time. I also do not think Patlabor understands what makes said slice of life like scenes functional. Scenes without conflict are great to show the personality of the individuals, showing how they truly act in the absence of an external force, these are the moments where we truly see characters’ act, instead of react to things like threats to their lives. Those can also be great to show people in a great variety of circumstances, or how mundane habits and values can shape or show the true personality besides facades. It can also be a way of stablishing relatability with characters, showing them as normal humans, which engage in the same kind of regular activities as you do.

A great looking, character driven cop dramedy with mechs. The main problem seems to be that the series was rather short on time to execute the ideas the staff had in mind.The first two episodes are basically just setting the tone and introducing you to the characters. A couple of the other episodes end right at what should be the climactic moment (one of these episodes, the 450 million year old trap, which is about a kaiju of all things, and represents a sudden but intriguing shift in scope and tone for the show,...actually acknowledges how anti-climactic the ending is. The other one is episode 6, the 2nd episode of SV2\'s Longest Day, which is all the more disappointing because of the 2 episode buildup).Episodes 4 and 7 are pretty charming, self contained stories that exemplify everything good about the show. Since we know the characters by now, we get right into the story, and each of these has its unique little twist on what would otherwise be a pretty straightforward narrative. They\'re just clever enough to hold your attention, and we get to enjoy experiencing them through the vibrant (though somewhat underexplored) characters, and with some great visuals and direction.Episode 4 is also one of the best looking episodes. I love the overhead shot of the bath filled with ""blood,"" and the intense use of color to create different moods throughout the episode; perhaps most notably when Shinohara is breaking down the details of the tragedy that happened at the training grounds a couple years prior for the rest of the gang, all drenched in stark amber light and bold black shadows. I also love how the whole cast is in frame for this scene, but none of the members are looking at each other as he delivers the story in somber tones.Then there\'s the scene in episode 5 wherein Shinohara is sitting on the bridge, listless, alone, thinking about giving Noa a call, and we see only the trails of the red and white lights of the cars passing by underneath. I really enjoyed that whole lonely subplot of Shinohara going from place to place, spending a bit of time with some of the other members of SV2, humbled at finding they\'ve all got their own families to spend time with on the holidays, while he hasn\'t really got one. Perhaps he realizes he could be a little warmer and more vulnerable with his coworkers, open up a bit more.Just as he settles in at Noa\'s place, where it was rather obvious he would end up eventually despite their clashing personalities, they\'ve gotta hit the road for Tokyo, where a rebel military faction has just tipped its hand and seized control of the city. It\'s great, but it doesn\'t leave much time to resolve the story in the next episode, which ends on that bizarre, cheesy freezeframe of the bad guy\'s face basically the same moment SV2 bust in to stop him.Despite a few highlights, the series is mostly a bunch of setup that goes nowhere. You don\'t really get to spend enough time with the characters, who seem like a decent bunch, but they\'re not quite charming enough that you don\'t notice what shitty cops most of them make.

Patlabor is an exception to this norm, an extremely grounded anime where the robots, named Labors, are not fighting in some epic war but serving in plenty of tasks to the general public.In this OVA, the spotlight in set onto the formation of the SV2 Unit, a small patrolling unit entrusted with preventing and stopping any malicious or irregular use of the Labor units. The setting is clearly inspired by Japan during the 80s, rampant bureaucracy...and rapid technological advancements leaving space for inefficiency and corruption. The SV2 team is formed by a mismatch of younger and inexperienced personnel and seasoned yet jaded veterans, facing the challenge of using the unfamiliar Patrol Labors (or Patlabors) to fulfill their rather unpredictable duties. Noa Izumi, a rookie fascinated by Labors, is tasked with most of the piloting of the Patlabor and is arguably the protagonist of this OVA.The first few episodes are spent introducing Noa and her SV2 coworkers, having them deal with threats of local terrorism and investigation. Humor is always present during these first episodes, cartoony expressions and witty conversations are used to establish the group´s dynamics and sets a slightly lighthearted tone for the majority of the series. Even though these episodes serve their purpose of building character dynamics, the excessive use of humor somehow overshadows the worldbuilding and critique of bureaucratic organizations, feeling more like satire than a series of its own.After properly introducing the SV2 Unit, the anime takes a much serious tone and deals with stronger threats and themes such as insurrection and internal covers up. The political commentary is very present in these episodes being deeply intertwined with the plot developments. The group finally acts like a serious unit during these arcs,  facing an important conspiracy and unveiling the truth behind it.In the animation department, the OVA has detailed 80s style animation, having varied and expressive character designs. The Labors and other mechanical vehicles are well animated, the titular Patlabor itself having a very distinct and appealing mechanical design with fluid human-like movements. Even though not many action scenes are present in the series, the action animation is very dynamic and visually engaging. Tokyo and other locations are accurately represented with rich backgrounds and detailed street signs, a visual feast for fans of the late Showa era aesthetics.In general, this Patlabor OVA is a decent introduction to the Patlabor franchise. The early introduction episodes can feel like a drag even for a short series but later episodes are good enough to make up for it, especially for fans of political intrigue. I can only recommend this series to fans looking for something grounded and realistic with political commentary, this anime is more akin to a police drama than to a regular war setting mecha. and rapid technological advancements leaving space for inefficiency and corruption.

I think to get that stuff to work you need to have a lot of space for characters to develop and play off of each other in a bunch of different scenarios and pairings. There just isn't enough time here to do that, but it does make me think the anime could well be pretty decent actually, as long as you go into it knowing what...you're getting. you're getting."", ""Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor is definately a compitent anime , and it does things good , but it scarcely excells at any of them . Nothing here is really noteworthy because it either feels like you have seen those things done before , or they feel really underwhelming in the execution .The main idea for the story sounds really intriguing . A world where mecha are so common in everyday life , that crime specifically centered around these mecha called Labors naturally occurs , so a police force to combat those crimes with Labors of their own is formed . However there is little labor...crime for a show centered around it .The first episode was a pretty straight forward introduction to this world and the characters . The second episode did not feaature any particularly exciting labor scene but it was okay . The third episode was a straight up Godzilla reference -which is entirely played for laughs- and it ends very anticlimactically , a very weird tonal shift for the show , and this early too ! The fourth episode I actually really liked for the message it tried to push and it really fit the show . Episodes 5 and 6 are a two parter that is everything i wanted from this show and it delivers ... up until it doesn't , because it ends so abruptly with no closure at all , leaving me dissapointed . The final episode is just okay .The characters have good foundations , but i honestly cannot tell a single noteworthy thing about them , and besides Noa , i cannot remember any other name ... Pity , because throughout this short show you can see that they make a fun bunch and you just want to spend more time with them .The art is very good even for its time . The labors are sleek and stylish , and i love that kind of mecha design . The animation tends to lean a bit  on the static side of things , but most of the time and where there is action or intense character reactions happening , it is really fluid and stylish . It has that 80s anime edge that i am all in for .The soundtrack is really rocking and i admire it for that . I wouldn't necessarily say it is memorable , however when you hear it you just can't help but bop your head . The oppening theme is okay , not the kind of music I would listen to , but not bad .Overall , I would say that this anime , unfortunately is just wasted potential , and believe me , I say it with sadness , because I can see something working here , and I really want to cherish it , but i just can't .

Anyways, there is no development. The whole anime is just 2 girls spending time together. There\'s a short part in which we are shown a dramatic scene which I\'m sure makes perfect sense in the manga, but in here it\'s an isolated scene, and we are not provided with any context, so it kind of comes off weird, stupid, and pointless?Same things with the characters, the video shows off nothing more than...""cuteness"". I liked the short haired girl tho, cause I have a fetish for masculine females, but yeah, it didn\'t really make the characters any better.A decent song which provides you with a pleasant mood while watching this completely pointless OVA that felt like an AMV, which it kind of was, or not really, who cares...So why am I even writing this review? Why do we do anything at all? Does anything even matter?If there\'s one thing you can take out from this review, it\'s the fact that I\'m attracted to masculine females. ""cuteness"".

Well look no further! This anime is a promotional video for the manga from which it\'s based from, and boy does it get the job done.The whole thing is aesthetically pleasing, the animation is nothing special, but the stuff like character design and background art are forceful. From watching this I\'d definetly start reading the manga if I wasn\'t doing so already. The music is your generic mellow J-Pop song, but I honestly wouldn\'t expect any other type of music from something like this.The only real problem...is that although it classifies as ""anime"", it doesn\'t really have much substance by itself, it only really works because it\'s just a promotional video.Bottom line, as an anime, is meh, but as promotional video (which it\'s the only thing this should be considered as) it\'s pretty damn good.

Konjiki no Gash Bell!!: 101-banme no Mamono,https://myanimelist.net/anime/844/Konjiki_no_Gash_Bell__101-banme_no_Mamono,"['My sister and I are huge Zatch Bell fans, and we were extremely happy to find out that there was a movie on it. We both happily watched the movie with high expectations and glorifying hope that this movie will be one of the best movies we will ever watch. However, we were both disappointed on its overall outcome. ""Zatch Bell Movie: Unlisted Demon 101"" is an overall cliche movie that I feel will most likely leave its fans a feeling of disappointment. Indeed I will admit that I have watched several other anime  movies and thus could easily compare and contrast which one...has left a better impact on its viewers, but I believe that even a person who has no experience of watching several anime movies, such as my sister, could easily have known or thought that the creators could have done a way better job in the movie\'s creation.Story:There is nothing remarkable about this movie\'s plot yet nothing bad about it either. I just found it uninteresting is all. The movie starts off with a normal girl named Kotoha who has no knowledge whatsoever on the momodo/demon world, but is somehow whisked away by it by the main antagonist who is filled with hatred, jealousy, and all those other negative emotions and the strange golden haired boy we all know as Zatch or Gash. One problem I found in this movie is that the creators did not put in too much effort when trying to make the movie a masterpiece that will make the people watching it go “OMFG THIS SO FRIGGIN AWESOME, I’VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH EPICNESS IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!” Instead it probably made them go “I guess it was okay, but they could have done way better job.” The movie also failed miserably on outlining the overall message or life lesson as you may call it. I felt as if the creators only had the idea of making the whole fighting scene cool by adding some ignoramus flashy creature to finish the whole movie off with a BANG; however a movie does not need some weird looking powerful creature to make it interesting, but maybe a simple message to tell each viewer that we do not need some out of this world power to defeat the problems that may come our way, but the help of our friends to guide us to the right directions in which life may take each one of us.Art & Music:There was nothing wrong with the art or music of the whole entire movie. Nope, nothing wrong with it at all. Sure the creators could’ve done a better job at the movie’s art, but the art is the way it was in the TV version, and we all know that Zatch Bell’s art is not the greatest. Same with the music, there was absolutely nothing special with it, it was just plain average. If you were expecting a bunch of the Zatch Bell seiyuus to walk on the red carpet gallantly to get the “Number 1 Voice Actors Award” than I’m sorry to say this, but these voice actors did none of that! These voice actors just did what their supposed to do, their job!!!Characters:Throughout the rest of the movie it mainly concentrates on Zatch and Kyo which I count it to be as one of the movie\'s mistakes. Of course, it makes perfect sense that the two main characters should have most screening time, but I believe they shouldn’t take about 80% of the screening time! We don\'t even get to see Kanchome, Ponygon,Tia, and their partners that much, we only get to see them about 4% of the time! The villain, I believe, needed much more screen time. The movie didn’t fully express the feelings of anger the main antagonist was supposed to feel, as a result, we have a villain who is just there to add some difficulty for Zatch and Kyo.  You may think that’s what all villains are for, but I like to think that a villain needs more than just some evil attitude to be a villain, I do not know what other qualities villains should have, but perhaps it has something to do with the way it is expressed. Lastly, I didn’t see an appropriate amount of any character development for any of these characters, not even Zatch or Kyo who are the main characters of this whole dang movie showed some signs of noticeable growth till the last few ending scenes.Enjoyment:Oh how do I express all the emotions I felt for this movie? Oh yes, uninteresting, apathetic, boring, cliché, and all those other adjectives used to describe the feelings of boredom more fancifully. During the whole movie I was bored, absolutely bored! I thought this movie might make my spirits bright where I will sing a song of praise to thank the heavens for taking away my boredom, but instead it just made me even more bored. I even yawned a couple of times, and nearly fell asleep just to express my overall boredom to this movie. Sadly this movie was a waste of my time, and I kind of regret wasting about 1 hour and 25 minutes of my life.

Even so, i think they manage to tide all this together in a good way and the ending was kind of bitter sweet.Overall the story was very good and I found a lot of enjoyment watching this.9/10Watch it!', ""A great little piece of animation about tragedy and the power of the human spirit to persevere in the face of it. When young adult Keichiro is left orphaned due to a past family accident, he leads a lonely existence devoid of much company. But his world is shaken up when he finds an older model helper android named Flower and proceeds to take her home. Finding out the little android girl is obsolete and broken he intends to dispose of it, but when she reactivates and starts housekeeping for him and offering him a sense of companionship/friendship, he begins to feel inspired to live...again. But the spectre of Flower's obsolescence soon threatens to take away his newfound sense of purpose in life with even more heartbreak & tragedy. NOTE: The Movie version offers a couple small scene extensions with a scene at a village shop, and Flower discovering Keichiro's media computer/song while cleaning the house in another scene. Taken with the attached Special, the movie feels like a solid little window into Flower's time with Keichiro. Definitely a well produced piece from the people at POP, would be nice if it adapted more of the ongoing Manga stories, but it's a nice one-shot OVA. again.

Kidou Tenshi Angelic Layer,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52/Kidou_Tenshi_Angelic_Layer,"['If I were to describe this anime in one sentence, it would be: ""Pokemon with Battle Dolls!""Story: 6/10We follow little Mizaki, a little girl wanting to see her mother after years and years of being away from her. Upon arriving in the city where her aunt lives, she sees a jumbo vision screen that has two little battle dolls (known as Angles) fighting one on one. She is intrigued by them and decides to try it out for herself, unknown to Mizaki her mom is actually much closer than she thinks. This is the base of the storyline, along the way she meets new friends...and rivals alike. To her; Angelic Layer is nothing more than a fun activity she likes to play as a sort of hobby, she soon becomes more involved with it and eventually signs on to a tournament...where her mother is the grand champion. It does good with keeping the tension between her and her mother actually meeting one day, as many episodes have them barely missing each other. The story starts off well with introducing each main and supporting cast roll, and there are quite a few of them. However, during the half way point you may start to notice a filler or two happening ever so often, or battles that seem kind of pointless to the base of the story. Speaking of battles, this is another negative about the series, in that Mizaki is one of those main lead characters that rarely ever loses, which might ruin the anticipation of each battle for some viewers. To its credit though they do end on some nifty cliffhangers every now and then, and do a pretty decent job of making the battles exciting for the viewer. Oh and the ending is just awesome, it concludes very well and doesn\'t leave you with any sort of questions. So you need not worry about investing your time in a 26 episode long series, only to have it disappoint in the end, because it doesn\'t! Its a good story as a whole, but does lack somewhat being that the only real goal in mind is Misaki meeting her mother.Angelic Layer shouldn\'t contain anything that viewers would find offensive, there are little romance scenes going on, but they are never shown or implied as dirty...since these kids are pretty young.Artwork: 8/10If you\'re familiar with a company known as ""Studio Bones"" then you\'ll notice right away that Angelic Layer is very appealing to look at, even considering the fact that this anime isn\'t the newest out there. With very colorful setting and character models. However, the characters themselves (with the exception of Misaki) look pretty standard and generic, I was never really able to find one that stuck out for me. The fighting scenes are cool though, they move swiftly and have nice balance of unique fighting moves and martial arts. Along with some containing actual power style techniques. Almost makes me wish they would bring over a fighting game of this series, heck I would buy it!Soundtrack: 8/10The closing themes change twice during the whole series, which helps give good variety to the show. They are pretty darn catchy, as is the opening theme song ""Be My Angel."" Character voices were also spot on! I listened to it in both English and Japanese. I felt they were just about equal, but I would give a slight tip of the hat to the Japanese version, as it seemed to match a wee bit better! Regarding the background music, you only really get one memorable soundtrack, it plays this sort or arena style action theme, it fits well with the fighting and builds up the anticipation of each match.Characters: 7/10They are varied in their personalities, and you get a pretty good variety of them because of this series\' larger style cast line up. Though I feel that I should mention that the major bulk of the cast are indeed females. Even so they seemed to lack a real sort of depth to them, there aren\'t really many episodes where we get a true understanding about the supporting cast or rivalries, usually it will include only a brief flash back or passing mention. But I must say they do interact well with one another, and you get a fair amount of character chemistry too. I would also point out that this title is quite good with its whole ""friendship"" feature.Bottom Line: 7/10If I were a big fan of these ""one on one"" battle style anime, then I probably would have given it a bit higher of a score. Still, it kept me entertained! If you can make it through some of the filler style episodes, and don\'t mind the story dragging on some what, then you will like Angelic Layer! and rivals alike.

After exiting the station, she sees on a big screen two people fighting. However, these are not people - rather they are Angels, which are dolls controlled by a Deus. These dolls are custom made, and they fight in Angelic Layer, which is the name of the sport. She is told all this by the scientist Icchan, who walked up to her and started telling her this...stuff. Ignoring the possibibility that he might be a lolicon [AKA, pedophile][He isn't], she followed him into the Anglelic Layer store, where he went and showed her what to buy to create her own angel.

Its done by CLAMP, which makes some good anime/manga, but I do have some problems with it. Early on in the series, Kotaro developes a crush on Misaki, which is teased upon by Tamayo. However, later on in the series, Tamayo admits that she's had a crush on Kotaro for a long time. If thats the case, why did she even push him onto Misaki to start with? The other thing I can't get around is the fact that she is the Kiseki no Rookie. She starts playing, and then she never looses.

Additionally, the Champion, Shuko, who is her mom, lost to her. When she hadn't lost to 77 or so other players. Finally, there is the matter with her mom. Her mom, quite frankly, is a wuss. A gigantic one. She's afraid to see Misaki, because she's afraid of what Misaki will think of her. She doesn't want Misaki to see her in a wheelchair. However, by postponing it, isn't she just making it worse?End of SpoilersAnalysis [No Spoilers]: Some of the fights are cool. I think that the plot is a bit iffy, but its a 26 episode show expanded from a 25 or so chapter manga. There really isn't much you can do with it. I think that the comedic moments are great, but sometimes it just pushes it. Some of the fights are good, some are bad.

While sometimes, it works, but other times ... I just can't buy it. Theres only so much you can ignore.Additionally, when you 'launch' angels onto the layer, you say an opening shpeal. Which is kinda lame. And I really dont see how Hikaru can fall like the way that she does in that.There isn't really much to the anime except for the tournament. The first 4 or so episodes deal with her starting, and then there is the tournament. The rest of the plot then deals with the tournament. The unimportant matches get an entire episode, and some of the 'big' matches, you never see the character again. If you do, its very very minor.This is a cute anime, and ok for a laugh.

Partly it does this by making the tournament a fighter between customizable dolls, and making most of the competitors young females.Like most tournament shows, the themes of doing your best and friendship pervade the experience. A doll used in the Angelic Fights is usually treated by her (or rarely, his) owner (deus)  as though it were a dear friend, with concerned cries going out when they are injured. Unlike most competition shows, however, Angelic Layer isn\'t treated as the be-all-end-all of life. Characters who take it...too seriously end up losing to Misaki and come to see that winning is less important than making friends and having fun. That\'s not to say the entire show is light-hearted and gay; Misaki\'s personal mantra seems to be: I\'ll do my best in spite of my tiny size!The plot is mostly simple enough: Misaki arrives in Tokyo, since she\'ll be going to a new school there and sees an exhibition Angelic Layer fight. When the pretty, smaller Angel wins, Misaki is immediately enamored and wants to create her very own Angel. After winning her very first fight, she enters the annual tournament, and proceeds to advance round after round, with help and encouragement from her friends, growing as both a person and a deus. Along the way, she makes new friends, and they occasionally stop by for a picnic or a trip to the beach.Misaki herself is an adorable girl, and a virtuous heroine, but, unfortunately, somewhat shallow as a character for most of the story. Her motive of being strong is dedicated to not being a burden for her mother, whom she hasn\'t seen in years and has been away in Tokyo for work; or so she believes. The truth about her mother is revealed about halfway through, and eventually that plot thread allows for Misaki to rise above her basic role as the talented newcomer at the end of the show, but until then, she fails to be much more than an enjoyable stereotype.The supporting cast lend a great deal of charm to the show, most notably from Icchan, the goofy, eccentric creator of Angelic Layer who hides his role as such from Misaki while guiding her into the game. Aside from tormenting his assistants and providing screwball antics, Icchan displays a caring and sometimes insightful side behind his silly facade, proving to be a deeper character than the lead for much of the series. Misaki\'s classmates, the childhood friends Tamayo and Kotaro, provide a regular dose of levity, with Tamayo regularly practicing various martial arts holds or wrestling moves on Kotaro, who develops a crush on Misaki. Kotaro\'s little sister, Hatoko, fills the role of a mentor for Misaki. Many of the rival deus also befriend Misaki, eventually, nearly all of them with a brief, touching, backstory to endear them to the viewer, although pop idol Ringo just provides silly and energetic entertainment value.The series makes use of lots of vivid, solid colors, and is pleasing to look at. Even during rainstorms, the pallet never feels downright dreary. Character designs are moderately varied (Just, be careful about the announcer\'s purple suit, wow), although most of the characters have only one outfit that they where in the entire series.  One wonders why so many characters participate in these games wearing their school uniform. All of the Angels have unique outfits as well, ranging from strikingly beautiful to kind of funny looking. Hikaru, Misaki\'s angel, is a distinctive red outfit that\'s somewhere in the middle. The battles are fairly fluid, although certain moves are represented with flashy single frames, and in some of the longer battles, some scenes are shown from a distance. People who watch more recent action shows won\'t be impressed with any of it, though.Sound effects are used well throughout the show, whether in the Angelic Fights or for comedic emphasis. Especially for comedic emphasis. The English dub, however, fairs less well. I only had access to the dubbed version, so I can\'t judge the Japanese track, but the English voice acting is probably the series weakest aspect. The children, especially younger children, frequently come across as a little wooden or strained, and not entirely believable. Hatoko\'s light and wispy tone doesn\'t sound bad, but it doesn\'t quite seem to fit, Jessica Boon\'s Misaki always seems just a little bit too dramatic, Monica Rial plays Tamayo maybe a little too gruff, and so on. Icchan feels pretty spot on, though, but his harried assistant\'s whininess is a bit grating. One major distraction in the voice acting is the regularity of unnatural pauses in the middle of a sentence. Yes, this is a side effect of the difference in sentence structure from Japanese to English, thus the lip flaps make it difficult to get the dialogue to flow easily, but perhaps if the translation was a little less rigid (I\'m assuming, again, I only saw the dub) it might have been less obvious. Also, the pronunciation of ""deus"" as deuce struck me as odd, since deus (day-oos) is Latin for god, and matches the Angel theme.All-in-all, it\'s a nice show. It\'s got a good message and will generally provide a warm and cuddly feeling with a few chuckles along the way. There\'s nothing really ground-breaking here, but it\'s a good kid-friendly show, if that\'s what you\'re looking for.

I feel bad for it because is it actually a very nice and peaceful show. If you are looking for gore and darkness it is definately not for you. However if you are looking for something that is light and funny, without a buttload of romance this is perfect. Although it my seem childish at first within the first 4 episodes you will be hooked. In Angelic Layer, the girl connects with her feelings and with her past through these dolls which she controls.I not only...find that cute but the plot is original making it unique. The best part is: it is enjoyable and suitable for all ages. I definately reccomend this for anime fans!!!! :) find that cute but the plot is original making it unique. The best part is: it is enjoyable and suitable for all ages. I definately reccomend this for anime fans!!!! :)', 'I have a strong soft spot for kid tournament anime. Ever since I was a kid intrigued, watching kid tournament anime thanks to it\'s flashy fights base on set project as well seeing set strong fighter fight set strong fighter in a match.Even though I enjoy watching Kodomo tournament anime, I don\'t find them to be all that great in actually. Yes, there were a few kid tournaments that were actually good such as Gundam Build Fighters, Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 and Future Card Buddyfight Season 1 many of the kids tournament anime seemed to be meh at best by comparison especially when theses that...three shows that I enjoy actually have more things going on outside its tournament nature in terms of story and charterers.As a fan of the sub genre self I decided to check out other kid tournament anime and the first anime that appeared other than the pretty good Danball Senki series which am currently watching from time of the review is Angelic Layer a 26 episode tournament series done by Studio Bones as featuring the art-style from Clamp. I went into this show with pretty high exceptions as I expected this show to be a engaging tournament show that had a good sci-fi tournament setting and fun and likeable characters.Unfortunately I didn\'t get any of that as show quickly devolves into a generic tournament anime that was filled with cliche characters and cheesy predictable writing that was too much for my tastes. Angelic Layer isn\'t a bad series, but I don\'t think it\'s all that great. It\'s a decent anime that is very enjoyable for children as well newer anime fans. However, if you like me who had lots of Kodomo tournament anime in the past, you will begin to see that Angelic Layer has a lot of small cracks which become larger as you progress the series to a point where the series starts falling apart in the end.Also get use of hearing the word predictable throughout this review.Story.The story follows sixth grader Misaki Suzuhara who has just moved to Tokyo to live with her aunt. When she arrived in Tokyo, she sees two battle between two dolls on a big live-screen called Angelic Layer which is a highly popular game in which players (called Deus) buy and custom-design dolls known as Angels that are moved by mental control when on a field called the ""layer.""She soon meets a guy with a lab coat named himself Icchan where he encourages Misaki to purchase and create her own angel. She ended up getting an angel that resembles the protagonist from Magic Knight Rayneth, and she calls it Hikaru. Despite being a clueless of the game in first glance she competes in tournaments and is assisted and watched carefully by Icchan and from there Misaki life as a competitive Angelic Layer player where she has to defeat other players to become the best like no one ever was.The story on paper was interesting and entertaining however it actual execution the story is boring and predictable. Am not joking when I say this but Angelic Layer is one of the most predictable stories I have ever seen and it\'s not for a good reason which falls into the shows cheesy writing which I will talk about in a bit. My problems in Angelic Layer begin with the overall pacing as the series is overall pretty inconsistent as it can go either way too fast or way too slow. It was okay in the first few episodes but it really got out of hand as the series went on as many of the fights seemed to either drag out just to fill the 20 minute mark or fights that are too short where they lasted 2 to 5 minutes. I will admit there were a couple of fights that solidly paced overall but the most part the pacing could have been a lot better.The pacing seemed to plays along with the shows cheesy writing.The writing in Angelic Layer is such that many of the dialogue and conflicts are cheesy for the sake of being cheesy. There\'s not much self-awareness as the series seemed to ride on the cheese train. It\'s gets even worst when the writing goes into full angst mode One of the example of this happens with one match of the tournament where Misaki is fighting a girl who complains about being too tall. Uhhhh what?On top of the inconsistent pacing and cheesy writing comes in the series of plot holes that ruined the story even more. I won\'t mention them here but can easily notice them as you watch the series itself.The worst thing about Angelic Layer is that is ultimately predictable, but it\'s not of a good reason. Personally, I don\'t mind predictable shows as long as they good characters that make it up unfortunately with the expectation of two characters which I mention in a bit the characters in Angelic Layer weren\'t not all that good. The battles in the Angelic Layer have predetermined meaning thanks to the power of-plot armour that Misaki has she cannot lose an Angel fight. She may lost once an Angel fight in the beginning but after that, she becomes an unstoppable god.As for the love triangle itself like with the tournament, it\'s very predictable and not well executed even though it had potential to be good.Overall the story of Angelic Layer was underwhelming. It had potential to be fun and interesting, but the predictable and cheesy writing ended up destroying all the shows potential of being a solid kid tournament anime.Characters.The characters, for the most part, aren\'t much better as they okay at best and at worst wasted potential. They are not necessarily bad characters it\'s just the writing at the various points ruined many of the characters in Angelic Layer.First up we have Misaki. Out of all the characters in Angelic Layer, she\'s easily the worst of the bunch. She\'s is a self-insert Mary sue who is simply perfect at everything. She doesn\'t much of a personality other that she is kind and clumsy and most of her dialogue was plain boring to listen. She slightly gets better in the final episodes but by then it\'s being its way too as she comes off as a bland and unlikable Mary Sue.Icchi Chan is a pretty cool character While he doesn\'t have much depth, his still, a pretty entertaining character who has a lot a charm though at times he does go completely off-rails for my liking at times.Next, we have Hatoko.Man what a wasted potential Hatoko was. She was a badass character in the first half but as the series progress, she loses her badassery to a point where she became nothing but cheer-leading fodder for Misaki. It\'s such a shame really.Now we get to my favourite character in Angelic Layer Tamayo.I really liked Tamayo I really enjoyed of what she did for her character. Despite being a cheerleader for Misaki she was filled with passion and joy. I really enjoyed her tomboyish characters towards the cast especially towards Kotoro and Misaki. Honesty she should have been a main protagonist rather than Misaki because she\'s not only interesting character that is filled with charisma but she was only character in Angelic Layer that wasn\'t a bore to watch. Thank god!!!Now we have Kotaro and not gonna lie he\'s is boring.He\'s just an incredibly bland character who simply allows Tamayo to do all her karate moves on him like a punching bag. He doesn\'t even attempt to counter Tamayo moves and his dialogue was boring as hell.Finally, we have Ohijro or like who are you again? Apart from being a love interest for our Mary Sue lead as well being a step brother for Icchan he\'s was a forgetful character who didn\'t do much to the overall plot.The rest of the characters are very forgetful as they all come and go for plot reasons and they barely leave an impact on the overall plot.Visuals.The visuals in Angelic Layer are a mixed bag. On the one hand the series well polished that contains great lighting and cinema-photography while at other times the series can look pretty messy and inconsistent to a point where some of the scenes in Angelic Layer look pretty ugly. The characters designs despite being done by CLAMP were average and not all that appealing to act for the most part. The background scenery is okay as it uses a series of basic sci-fi and urban colour palette for the environments.The animation itself was fine. While the Angel fights were nicely animated the human characters have somewhat limited animation. While it\'s wasn\'t bad it just didn\'t do much especially when the series likes to use stock footage and animation shortcuts.Sound.If there was one word to describe the soundtrack of Angelic Layer, it would be forgettable. Apart from three to two tracks, I can\'t remember the tracks in Angelic Layer.The opening theme ""Be My Angel"" by Enomoto Atsuko is a decent opening theme that is upbeat and catchy.The ending themes, on the other hand, were pretty forgetful and dull.Now for sub vs dub.I only saw the first four episodes of Angelic Layer subbed and I thought it was pretty good. Not great but not too dull.The dub on other hand is pretty weak. Apart from Monical Raial as Tamoyo, the dub, in general, is pretty bad that it\'s filled with lacklustre to downright awful performances left and right. Stick with the sub for this one.Final Thoughts.I have mixed feelings towards Angelic Layer. On one hand, the premise and setup were very intriguing despite being weakly executed. I liked characters like\xa0Icchan and Tamayo as they were a joy to watch and I thought the some of the battles despite being very predictable were fun to watch. Unfortunately, Angelic Layer had a lot of problems that actually hurt it. The soundtrack minus the opening and ending themes were very forgetful and repetitive. Most of the characters apart from the ones that I just mentioned ranged from dull, mediocre, wasted potential to downright awful and the tournament ultimately ended up being tedious thanks to its massive plot armour and predictability.Your honestly better off watching Gundam Build Fighters as it\'s much better version of Angelic Layer that has a better character cast and a more intriguing tournament arc.Overall I enjoyed Angelic Layer, but I don\'t think it\'s a good show. It\'s a semi-decent series that\'s it\'s great for people who are under the age of 12 but completely falls for anyone who is over the age of 12.Final Score 6/10 three shows that I enjoy actually have more things going on outside its tournament nature in terms of story and charterers.As a fan of the sub genre self I decided to check out other kid tournament anime and the first anime that appeared other than the pretty good Danball Senki series which am currently watching from time of the review is Angelic Layer a 26 episode tournament series done by Studio Bones as featuring the art-style from Clamp. I went into this show with pretty high exceptions as I expected this show to be a engaging tournament show that had a good sci-fi tournament setting and fun and likeable characters.Unfortunately I didn\'t get any of that as show quickly devolves into a generic tournament anime that was filled with cliche characters and cheesy predictable writing that was too much for my tastes. Angelic Layer isn\'t a bad series, but I don\'t think it\'s all that great. It\'s a decent anime that is very enjoyable for children as well newer anime fans. However, if you like me who had lots of Kodomo tournament anime in the past, you will begin to see that Angelic Layer has a lot of small cracks which become larger as you progress the series to a point where the series starts falling apart in the end.Also get use of hearing the word predictable throughout this review.Story.The story follows sixth grader Misaki Suzuhara who has just moved to Tokyo to live with her aunt. When she arrived in Tokyo, she sees two battle between two dolls on a big live-screen called Angelic Layer which is a highly popular game in which players (called Deus) buy and custom-design dolls known as Angels that are moved by mental control when on a field called the ""layer.""She soon meets a guy with a lab coat named himself Icchan where he encourages Misaki to purchase and create her own angel. She ended up getting an angel that resembles the protagonist from Magic Knight Rayneth, and she calls it Hikaru. Despite being a clueless of the game in first glance she competes in tournaments and is assisted and watched carefully by Icchan and from there Misaki life as a competitive Angelic Layer player where she has to defeat other players to become the best like no one ever was.The story on paper was interesting and entertaining however it actual execution the story is boring and predictable. Am not joking when I say this but Angelic Layer is one of the most predictable stories I have ever seen and it\'s not for a good reason which falls into the shows cheesy writing which I will talk about in a bit. My problems in Angelic Layer begin with the overall pacing as the series is overall pretty inconsistent as it can go either way too fast or way too slow. It was okay in the first few episodes but it really got out of hand as the series went on as many of the fights seemed to either drag out just to fill the 20 minute mark or fights that are too short where they lasted 2 to 5 minutes. I will admit there were a couple of fights that solidly paced overall but the most part the pacing could have been a lot better.The pacing seemed to plays along with the shows cheesy writing.The writing in Angelic Layer is such that many of the dialogue and conflicts are cheesy for the sake of being cheesy. There\'s not much self-awareness as the series seemed to ride on the cheese train. It\'s gets even worst when the writing goes into full angst mode One of the example of this happens with one match of the tournament where Misaki is fighting a girl who complains about being too tall. Uhhhh what?On top of the inconsistent pacing and cheesy writing comes in the series of plot holes that ruined the story even more. I won\'t mention them here but can easily notice them as you watch the series itself.The worst thing about Angelic Layer is that is ultimately predictable, but it\'s not of a good reason. Personally, I don\'t mind predictable shows as long as they good characters that make it up unfortunately with the expectation of two characters which I mention in a bit the characters in Angelic Layer weren\'t not all that good. The battles in the Angelic Layer have predetermined meaning thanks to the power of-plot armour that Misaki has she cannot lose an Angel fight. She may lost once an Angel fight in the beginning but after that, she becomes an unstoppable god.As for the love triangle itself like with the tournament, it\'s very predictable and not well executed even though it had potential to be good.Overall the story of Angelic Layer was underwhelming. It had potential to be fun and interesting, but the predictable and cheesy writing ended up destroying all the shows potential of being a solid kid tournament anime.Characters.The characters, for the most part, aren\'t much better as they okay at best and at worst wasted potential. They are not necessarily bad characters it\'s just the writing at the various points ruined many of the characters in Angelic Layer.First up we have Misaki. Out of all the characters in Angelic Layer, she\'s easily the worst of the bunch. She\'s is a self-insert Mary sue who is simply perfect at everything. She doesn\'t much of a personality other that she is kind and clumsy and most of her dialogue was plain boring to listen. She slightly gets better in the final episodes but by then it\'s being its way too as she comes off as a bland and unlikable Mary Sue.Icchi Chan is a pretty cool character While he doesn\'t have much depth, his still, a pretty entertaining character who has a lot a charm though at times he does go completely off-rails for my liking at times.Next, we have Hatoko.Man what a wasted potential Hatoko was. She was a badass character in the first half but as the series progress, she loses her badassery to a point where she became nothing but cheer-leading fodder for Misaki. It\'s such a shame really.Now we get to my favourite character in Angelic Layer Tamayo.I really liked Tamayo I really enjoyed of what she did for her character. Despite being a cheerleader for Misaki she was filled with passion and joy. I really enjoyed her tomboyish characters towards the cast especially towards Kotoro and Misaki. Honesty she should have been a main protagonist rather than Misaki because she\'s not only interesting character that is filled with charisma but she was only character in Angelic Layer that wasn\'t a bore to watch. Thank god!!!Now we have Kotaro and not gonna lie he\'s is boring.He\'s just an incredibly bland character who simply allows Tamayo to do all her karate moves on him like a punching bag.

I found it from an anime mix AMV I saw on Youtube. I think that ""battle"" animes are usually boring and repetitive, but Angelic Layer wasn\'t. It had in depth fighting for every battle, and no two fights were the same. It also had a very nice twist at the end which was really cute! The characters were really thought out, too. Athough Misaki was the typical cute main character, I think that Tamayo was a really good character. And Icchan\'s personality was great. =)Overall, this anime was...amazing! It wasn\'t a masterpiece, but I found myself laughing a lot. It was intense and cute at the same time.

Also, this show is NOT widescreen, so that kind of disappointed me a little, but that doesn't really have...much to do with art.The sound was bad.

And sure, I ended up sympathising with two of them, but that didn't make them any less annoying at the end. I greatly enjoyed the other characters, however. Perhaps the three girls are good enough characters that they evoke an emotion in me - annoyance? Maybe. Who knows.

There are some scenes that are very sappy, but being a show aimed squarely at girls this is somewhat forgivable. Yet I was saying 'stop trying to make me cry, dammit, it's not that tragic! (sniff)' at several points. Yeah, I'm a big softie.The show manages to meld a couple sub plots involving the supporting cast that not only get good treatment, but are resolved in a satisfactory manner as well. On the supporting cast, outside of a couple minor characters whose only purpose is to further Misaki,...they each get a good amount of screen time so you get a sense of who they are. I did find Hatoko pushing my suspension of disbelief, though. It would have been much more believable if she were 8 or 9 years old, not 5, and I found it easier to pretend that she was.The fights themselves are very well animated, and quite well choreographed. Unfortunately, this is often at the expense of the rest of the shows animation, as it can be quite choppy at times. But since the fights take up much of the show, this is not a major problem. A nitpick about the fights: The show is inconsistent about the HP and damage done by the angels. Sometimes a punch will layer out, yet at others a mighty kick will do nothing. This leads to some fights were you're thinking 'hang on, wasn't she screwed just then?' It doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the fights overall, but just something I noticed.The dub acting was well done, for the most part. The main characters did a good job overall. There were some flat spots, and a number of occasions were the English script had a noticeable pause in the line to let the mouth flapping catch up. The biggest problem is the little children. Normally this wouldn't bother me so much as little children don't have big speaking roles, but this includes all of Hatokos spoken lines. She sounds in no way like a 5 year old, either in voice or script. Whilst her voice wasn't as grating as the other children, it wasn't....right.The music was entirely appropriate for the show, if somewhat forgettable. Overall, Angelic Layer is a pretty solid title, both for it's dramatic elements and its fighting elements. I think it manages quite a bit of universal appeal despite being marketed mainly for girls.On a side note, though I haven't read the manga in ages, I quite clearly remember the anime being a lot better than it. Not because the aciton sequneces make a whole lot more sense animated, but the story was made much more believable and I remember the animated postscript being much more satisfying. they each get a good amount of screen time so you get a sense of who they are.

A nitpick about the fights: The show is inconsistent about the HP and damage done by the angels. Sometimes a punch will layer out, yet at others a mighty kick will do nothing. This leads to some fights were you're thinking 'hang on, wasn't she screwed just then?' It doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the fights overall, but just something I noticed.The dub acting was well done, for the most part. The main characters did a good job overall. There were some flat spots, and a number of occasions were the English script had a noticeable pause in the line to let the mouth flapping catch up. The biggest problem is the little children. Normally this wouldn't bother me so much as little children don't have big speaking roles, but this includes all of Hatokos spoken lines. She sounds in no way like a 5 year old, either in voice or script. Whilst her voice wasn't as grating as the other children, it wasn't....right.The music was entirely appropriate for the show, if somewhat forgettable. Overall, Angelic Layer is a pretty solid title, both for it's dramatic elements and its fighting elements. I think it manages quite a bit of universal appeal despite being marketed mainly for girls.On a side note, though I haven't read the manga in ages, I quite clearly remember the anime being a lot better than it. Not because the aciton sequneces make a whole lot more sense animated, but the story was made much more believable and I remember the animated postscript being much more satisfying."", '[I dropped this show when i figured that no new rivals and angels will appear. Tell me if there\'s anything really entertaining after 21 ep.]This show was sort of entertaining, especially in its second half, after they modyfied the battle arena. In supokon-like animes like this one of the most interesting points is meeting new rivals with amazing skills and cool look; and also watching the protagonist become more and more skillful. So, here we get all of it.But let me tell you about the things that really suck here.1. the humour. poor Ogata guy2. one of the ideas of this anime is solving one\'s...psychological problems about the height. they tell us: ""You are a small person and hate it?

The costume designs, particularly of her doll Hikaru and that of the others she fights, are really appealing. It'd be so cool to get an angel make it look however you want, then fight on the layer.The plot of the anime is relatively good, although it mainly follows Misaki's fighting progress....There are relatively few characters, but they are in general well-developed. The music is repetitive, and you get well used to the themes, but that tends to be the norm for a lot of animes. The fight scenes are pretty darn cool, my favourites being the epic fight against Wizard near the end, and course Misaki's final fight.And one last thing. You've got to love the mad doctor Iichan  and his imaginative punishments for his second in command. Octopus down pants, anyone?

The first anime I watched, CCS, I was so in love with it for years. And the romance was amazing, compared to this - - the ending pretty much sucked.Unless your a fan for family reunions - which im not - you\'ll love it.Story: 8/10Overall, I felt the story was really good. It was passionate and lovey between the mother and daughter,...as you get to see Misaki develop her emotions. It also gives you that sense of finding your identity. The real problem, or issue i had was the ending. I\'m was quite hyped up about the romance in this anime, and in the end, Misaki never ended up with anyone, although you can refer she ends up with Ohijiro although she does say he\'s like a ""brother"". You still get the sense that Tomoyo and Kotarou end up together. Hikari also says at one point something along the lines of ""I still havent told him my feelings"" which is a big appointment  because that romance kinda goes no where once her mother appears.Art: 7/10I usually love CLAMP\'s artwork and would give it a 9/10. But for some reason, this just didnt appeal to me. Maybe it has to do with Misaki\'s hair style. it was always the same - quite boringSound: 6/10Okaii, most of the characters were fine but...... Misaki\'s voice made my ears bleed. Too squeaky, too high, too realistic. That\'s honestly all I got to say, and that\'s the minus 4 points there.Character 7/10Again, character development was nice, each character had their own story, and you got a feel for their situations.Enjoyment 8/10There were a lot of times I just couldn\'t stop watching, even though it\'s obvious Misaki would win, it was epic to see how she did. Also, once the romance began to flourish, I was really out of my seat. BIG BUMMEROverall: 8/10Honestly, I was thinking of giving it a 9 or 10 out of 10, and then the ending was a MAJOR disappointment. as you get to see Misaki develop her emotions.

I\'m all for battle anime about a sport where you control essentially, an avatar. The problem is the lack of any description of any fights.For a battle show, good fights make or break it since that is the only focus of the show. Yet, despite this focus on fights, the fights do not seem very exciting. While the show tries to create a sense of tension in the air when fighting, there are not enough descriptors, monologues, or commentary on the fights. Since it is a show about fighting, you would...think that it would almost be martial arts-like. You can customize your avatar to specialize in whatever you want. There are big sized avatars focused on strength, or more agile, smaller builds specialized in dodging and getting small hits to get advantages over time. Whatever you want your avatar to be, you can customize it to be tailored to your ideal fighter. While yes, the avatars have superhuman strength compared to humans--they can jump many feet into the air and leave afterimages--they still just fight with their hands and feet. There\'s no magic involved, and it\'s hand-to-hand combat, so you would imagine there to be an application of martial arts techniques. There aren\'t. You just see two players flail their hands around with barely any focus on the technique or strategy either player is using, then the fight ends.There are no rules for the fight. There are no people who specialize in running the clock, pushing people out of boundaries, or people who aim for specific joints to disable them, or people who go for light hits only to play for points only. The amount of damage an avatar can take varies from match to match, some matches only take one punch, while others take many hits. You have no idea how points or damage is acuumulated: do you take more damage if you get hit in the head? Is it game over if your head takes enough damage? If you hit their legs or damage something, do they get debuffs because of the injury?So, the fights basically don\'t matter. How are the characters? Very generic overall, but I thought the character dynamics between Misaki and Hatoko was only there to have some drama, which I think applies to the rest of the show as well. When Misaki performs cowardly in a fight and doesn\'t ""fully"" trust her doll, Hikaru, Hatako pouts and acts cold to Misaki. I thought they were pretty good friends? Hatako just brushes Misaki off and tells her she\'s no good without telling her why. By the way, Hatako is also like, 12 years old or something. Same thing goes for the relationship between Misaki and her mother. There\'s a very simple misuderstanding or lack of communication between the mother and daughter that ends up having the mother not talk to her daughter for many years. Basically, this strained relationship is only there to have the mother and daughter make up through Angelic Layer. I am also told that there\'s a love triangle drama as well, but I never got to that part of the show. Just a lackluster melodramatic show that can\'t actually prop characters up by themselves.The doctor was actually the only fun character. He\'s definitely a plot device to introduce the viewers to the game and also guide Misaki, but is ultimately a fun character that has his moments. The only ""good"" moment of the show for me, was when the doctor teaches Misaki how to practice movement in Angelic Layer by having her practice dance moves. While dance moves doesn\'t seem like it does anything, it actually provides timing movement quite well with your thoughts, which I thought was a nice little depth to the game. Too bad that\'s about as far it goes. As mentioned earlier, Angelic Layer fights are very simplified and almost don\'t even have enough detail for there to be an understanding of the game.Animation is pretty mediocre, but I\'m surprised at the amount of fights that get animated each episode, no matter how poor it looks. This show doesn\'t get any prizes for both animation and artstyle, but it\'s not the reason it sucks. I suspect the white stage is just a completely white stage rather than one that changes for each game, say, like a mountain or grassy plain, is due to the fact that it\'s easier to draw and animate both for the manga and the anime. think that it would almost be martial arts-like.

I loved it when I was 12. Not anymore. I wouldn't be able to sit through its sluggish pacing.It wasn't bad but there isn't a plot. I've seen this series more than once entirely. I was more attached to the characters than any of the Angel fights. There's a lot of plot armor and the fights didn't make much sense.Episode 25 to me was the best episode. The ending, what ending. That was disappointing. So Misaki's mom can suddenly walk by Christmas? All the emotional intensity was gone, just for one more fight.I do like the...story arc of Misaki and her mom more than her romance. I ended up rooting for the other pairing - Tamayo and Kotaro. They actually had a lot more chemistry and were more interesting to watch than Misaki and what's his face.It's average. story arc of Misaki and her mom more than her romance.

The winner knocks the other doll out of commission first. She enters the Kansai regional tournament, unaware that the mother she hasn\'t seen in years is the reigning national champion.Overall, I rate this a 5 and recommend you skip it. At the end I\'ll talk about some issues that contain spoilers, and mark it as such. The rest of the review shouldn\'t affect your enjoyment of the show. I will talk about the major aspects of the show, and what is good or bad about them.The story starts out...good, but fills with holes in the second half. The plot has a few threads: you have Misaki\'s tournament battles, the obligatory romance subplot, and her (nonexistent) relationship with her mom. Also, there are a few glaring similarities to Cardcaptor Sakura that I\'ll mention.*Tournament Arc:*The focus of the show is the battles, so if you\'re not interested in action you\'ll probably get bored. The action isn\'t anything amazing. Each episode is animated well enough, but the fights in each episode tend to use the same movements on a loop. Misaki, being the main character, mostly wins battles. In the beginning there are good reasons for this: she\'s a natural, she uses the strengths of her doll to the max, and she can learn moves instantly. She\'ll memorize the moves that other players pull on her and then use them on future opponents.One of the reasons the show goes downhill is that they run out of ways to make Misaki win the fight naturally. Now her doll can take punch after punch while barely taking damage, and then she\'ll one hit KO her opponent. It was plausible at first, if you consider the strength and placement of hits. It quickly pushes the suspension of disbelief when a nearly beaten Misaki can take a powerful hit and stay in the game, and moments later use the SAME EXACT ATTACK on the enemy and drain their entire health bar.There are MANY instances where an opponent is suddenly nerfed when they fight Misaki. More than once a doll is so fast that Misaki can\'t even see the movements, but a few episodes later they fight and Misaki can keep pace with them. Also, weapons are forbidden, but a few dolls use abilities that should definitely count as weapons (and are only loosely explained). The most egregious example is a giant unavoidable energy ball that explodes the entire playing field.There are also cheap moments to create suspense. Throughout almost the entire show, damage is calculated instantly. The moment one doll hits another their health bars update. Then there are a few moments where the health is ""Calculating"" to make you wait, wondering who wins the fight. It was already obvious who the winner would be from the story structure and these scenes just throw away the internal logic of the world for no gain.All of these problems appear in the final, climactic fight too. Even worse, Misaki\'s doll can push through a hard situation from sudden ""power of love"" that doesn\'t make sense in this world. All this did was give me some very unpleasant flashbacks to Lostorage Incited Wixoss.*Romance Arc:*The romance subplot is... there. There\'s the one dude that obviously likes Misaki, and there\'s a girl that likes him. It\'s exactly the subplot with Meiling, Shaoran, and Sakura again. Some spoilers about this later. There\'s also another guy that likes Misaki. Probably because she\'s the main character. I\'m reluctant to call any character a ""Mary Sue"" because of how overused the term is, but... there\'s literally a scene where like every character in the show talk about how much they love Misaki.For almost the entire runtime of the show, the whole romance arc is this conversation: ""You like her, don\'t you?"" ""N-N-N-No I don\'t know what you\'re talking about."" That stops being funny quickly.*Mother Arc:*Misaki\'s relationship with her mother is an interesting premise. You know that if Misaki keeps winning, she\'ll play against the champion and discover it is her mom. Misaki will meet people that know her mom, and she almost runs into the mom once or twice.Her mother had to leave, which is fine. But she could have at least written letters to Misaki. Now that Misaki is in Tokyo, they can meet in person whenever. The mother doesn\'t want to. She\'s a terrible mom. Wondering how/when Misaki and her mother will finally reunite isn\'t nearly as gripping when you think about how shitty the mom is.I\'d be hooked if I felt like Misaki was going to come to terms with her mother leaving her and accept that she\'s just a shitty mom and that Misaki should move on. This is not how the show like to portray the mom. The only character who really expresses any frustration with the mother\'s decisions is Misaki\'s aunt. Overall, it gives you the feeling that the writers don\'t think Misaki\'s mom is bad.*Characters:*Misaki is a likable enough protagonist, with a few quirks that stop her from being a blatant Sakura Kinomoto clone. She\'s small, and she likes Angelic Layer because age and size don\'t matter in the game. She likes to say that a lot. It\'s a pretty good message for a show. She loves her doll, like most players. She loves her doll to the point she has to overcome the fear of watching it be injured. Not only that, but she feels bad when she injures other dolls. Why does she play a game where the only goal is injure the dolls? Great question. I would have loved to see how Misaki feels about that.Misaki gets some development (and I hated it; more on that later) and that\'s about all the development. Side characters are mostly entertaining but don\'t change. Not much to say about them. None of them are bad, but none of them stand out either.You have the weekly enemy who has some sort of personal issue and they think winning will fix it. Misaki wins instead and then is nice to them. Suddenly, ""Oh I see I was thinking about this game all wrong. Misaki showed me the goal is to have fun and I love her now."" Then they make cameos in future episodes to support Misaki. It\'s par for the course.*Overall:*It was cute in the beginning. It\'s funny, you like the characters, it\'s pleasing to look at, and you want Misaki to do her best and win. Then she starts winning for no reason, character development doesn\'t happen, and the show just fizzles out with an undeserved and unexplained ""power of love"" ending. I had a good time in the first half, but when I think about the show, I think about the ending. I do not recommend.*SPOILERS:*So, the romance plot? Goes nowhere. The guys that likes Misaki, he never tells her. There\'s the girl that likes him. She tells him, he doesn\'t know how to feel about it, and they never resolve that. It ends with them being awkward around each other. Super depressing.Misaki admits to herself how lonely she is without the mom and stops pretending to be strong. She wonders why her mom is avoiding her. She realizes her mom knew she was in Tokyo and had the opportunity to see Misaki multiple times. Then they meet up and they talk, the mom offers no good reasons for abandoning her daughter. Misaki says ""well I could have been more selfish in demanding to talk to you"" and they make up. None of the characters ever seriously call out the mom for what she did wrong. This really killed the heart of the show for me. good, but fills with holes in the second half.

They have produced many known titles and have created many all time classic characters. Sadly, the thing that makes their stories so interesting is the same that eventually bogs them down. They rarely develop and if they do, it is usually rushed and in the final parts of the story. That is seen as a hook for most who keep watching in hopes of something good to happen, only to be eventually disappointed most of the times with stories which have catchy themes and potential for greatness but are otherwise ruined in the name...of cute characters doing silly stuff.I won’t lie, cute sells. So does taboo romance, a thing CLAMP throw around in their stories all the time. Most of my interest in works like RG Veda or Card Captor Sakura was about finding out what the outcome of all those kinky relationships would be. Plot? What plot? Who cares about that? Gimme cute characters in kinky relationships!And this is eventually what makes Angelic Layer to be one of their least good works. The story is again two lines long, the characters are static as usual… but there is no kinky romance to make up for it! Yes, it sounds pretty lame saying such a thing but trust me, most of the appeal CLAMP stories have is their characters’ weird sexual preferences. And this particular title has almost zero. It has just a “normal” kiddy romance with the only twist being a possible triangle that never escalated into a cat fight. No catfight = no romantic triangle. Well that ruined most of the appeal!Even the concept of the story isn’t very interesting. It is basically proxy battles around a children’s fighting game, which is not very violent or exciting. The battles are somewhat done nicely, with basic choreography and high octane music. But they are all so… bloodless! No fatalities, no dismemberments, not even shred clothes most of the times. Some say it is just a show for kids but I say I had Jumaru levels of violence 4 decades ago which, guess what, was also a show for kids. If you happen to have watched the similar Plawres Sanshirou, a much older and yet much more action-based series, you will understand what I mean. The robots there were shred to pieces, oil was spilling around, they needed maintenance, they had upgrades, they needed basic programming based on martial arts! Those were some really damn entertaining proxy battles! Angelic Layer on the other hand is just Barbie the Wrestler serving tea to Ken.Furthermore the story doesn’t even try to explore its own concept. The Angels are supposed to be fighting dolls that move through their master’s brainwaves. Plus, it is stated several times that they resemble their masters’ in behavior. If they had bothered to show the dolls having emotions or a bit of free will outside of battles, I would have liked all this mess a lot more. Imagine Misaki’s doll saying or doing anything she is too afraid to say or do by herself. Imagine the same for everyone else, having his or her doll being the expression of their real inner selves that they can’t show directly. But nooo, they are just mooks. They play no part in the story whatsoever. They are not even characters! Just dolls their masters play with, like middle aged otakus.And that is how they wasted the only thing that could have made this anime great. The dolls are just… dolls. Their only purpose is product placement. And, hello, is it me or are almost all dolls females dressed in skimpy outfits? Was that some sort or attraction for plamo fans? I’m sorry, we have Queen’s Blade and their peripheral titles for that. That does it; Jumaru, kick the living shit out of them!Outside the battles, animation and music are plain average. The setting is somewhat futuristic and the characters are cute but it ain’t something worth remembering. The story is as I said, a typical CLAMP one. A good premise that goes nowhere. It’s just a girl who is looking for her mother and, oh, just starts playing a game with dolls for fun and, oh, wins all the time against pro players despite being a rookie and, oh, a friend of hers likes her and, oh, the champion in the game so happens to… be her mother. Like, what are the odds of that happening.Overall, this is quite the passable title, it has zero replay value and has nothing you can’t find way better elsewhere. of cute characters doing silly stuff.I won’t lie, cute sells. So does taboo romance, a thing CLAMP throw around in their stories all the time. Most of my interest in works like RG Veda or Card Captor Sakura was about finding out what the outcome of all those kinky relationships would be. Plot? What plot? Who cares about that?

Imouto sae Ireba Ii.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35413/Imouto_sae_Ireba_Ii,"[""This season of anime was one to look forward to, with popular series like Umaru and Gintama gaining new additions to their story. However there were a couple of new additions that have stood out as well (namely Blend S and Mahoutsukai no Yome). That being said Imouto sae ireba is my pick of this season. The reason simply being because its good at its genre. Compared to Blend S forgetting about the settings of their MC (I can only assume it has something to do with wanting the audience to actually like her) and Mahoutsukai no yome merely touching upon dependence rather than love,...Imouto Sae Ireba is a story about a group of people finding their direction in life.Story 8/10A lot of you who just watched the first episode are probably bloody confused, the first 5 minutes in nothing but ecchi, and cringey ecchi on top of that. But thats where the protagonist fits in, his love is cringey/unconditional due to the experiences he has had in life, however this series focuses as much on the MC as it does everyone else, meaning that towards the end there is only one character who really brings forth these scenes.The story itself is episodic and whilst there are buildups that helps with the flow, that being said its not one of those exciting ones, just a warm and fuzzy story which is why I cannot give it a great score despite my liking it.Art 8/10The art is a bit more different from the usual anime,  that is not to say it isn't good, but its something to bear when watching the thing. There isn't much to say aside from that, but I do know some who were slightly put off by this art style.Sound 8/10Opening was great, thats one thing all the new anime have in common this season. But the actual bgm/ost in this doesn't really stand out. Once again simply because of the type of anime, but for the most part it compliments the story and doesn't feel out of place.Characters 9/10This is where the anime stands out for me, with an anime like this the characters are the focus and the story is merely a means to compliment them. You have the passionate MC who as I've mentioned before is slightly eccentric, the reason for this was explored slightly too late for my taste, a mistake a lot of anime make, but even without the reasoning it should be too hard to empathize with. On top of that you have a small assortment of females, each with their own reason for being there and supporting the MCs. That being said there is none of the typical cat fights that go on in so many anime, instead its more of a slow paced romance that eventually falls into place.The relationship between characters is rather dynamic and there are many small changes in the story that put said relationships to the test, which is always good to see.Overall 8.5/10I personally put 9 in my score, but 8.5 is probably slightly more accurate. A good one to watch if you have the time and managed to muddle your way past the first episode but for those who are expecting an ecchi incest anime its probably better to give this one a miss.

Bah, I\'m getting ahead of myself.  Let\'s just get into this thing.Story:First off, ignore the first five minutes.  As a writer, Hashima Itsuki is peculiar.  After getting an earful from his editor for the umpteenth time, he goes off on his usual schpeel about the greatness that is the \'imouto\', before being promptly told to take...his work seriously and get his shit done on time, like any novelist with a deadline.  And so, that\'s...basically where our story starts.Based solely on its cast, Imouto Sae (that\'s my shorthand this time around) is a slice of life romp seen through the eyes of its literature-based cast as Itsuki and the rest of the main cast do what writers do.  Each episode is focused on the character interactions between the cast, whether it be for research for someone\'s book or spending time with one another through games that act more as a creative exercise for their brains.  The show\'s naturally lax nature exudes the slice of life genre, utilizing a brand of conversational humor with the main focus being what the oddities that are its characters and how they are as people as the brunt of its comedic prowess.  On the outside, not much really happens since episode after episode, it\'s basically the same thing, but slowly, we watch as more minute and complex matter arise.At times, the show ever so slightly shaves away its naturally fluffy and slice of life feel and touches upon the \'writer\'s struggle\', or at least those relating to LN authors that adds more to the show.  We sort of see the individual problems that each of the authors in the show face, touching upon different personal problems that add a nice subtlety to the overall story as the sunshine and rainbow of everything we see sheds away for that brief, sober moment amidst the characters\' happily drunk nature being published authors.Yet despite that, the one problem I see from the show is that nothing seems to change.  Sure there\'re events that lead one thing to another, but because the slightly deeper moments of the show fade away once they\'re over and leave but a shadow of their impact, much of what we get is the status quo which, while amusing, poses a problem when the moments of deeper thought were only just a few minutes ago.  The ending also leaves a lot of loose ends that I\'m not particularly fond of.  Kind of like a \'read the manga\' ending, but not so assholeish that they stop in the middle of some plotline that you\'ll never get an answer to.Overview:+ Provides a nice look into the \'writer\'s struggle\'+ Never melodramatic despite being a show featuring interpersonal relationships and such-  Tends to stick too much to the status quo-  A bit too many loose ends by the endCharacters:A connoisseur of the little sister, Hashima Itsuki is the writer of a magic academy series, or by its other name, \'trash\'.  (I jest, I jest.)  Initially seen as nothing but a pervert too prideful in his own work, Itsuki has many moments where his inferiority shows through the cracks, and the cheerful facade that we see through most of the show slowly fades away as he reveals his own insecurities as a writer.  As someone who\'s also been guilty of saying  ""I\'m not good enough"" to myself, I find Itsuki to exemplify much the internal battle inside someone who writes, with just enough of this hidden side of him to give us a proper character.Despite that subtle complexity, the true star of the show (at least in my eyes) is Nayuta herself, the popular 18 year old novelist who from episode one has never stopped trying to get into Itsuki\'s pants without committing a crime in the process.  A natural prodigy at writing, much of her story lies in the events that led her to becomes the girl that we see her as now.  It\'s less of a writer\'s struggle, and more of a personal struggle, but all the same is done in a way that adds just enough to her character to give us the viewer some more information.  Aside from that though, Nayuta acts much like a supplementary character to Itsuki, giving him the drive to be the writer he always wanted to be.  Their relationship is cute, and I personally really like the direction they went to explain why things between the two are the way they are.To round out the quartet, both Miyako and Haruto act as similar characters with their issues, boasting a personal and professional struggle respectively that again, adds enough to their characters to bolster and solidify their problems as looming parts of their lives, like how normal people are.Aside from them, the cast is filled with a cast of colorful weirdos that spice up the gaps that the main cast leaves behind.  Everything from an accountant who takes joy in the squirming in others to a mangaka who wears a ribbon of questionable material provides us with a weird yet amusing spectrum that makes the episodes that much more fun.Overview:+ Rounded main cast+ Amusing side castArt:Produced by Silver Link, the show replicates the original artist Kantoku\'s style of the slightly muted color palette in conjunction of super shiny, almost reflective hair that\'s commonplace in the works he draws for.  Art quality is very consistent throughout due to the show\'s severe lack of need for any taxing animation (since everyone basically just sits around), and stands as a nice relaxing sight without anything bad to note.As far as fanservice goes, the show does have several choice moments that are certainly more risque than what the rest of the show is in comparison, but it\'s super tame, and if it ever gets out of hand, the show goes to use its various colorful slides with text on the front for \'censorship\'.  One of the most amusing ways to censor something if you ask me.  (Though I will admit that Nayuta is the cause of most if not all of these so blame her.)  Most of the perverted comedy is done through innuendos and spoken words, so visually, it\'s not severely apparent.Overview:+ Consistent quality+/- Some fanservice, but not muchSound:Chouchou\'s ""Ashita no Kimi sae Ireba Ii."" stands as a song that when combined with the visuals, harkens to the whimsy that authors feel when writing their works, the wonder than a person feels when they put their imagination on paper.  Personally, I feel like many of her other songs are more memorable, but this is no way a bad song and given the placement and usage of this song in the series, certainly has its impact.On the flipside, Aria Yuuki\'s ""Donna Hoshizora yori mo, Donna Omoide yori mo"" is a more somber piece that ends the episode on a calming and closing note that compared to the slightly more energetic whimsy of its OP counterpart, gives us pleasing resolution to the episode rather than some seiyuu song or something that doesn\'t have much impactOverview:+ Nice and whimsical tracksPersonal Enjoyment:I think my first reaction to watching this show\'s PV was \'Yes\'.  Not for really any particular reason, but it just seemed like the show I was really going to like.  And surprise surprise, it was.  It has the quality of touching on the personal problems and the insecurities and stress of making a good story and making a name for yourself in the publishing world without succumbing to melodrama or any kind of super contrived storyline which is refreshing in a landscape where anything drama-based resorts to melodrama.  It\'s a show I watched because I was intrigued, but stayed because I genuinely resonated with the characters having had tinges of these problems myself when writing stuff in my own time.  So for that, I appreciate this show and am really glad that this was something on my seasonal list.Did I like this show?If I haven\'t sung enough praises about my enjoyment of this show, then yes, I did like the show.  In particular, I really like Nayuta.  I\'m always a fan of girls who know what they want and earnestly strive for that person they love because often times you get tsunderes or some other stupid trope of girls undeserving of the happy ending they get in the end without rhyme or reason.  (Abuse is not love, girls)  But more than that, the relationship both professional and personal between Itsuki and Nayuta stands as one of my absolute favorite things of the show because there is reason why Itsuki doesn\'t take the plunge and overall gives more depth to the protagonist.What didn\'t I like about this show?Nothing particularly irked me, but my only wish is that somehow they continue this.  The loose ends were vaguely irritating and given the setup that we were given in the last few minutes, a sequel is all the more possible from that.  (We do not talk about the first five minutes of the entire show.  That shit is repressed.)Would I recommend this show?Personally, I say yes.  Though the show is infamous for the first five minutes of the first episode, if you do get past that gate (and trust me, there is an explanation), you are in for a slice of life adventure that really is more than meets the eye.  It\'s a lax show focused entirely on its characters and their interactions, taking time every now and then to expand upon its cast to smooth and polish them out a little more for depth.  Plus it\'s got a nice helping of wackiness that makes things a helluva lot more entertaining than it should. his work seriously and get his shit done on time, like any novelist with a deadline.

I mean if I wanted to watch game reviews I would open Youtube.the second route was the ""Every Male character has to have a Female character to end up with at the end"" route and it is self explanatory when you think about it, while I do hate those shitty cliches that wasn\'t the reason I hated this one, what I hated about this route is that it was extremely forced, one of the characters turned into a molester and yet the female character acted like nothing happened after that, The MC was suddenly in love with the heroine which is pretty illogical because at that time if he were to love someone it would be Miyako not the heroine, Haruto suddenly fell in love with a Miyako and that was pretty much the only thing that could be acceptable out of all the stuff that happened.The problem is that even after all that the anime didn\'t go through with neither the important stuff we wanted to see nor those routes it started, some episodes were genuinely funny and enjoyable so I have to give them that but the premise the anime had at the start vanished and it felt like watching an episodic anime where each episode has nothing to do with the others and that definitely wasn\'t what the anime was supposed to be like at least not from the start, after all that the anime ended in a bad way,the backstory we should have known about at an earlier stage (IMO) was finally out in the finale and a game review with pretty much the characters ending in a way that shows absolutely 0 character progression and lots of stuff that was supposedly meant to be resolved was left out just like that, even the part with the molester was supposed to be an introduction to the relationship of the little sister with the guy and yet even that didn\'t happen.The anime was a disappointment tbh and a complete waste of what could\'ve been a great slice of life.Overall I would give the anime a generous 4/10.Wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone. felt inferior to them and that as a setting was very good and I thought we were gonna see some good drama from that but nope all that ended after episode 3 or something.TL;DR : The anime was extremely random and didn\'t follow any route or try to create and continue anything that it started.The anime then went after 2 routes:the first route was the game reviews we see in 4 or 5 episodes out of 12 which ruined a lot of things, it was pretty much filler at this point, some of them were nice but when 1/3 of the anime is game reviews then it isn\'t really helping it\'s case, is it?

So many of the reviews I see here are completely inaccurate, and it\'s pissing me off. Please? Actually watch the anime? Thank you?Now, getting into the meat of my review; this anime is not your run of the mill generic imouto anime. I actually can\'t stand that genre, and always drop it. In fact, I have refused to even touch Oreimo. HOWEVER, this has almost no focus on little sisters at all plot wise. The main character himself is obsessed with little sisters, but spoilers, doesn\'t actually obsess over a real...sister. Instead, you watch his interactions with his friends, his struggle to become a successful author, and his journey towards being someone he can be proud of. Each and every character in the anime has a story. They each own a flaw, and their personalities are all memorable. Although there\'s some stupid crap that pops up every now and then, like the first 5 minutes of the first episode, there\'s so much more to the anime than meets the eye. I never ever write reviews, and in fact this is my first one. It\'s not like this is my number 1 favorite anime or anything, (ATLA all the way idc I know it\'s a cartoon)  (also konosuba <3) but it deserves a higher rating than just 6.79. Seriously??? You\'re giving this anime a 6.79??? The music isn\'t like orchestral, but I personally enjoy it a lot. The art is beautiful, with an extra wallpaper-esque picture at the end of each episode (which is a courtesy might I add). The plot is really light-hearted and fun with a dark undertone that is actually expanded upon. The characters are all unique, quirky, flawed, and relatable. As for enjoyment, frankly it is something I look forward to watching each week. People are just band-wagoning over anime like Black Clover, complaining about how crap it is, and then continue to watch it while completely disregarding actually quality anime like this one. This anime shows the struggles of being an author, the struggles of failure, and struggles of being unable to express your true feelings. I can relate to a lot of what goes on in this anime, and it always leaves a smile on my face.In conclusion, I know this review sounded like a rant, but I don\'t care. How would you like it if your hard work was disregarded by the majority because they just assumed that it was ""like the rest of the genre"". It\'s like the racism of entertainment. This anime deserves respect, and it is 100% worth giving a try. Now while in my opinion it\'s probably more of a 8.5 to 9 out of 10, I\'ll give it a 10/10 to help balance out the ignorant fools who give it 1s and 2s without actually watching it.Give it a try, you might like it more than you think you will :) sister.

I write this review having seen only the anime, and mentioning only what is revealed in the synopsis above.Imouto sae Ireba Ii:""Normie Barrier""""Fanservice-driven""""Trash""...I think every one of these labels is a great and common excuse for many people to stop or avoid watching this series. I think each is painfully inaccurate. I\'ll explain why I believe that is true, and why I believe this is possibly the best series I\'ve seen this year so far (clearly it is not yet finished).Anime, manga, and light novels are experiencing a dearth of material to bring the high school audience into early adulthood. How does someone in or graduating college relate to the struggles of high school, which they are quickly forgetting? I wholeheartedly believe that Imouto sae Ireba Ii fills that gap in a meaningful way.The characters in this anime each represent the difficulties and insecurities of being in your 20\'s, whether that is through a feeling of inferiority, purposelessness, or pressure to succeed. The art and production aid the expression of these feelings with intimate depictions of each person that feel deliberate and compelling. There is a communal feeling in this series that is born out of a rich tapestry of relationships, allowing us to learn more about the characters without so much of the explicit and forced exposition common in the slice of life genre.The comedy in this series also demands greater scrutiny than a simple rehearsal of tropes. Viewers receive much of the humor from understanding things about the relationships between characters that they never could, and that pays off more with each episode. Music is mixed and reworked to frame scenes and enhance the comedic pacing. Humor is also drawn from some very common themes and concepts within the Imouto genre, especially the ""meta"" approach to storytelling, considering the protagonist is a light novel writer. The self-referential approach to comedy here is not necessarily unique, but Yomi Hirasaka accomplishes it with measured grace that tends to avoid pandering for attention.From here on, I want to take a hard look at the aforementioned labels/criticisms of Imouto sae Ireba Ii.""Normie Barrier""Everyone\'s favorite talking point seems to be the beginning of this show. I will not waste time explaining why art needs a chance, but I will say that the storytelling proves itself to be demonstrative. Instead of being handed a list of the likes and dislikes of a character, viewers are shown through reactions and fantasies. Showing instead of telling is something far too many anime forget to do, especially for such a visual medium. Things that shock or confuse you can be difficult to ingest, but sometimes that reaction is necessary as a narrative device.""Fanservice-driven""If this series were driven by fanservice, it would be immensely different. I find myself laughing more often than not when it occurs, and I believe there are subtle cues that differentiate the depictions of this anime\'s characters from ecchi anime. I believe that the art does not contain the sort of detail in suggestive scenes that portends fanservice. I also think that the development of the characters justifies most instances of fanservice that occur. Is there fanservice for fanservice\'s sake? Probably. Is it a driving narrative force at any point in the show? Absolutely not.""Trash""This show is in part about people with hobbies or occupations that ostracize them, and that is completely intentional. We cannot hope to understand the development of a siscon author writing novels without getting behind what makes him that. There can be a compelling story that does not focus on a main character with a traditional background or psyche. We do not need to be able to project ourselves on to any of the characters to relate to them, and that is the beauty of this anime.All of this said, there is a reason that I give this anime a 9 instead of a 10, and that is because I have to admit that there have been one or two short, one-off scenes that display some sexually aggressive behavior that does not have a purpose in the story. I did not think that these moments felt cohesive, and I am tempted to disregard them in my enjoyment, but I cannot ignore their presence in this review.In summation: Imouto sae Ireba Ii is a compelling representation of the trials and tribulations that come after realizing you\'ve grown up. This show displays a storytelling prowess that stems from the honesty with which it delves into relationships, and the synchronicity of its art and music. The common criticisms of this show seem unwarranted in the face of its intentionality, but that isn\'t something that a viewer could hope to fully understand in just one or two episodes. I encourage everyone to form their own opinion of this show, because the carefulness of its writing and production more than deserves that much.9/10 I think every one of these labels is a great and common excuse for many people to stop or avoid watching this series.

Good, because our protagonist Itsuki loves them probably more than you do. I give this anime an overall score of 6, but that does not mean I think it is distasteful. In fact I think that some people will give this anime a 8 or 9, maybe even a 10. This review is a spoiler-free review by the way, but it would not hurt for people who have watched this anime already to read this review too.Story:I acknowledge how the story may seem non linear at times, but I assure you that this anime actually has an excellent narrative....The overall plot is Itsuki, an aspiring author, making his way through the light novel industry while passing through hardships. It is a story of friendship and comedy for the most part, but I would pay more attention to the background. This story is actually about a depressed young man who fights against reality, diving into his own form of escapism, probably retreating into his perverted light novels, only to realize how his peers have earned successes that he has yet to earn himself. For instance, one of his friends is a much more talented writer while the other has an anime in the works. Itsuki deals with his issue by not caring about it. As the anime goes on, you will find Itsuki making peace with himself, and I feel that this narrative would be enjoyable for literally anyone who has felt at least a taste of depression. The flaw to this narrative, however, is that it lacks a dark theme since this narrative only lies in the background, but the anime makes it obvious enough for an attentive audience to peace this together. So now that I have pointed out where your attention should be, I think you would find the story to be at least above average. (8)Art:Given the silver link art quality, I thought this anime would be able to use art to its advantage. I was right in some parts as the art is often used to show Itsuki's room clearly and everything outside as a foggy and generic setting. Although it gives the impression that Itsuki himself views the rest of the world as irrelevant, I feel that scenes where some of the girls are naked are more horrific rather than enjoyable. Now that I'm here, I would like to emphasize that the fan service is not good. I'm not a personal fan of fan service, but the anime is willing devote 5 minutes every two episodes to only showing fan service to the reader. (6)Sound:This is the worst category for good reason. So I did not hear anything in the background, I do not know why. Maybe it is to illustrate how Itsuki is living in the real world, but I think it is because the show did not have enough budget. Nevertheless the opening and ending are great, but I think the overall soundtrack could be used to describe the anime's overall mood rather than a deafening silence. (4)Character:Earlier I mentioned how this anime is actually a narrative of a depressed young man. That was a lie. This anime is really a narrative about multiple depressed people that hide their flaws from each other. I'm not going to say any spoilers, but I will just say that every episode has a little crack of the character and you will enjoy, or sympathize, with the character when he or she breaks. (8)Enjoyment:Please take this category with a grain of salt. I thought it was at best fair. I could see how other people would enjoy this anime more than I did because I really liked the episodes when the characters played board games, showing there inner flaws or making a spoof of another popular work, but I thought that the overall silence of the anime was very unfavorable. I suggest that you just pay attention to the character's dialogue because they really are interesting at times, and I also recommend that you treat this anime as a totally different work from the likes of Shirabako or any other anime with a Japanese entertainment industry. (6)Overall:This anime has its ups and downs, but I just have to give it a little more than average. I predict that there will be many who enjoy this and many who don't, but it's really a coin toss. Would you be willing to toss that coin? I would. There is something for anybody in this anime, but if you are more of a edgy type of guy I would say this anime is not for you.

(6)"", '#4If this anime didn’t have the slightest mention of sisters, it would be a pretty solid anime. It was actually pretty enjoyable and quite nice when the main character wasn’t talking about his dark twisted fantasies. How is the MC not in jail? Like, this anime had some SERIOUS potential considering it had a semi decent story and message, but it was completely ruined by fan service that was uncalled for. The FBI could be at my very door step… wait… I GOTTA RUN ITS ALL THIS SHOWS FAULT!!!! DON’T WATCH!!!Seeing the MC suffer was a highlight4/10 ', 'ImoSae was just as if not shittier than Eromanga.The only reason I didn\'t drop it was because I always pick a show every season and watch it precisely because it\'s terrible to make me feel thankful for the existence of actual good shows.( Previous season it was ""in another world with my smartphone"". God damn it was bad lol ).The show tried to force kanikou down my throat and into my heart and it failed miserably.They went for the trope of the girl who\'s very ""lewd"" and always aggressively coming onto the MC but blushes and shuts down when he ""unintentionally"" comes onto her....I hate those.She also says Nyaa all the time for no fucking reason and it\'s very annoying. You don\'t get to say Nyaa unless you\'re a cat girl or you\'re just saying it in a comedic bit.Also why the fuck is this an imouto series if the main heroine is not even an imouto.There was no point in the orange hair girl(super boring bitch),the glasses novelist(thinks he\'s rivals with MC but it\'s one sided and sad lol), the mangaka(wtf.) and the ass fetish artist(so annoying , I thought it was a girl at first) even existing, they\'re barely relevant to the ""story"".They also went for the ""make reference to other anime to make us seem cool"" trope, Bringing up Kobato from haganai, komachi from oregairu ,OreImo and Eromanga. Just to say that ""Hey there fellow kids! these shows are totally great and we totally love them too, please watch our show we\'re so relatable xd lol Fidget spinners lmao dab haha "".There was only one moment in ep 11 that I found touching but it was concerning KaniTRASH so i didn\'t really give a shit lol. but other than that they just play board games and hang out all the time, like it\'s some shitty slice-of-life anime. It\'s so fucking boring and the ""comedy"" is so bad it\'s sad.The art like most other LN anime was pretty bland and got worse as the episodes went on.There was one soundtrack I enjoyed. other than that it wasn\'t anything special.I felt like gouging my eyes out while watching this show at least twice per episode.Then again if you\'re someone who enjoys trash imouto shows such as OreImo and Eromanga then you should watch it lol.P.S: *SPOILER*To the show\'s credit, I did laugh once.

People can’t blame them since the first episode was a giant normie filter.Nevertheless, you shouldn’t judge it based on just the first impression.If you’re someone who’s new to watching anime, or someone who’s not comfortable watching 'unconventional' scenes, then this anime will probably throw you off. There’s a huge amount of sexual comments even in the first episode. The show doesn’t hold back when it comes to fan service. It’s a giant normie barrier.Your normie friend will go...crazy watching this show.But if you can overlook these things, there are many things that this anime has to offer.Let's skip discussing the plot and focus on two things that makes this anime good.On Being Informative:These are just small details, but the little explanation they add on some topics was a nice addition. For instance, the hometown tax, a system introduced in Japan in 2008, was briefly mentioned and explained in episode 4 of the anime.You just learned about taxes in an anime that has “Imouto” in its name. The anime also gives information about different things like drinks every episode. An example of that is the daiginjo sake featured in Episode 6.Nowadays, it's not common to find an anime that can both inform and entertain the viewers.On the Characters' Interactions:One of the good things about this anime is the characters’ interactions. It’s nothing spectacular but it’s definitely enjoyable. Scenes like Haruto and Itsuki getting teased, Miyako sympathizing with everyone, or when Itsuki struggles to meet the deadlines. We even get a general idea about the life of Light Novel authors in this anime.So..Should you watch Imouto sae Ireba Ii.?The show isn’t something spectacular, but it definitely has many things to offer. It’s a great and enjoyable anime that doesn’t have any complicated plot. Give it a try and watch a few episodes before deciding if you like it or not.Overall, I'll give it 8/10. crazy watching this show.But if you can overlook these things, there are many things that this anime has to offer.Let's skip discussing the plot and focus on two things that makes this anime good.On Being Informative:These are just small details, but the little explanation they add on some topics was a nice addition.

And there is that, main guy who has this fetish of having a sister, or wanting to be...in a incestuous relationship with a sister, that he doesn\'t have......oh he does have one , except that...either he knows that the step sister is just a cross-dressed bokuko or he\'s just plain stupid.Fair 6, Art:So Kani Nuyata has a habit of being a nudist when she is by her lonesome, so we have seen the girls being naked quite a number of times, but don\'t expect to see some frontal flash nor see any nipples or panties........Decent 4, Art:No comment, nothing to say and I don\'t care.Pathetic 1, Character:So let\'s go over them:Hashima Itsuki- At first you might think that he the usual quintessential oblivious guy, who doesn\'t know about the girls whom were having feeling for him, until he blurts out ""I wanna a sister"" as it turns out,  he\'s siscon without a sister or has a sister (Step Sister that is) that he doesn\'t even know that he is a she. Also, he likes Nuyata, but has a lot of fuss about even having a relationship with her. There is Miyako, for some reason who keeps hanging out with him and his gang of authors who obviously likes him but keeps playing the oblivious card with her. So therefore for him alone the score was for him.Nuyuta Kani- I kinda like her free spirit and directness of liking Itsuki, but she kinda strikes me as a she pervert who can have some yuri sex with every female characters around here and still have some energy left to do it with Itsuki.Shirakawa Miyako- Is a fish out of the water around with Itsuki and his gang of authors. In fact she should have just left that loser, Itsuki for ditching college where he would have had a much better future than being an author  where your works are as good as your previous ones. To me , I see her character of being better off without Itsuki and his gang and going on her own with her classmates. So just hanging out with a loser like Itsuki, she\'s another reason for the low score in my book.Hashima Chihiro- Ok, so she\'s Itsuki\'s step sister who is a cross-dressed bokuko, so just how long would a guy take to know that he is a she? And how pathetic he was to not notice and it has to take Nuyuta and Ashley to know that she is a girl, so that another nail to the coffin.Fuwa Haruto- Well, he seem like a guy who is doing well, much better than Itsuki and Nuyuta in fact......Then again , I\'m glad he didn\'t get to be in a relationship with Miyako.Ena Setsuna and Mikuniyama Kaiko- one thing I can say with these two, which one of them is Itsuki\'s illustrator? Btw Mikuniyama, strikes me as some who could have sex with Nuyuta all day, while Ena, can pass as a sex offender.Ono Ashley- Strikes me as a harem girl who can have sex both with Itsuki and Haruto.And my fave character, Toki Kenjurou, my man can really kick Itsuki\'s butt.Good 7, Enjoyment:Well, part of me really want\'s the possibility that Itsuki would either reveal that he always know that Chihiro is a girl and the he had a serious relationship with Nuyuta, but part of me also , want\'s to see him fail, good as it it, it is just not good enough.Fair 6, Overall:I may like this anime for the character\'s stupidity , but overall it\'s still a face palm.Merry Christmas in a incestuous relationship with a sister, that he doesn\'t have......oh he does have one , except that...either he knows that the step sister is just a cross-dressed bokuko or he\'s just plain stupid.Fair 6, Art:So Kani Nuyata has a habit of being a nudist when she is by her lonesome, so we have seen the girls being naked quite a number of times, but don\'t expect to see some frontal flash nor see any nipples or panties........Decent 4, Art:No comment, nothing to say and I don\'t care.Pathetic 1, Character:So let\'s go over them:Hashima Itsuki- At first you might think that he the usual quintessential oblivious guy, who doesn\'t know about the girls whom were having feeling for him, until he blurts out ""I wanna a sister"" as it turns out,  he\'s siscon without a sister or has a sister (Step Sister that is) that he doesn\'t even know that he is a she.

The first two minutes are COMPLETELY different from the rest of the show and is only there for comedic effect (something it overdoes actually.)This show is definitely brilliant if you give it a chance, that being said it's not for every anime watcher. For a nice comedic and a little bit of a slice of life anime I highly recommend this.Do note that some of the humour is aimed at an older audience and some humour might be too sexual for younger...viewers viewers"", ""At first, going into this anime, the first impression gave you of it is simple and filled with fanservice. However, it ends only there; it will just be another one of those all so famous Imouto anime you see nowadays. However, that's quite the false alarm, because, for me, I was pleasantly surprised to find out what this anime is actually like.It's nothing like what you might think at first glance; it's a lot more and to put it easy, its delightful, quirky romance with a dash of a slice of life added in the mix. I won't deny you will see fanservice now...and then, but then again, a tiny bit of ecchi has never hurt anybody. If it doesn't shove it in your face and it feels like a natural aspect to the anime, I don't see any issues with it.StoryThe anime follows a novelist, Itsuki Hashima who is quite obsessed with little sisters and tries to revolve his work around that. His goal is to one day create the ultimate younger sister novel. Despite its weird background for the plot, the anime delves into some realistic themes — both in his work and outside of life.  The anime is simple and straightforward, but it was a very entertaining watch for me, more than I am willing to admit. I would not mind a sequel because of that.ArtThe art for this kind of anime fits nicely, and it doesn't seem lacking from my understanding. It's cute, and moe, but have this certain mature vibe to it. I don't know how to put it any other way. Adding on, the facial expression and comedic moments hits well, and you don't see yourself yawning over how boring the art style is. It's simple but compliments the anime well and suits it well for this kind of anime.CharactersCharacters are all colorful and quirky; no one feels flat or dull. They all have something about them that can entertain you. Especially, a certain silver-haired female, Nayuta Kani. Without going too much into spoilers, let's say she is with a doubt one the reasons I liked this anime and want more. Her personality is so refreshing, and it's not something you see that much of anymore. She is to put it in laymen terms, quite the daredevil and unpredictable an overall super fun character to watch on screen, as her shenanigans with Itsuki unfold.She is my favorite character among everyone, but you have a good cast in here that feels alive and important. They are not just there to be there. The story might as well be around them, although, there is a set goal for our main character, Itsuki, that's no the only main focus here. It goes into the issue with making a light novel, romance problems which are handled realistically and don't come as forceful: even family issues and more, like the common problem you happen to come upon.The NegativeI enjoyed the anime from start to finish; I never taught it was tedious or boring. Sure, some arc did feel slightly rushed and certain moments with the game they were playing was kind of weird, I wanted them to focus more on the characters instead of that. This is my only gripe if you take into mind it was only a 13-episodes long first season. If it had more to offer, I would probably ignore it altogether. Also, mainly this is just a tiny gripe, nothing more or less. My overall enjoyment for this anime was barely affected by this one thing.The bigger issue is that there is no sequel for this anime, and although, it's not a negative aspect by itself, it does fit in here so, there is that. However, all said and done; I never had any problems that made me want to drop it or yawn as I was watching it. It was a good watch, and I am hoping we get a sequel soon, or I might start the light novel instead. Since, I am very curious where it will go in the future, what more problems will arise and... I do want more Nayuta, so there is that too.ConclusionThis anime was quite a pleasant surprise, one I am glad I did not skip over and got to experience. It had a surprisingly good cast of characters, and it was kind of it to delve into some realistic theme making it for an exciting and fresh watch if nothing else. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind ecchi and want something slightly different than the other anime which falls in the same category as this one.Overall ScoresStory: 8/10Characters: 8/10Art: 8.2/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 8.3/10 and then, but then again, a tiny bit of ecchi has never hurt anybody.

However one day, as I stumbled across it, I found that this anime is actually better than what most of us redeems it to be.Just to clarify, I only watched the anime, so this review is written with regards to the current episodes alone (5 ep up to now) without any insights from the original novel.Imouto sae Ireba Ii, an anime about a novelist and his friends, started off like any other daily-life animes. Compared to the others, one may think that the story is lacking in...depth and in plot, having some weird characters and a plain MC. Nevertheless, there are some heartwarming moments inside each episode that kept me on my toes, while the story itself is very relatable, describing the daily life of a novelist and his struggles while depicting his social circle.Character-wise, all of the characters have a personality of their own. The MC is a sistercon; his brother/sister that's perfect in all senses; different female characters that interact differently according to their personalities with the MC; the competition in life; all of them is helping to shape the MC into what he is, and while many of the characters might seem plain in the beginning, as the story goes on, we are guided into understanding each of the characters, and why they are important in their own aspects.The music is pretty good, so far I am very enjoying the OP, and funny musics usually accompany funny moments.The art is our usual art type, nothing fancy, nothing 3D, but this plain art-style fits perfectly with the type of story we are looking at.TL;DR I am enjoying this anime as it takes up a different approche than most of the other daily-life styled animes, the story might be bland, but more details are given by each epsiode. Most of the characters are relatable and fun, the art and sound are fine and overall enjoyable. I encourage everybody to give this a try. :) depth and in plot, having some weird characters and a plain MC.

I'm seeing that a lot of people dropped this anime early on/gave it a fairly low score. Please, DO NOT drop this anime. The first 6 episodes were essentially just memes, dick jokes and character introductions/getting us used to the dynamic of the characters. However, episode 8 brought a fairly interesting turn. I noticed early on, that the Romance in this Anime was kinda lacking. But, episode 8 changed that. After seeing episode 8, I can confirm that there is still hope left, and that this could potentially end pretty well. I won't spoil anything, but if...you must, you can skip to episode 6 and start there (I say start at episode 6, because episode 6 sets up for episode 7). Aside from that, just go try this Anime out.P.S. The main character actually has a little brother. He looks and sounds female, but he's a dude.

Yes or No= Yes, it is enjoyable and romance was not the aim for this anime ( but the manga does )Recommended ? Yes or No= Yes, some people may enjoy 'just characters sit down play board games and talk about their life'Nayuta Kani best girl ? Yes or Yes= Yes, she really deserves Itsuki's virginity and her's to be Itsuki's it.Okay for the story for me is 9/10, why?- Going through a fun ride with 12 episode of this is soo good, specially episode 10 ( Itsuki finally admits that she love Nayuta but not enough to show that he love her cause of his current stage/status ) that episode really hits the mark for me, and not enough backstory for Nayuta's past ( It was Bullying ) and really enjoy this 12 episode.- THIS IS NOT EROMANGA-SENSEI, this is far better than that Incest.- I want more episode, yes i want more because i want to know if Itsuki really end up with Nayuta and achieve his dreamThe Art is 8/10, my opinion :The Sound is 7/10 , my opinion also :- Okay the animation was pretty decent for me and the sound is just too casual but never ruined the story and the progress of each character, well the animation is just too cute for me because look at Nayuta, Miyako and Chihiro, they are cute ( hehe )Character ? 8/10 for me- The development is just centimeters by centimeters, i got confused in some episodes but really research for that.- This anime is just introductions for the story ( not yet the full ) but the execute of s*x jokes really hits home.- Slow phase you have to read the manga for backstory of the main character.ENJOYMENT? 10/10 mlg- I love this anime ( idk why ) but truly, this is the first show i watched that the title sounds like INCEST but nope, totally misleading, it's just a guy who love little sister for his manga ( sounds incest but okay ) and his little sister ( Reverse trap ) does not want his Oni-chan's peepee- Really doubt the first episode but damn episode 10 just got spicyOverall ? 8/10- There is lacking some development and some few plot holes, but never really bothered me since it's easier to research- Not much to talk about but i do enjoy this better than 'Eromanga-sensei' and 'my little sister cannot be this cute' ( i do not like hardcore incest )So would you watch this ? Yes or No= Yes, it is enjoyable and romance was not the aim for this anime ( but the manga does )Recommended ? Yes or No= Yes, some people may enjoy 'just characters sit down play board games and talk about their life'Nayuta Kani best girl ? Yes or Yes= Yes, she really deserves Itsuki's virginity and her's to be Itsuki's"", ""The award for the most misleading title goes to…!Probably not A Sister’s All You Need but it’s a pretty damn misleading name.It’s definitely caused a bit of confusion for people deciding whether to watch it or avoid it like the plague, so before I start the review I feel like it’s necessary to say what this show is and what it isn’t.This show isn’t...-A little sister romance.-A rip off of Eromanga-sensei.-Ecchi, but there are few over-the-top lengthy fanservice scenes.-A kids' show, despite how the characters appear....-The horrifying events that occur in the first 3 minutes. It gets better after that, I swear.This show is…-About the ups and downs of being an artist.-A character study. Yes, as ridiculous as that sounds this show is about the characters, not the story.-A (perverted) gag comedy.-Unfiltered. Characters do and say what they please. Be prepared to laugh and possibly to be offended.No time is spared in establishing the perverted tone. Within the first three minutes of episode one, the main character’s horrifying sister fantasy is shown to the audience in grotesque detail. Later it’s shown that the main character’s editor is reading then spitefully denying his appalling work as he drops the script to the table (not unlike how I initially dropped the show after only that first scene). The start of the show may be a bit alienating to anyone who isn’t prepared for a sis-con, but it does a good job of preparing you for the show’s absurdity even if no other scene reaches the heights of the first few minutes. Don’t take this as praise though. The show knows where the line is between too much fanservice is, and it purposefully crosses it to get you to think about how disgusting the whole fantasy is. It’s self-deprecating for sure, but that’s part of the charm.A sister obsessed light novel writer, his younger stepsister, a perverted novelist, his plain jane friend, and a few more writers and publishers make up the cast. The story is small in scale, but it gives the characters plenty of room to develop. The main character struggles to come up with new material and jokes ensue around him in his distraction. He gets some absurd story ideas turned down by his editor. He spends a lot of time in his apartment with his friends playing games, telling jokes, talking about anime, and this all brings about plenty of funny perverted gag humor. If you can’t gel with perverted humor then I don't think this is the show for you, but give it a chance beyond just judging a book by its cover.Despite looking and acting like teenagers, the characters are used to adult life and often show their wisdom in conversations. They can be really perverted at times and seem like sickos but over time they grew on me. Through great moments of the character’s reflecting on themselves you’re able to get into their heads and understand why they are and what motivates them. For the characters to be so well developed it becomes easy to get invested in the ups and downs of their lives as they become adults. We learn about what formed them into the people they are through the many outgoing conversations they have with each other. They’re not perfect friends and their chemistry isn’t totally perfect, but the way they clash adds to their believability. I find myself justifying their actions no matter how deplorable by referring to the minor details that built their foundations as people.All of their weird quirks just make them so believable, the weird insistence on sisters that Itsuki has, how Nayuta only writes naked, and Miyako’s jealousy of lives of her interesting friends. We know these characters for more than just their weird quirks. We seek how they interact with one another, not just the main character, we get a sense of what their lives are like outside of Itsuki's apartment. Even the supporting cast of publishers, freelance artists, writers, mangaka, and just normal people all have expressive enough personalities to carry the show for the brief time that they appear to offer some wisdom or humor.I don’t gauge characters based on how realistic they may seem, I gauge them on believability. Could the characters in Imouto Sae Ireba Ii exist? Probably not, but after seeing what formed them into the people they are I’m more inclined to believe.Not every joke lands, but enough do to keep it enjoyable. What had me coming back to it week after week was the realistic drama mixed in randomly with the zany comedy that would surprise me when my guard was down. The characters evolved into people I actually liked, not just the stupid pandering archetypes I initially pegged them to be. -The horrifying events that occur in the first 3 minutes.

He\'s a novelist (works in light novels, *cough eromanga-sensei *cough) and has a big ass fetish on imoutos (little sisters), but he doesn\'t have one, instead he has a ""trap"" little bro that really cares for him. He isn\'t that bland as a protagonist, he has some complex (it\'s a japanese series so you can easily guess what\'s going to be), with just one day he can grew hair really fast, it\'s not a bad one, but I wouldn\'t call him the best MC of the season.the series goes for the slice of life with a tint of gags each chapter that makes you think it\'s a 4-koma (seitokai yakuindomo), but the series is based on a LN, it has a manga adaption in neither of them have that style, so it tends to feel really flat when overused each chapter and it was used every single episode, it also has a side A and B of stories, that one tends to be a tabletop games and that trust me, are pretty funny most of the time, except ep 7 that went too far though, but most of the time they don\'t give you much detail in the characters, but I would probably play with friends some of them.art isn\'t bad, music isn\'t bad, OP is fine, ED is great, and they have a little music to announce each chapter that is pretty nice, and appears from time to time each episode (the same as with the gags, it can be easily overused, and probably will -and it was-).characters are pretty much stereotypical, but ochinchin girl is cute and except for the boxers scene, she\'s charming and she kept her style all season, you can love her or like her (and you can notice the original author fetish *cough nun dress *cough), she doesn\'t get annoying. already talked about the MC, the best friend got his episode and he used pretty well, since ep 6 I really liked each time he appeared and how he acted was the most realistic one of the bunch, he\'s pervy too, he can fall in love, he isn\'t dense, feel envy, sadness, joy and complements pretty well the MC and it\'s good that he\'s there so he doesn\'t have to monologue as other protagonist.this series is pretty much binary, you like it or you don\'t ...

Rather, it\'s not really focused at the ""Little Sister / Imouto"" thing at all, it\'s just like some kind of extra detail or fuel to the protagonists debuts and works.Also for the most part of the Comedy being about the lives of the Novelists. There\'s often a sex joke (not as much as Shimoneta handles) by Nayu. I\'d go as far as to tell you that Nayu x Itsuki all...the way. Honestly, they should just date already.. (I\'m going off track now)Ok, first off... the story.I might\'ve already explained some parts of it.It\'s not focused about ""Imouto"" but rather on the Characters and the Lives of those in the Novel Industry.Our protagonist is an Imouto-loving Writer but doesn\'t really rely on that for the story, rather, he\'s just using it as a motivation and as his primary fuel for his works.This is a Comedy Romance type of Anime but without the falling in love with his little sister part.It\'s about his and the other characters growth as Novelists. His motivation to overcome his love interest in terms of Novels in order to soothe his Inferiority Complex and to accomplish greater heights on writing novels (yes, he loves someone other than Imoutos)Although most of the background and fixing about him and his family\'s misunderstanding is somewhat ignored so that they could continue with the ""Lives of Novelists"" kind of thing.Also noting that the title came off from one of his favorite works, so don\'t put this on the same shelf as Oreimo and Eromanga.Art.Yes, the modern style of backgrounds and the details are complimentary, although we are mostly seeing him in his room, the visuals of the outside when he ever goes out to get ideas are nice, although common in terms of new anime, it still gives off the new modern feel into it.Sound.Not much I could say but the Opening and Ending is nice. Also a good set of choice on VA\'s.Character.Yes, this is where the story is focused and what develops the most, everyone is trying to overcome and achieve goals for the whole anime. Feeling inferior to someone with natural talent. (It happens) in a chain-like manner, and the fact that they are doing their best to so even with the Comedy. A few occasional drama (not as big as youtube drama) are shown and the Romance part of it isn\'t exaggerated, everything\'s at their own pace and their own methods, their lives and the turns and loops of it. They get along well regardless of their competitive characteristics.Also, I have settled my ships as what they wanted it to be.Enjoyment.Simple Comedy and Sex Jokes often portrayed (mostly from one character tho) just makes it fun, it\'s not offensive for the most part and that the order feels like a day-to-day Slice-of-Life. Also features more about what a life of a Novelist/Writer is. One of the few nicely paced anime I could go on to if the others are way too tense and messed up.Overall, I\'ll give it a 10 at this point, my opinion is you shouldn\'t judge a whole anime by it\'s title and covers.

So please remember that, just because you\'ve seen some similar concepts in other anime, IT DOES NOT MEAN that the show is a basic rip-off of ero manga sensei and it just follows a trend that passed its hype-point or whatever. IT\'S NOT. This show does an AMAZING job taking over popular themes and motifs, breaking them at times and shifting them towards the development...of some of the most enjoyable shit I\'ve seen lately.Its strongest point, in my opinion, is the way it balances the light, humorous, joke-around, pleasant-to-watch atmosphere with short moments of deeper character introspection, revealing tiny puzzle pieces that, when put together, make for a great, meaningful story about what draws people together and what sets them apart as individuals. (I believe Ituski stated something along the lines of ""What one person craves, the other one has and doesn\'t care much about it."" This, for example, is one of the more subtle dilemmas that the plot explores. And while we\'re at it, the ending scenes of episode 8 are a fucking masterpiece.) YET it\'s still incredibly entertaining, and easy to watch.The cast of well-picked characters - a group of four good friends, with obviously different personalities, certain weird obsessions and their worries about being a lot less mature than they would expect from being 20-ish (very relatable stuff) - gives birth to saucy, super-funny exchanges of lines where very little stuff that can be said is out of line. The voice acting is great. The drawing pairs it just as well. Not a heavy-plot, not a superficial anime either, twisted just at the right amount for its genre.I can keep this going for a lot more paragraphs, yet the core of my message is just this: please give it a chance, it will surprise you. of some of the most enjoyable shit I\'ve seen lately.Its strongest point, in my opinion, is the way it balances the light, humorous, joke-around, pleasant-to-watch atmosphere with short moments of deeper character introspection, revealing tiny puzzle pieces that, when put together, make for a great, meaningful story about what draws people together and what sets them apart as individuals.

The characters are not good. Most of them are creepy or downright criminal, with several of them being guilty of SA, which just gets brushed off as if it\'s normal to strip strangers clothes off on the street because you want to see their naked body, or downright R-ping other characters to get them to agree with you. These examples sound extreme but they are things that actually happened in the show. There...are some more meaningful moments, but they\'re completely overshadowed by the unending torrent of s*x crimes. Even when it comes to the positives of this show, the unfortunate truth is that this show is designed to appeal to people who have ego problems, as the overarching themes include feeling worthless, reckless spending, violating the rights of others, and trying to be the ""main character"". It might seem like the show gets better as it goes, but it actually just gets worse. I\'m sorry, but the only thing this show did for me was inflict psychic damage to myself.

It\'s not really a romance either. It should be appropriately labeled as a slice of life comedy. Now with that out of the way, here\'s why. Imouto sae Ireba Ii is actually an anime with several narrative goals. It wants to be a coming of age story  directed at college students or viewers who are beginning to enter the ""working-phase"" of their life. It wants to be a comedy that makes fun of ""little sister"" and ""ecchi"" anime tropes. It wants to be informative with regards to the life of a light...novelist. Finally, it balances these lighter elements against several instances of drama revolving around themes of friendship, romance, and goals. Sound familiar? It should, but you\'ve probable never seen all these concepts played simultaneously.[STORY = 6]Practically nonexistent. Don\'t watch this anime if you\'re looking for rapid development that builds towards a sharp climax or any conclusion for that matter. Every episode is very contained with a specific message it is trying to convey. As a viewer, you are simply a bystander peeking into the daily life of a light novelist and his friends. I especially enjoyed the little ""board-games"" that the characters played in several episodes. Clearly, the creators were trying convey the imagination behind story telling. At the very least, it was a refreshing and original attempt with some laughs at the absurdity of light novel stories.[CHARACTERS = 7]Exactly what you expect. Itsuki, the protagonist and sis-con. Nayuta, the perverted comedic relief with an obsession for Itsuki, but God only knows why. Naturally, he doesn\'t reciprocate. Chihiro, the doting and caring little brother who looks like a sister, but sounds like a little boy. Or was it the other way around? Whatever, you know what I mean. Haruto, male-friend/rival to protagonist who is forever the third wheel in any romantic scenario.  Miyako, the sensible attractive female who reacts accordingly to our (the viewer\'s) thoughts at every outlandish scenario in the anime. Individually, no character is special, but in concert they have good chemistry and give the story a lot of texture.[ART = 7]The average modern standard. There is some fan-service but it\'s never erotic. It just makes you want to cringe, which is what the show is going for. The anime is making fun of the ecchi genre after all. Don\'t expect any zoomed-in shots of butts/boobs where you can see shine/sweat. Everything is drawn rather flat, but the surroundings are very colorful and realistic. Appropriate for this genre.[SOUND=7]Not bad, but forgettable.[ENJOYMENT =8]I had a good time. This anime is a fair example of a work that is greater than the sum of its parts. There is enough variety across the episodes to keep you interested if you like slice of life and comedy. The show does a good job of shifting tonally when you least expect it. One moment, it\'s all fun and laughs, and then you\'re given a somewhat dramatized shift in the narrative that has something to do with success or relationships.[OVERALL = 7]Despite the variety this anime offers and the balancing act it is attempting to maintain, the show ultimately fails at juggling these goals and falls over on itself. The anime starts losing focus towards the end and its final episode is so anti-climatic that my final grade rounds the work out towards the lower end of the 7 spectrum. If what this show is about is still unclear, I\'d say it\'s most similar to animes like Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Still, it was an enjoyable and light-hearted diversion that\'s a good watch if you just need a break from heavier shows. novelist.

Nayuta, the perverted comedic relief with an obsession for Itsuki, but God only knows why. Naturally, he doesn\'t reciprocate. Chihiro, the doting and caring little brother who looks like a sister, but sounds like a little boy. Or was it the other way around? Whatever, you know what I mean. Haruto, male-friend/rival to protagonist who is forever the third wheel in any romantic scenario.  Miyako, the sensible attractive female who reacts accordingly to our (the viewer\'s) thoughts at every outlandish scenario in the anime. Individually, no character is special, but in concert they have good chemistry and give the story a lot of texture.[ART = 7]The average modern standard. There is some fan-service but it\'s never erotic. It just makes you want to cringe, which is what the show is going for. The anime is making fun of the ecchi genre after all. Don\'t expect any zoomed-in shots of butts/boobs where you can see shine/sweat. Everything is drawn rather flat, but the surroundings are very colorful and realistic. Appropriate for this genre.[SOUND=7]Not bad, but forgettable.[ENJOYMENT =8]I had a good time. This anime is a fair example of a work that is greater than the sum of its parts. There is enough variety across the episodes to keep you interested if you like slice of life and comedy. The show does a good job of shifting tonally when you least expect it. One moment, it\'s all fun and laughs, and then you\'re given a somewhat dramatized shift in the narrative that has something to do with success or relationships.[OVERALL = 7]Despite the variety this anime offers and the balancing act it is attempting to maintain, the show ultimately fails at juggling these goals and falls over on itself. The anime starts losing focus towards the end and its final episode is so anti-climatic that my final grade rounds the work out towards the lower end of the 7 spectrum. If what this show is about is still unclear, I\'d say it\'s most similar to animes like Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Still, it was an enjoyable and light-hearted diversion that\'s a good watch if you just need a break from heavier shows.', ""Is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really.Imouto sae Ireba Ii is one of those animes that people will probably think it's Eromanga Sensei rip off or whatnot but in-reality it's nothing like that. The anime is more of like a chill laid back slice of life anime that really isn't taken too seriously. It doesn't have a complex story nor the best character development ever but I think it's not as bad as people make it out to be.Story 6/10:Like I said, the story isn't complex or anything. There should be a Slice of Life tag for this anime because it's literally...just that. Romance? Barely any romance in the story. There is bit of romance from time to time but it's doesn't deserve it's own tag since it's not the MAIN focus of the story. The story is simple, it's pretty much about Itsuki Hashima a light novel writer that is trying to make it big in society. He pretty much always hang out with his friends which are also similar in the business. I will talk about the characters later on but that's pretty much it. Every episode is just a new day for Itsuki to hang out with his friends. They either talk about their work or they do fun things together like playing games or drinking and eating. After a few episodes, it shows internal conflict with each character and show their hidden emotions but I felt like they should had expanded on it. If they expanded on it and actually show more conflict with each other the story would had a greater impact on the series. That's just the main flaw of the story, there's not much to it because they didn't expand the conflict of each character emotions which kind of makes it bland and kind of useless.Art 8/10:The artwork and the animation isn't bad. I think it's probably one of the best part of the series is the art. The artwork isn't complex and have the most depth but it's pretty vibrant and still consistent enough to make it look nice to the eye. There's not much to say about the art but I feel like it's probably one of the greatest strength for the series.Sound 8/10:This is the second strongest strength for the series. The opening and the ending is really nice to listen to. It's really catch and something that you want to keep listening to. The ost isn't the most pop out thing ever but the opening and the ending songs really did a good job expressing the series as much as possible.Character 6/10:To explain the character, I don't really need to break down each character in-order to explain the pros and the cons because due to the fact that each character pretty much suffers from the same flaws. The character are almost bland but they're not bad either. The series tries to give each character with different humor or fetishes but it doesn't really weigh enough to make them unique as a whole. The first few episodes, it's pretty much them having fun and talking about their work but as times go on the series introduces the character with some internal conflict. There is pretty much 2 internal conflict that the character have. The first internal conflict is romance. Simple internal conflict where A loves B but C also loves B where D loves A but A loves B. Pretty much those triangle love type of shit. This is where I said the romance tag shouldn't be in here because the series doesn't EXPRESS much of it to be the main focus of the series at all. It's express for like a few minutes in a few episodes then it's gone. The second internal conflict is Jealousy. Pretty much Haruto is jealous of Itsuki because he can make better stories or whatnot. I felt like if they expanded on this conflict alone, the series would been so much better. Instead, just like the romance, it appears for a few minutes then POOF it just disappears. I wish they can do a better job of expanding the conflict within the characters or it could had been a way better series and deserve a higher grade.Overall 6/10:The anime isn't good but it isn't bad either. This is the type of series is where if you're just bored and looking for a series to watch. There is some funny moments that will make you smile and the goofiness but it's not a series where you should take it seriously at all. It just feels incomplete of a story and wish they could expand more of the conflicts. 6/10 just that. Romance? Barely any romance in the story.

Like many others, I expected the show to be akin to Ero-Manga Sensei or Oreimo, a love comedy of sorts and whilst Imouto Sae could still be definitely categorized as such, it has a much lesser emphasis on romance. We are privy to the lives and emotions of Itsuki and his friends, including the hardships that they face during their transition to adulthood. It is easy to sympathsize with the tragic pasts of the characters, and root...for their happiness.There are unique aspects to the show- such as the minigames that the characters play, and the neat little animation introductions to them. The show also does not take itself seriously, by having bizarre characters such as best girl Kanikou or the Tax Accountant Ashley Oono and silly music to lighten the mood. The addition of fanservice is always great, and with the exception of episode 1, Imouto Sae doesn't overdo it.Imouto Sae is wrapped up at the end of each episode by the melodic and somber ending theme song starting to play right as we witness one of our favorite characters go through a difficult time. And as we emphasize with these characters, we are taught life lessons that are invaluble not only for these characters, but for our own, complex lives. Ultimately, Imouto Sae is a rollercoaster of emotions that will make you laugh one second and tuck at your heartstrings the next. for their happiness.There are unique aspects to the show- such as the minigames that the characters play, and the neat little animation introductions to them.

There were quite a few instances that felt mundanely generic as well as some moments that were really...well crafted. Overall, I felt that the first half or so of the series had fewer uninteresting moments, but it was mostly enjoyable throughout.While the characters, understandably, did not develop a huge amount of depth in such a short series, what we do learn about them turned out to be welcomingly believable and heartfelt.-Miyako's feelings that she's wasting time at college while her friends are living 'real' adult lives with jobs, creating tangible products of the time they spend, and making a name for themselves-Haruto's struggle to maintain his friendship with Itsuki despite his feelings of inferiority as an authorThey're human, and realistic. The characters develop into people we can connect and empathize with.The moments of self reflection and serious contemplation are, while comparatively brief, insightful. Emotion feels honest, these scenes follow the moments of absurd, and often sexually explicit, humor quite naturally.What I'm saying is it doesn't feel forced. Or fake. They feel fitting and astute.Moving on from the praise, there were parts in the second half especially where the show felt bland and unfunny. It wasn't for a lack of trying though so I write it off as a consequence of different jokes for different folks.The ending wasn't very satisfying, while it's not as if though it was wrapped up in a messy and overstuffed ending, it leaves all but a few issues unresolved.

While watching this anime, you see how everyone struggles to be the best in an environment where even if you want to do it for yourself, you have expectations.I did watch the dub because I learned it had Jamie Marchi in it, who voices some of my fav characters like Ayame from Shimoneta and Lucoa from Kobayashi; but I ended up liking/loving all the voices of characters in the anime. Of course, there are those who may seem very annoying, but they have their own slice of humility and attraction.

Even minor characters like Ashley and Toki and Satsuna are just so appealing in their own waysComplaints?: my only complaint is that it ended way too soon, but it never once felt boring or too much at once; it is perfect for a small watch but you just want so much more. I swear if there's no season two, I'll be so madOverall: this was worth the 12 episodes if you have some time, but I really would like a season two cause I want to see how Miyako does as a part-timer or if Chihiro tells Itsuki about being a girl or even if the anime works out for Itsuki.

The biggest factor that could've changed this from a mediocre anime to a fantastic one is the character development and the story. Right in the beginning, it's made clear that the characters all have personalities but as the story progresses it feels like the author just kinda forgot...or just didn't care about the characters.

However, something like that has happened with a show in the past. I dropped a show after a very cringy first few minutes, only to give it another try months later. I ended up really enjoying that anime after those first few minutes. So for A Sister's All You Need, I pushed through the first scene and boy am I glad I did.This show mostly focuses on being a slice of life comedy about light novel authors and what they go through on...a daily basis. It shows the fun of writing, the difficulty of making deadlines, and even the pain of trying something new, such as making your novel into an anime, and it failing misserably. This all helps to keep you interested when some slice of life can get boring and redundant. The humor combined with this fresh take on what it's like to be an author makes for a really enjoyable watch.There are a few things that I am left wondering, but that could be fixed with a second season. For one, what made his little sister decide to pretend to be his little brother for the whole anime? She obviously didn't know that his longing for a little sister is what drives his light novels, so why'd she do it in the first place? She shows that on the last scene of her when she's in the bath and tells herself that she needs to tell him the truth soon. Why hasn't Itsuki's new stepmother tried to meet him? If you marry someone who already has a kid, wouldn't you meet them at the very least? I realize that it may be due to his poor relationship with his father and the fact that Itsuki resents him for re-marrying so quickly. But even so shouldn't she want to meet him? I don't remember the anime ever mentioning that she's tried to make contact with him at any point. Please correct me if I'm wrong about that.Another thing I would have liked to see was more development in the relationship between Itsuki and Nayuta. I'm sure they will if there is another season. Him admitting to Haruto that he likes Nayuta and wants to date her was a good step in that direction.One more thing to mention is the strong ecchi component in this anime. I personally like it if it's done right and, thankfully, I think it was done right in this anime. It's used almost entirely for comedic effect. If you dislike ecchi then I would not recommend watching this.Okay, so would I recommend this anime to another person? Yes, I would. Now if said person does not like slice of life anime or ecchi I obviously would not, but otherwise I would definitely recommend it to others. It is a funny slice of life that has an interesting story and cast of characters to keep you engaged for the whole 12 episodes.My personal rating is: 9.2 out of 10 stars for how much I enjoyed it.My objective rating is an 8.3 out of 10 stars.Thanks for reading! This is my first time doing something like this so let me know what you think. If there's something I could change or improve on I'd love to hear it.

This story will all be about how perverted things a brother \'tries\' to do to his sister and she would probably be a tsundere who does nothing more than annoy. There would be no character development probably because most of the episodes are going to be wasted in ecchi and drama.""But my...inner otaku screamed telling ""NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT\'S COVER""Well why not give it a try.The first 5 min burned my eyes and made me regret watching anime, now I was and to believe that is god level perverted anime which was then soon followed by dropping the anime.One otaku-ish day I came across the review of the anime after it\'s completion with its 12 episodes, and I was wondering how it got a rating of above 7.I decided that even if I want to drop it why not watch like 2 episodes and drop it if it does not give me the feels.And that was the time when my eyes opened....I understood that this anime title was more like a click-bait.CHARACTERS AND STORY (spoiler-less)The story starts off by a perverted scene which is then revealed to a part of a story.

It will seem more like a \'hentai-ish\' anime and that is what is the most misleading about this show.The story is about a light novel writer Itsuki Hashima who has some serious \'sister complex\' and is literally obsessed with little sisters and that induces him to write about little sisters in his works. (apparently he has fans too)Itsuki attended a college which he later left after 6 months. He met Miyako Shirakawa when he was attending the college. Miyako noticed Itsuki really engrossed in his work and liked that about him.SPOILERS AHEAD (Go ahead at your won risk)Miyako approached Itsuki but Itsuki taught that she was just trying to play with him and called her a slut which hurt her feeling and she started to cryand that is how their friendship started.The next character we got is Haruto Fuwa who is Itsuki\'s friend and is another light novel writer who is more famous than Itsuku, he is having his light novel adapted to anime. He is a hard working and organized author unlike Itsuki.Then we have Nayuta Kani, a prodigious writer whose works are really mesmerizing. She is all \'deredere\' for Itsuki and the reason for it is revealed later in the series which is when Nayuta was being bullied in her high school days and she lost all her hope and was suicidal, Itsuki\'s work gave her hope and from that day she fell for him.The character development in this story is amazing and I never expected such good pace in this kind of \'misleading story\'. Enough time is given to introduce a character, give some insights in their personality and their past.The best thing about this anime is the symbolism of \'love\' portrayed in show. Unlike most of the anime where the MC gets a harem because of his looks or because he is overpowered and godlike (onni-sama). The love portrayed in this show is simple and life like real. One falls in love because of what they are from inside, that is their inner beauty not their looks.HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD (on your own risk){START}It is revealed that Nayuta loves Itsuki because he helped her fight though her rough days when she lost all hope and was suicidal due to bulling which she went through in her school. She proposed him in the Annual Author meet (or something) and was rejected because Itsuki wanted to do something as big as Nayuta so that he could proudly stand by her side. Even after being rejected and facing so much humility she did not give up and still continued to show up at his house everyday and help him in every way she could believing that one day he would finally accept her (later he admitted that he loved her which she actually heard).Second is Haruto\'s love for Miyako, Haruto started to fall fro her when she understood his pain when his light novel\'s anime adaption performed really bad, she cried for him and said she understand how much painful it is when one tries so hard and still fails. That is the point where Haruto fell for her. He asked Itsuki for help and Itsuki readily agreed to help him. He later realized that Miyako loved Itsuki and GAVE UP loving her to keep her happy. He thought it would be too cruel when Miyako got to know that the one she loves actually helped some other guy to pursue her.The purity in love is admiring and something which the modern society lacks. It shows what true love really is, only if you truly love her you will let her go and that is what Haruto did, give up his own self desires to see the one he loves happy. That is something really hard to find in today\'s society.This anime also deals with the ups and downs of life, how hard actually this thing called life is. Even if we fell that writing stuff is really easy, how hard the life of an actual author is.I hope this review helped you.This anime is great and you should watch it.Thank you. :) inner otaku screamed telling ""NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT\'S COVER""Well why not give it a try.The first 5 min burned my eyes and made me regret watching anime, now I was and to believe that is god level perverted anime which was then soon followed by dropping the anime.One otaku-ish day I came across the review of the anime after it\'s completion with its 12 episodes, and I was wondering how it got a rating of above 7.I decided that even if I want to drop it why not watch like 2 episodes and drop it if it does not give me the feels.And that was the time when my eyes opened....I understood that this anime title was more like a click-bait.CHARACTERS AND STORY (spoiler-less)The story starts off by a perverted scene which is then revealed to a part of a story.

I actually enjoy this anime a lot and it was a long time since I enjoy anime like this.A Sister is All You Need is an anime that has a misleading title but the story is pretty cute and very nice to watch. It has a little bit of everything, romance, comedy action and slice of life. The characters are pretty enjoyable and I like their voice acting and their stories....Sometimes it gets boring during the times they play boardgames but its worth it due to the interaction between each characters. The art is pretty good but sometimes the animations seemed kind of weird or lagging I would say. I had a fun time watching this anime and I enjoy myself a lot during it.I recommend to watch this anime If you like slice of life, a bit of romance and comedy. You are going to have a fun time during it, don't let the title mislead you!（‐＾▽＾‐） Sometimes it gets boring during the times they play boardgames but its worth it due to the interaction between each characters.

There is little to invest emotionally and the characters aren\'t gonna win awards anytime soon, despite the occasional sprinkling of drama and love-complicated geometric-shape.However...That is really not what the show is there for. It\'s a slice of life comedy that follows the recent trend of such shows that focus on the life of young adults instead of the endless procession of high schoolers. There is some emotional depth here and there, that is kind of refreshing, but over all it\'s just a fun little romp. The little sister gimmick...is really only there to set up some of the jokes and not to feed any weird fetishes. There is no actual siscon in there just a guy with a fetish that only comes up when it is time for us to laugh about it.What I like especially is how the fan service is handled. Far too often such is far to forced, with chraracters constantly barging into room, spilling drinks or slipping and falling on girls which result in the dreaded accidental grope. And while some of that is in evidence here as well, most of it is part of- and enhances the narrative. Digibro called this type of fan service ""diegetic"" and I agree[spoiler]For example at one point Nayuta asks Miyako to strip so she can fondle her breasts and later her butt. And while it is mostly there to feed a fetish, it also gives us more information about Nayuta: she\'s not shy about her own body and has no problem fondling other woman for research and sees nothing inherently sexual about it. At the same time we learn, that Miyako is of course embarrassed and shy about the whole thing, but will do something that makes her uncomfortable for her friend.Another thing I really enjoy is how the show handles exposition:[spoiler]Instead of a voice over or another character explaining the protagonist, we get the first minute of episode 1, which a scene from a really weird and over the top siscon story/anime. (btw you can easily skip that and don\'t miss a thing. It\'s supposed to be off putting. that is the joke). Through this scene and the funny little conversation between Itsuki and his editor we learn all we need to know about him. He\'s a siscon, light novel author, but not a predator and apart from his obsession rather well adjusted without the usual trapping of the anime pervert, like the stupid face or the nosebleed. Another excellent example of this is when Nayuta tells Miyako how she was bullied in school. This is handled with some quick flashes of images, that mostly strongly suggest instead of outright tell. So instead of the usual anime trope of the emotional 5 minute talk with still or slo-mo shot of crying faces, we get all we need in under 10 seconds without loosing the emotional impactIf you squint a bit you can interpret some Harem elements, but only two female characters explicitly profess love for the protagonist, so really have to squint and want to ship some of the others as well.[spoiler] What really annoyed me to no end was Itsukis reasons for spurning Nayuta’s affections. It\'s the typical anime guy self centred bullshit that sound profound but is in fact just dickish. And the last episode was the usual anime cop out as well seeing as now there was potential for something real developing between Itsuki and Nayuta. Disappointing but not surprising. The development of the relationships along the usual anime lines had me drop the score by a point sadly. Frankly the whole episode 12 was such a needless toneshift it is best to ignore it, if you enjoyed the rest of the showIn conclusion, watch it if you are after an adult slice of life comedy with the occasional (about once per episode) fan service, which wont distract you from laughing. is really only there to set up some of the jokes and not to feed any weird fetishes.

But to my surprise, it is, in my opinion, one of the best anime of this season. And I think that if this anime came out last season for example, it would've probably got way more attention. The synopsis is kinda misleading. It gives off the vibes of a carefree comedy/romance with basically no plot. But in reality, it is none of that. While Comedy is very dominant in this show, it also has some slight romance and drama in it, and a kind of shocking twists...which you would not expect from this sort of show (This is more apparent in the later episodes). As for the characters, I personally found them very entertaining, with each character having multiple dimensions to their personality rather than a blank canvas. Overall this anime was very enjoyable and one which i would recommend to anyone who enjoys this sort of anime, and especially to those who enjoyed oregairu and want something similarPS: I found that this anime's writer also wrote Haganai, which I've heard good things about. So i might give it a shot. which you would not expect from this sort of show (This is more apparent in the later episodes).

Tbh, I wasn't going to pick it, but due to the lack of good anime this season, I ended watching the first three episodes, despite the whole internet saying how bad it was, and guess what, I don't regret at all. Sure, it had unispired characters for a slice of life-like anime, still, it mananged to make me enjoy the whole thing from beggining to end, loving and wanting the best for (almost) all characters (exception is the crazy tax bitch). It had a different atmosphere from most anime of this season, it was...funny, had great soundtrack. Overall, it was greatly enjoyable and lighthearted, and made me learn to not pick on an anime for its premise.- 7/10Really hope for a second season (not happenning tho ;-;) funny, had great soundtrack.

And after a few episodes, I can commit that “Imouto Sae Ireba Ii” is a great example of the quote. I was lost my momentum because of trailer, preview and thought it would be a romance slice of life around a siscon decorated with ecchi and harem. But I’ve learnt my lesson: I shouldn’t be a weather forecast just based on some minutes of the film.About how I could have deviation before and at the beginning, the first scene of ep1 definitely takes in charge. Its genre had been rechecked to make sure ‘hentai’ didn’t contain, so basically,...I just can’t believe what I just saw. Because we have a spoiler disallowance, I can only reveal that it’s on a whole new level of perverted, also disgusting inspired by an incestuous love. That’s how our main character, Itsuki-sensei, make a debut by asserting specific favor in his light novels: Brother x Little Sister romance.Comedy is another genre that I’m confused at. My emotion gets deeper and deeper as the story develops, grown by novelists’ precarious career, nurtured by their mysterious unhappy past and ripe at their relationship. Talk about relationship, not only about sad triangle love, but the interactions with other characters are enough for me to look forward to watching next episodes. By the way, some enjoyable, interesting board games they presented cooperated with happy slice of life has brought comedic atmosphere back to the series.One of the spotlight is the plot of some conversations, what can I say, is extraordinary. I mean the words come naturally as they’re close friends, no beef, but just about pe**s, panties, somethings need to be tagged as R18 generally (just a vague comment as I knew we got R+-Mild Nudity rating). So that, if perverted flirting were illegal, Nayu-chan could be on target of any policeman. Pop up as a naughty girl with a “beautiful mind” and also a yuri lover, she easily passes all competitors to be on top of fan favorite character.To get along with Nayuta, we have Lil-sis addict Itsuki with his buddy Haruto, all of them are talent novelists; and then reverse trap stepsister Chihiro; Itsuki’s friend Miyako… They’re really an important piece for Imouto Sae Ireba Ii. Character also takes my best grade and high appreciation of reviewers while each has his/her own jewel inside.Enjoyment:Great anime with just comedy, romance isn’t what I chose to keep following, but the dramatic moods, good fan service art, sound and the life of light novelists attracted me to keep my eyes stick on the screen and enjoy every moments. Additionally, ED song made me feel a bit sad with deep melody on sedentary background.I can’t wait till the ss2 after the OE.Ep 9: useful tip right there. I just can’t believe what I just saw.

A Sister\'s All You Need...no this seriously isn\'t ANOTHER imouto incest anime...though it looks it.Imouto sae Ireba Ii. is by far for LA, one of the animes for Fall 2017 where much of the outcry for this anime as unwarranted even with it\'s excessive ecchiness which it displays itself full force. Yeah, LA saw Imouto sae Ireba Ii. as more of a character study of writers more than the ecchiness overload many thought from the first few minutes of this anime...though as LA says that, LA knows Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has it\'s problems even due to this.Well the first thing...to deal with is the excessive fanservice Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has, the main culprit and instigator from all this is usually Nayuta Kani voiced by Hisako Kanemoto. LA at first was skeptical about her as a character and she usually derails many of the cast\'s conversations and games, but for LA if anything she spiced things up taking things to the extreme towards an anime that is mostly talking...sure it\'s fanservice but LA doesn\'t care, LA hasn\'t seen this brazen of a character since...Eromanga-sensei...if you catch LA\'s drift.Now the character study about writers are shown through the main protagonist Itsuki Hashima being an amateur siscon novelist, Haruto Fuwa voiced by Hiro Shinono, a fledging writer who happens to be friends with Itsuki, the aforementioned Nayuta  and a genius novelist who are actually influenced by Itsuki and has a uhhhh....very clingy liking to Nayuta because of it. Now these writers also surrounds themselves with editors, auditors, friends and illustrators which makes up for the anime being mostly talking. The most interesting and LA\'s favourite character in Imouto sae Ireba Ii. being Miyako Shrakawa voiced by Ai Kakuma being both Itsuki and Nayuta\'s friend. There are other characters like Ashley Ono voiced by Manami Numakura (the auditor) and Kaiko Mikuniyama voiced by Akane Fujita (illustrator and a caricature of Sagiri Izumi from Eromanga-sensei) to have her own...unique scenes to their plate however besides the editors in this anime, the rest brings little to the plate besides their one-scene wonders.Imouto sae Ireba Ii\'s most interesting aspects goes to us going into the writers headspace through the main cast (all ranging from different backgrounds) and seeing how they tick or just their way of thinking when it comes to writing in the form of the weird games they play. From Nayuta\'s blatant fanserviced nature to Itsuki\'s siscon fetish to Miyako being the minder to most of the cast and trying to get the story back on track. It\'s a weird notion but it\'s similar to Eromanga-sensei\'s belief on writing (Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has some strong connections to Eromanga sensei doesn\'t it?).Imouto sae Ireba Ii\'s shortcomings however comes in the form of plotlines not following through at times such as Chihiro Hashima (Itsuki\'s step brother) and again the odd one scene wonder characters like Ashley and Kaiko doesn\'t get brought up again. This and the most obvious one being of who Itsuki\'s likes by the end isn\'t shown in this anime and it\'s a shame as LA oddly liked the dynamic of Itsuki\'s pseudo-friendship romances...just not the follow through.The animation by Sliver Link is mostly decent, from the good yet not as exotic character designs to the typical backgroundings, the ""game"" animation was greatly done and yes...the fanservice is great for the most part even if it is mostly intentionally censored for obvious reasons.The voice acting, well, LA doesn\'t need to say much but Hisako Kanemoto, Ai Kakuma and Manami Numakura blasted this anime out of the gate. Though LA likes Miyako as a character, this is a role Ai Kakuma is in her niche (a la fanservicey shows), the MVP easily goes to Hisako Kanemoto going full lewd mode and her mannerisms.The only other plot point that actually does have a follow through is how Itsuki became obsessed with little sisters in the first place and to contrast Masamune Izumi\'s beliefs, Itsuki\'s backstory has some legitimacy to it...but that isn\'t until the final episode of the anime.Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has it\'s major problems to the detriments of it\'s heavy reliance of fanservice, plotlines not going following through and an anime mostly about talking. But for what\'s it worth...Imouto sae Ireba Ii. though it\'s risky and ""controversial"" in many ways it has become to be known as...it rewarded you at least.It\'s no great masterpiece...but LA doesn\'t think Imouto sae Ireba Ii. was intending to anyways. to deal with is the excessive fanservice Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has, the main culprit and instigator from all this is usually Nayuta Kani voiced by Hisako Kanemoto.

However, there are still some secrets that have not been revealed, many.And also there are some scenes that I think are very boring, one example is the board game they play. Almost of the whole part of the anime is dominated by it. However, all of that is replaced by a few minutes romance scenes that can cover it all.Its Ecchi part too, well I think destroy the moment. I imagine this anime without the Ecchi section, just a romantic comedy. That...will make me satisfied.I think the anime is not finished yet,.

If you’re coming in expecting a stereotypical siscon harem, which personally I am a fan of the genre and will neglect to comment on it as a whole, you will be pleasantly surprised that this series tackles some very mature themes such as the daily life of a light novel author in its intrinsically volatile industry, what...it takes to maintain inspiration despite horrible commentaries, and even what it means to be the protagonist in your own story of your life.I would also like to see more characters like Itsuki, introspective and daring characters willing to take the first steps into their own futures, rather than waiting for their ""moment"" to shine or chance to reach them. Kind of a tangent, but it\'s nice to see a character that is willing to progress his own story rather than wait for the story develop around him. It was welcoming to see this anime tackle this kind of problem in the way it does, and the sole reason I rate Character as a 9.I would recommend this series to everyone that is a fan of slice of life dramas/rom-coms, and would strongly remind you to give the anime a chance past its “Normie Filter” first few minutes of the first episode. it takes to maintain inspiration despite horrible commentaries, and even what it means to be the protagonist in your own story of your life.I would also like to see more characters like Itsuki, introspective and daring characters willing to take the first steps into their own futures, rather than waiting for their ""moment"" to shine or chance to reach them.

The characters were great, the comedy was excellent, the pacing was perfect, there are so many good things I could say about this show!I really liked how the mindset and actions of Itski become so much clearer as the story goes on, he starts off just seeming like an idiotic freak but by the end of the show each of his personality traits can be explained by something from his past. Really good example of character development.My only flaw with this entire anime is...it\'s title and it\'s summary, they do not in any shape or form do it justice. Accompanied with the opening scene in episode 1 they give the impression that the show is something along the lines of ""Oreimo"" or ""Eromanga Sensei"" when this is NOT the case at all.I\'ve seen some of the illustrations from the light novel so I know some of the story ahead and I would absolutely love to see another season covering those events.Completely blew expectations out of the water.

You could see many common tropes of great comedy anime being used, but the timing is off and awkward.I've read reviews that it gets better further on, but as I read from one review to the next, it doesn't seem to be worth it to watch boring episodes for some meager 'wholesomeness'.

This show is about a little sister fetish light novelist who goes through his life with his friends, some of which who also have a part in the business of writing. Now, this sounds like a couple partially infamous shows, Eromanga Sensei, and Orimo. Imouto sae Ireba Ii is very different from these, first off, these characters are adults, they have adult problems and overarching goals. Its very down to earth like that. Second, although they are both about writers who are siscons, the protagonists are very different. The protagonist...of Imouto sae Ireba Ii is cold, distant, and has a pseudo-unrealistic sort of personality from the normal main character. Where is the protagonist of Eromgana Sensei is your basic nice guy character. These characters, I feel are realistic enough to have them relatable, but odd enough for me to enjoy the show, which is the perfect medium. The art and animation aren't anything special unfortunately. Nothing anime ruining, but noticeable. The music is also nothing to look at. The show is character driven for sure. I give this show a 7 out of 10. Id recommend this to someone who likes a nice, mature-ish show that doesn't take itself very seriously.

So, before I go into depths of this review, I'll take my sweet time to point something for you people out there- This is NOT Eromanga-sensei 2.0 or Oreimo 2.0Meaning, there's no romance between sister and brother. Hell, there's hardly a sister shown at first. It is nonexistent to me.So, after putting it there, I'd like to go into depths of the show.The MC, Itsuki Hashima is a novelist with a sister complex. Sounds like Eromanga? Yep, you goddamn...right. What makes this different is, there's no sister at all. It's just fantasy of the MC. This anime mostly take place in Itsuki's apartment. It's a dialogue, character-based show. One like in Joshiraku or Monogatari series but not that intense. The take on novelist life is realistic and sometimes relatable. The animation is decent. Nothing feels out of place.The anime rely on the character interaction so, not much of a story happening here. Still, it's good and sometimes sad as well. Looking at the hardship of a novelist and all.VerdictThis anime is underrated and overlooked because of the misleading title and premise while in reality it is a good show right.

Yes, the first 2 minutes of the anime make it seem like some kind of imouto incest trash show, however, after those two minutes, the show becomes amazing. I see so many people just categorizing this anime as a ""Eromanga Sensei 2.0"" or calling it trash, because of the first two minutes and the title. The title is misleading and the first two minutes have NOTHING to do with the actual show. Okay, now that my ranting is out of the way, let\'s start the actual review.Story:The story itself is pretty...great. It\'s a good blend of slice of life and comedy with a couple drama elements here and there that don\'t seem too out of place. Sure, some episodes may seem pointless and that they are there just for fanservice or filler, every single one of them has some kind of purpose, if you look closely enough. The best way to notice this is to rewatch the anime after you finished it (I watched it first with subs and then went to see how the dub was) and you will realize that. The pacing isn\'t the best and some details still need to be explained a little bit better, but it\'s definitely much better than average. And I do believe that this will get a Season 2 based on the ending, so most details that aren\'t explained in this season, will be explained in the next one.Overall: 9/10Art:I don\'t really have much to say about the artstyle. It\'s pretty good, though some people might not like it. The actual animation quality is pretty good and nothing really seems out of place. The character designs themselves are pretty decent and they stand out.Overall: 8.5/10Sound:The opening theme is outstanding, and the ending is pretty good, however, the rest of the OST doesn\'t really stand out all that much. But if you actually go back and listen to it, you will see that it has some pretty catchy and good songs. While not the greatest OST out there, it\'s still pretty good.Overall: 8.5/10Characters:This is without a doubt the best part of the entire Anime. All of the characters are unique in their own way and they aren\'t just some dumb people that can\'t make decisions, but have their own flaws, goals, desires, and overall feel like real people. The main character himself has a serious obsession with little sisters, and sure, it does get pretty extreme at some points, but it never feels TOO overboard and suits his personality and character. And his relationship with every other character is pretty great as well. Nayuta, or ""Ochinchin girl"" as some of you might call her, isn\'t just some thirsty girl, but actually has a reason for being this way, is really cute, and her backstory is very interesting and one of the things I wish were explained in more detail. Miyako is also pretty interesting, and feels the most realistic out of all of them, for several reasons that I cannot mention here because of the risk of spoilers. And then there\'s Haruto, which the story makes you feel bad for and wish to see succeed. However, things never really seem to go right for him. As I said, if you need a reason to watch this series, this is it. The characters are outstanding and the series will make you care about them pretty quickly.Overall: 10/10Enjoyment:The series itself is extremely enjoyable, really funny, and the drama portions that are thrown in there don\'t feel too out of place. If you\'re looking for an anime just for enjoyment, this will most definitely not disappoint you.Overall: 10/10This is my first review, so it might not be perfect, but I had so much frustration built up inside of me because of all the people that just give it a 1 without even watching it and judge the anime because of a couple scenes, I just had to write a review. I could do in so much more detail but that would risk spoilers. Just go watch the series. You will not regret it. Can\'t wait for a Season 2. great.

For writers and college students, it gets a little too real at times.Art is cute overall.

After the first 2 minutes, i thought it was trying to one up the trashy shows we have been getting lately, but when it turned out to be the butt of a joke i knew this show wouldn\'t be too bad.The story was awkward to say the least. It wasn\'t bad by any means, but weird at some points.

The focus of the anime is not little sisters or that Itsuki actually has one oops... screw it the series is almost over. The focus of the story is the development of the relationship between Itsuki and Nayu, she\'s no joke she will do anything to get Itsuki, and her behind the scenes machinations become front and center around episode 8 or 9. To the point of wresting a manipulated confession from...an inebriated Itsuki while she was supposed to be asleep and not hear. Her powers and influence seem almost godlike in their ability to get exactly what she wants maybe channeling Haruhi Suzumiya? At some point apparently Itsuki did something that saved her life what it was has been alluded to but not revealed perhaps episode 12 will bring it to light. The anime is not about romance between siblings the most lascivious thing about the anime is the Yuri teasing between the openly female characters and Nayu\'s skinship with the other girls. This is not a bad thing it teases but does not satisfy with good ""plot"" or ""fanservice"". That said very much looking forward to the close though i\'d love the anime to extend another season as the world and characters are interesting.Music is so so kinda like elevator music. Artwork is very good and I watch a lot of anime.  Overall this anime made my 10 for the Fall season right up there with Girls Last Tour, Konohana Kitan, Blend S and Net Juu no Susume. The star of Fall is no doubt Ancient Magus Bride. The anime kept my attention enough that I grabbed each episode as soon as it was subbed. an inebriated Itsuki while she was supposed to be asleep and not hear.

So going into this anime I was a little sceptical and was expecting the same kind of treatment, but to my delight it surprised me hugely and is definitely one of the funniest anime's I've experienced in a good while.Story (9/10)The story focuses on Itsuki Hashima, a growing Light Novelist, who has an obsession for little sisters and puts them into his stories.That's pretty much the gist of the story, mainly because there isn't much of a story here....Instead it's more of a character driven story, where it relies more on the chemistry between the characters instead of like a big end goal you usually see.It still shows what the life of a light novelist is like, much like in Eromanga Sensei. However that is just an example of what it's like starting out as a light novelist, whereas here we see it in much greater detail as Itsuki struggles to keep up with deadlines and trying to make sure his stories are at their finest quality. Itsuki and his friends often travel to places to think up of ideas for their stories and even shows how manga artists operate too.Compared to Eromanga Sensei, this anime goes into much deeper aspects of the life of Light Novelists and other various stuff linked to it, like anime and manga.The meat of the show though, is the characters themselves. I absolutely love the amount of chemistry the characters had and made each episode so much fun to watch. They usually had meetups, parties or played games from time to time and these instances were really great, it was really funny how quickly all of the conversations and games got out of hand making for some spectacular moments of hilariousness.There was also a some what deepness to the anime, the interactions between the characters as we got to know them more showed a deeper meaning to their relationships and how much they mean to each other. These moments were nicely spaced inbetween the comedic stuff and gave you a reason to care for the characters.Characters (9/10)It has been a long while since I have seen a group of characters and enjoy every single one of them, usually there's always one character who seems bland or dislikeable. I could not find that here and I applaud the anime for managing to do this.Itsuki is the male MC and creates light novels that always involve the main character having a little sister. The fact that for once he isn't a 15 year old sex thirsty teen felt refreshing, yeah his fetish for little sisters is pretty damn creepy, but the anime turns it into a big joke that just made me like the character more. Also despite looking like he isn't always in the best mood, he respects and enjoys the company of his friends and has brilliant banter with them. He also puts a lot of passion and determination into his stories which also has to gain some respect as well.Nayuta Kani is the female MC and also a light novelist, she is pretty much the character who steals the show, sure all the other characters are great, but Kani is absolutely hilarious. She has an immense affection for Itsuki since his stories saved her from a deep depression and she hopes to be his girlfriend one day, luckily she doesn't force this in a stupid like most other characters I've seen do this. She also has a really lewd mouth meaning most of her sentences will always end up being something sexual and oh boy can it be pure gold, because no matter what she said it always made me laugh. She also has this funny obsession of having to touch another girls breasts just to help her create an image for her story, which was always funny with Miyako.Haruto Fuwa is another male character, who is a light novelist. He and Itsuki always have a friendly competition with each other when it comes to the sales and feedback of their light novels, but they respect each other in the area they work in. Fuwa is a pretty cool dude and you tend to feel sorry for him when his work becomes a poorly made anime, he usually gets through the hard times thanks to his friends and sometimes even gains determination from the way Itsuki does his work.Miyako Shirakawa isn't a light novelist and used to be Itsuki's friend in college before he dropped out, she tends to be the one who doesn't know as much stuff when it comes to the industry her friends work in and wishes she could understand it better with how much they talk about it and love doing what they do. You also tend to feel a little sorry for her innocent nature as she tends to get caught up in pretty funny situations with Kani that end up with her being nude.Chihiro Hashima is Itsuki's step-brother, well in Itsuki's eyes she is since Chihiro is actually his step-sister. She tends to look after Itsuki when the going gets tough and makes him meals and does chores around the room when he doesn't have time to do it. She's a pretty strong and capable character, despite ending up in a few funny situations with Itsuki's friends and associates.Art (8/10)Even though the artstyle isn't really amazing, there is still something there. The characters did have a familiar look to Tsurezure Children with the sorta play doh look except it wasn't as strong here, although it made the female characters a lot cuter despite them being 18 and older.I did like the different locations the characters went to for their story ideas, so the anime wasn't limited to one area and some of the stuff to represent manga and light novel drawings were pretty damn good replications, kinda inceptiony really.I also liked some of the other stuff like that one episode where they tried to play out a fantasy game, that felt pretty interesting with the designs as well.Sound (7/10)The sound is admittedly the weakest section of the anime. The op was alright, but didn't grow on me much by the end.The ed however was actually sweet and had a nice soft beat to it that always felt relaxing to hear at the end of an episode, but there was a particular section of the soundtrack for the ed that sounded a little like The Devil is a Part Timer ed.The soundtrack is also pretty forgettable.Extras:Even though there is quite a good amount of ecchi, it is nicely used as a tool for the shows comedic elements and the both of them work incredibly well together, which surprised me. Usually whenever anime's try to combine these two things like most Harems it kinda falls flat and ends up being more cringy than funny, here they are used at specific moments and boy are some of these moments absolutely fantastic, my favourite being the encounter between Chihiro and Ena, where Ena wanted to sketch Chihiro's ass and the way it was done was friggin hilarious.There is a romance element here too, this subtlety grows over the course of the show especially between Itsuki and Kani who become two really lovable characters by the end and actually seem like they have a chance of ending up together.Enjoyment (9/10)This is probably one of the funniest if not the funniest anime I saw from 2017.Overall (9/10)Overall this is definitely an anime that thinks you're in for more of the stupid brother/sister complex crap, especially with the opening sequence. Instead it uses that stuff as parody material and uses it to great effect, this definitely feels like an underrated gem. Instead it's more of a character driven story, where it relies more on the chemistry between the characters instead of like a big end goal you usually see.It still shows what the life of a light novelist is like, much like in Eromanga Sensei. However that is just an example of what it's like starting out as a light novelist, whereas here we see it in much greater detail as Itsuki struggles to keep up with deadlines and trying to make sure his stories are at their finest quality.

These moments were nicely spaced inbetween the comedic stuff and gave you a reason to care for the characters.Characters (9/10)It has been a long while since I have seen a group of characters and enjoy every single one of them, usually there's always one character who seems bland or dislikeable. I could not find that here and I applaud the anime for managing to do this.Itsuki is the male MC and creates light novels that always involve the main character having a little sister. The fact that for once he isn't a 15 year old sex thirsty teen felt refreshing, yeah his fetish for little sisters is pretty damn creepy, but the anime turns it into a big joke that just made me like the character more. Also despite looking like he isn't always in the best mood, he respects and enjoys the company of his friends and has brilliant banter with them. He also puts a lot of passion and determination into his stories which also has to gain some respect as well.Nayuta Kani is the female MC and also a light novelist, she is pretty much the character who steals the show, sure all the other characters are great, but Kani is absolutely hilarious. She has an immense affection for Itsuki since his stories saved her from a deep depression and she hopes to be his girlfriend one day, luckily she doesn't force this in a stupid like most other characters I've seen do this. She also has a really lewd mouth meaning most of her sentences will always end up being something sexual and oh boy can it be pure gold, because no matter what she said it always made me laugh. She also has this funny obsession of having to touch another girls breasts just to help her create an image for her story, which was always funny with Miyako.Haruto Fuwa is another male character, who is a light novelist. He and Itsuki always have a friendly competition with each other when it comes to the sales and feedback of their light novels, but they respect each other in the area they work in. Fuwa is a pretty cool dude and you tend to feel sorry for him when his work becomes a poorly made anime, he usually gets through the hard times thanks to his friends and sometimes even gains determination from the way Itsuki does his work.Miyako Shirakawa isn't a light novelist and used to be Itsuki's friend in college before he dropped out, she tends to be the one who doesn't know as much stuff when it comes to the industry her friends work in and wishes she could understand it better with how much they talk about it and love doing what they do. You also tend to feel a little sorry for her innocent nature as she tends to get caught up in pretty funny situations with Kani that end up with her being nude.Chihiro Hashima is Itsuki's step-brother, well in Itsuki's eyes she is since Chihiro is actually his step-sister. She tends to look after Itsuki when the going gets tough and makes him meals and does chores around the room when he doesn't have time to do it. She's a pretty strong and capable character, despite ending up in a few funny situations with Itsuki's friends and associates.Art (8/10)Even though the artstyle isn't really amazing, there is still something there. The characters did have a familiar look to Tsurezure Children with the sorta play doh look except it wasn't as strong here, although it made the female characters a lot cuter despite them being 18 and older.I did like the different locations the characters went to for their story ideas, so the anime wasn't limited to one area and some of the stuff to represent manga and light novel drawings were pretty damn good replications, kinda inceptiony really.I also liked some of the other stuff like that one episode where they tried to play out a fantasy game, that felt pretty interesting with the designs as well.Sound (7/10)The sound is admittedly the weakest section of the anime. The op was alright, but didn't grow on me much by the end.The ed however was actually sweet and had a nice soft beat to it that always felt relaxing to hear at the end of an episode, but there was a particular section of the soundtrack for the ed that sounded a little like The Devil is a Part Timer ed.The soundtrack is also pretty forgettable.Extras:Even though there is quite a good amount of ecchi, it is nicely used as a tool for the shows comedic elements and the both of them work incredibly well together, which surprised me. Usually whenever anime's try to combine these two things like most Harems it kinda falls flat and ends up being more cringy than funny, here they are used at specific moments and boy are some of these moments absolutely fantastic, my favourite being the encounter between Chihiro and Ena, where Ena wanted to sketch Chihiro's ass and the way it was done was friggin hilarious.There is a romance element here too, this subtlety grows over the course of the show especially between Itsuki and Kani who become two really lovable characters by the end and actually seem like they have a chance of ending up together.Enjoyment (9/10)This is probably one of the funniest if not the funniest anime I saw from 2017.Overall (9/10)Overall this is definitely an anime that thinks you're in for more of the stupid brother/sister complex crap, especially with the opening sequence. Instead it uses that stuff as parody material and uses it to great effect, this definitely feels like an underrated gem."", 'First of all, this is my first review, so I apologize in advance if it is not very good. However, what I want to say that is you should watch the entire anime before you say make a judgement because it honestly surprised me.In my opinion, the summary does not really do this anime justice. It is a barebones explanation of the premise of the anime. Note that I said premise, because it is definitely not an adequate representation of the anime itself. It states that it is ""the daily life of a young siscon novelist, Itsuki Hashima with his perfect little sister Chihiro."" The...problem with this is that it portrays the anime as about little sister love, but that is incorrect. It almost has nothing to do with actual little sisters. This anime is about the life of a writer who loves little sisters, but he only writes about them. The anime has almost no focus on the little sister loving the main character.Some others have said that it is unoriginal and simply recycles the trope of little sisters. However, I would have to disagree with this--the people who posted these reviews likely had not watched that far into the anime. Even some reviews that are somewhat positive show that they have only watched four episodes or so.The story is not remarkable in any way; it is a typical slice of life show out of high school. The art and sound are nothing special as well, and there is quite a bit of fanservice. But what stands out to me is the characters. At first glance, they seem to be boring, cookie-cutter characters, but after the first few episodes, the characters, particularly the two male writers receive a bit more character development. The part that really sells it for me is how it balances seriousness and comedy. There is usually a few episodes of lightheartedness before being interrupted by a serious section, which helps to give the viewer a rest from the comedy and lighthearted sections. Personally, this was quite refreshing and helped to stop and overwhelming amount of cuteness and comedy.This anime actually goes somewhat in depth to the feelings and lives of writers (which seems fitting, since it was originally a light novel series). Most of it revolves around how they are afraid they will not be successful in the light novel and anime world, and how they feel when they do succeed. Additionally, they have a eighteen-year-old genius writer close to them that the main character constantly compares themselves with. This is really what makes me love the characters so much because I can understand how they feel. It really speaks to me.I feel like I have not properly explained what makes this anime good, so I think that you should watch this anime to see for yourself. Although it starts out somewhat slow, that is how slice-of-life anime generally start out, so I do not think that is really a negative point. So far, I have really enjoyed this anime. I hope that I will still hold the same opinion once it ends because like Arkada from Glass Reflection, I believe the ending to be paramount.

The character introduction was quick, clean and to the point and wastes no time getting to the jokes. This anime is mostly a comedy and really nothing else, maybe slice of life/ comedy. So was it funny? At times sure but it wasn't lol funny. Lots of sexual type jokes less slap-stick or punch line type jokes. My problem with this one is that for the most part, story wise, nothing happens. And yet it hints that it will. It almost felt like two people wrote the script where one wanted a story and the...other just wanted cheap laughs. This lack of fluidity made me not care about the characters and all in all made it less funny. Now i can forgive any anime if it has good romance, unfortunately if you're here for the romance be prepared to be underwhelmed. And that's all i'll say about that. I recommend this anime to anyone with nothing better to watch or want a quick laugh. I did enjoy it enough to finish it with ease but next week I will have forgotten all about it. other just wanted cheap laughs.

Of course not right? You would never think of it as a worthwhile show to watch. But having to see the rest of this series, my answer would be as ambiguous as this show can get. You see, this show has a lot of potential. But most of it gets overshadowed by the unnecessary tropes and fan service present in the show. It would have been a perfect drama/romance/slice of life anime if it weren’t for a few problems that this show possesses. To fill...you in with the details, let’s start with the story.The story revolves around our protagonist, Itsuki, and his daily life as a light novel author whose books involve incestuous themes of obsession to little sisters. Even though this series was supposed to be more romance oriented, I say that it exceled as a slice of life show. The show did well highlighting the life of a light novel author. From the struggles of writing a material and making it to the deadline up to the conflicts that arise between authors and the anime industry, these were all portrayed very well making it an excellent slice of life anime. Meanwhile, it also did well creating a whole dramatic atmosphere as the characters interact to each other. From the start, the relationship between characters are already well-built and all throughout the series, it shows how such relationships we’re made. It did in a very dramatic way the can surely deal impact on the viewers. The flashbacks that show how each and every single one of the characters met always left me with feeling of both sadness and amusement. This aspect of the show is what I admire the most. It is what kept me from continuing the show despite having some aspects that I can’t deal with that well. I’m talking about of course the tropes and fan service present in the show. To begin with, this series already follows the “imouto” trend that’s been going on for quite a while now. But what really took the cake when it comes to ruining this show was the fan service. From the female anatomy up to the simplest of dialogues, this series is not holding back. Just by looking at the first episode you’ll be greeted by an extremely weird incest fan service that would leave you wanting to drop this show immediately. But what really irritated me the most were the obligatory sex jokes on almost every line of one of the heroine’s dialogue. To me, it felt like these bad aspects of the show were overshadowing the good ones.  These bad aspects were a bit more prominent during the first few episodes of the series. This might cause a lot of views to get turned off and drop the show instantly. Although halfway along the series, all the fan service gradually toned down and it focused more on being light-hearted show. Even the “imouto” romance that I thought this show would have was not present anymore. The last few episodes featured the characters just playing games almost the entire episode like you see in most slice of life anime. The bits of progression were still there and I don’t really have problems with those episodes because they are still entertaining nonetheless.  The ending gave me a vague impression that this show will receive another season. If so, then that would be great and I would gladly watch it. So overall, I can say for that the story did a fair job in as an element of this show. It did its best to be different even though the concept of the story isn’t really something new. Although I say it would have been a lot better if all the unnecessary fan service and stereotypes were not present in the first place. But nonetheless, it’s still quite entertaining.I can’t really go in-depth with the characters because I might end up leaving a few spoilers but to say for sure, the charm of this show comes from the characters. Despite looking quite generic, the characters are actually well written. Their relationship felt so real and heartwarming. Every interaction between them leaves you with a distinct smile. If there’s something worth-while from this show, it would be the characters.When it comes to the art of this series, I can’t really say that I’m a fan of it. The art style is pretty much your run-of-the-mill stuff with more vibrant colors but lesser detail. But there’s the occasional bright and colorful background that was used in the show.  It caught my attention the first time I saw it but then I don’t ever remember seeing it again. The character design made the characters look like teens while in reality, they are adults. Overall, I’d say the art is okay but really nothing impressive.For the sound, this show really has some good opening and ending theme on it. Personally, I really liked the ending theme. Hearing it play at the end of every episode felt soothing. The opening also did a great job setting the tone of the show. For the soundtracks that play on the background, those that play during the lighter, more slice of life oriented scenes are the ones the caught my attention. So I’d say that the sound was pretty good.In conclusion, I say this show is not that bad. If you look at the story and the characters alone, this is a perfect drama/romance/slice of life anime. Those that are capable of tolerating fan service and stereotypes are probably in for a ride but those who can’t are better off skipping this one. Although it has it fair share of elements that I don’t find amusing, I can’t say that I did not enjoy this show. If ever it will receive another season and I will probably give it a chance.Overall score would be 7/10.Thanks for reading. you in with the details, let’s start with the story.The story revolves around our protagonist, Itsuki, and his daily life as a light novel author whose books involve incestuous themes of obsession to little sisters.

As such, the title of the show can be rather misleading, sounding as though it is yet another insipid, irritating entry into the ""people watch because they want to bone the sister"" category of anime. Thankfully it is not, although it has a fair share of ecchi material, and is basically about the author of Eromanga Sensei.The anime roughly has a skeleton of a continuous story....There is some development in characters\' feelings toward each other, and some actions and backstories are mentioned a number of times. However, the bulk of the runtime is spent watching the characters hanging out, drinking a various number of beers, playing board games, and navigating the world of being an author. This worked quite well, balancing a good story with straightforward fun times and a neat take on the writing world. Things don\'t always work out for the characters in this story either: bad things happen, and that\'s how real life is. It felt quite real! 8/10 for story.The art wasn\'t anything spectacular. As stated, a lot of it is merely games and apartments. However, when games with RPG elements were being played, animating out the RPG adventure made for a fun time, and a difference in the usual pace and animation of the show. You\'ll see a lot of real life beer animated, and real life locations. Gets the job done. 7/10.I really liked the music in the show. The OP was a bop, and the ED really felt mature and almost city-like, creating a mellow, chill end to each episode. BGM was well done too, complimenting without distracting. 8/10!I\'m giving a 7/10 for characters, and the score would be higher if not for the handling of Nayuta\'s character. I\'m fine with pervy, lewd characters, but she was taken too far. Whenever she had screen time, it would be an insufferable mess of being plagued by over the top lewd comments and actions every three seconds. I didn\'t find her to have character beyond that, nor any development. Besides her, the other characters were strong 8/10\'s. Good development, likable characters, interesting development. Chihiro was an easy favorite.I really enjoyed this series, much more than I thought I would. The characters grew on me and I was interested to see where their stories went, and everyday slice of life shows are right up my alley. This show is perfect if you want a laid back time watching a group of adults (Adults??? In an anime???) hang out and live life together. I also loved the information about different special Japanese beers and games. 8/10!Overall, Imouto Sae Ireba Ii is an enjoyable series to watch while having a beer, as you\'ll probably feel like having one after watching. It provides realistic stories over a casual tone, and you\'ll find yourself liking it way more than you would assume from the absurd title.7/10. There is some development in characters\' feelings toward each other, and some actions and backstories are mentioned a number of times. However, the bulk of the runtime is spent watching the characters hanging out, drinking a various number of beers, playing board games, and navigating the world of being an author. This worked quite well, balancing a good story with straightforward fun times and a neat take on the writing world. Things don\'t always work out for the characters in this story either: bad things happen, and that\'s how real life is. It felt quite real! 8/10 for story.The art wasn\'t anything spectacular.

To me they were really mature and i like\'em a lot.The mood is relaxing at times (for example when they played board games) but other times was really tense cause of their decisions as i said earlier.I\'m not sure how...to express what i felt watching this show but it let me a good taste.I won\'t tell what the show is about, i\'m just dropping what i think is important on a review. You can search for the premise and decide to watch it or not.My reccomendation is, watch it, is not the best on its genre but is not the cliché show you are expecting it to be. to express what i felt watching this show but it let me a good taste.I won\'t tell what the show is about, i\'m just dropping what i think is important on a review.

Here are my thoughts:Wow this is complete trash. It was a mistake to feel the slightest flicker of optimism for anything created by the same guy who wrote Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. Despite being about the manga/LN industry and having characters who are slightly older and 'more adult' than your average anime, this show is surprisingly juvenile. The author really channelled their inner 14-year-old boy into this.There is a ton of sexual humour in this and most of it is utterly moronic, even by anime standards. Furthermore, the amount...of time that gets spent on it is ridiculous; it's not just a line or two here and there – they spend entire scenes just for some idiotic gradeschool-tier sexual joke that makes me feel like I'm being lobotomized. The comedy is unfunny in general, but all the sexual jokes are especially atrocious and just so excessive and ever-present. This show often feels like a 14-year-old boy with an awful sense of humour wrote it with his dick in his hand. I'm not even prude or anything, it's just the constant sexual humour was absolutely eyeroll-inducing and none of it was clever at all. Literally it feels like most of this show's script was written by a dumb hormonal teenage boy. The 'siscon' schtick (recall the title of the anime) also wore out its welcome very fast, and the ways it was used were surprisingly uncreative, especially considering how frequently it was invoked.The MC was such an annoying little pervy worm; I wanted to beat him up, steal his lunch money, and hang his sneakers from the power lines. He was an insufferable little dweeb with zero redeeming qualities. What an awful MC – probably made to resemble the mouthbreather mental-teenager author himself. In fact I disliked the entire cast; all of the primary characters were annoying in some way. For a show clearly made to appeal to young men, the two female leads both had surprisingly off-putting personalities.Later in the series there is some character drama involving the main members of the cast in some kind of convoluted love-polygon situation, with a cup of jealousy and inferiority complex thrown in. This drama felt even more juvenile than all the sexual humour. It was really stupid and just unpleasant and groan-inducing to watch.I must admit, the skits with the accountant were actually funny. Same goes for the tabletop-RPG episode – that one was sorta funny and relatable too (although still plagued by excessive unfunny sexual humour).As far as the publishing industry theme of this show goes, they did make some effort to demonstrate the emotional experiences of authors. However, although the concept is promising, I was still disappointed by this aspect of the show – I thought it could have been handled better but also that it deserved greater focus. The screentime of this anime is dominated by all the sexual comedy, and this promising aspect of the show is neglected as a result. Also, the childishness of the writing and characters themselves neutered a lot of the potential this dimension of the show had. It's hard to relate to this awful cast of characters, even if some of their experiences resemble those that real-life writers commonly encounter.I thought the OST was bad. If I have to hear one more generic saxophone-heavy 'lewd atmosphere' track I am going to flip a table. Of course this kind of music plays frequently due to the prominence of sexual comedy in this show, and it does not enhance the humour at all. Even outside these scenes, the OST never once enhanced my enjoyment of the show. The voice acting for the entire cast was mediocre as well, with the exception of Nayuta – her VA did a good job and sounded cute, although I disliked her character.As for visuals, they were adequate but mediocre. I didn't like the bolt-on-torpedo-tits character designs of the females, and all the males looked dweebish and unattractive. There is no discernable art style and the visuals were never a source of enjoyment for me. Also they could have had way more fun with the character outfits, considering they're all adults in an informal creative industry, but instead the outfits are boring, uncreative, and rarely change.I appreciated the craft beer 'food fanservice' in the show. Delicious craft beer doesn't get nearly enough culinary attention in anime, haha.My overall rating: 3/10This anime in one sentence: a bunch of unlikable characters (mostly LN authors) hang out together and there is a lot of excessive unfunny sexual humour, and then during the later episodes there's some eyeroll-inducing crummy immature character drama about people you don't care about. The end.This show is quite juvenile and a teenage boy would likely enjoy it far more than I did. Anybody who wants to enjoy this needs to put themselves in a juvenile state of mind and get in touch with their inner teenage boy. If you, like me, tend to dislike sexual humour (especially in excess) then I would suggest avoiding this anime.

I kinda expect this to be like OreImo and Eromanga-sensei.I\'m writing this from the perspective of someone who expect this to be kinda like OreImo or Eromanga-sensei, about a brother/sister relationship, so keep that in mind.The story is about Hashima Itsuki, a young light-novel author who is really obsessed with \'little sister\' character in literature and wants a little sister, and his companions, Kani Nayuta, a highschool girl who is also an...author and really loves him by showing her affection through dirty jokes and such, Shirakawa Miyako, Itsuki\'s friend from college and the only one in the group who is not an author, and Fuwa Haruto, Itsuki\'s male best friend/rival, and Mashima Chihiro, Itsuki\'s perfect, dependable younger sibling.Story: 4As someone who expect the story and plot to revolve around a Brother/Sister relationship, i was pretty much disappointed. The story revolves around Itsuki\'s life as an author, its more of a slice of life about life as an author, and not much else. I find the humour is pretty dry, and the story/plot to be pretty boring.Art: 7It has a nice art. I\'m not an expert in this area, but well, its pretty nice.Sound: ?Not an expert, or even an amateur on sound quality, so i can really give a good review about the sound.Character: 8The only redeeming quality about this anime, except for Chihiro, is the character. They all have a different set of personality, and everyone seems to have a deeper character than most other anime. They all have a different reasons on why they hang around Itsuki/becoming Itsuki\'s friends, and each one is pretty deep. They\'re not just your generic \'friend to MC\' character. Everyone has their own story.Enjoyment: 5Despite the lack of interesting plot/story, i found myself mildly enjoying this and just kept watching just because the characters are interesting to me. You might like this if you like slice-of-life genre, and doesn\'t expect more, but if you expect a romcom or slice-of-life about Brother/Sister relationship, then you will find this a bit disappointing since they rarely show Itsuki\'s interaction with his younger sibling, Chihiro and focusing more on the \'author\' part.Overall, its 6 from me because i kinda expect this anime to be about a Brother/Sister relationship because of the title (A Sister\'s All You Need), and just disappointed from the lack of interaction between Itsuki and his younger sibling.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryIf Anime would been as the first 3 minutes of it. I would enjoy it in a comical way.But the actual story is slice-of-life about Novel writers and basically about their daily lives and essentially story is about learning the characters and join along with their lives. I would say for a slice-of-life it has some interesting ideas and premise. But I simply couldn\'t enjoy it. Oh and round table alcohol consumption was a common theme there as well.I found most of their dialogues being between boring...and obnoxious. The idea of them playing all sorts of memory and basically idea games, was interesting as concept, but felt boring in truth.I personally found it for the most part boring. And dialogues were one of the main reasons I decided to drop this and move on.✦Art & SoundArt & Animation was good enough and fitting for this Anime. The scenes where authors or character works & imagination were done pretty good.As for music, I think it was fine for the most part, but at the same time I didn\'t really notice any music? In another words had quite weak presence.✦CharacterMost the the cast were quirky authors with different kinks and fetishes. Even side-characters were semi-entertaining. I feel there was some progression, plus we did learn about characters over time.But at the same time, I seriously couldn\'t get into any of the characters. I just found them either dull or annoying. Oddly enough, most of the characters had some dominating traits I did not enjoy.But only one I want to mention here is Kani. As much I like lewd girls, she is the type I dislike. She is dangerously crude, unrefined dirty talking character. She is lucky that the guy she likes is actually respectable and doesn\'t take the bait nor attack. I cannot explain how exactly I don\'t like her, but the general ""feel"" she gives off, is simply something I can\'t enjoy.✦Enjoyment & OverallI find it very niche Anime that certain type of people or authors can appreciate it better than I do.But boring dialogues, unlikable characters and simply me being not able to get into the story nor the characters is good enough reason to drop this Anime. and obnoxious.

You'll have to read the light novels (or manga, if they exist, I don't know).'A Sister's All You Need' starts out as a full blown ecchi siscon anime and about halfway through turns into a board game advertisement show with slice of life elements and occasional ecchi moments, which vary from light perverse humor to a full on yuri groping session.Despite what the title promises, there is no little sister, only a protagonist who is obsessed with his ideal fantasies of them.Hashima Itsuki is a young 20-something year...old established light novel writer working on his career from his one room apartment. He is friends with a couple of other authors whom he hangs out with, along with a friend from high school and his step brother who visits frequently and helps cook and clean.Itsuki is an unapologetic siscon who obsesses over the concept of the perfect little sister and tries to implement it into his writing. Meanwhile people of the fairer sex have their eye on him.There are references to other sister related entertainment such as Oreimo and Eromanga Sensei, though this title is written by a different author.The progression of the story is odd. It starts out hard with a very spicy opening scene of a naked little sister straddling her brother, which of course turns out to be an imagining of a story Itsuki has written, and then turns into a slice of life show about Itsuki and his friends and how they experience starting from light novel authors and moving up on to manga and anime based on their novels.This part of the show is actually pretty interesting, even if it's mostly skin deep and glosses over almost all the detail.There's a half-way harem theme going on but the show never really goes anywhere with it, as this season is largely a setup for another.Curiously the show turns into a board game advertisement across multiple episodes and I have to wonder if this was a requirement for the anime to be made. By the last episode this content has definitely overstayed its welcome, but all the games are interesting and related to the anime, in the form of story telling and being in the industry.The main cast is interesting, you have the head-over-heels girl Nayuta who is overtly in love with Itsuki, who keeps trying despite his initial rejection, who also happens to be a top selling author.Then you have Itsuki's friend Miyaki from highschool who hangs with the group as the 'straight woman' character with her own doubts and wishes. The other male character Fuwa is another author who is in between Itsuki and Nayuta in terms of success who struggles with his own brand of writing and disappointing successes, obsessing over how his works are perceived.Finally there's Itsuki's step brother who there is absolutely nothing suspicious about.All of them have their stories and are focused on well enough. It's a light hearted show with practically no drama or misunderstandings which is to the show's benefit.It's a decent comedy/slice of life/ecchi show with some genuinely funny moments.

To call it a romance is a bit of a stretch but that does not stop me from recommending it to other people, Its cute, funny, and has that little bit of cringe that we all like. Its not focused on the drama aspect but there are hints and moments of some, and the anime leaves off for a season 2 if there will be...one.If it has a season 2 and actually goes into romance more i'd put this at one of my top anime so far in my no life otaku journey of 18 years.Overall im conflicted to put into 8's but its def a 8/10 so far, subjected to go higher if we ever get more. one.If it has a season 2 and actually goes into romance more i'd put this at one of my top anime so far in my no life otaku journey of 18 years.Overall im conflicted to put into 8's but its def a 8/10 so far, subjected to go higher if we ever get more."", ""Another adorable anime completed! Let's get right into the anime basics.Story; You follow the daily life of Itsuki Hashima, a novelist who creates fantasies, light novels and romance that are surrounded by his obsession with little sisters. Besides his crazy obsession for having a little sister, you discover he's actually a normal guy with normal problems that we could all face on the daily. Watch how he's grown, how he effects the crazy cast around him and why he acts the way he does. The plot for this story is really sweet, and although it can be VERY erotic at times this anime still somehow...gives me a cozy family feel. Art; I'm happy they went with Silver Link to create this anime; it represents the mangas original drawings (From only taking a quick glance) really well... the manga to animation style slightly reminds me of Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou... ya know that adaption. Sound; the background sounds from whenever something was inappropriate and the full OST suite the anime perfectly BUT it also wasn't enough to pump me up for the next episodes to come. Characters; They built up the cast of characters very well. They gave just enough background information for each character to make them lovable and maybe feel of empathy for them. At the same, it ticked me off when they'd make a sad/mopey flashback and not give it enough context to WHY they were in the situation in the first place.Overall, I freakin enjoyed the heck out of this anime. I know it's popular for episode 3 (THE EGG SCENE) but I truly believe the best scene was in episode 9 (GO TO 9min and watch till 10:40 to laugh your god damn ass off... and if it's not enough context for you, then just watch all of episode 9)I highly suggest this anime to anyone who enjoyed Eromanga-Sensei, or just needs some hilariously inappropriate humour in their life.

The wait was well worth it, and itwas something I can be proud to say I watched with glee....Story: 7/10Concept is simple. A group of friends centering around the protagonist gettogether often and share moments of their everyday lives. In this case,the majority are in the publishing industry, and so we get a semi-deepexploration and explanation as to how their everyday schedules are like, andthe troubles involved. More will be elaborated individually in the characters,as that is the main focus of this type of anime, where emphasis is placed moreon the characters themselves, and the plot takes a background role.One thing I want to say is that this is not just a rom-com with randomness. I find thestory to be well paced in terms of it being a \'slice-of-life\', in the sensethat this is not an anime where you will feel the urge to jump to the nextepisode (like shoujo animes, where cliffhangers are presented). There is an air of\'my pace\' throughout every episode, where the characters aren\'t in lifethreatening situations, but more just struggling to live and cope with situations thatnearly every adult will face. I find that fact itself calming for it fits the overallcomposition of the anime, where the characters themselves do not show their innerconflicts openly at first glance, but the cracks can be seen in time (much like mostof society).Another interesting note is that they commonly get together and play board games.You learn a lot of fun things well visually illustrated.

It is thissense of harbouring that makes the characters memorable.Music: 8/10The OP/ED were both soothing. Choucho always delivers.Background music for situations were fitting, but not memorable. I wouldn\'t saygeneric either. The point is, there won\'t be a time you think : ""why is this music here"".I find the songs presented at key moments very well placed. Occasional shivers.Art: 9/10Cute and fuzzy. Not totoro fuzzy, but along the lines of oreimo, where it is easy onthe eyes, and not excessively moe to the point of umaru/hinako note at times.Enjoyment: 8/10The humour feels forced at times, but thankfully it isn\'t often enough for itto be a concern. The ratio of good moments far outweigh the cons.Partial nudity is a correct way to put it. You will see shapes and outlines,but not clear views.If you ever feel like you are being swept away by the tide of the world, just sit backand enjoy this anime. Give it some time to unveil. Story: 7/10Concept is simple. A group of friends centering around the protagonist gettogether often and share moments of their everyday lives. In this case,the majority are in the publishing industry, and so we get a semi-deepexploration and explanation as to how their everyday schedules are like, andthe troubles involved. More will be elaborated individually in the characters,as that is the main focus of this type of anime, where emphasis is placed moreon the characters themselves, and the plot takes a background role.One thing I want to say is that this is not just a rom-com with randomness. I find thestory to be well paced in terms of it being a \'slice-of-life\', in the sensethat this is not an anime where you will feel the urge to jump to the nextepisode (like shoujo animes, where cliffhangers are presented).

Give it some time to unveil.', ""A Little Sister Is All You Need(Imouto Sae Ireba Ii)was a big surprise for me.The way the series starts out is so infamous of how messed up it was that it turned off a good chunk of people.I expected to go head first into an eromanga sensei-esque trashy incest show because of the title.BUT this show is waaaaaaay different than that.The story more or less is about this light novel author with a weird fetish for younger sisters who makes his stories about little sisters.And this show is just his journey making his way up through the entertainment business with his peers,with lives of their...own cheering him on.Despite how “hype” that plot sounds, It is way more tame than it sounds.But, for some reason IT’S SO DAMN ENTERTAINING.Let me explain…Despite the very casual nature, it is not boring at all because of the colorful characters put in these real life situation.For light novel authors that is.That also made it interesting because it informed me on the light novel industry, which i knew nothing about, it also answered one question that was on  my mind since i started watching anime:why the hell there were so many shitty anime adaptations.There are situations that bring up new perspective and completely changed my mindset about manga and anime adaptations.Surprisingly this show also gets super emotional too and it is done in a very organic way.Not only that but it really got to me, it did really speak to me even though I am not an author and I feel like it will speak to many others who watch.When it comes the slice of life aspect, it does deliver as well.Usually the characters are either going on trips or playing games.They are funny as hell but each have their own story supported by the main one.It still makes me question if being a light novel writer is like this because there are a lot of wacky moments,but in the end, this story is really enjoyable,thoughtful, with characters that make it so wholesome And the ending of the show is just amazingly beautiful and it really raised the bar on my overall thoughts of the show.Animation was done by silver link whom I adore.They made Yurikuma Arashi (One of my favorite anime of all time btw) and they made other shows.Silver Link can animate really well,But are mostly comfortable being average.Honestly, the animation did not bother me.Yurikuma had a reason to be beautifully animated, this show does not really, but I can still tell that they had a very moderate budget.The character designs are average but appealing, and the background is just a hair above average.The opening is one of my favorites ever,it’s just so catchy and sounds so good,the ending song is also great too with a catchy beat and a nice crescendo.I absolutely adore what they do with the visuals of them. If you pay attention, they change parts in the opening depending on the episode. And the ending feels so well fitted into each episode that it feels like less of end sequence and like a montage.And for some reason the soundtrack was good too???There were some catchy ass tracks in this show. It is hard to explain, but it was like it was simple but varied at the same time.Okay the characters in the show includes the main one Itsuki, his author friend Haruto,his other friend/potential love bug Nayuta,his….other friend Miyako who was the bystander looking in,and his “brother”Chihiro.There are so many dynamics with these characters,main or minor, that it’s like a star.One character is developed by others and vice versa.Despite the qualities about the main character, with his INSANE sister fetish, I still enjoyed him because of his experiences with others.I liked his aggressive nature with his editor despite the fact that it can get illegal at times.I liked how his experiences influenced his story, and i liked how he learned lessons and felt like a true adult,despite his sister fetish, and by the end of the show, i felt like I knew so much about him that by the end he really won me over.The other characters are great too, they all have different uprisings and backstory, and they all change for better or worse.Nayuta was one of those characters who try to pursue the main character,but it wasn’t super annoying and dumb, it was pulled off very well.They took an interesting route with the romance in the show basing off implications and I thought it was for the best since it would offset the true nature of the show.I enjoyed myself watching how these people act so familiar and hilariously around each other.Honestly, if there was one lesson to learn from this show it is to not judge a book by it’s cover.It’s super ironic how when I seek out a bad show, I enjoy it, but when I watch a show people say is good, I don’t like it that much.Despite this being a show you have to be relaxed to watch, it felt like such a wonderful ride from start to finish, full of the thrills, the laughs, and some tears at moments.It also gave me a lot to think about the industry and I cannot recommend it enough.Overall-9don't have sex in the middle of a town, or you'll be arrested. own cheering him on.Despite how “hype” that plot sounds, It is way more tame than it sounds.But, for some reason IT’S SO DAMN ENTERTAINING.Let me explain…Despite the very casual nature, it is not boring at all because of the colorful characters put in these real life situation.For light novel authors that is.That also made it interesting because it informed me on the light novel industry, which i knew nothing about, it also answered one question that was on  my mind since i started watching anime:why the hell there were so many shitty anime adaptations.There are situations that bring up new perspective and completely changed my mindset about manga and anime adaptations.Surprisingly this show also gets super emotional too and it is done in a very organic way.Not only that but it really got to me, it did really speak to me even though I am not an author and I feel like it will speak to many others who watch.When it comes the slice of life aspect, it does deliver as well.Usually the characters are either going on trips or playing games.They are funny as hell but each have their own story supported by the main one.It still makes me question if being a light novel writer is like this because there are a lot of wacky moments,but in the end, this story is really enjoyable,thoughtful, with characters that make it so wholesome And the ending of the show is just amazingly beautiful and it really raised the bar on my overall thoughts of the show.Animation was done by silver link whom I adore.They made Yurikuma Arashi (One of my favorite anime of all time btw) and they made other shows.Silver Link can animate really well,But are mostly comfortable being average.Honestly, the animation did not bother me.Yurikuma had a reason to be beautifully animated, this show does not really, but I can still tell that they had a very moderate budget.The character designs are average but appealing, and the background is just a hair above average.The opening is one of my favorites ever,it’s just so catchy and sounds so good,the ending song is also great too with a catchy beat and a nice crescendo.I absolutely adore what they do with the visuals of them.

It's just that the fanservice in this anime is not executed well and detracts from the better parts of the show.Imouto Sae Ireba Ii is an anime that excels in what it shouldn't excel in and fails at what it should succeed in. What a normal person would expect out of an anime like this is minimal storytelling and plenty of raunchy scenes full of little sisters. However, there are no little sisters to be found, and instead the view is given a minimal yet powerful and melancholic overarching story and fanservice scenes that feel overdone...and boring, providing nothing else besides fap material.Story - The plot in this anime is practically non-existent with there being a basic premise and fun hijinks between college-aged friends. Despite this, individual episodes have the capacity to give off a melancholic yet beautiful vibe. On the other hand, there are fanservice episodes that give no effort whatsover and that beg for the viewer to buy a BD. These two balance out to a 5.Art - It's pretty good and the girls are cute.Sound - BGM is upbeat and fun, the OP is pretty good, and the voice acting is good. Nothing much else to say.Character - Like the story, the characters can be generally split between fanservice and melancholic. Miyako and Fuwa particularly pull at the heartstrings at times as they realize that they're missing something that Kanikou and Itsuki have. Kanikou and the manga girl are lackluster, on the other hand. However, unlike the story, the Characters are generally better with even the fanservice characters having decent development.Enjoyment -  Once again, the fanservice/melancholy dichotomy comes into play here. The enjoyment of the show shoots up when the writing really delivers, but is canceled out a week later when a meaningless episode made to make blood rush to the lower body airs. But hey, if you love that kind of stuff and like good character development here and there, enjoyment would be an easy ten.Overall - As said above, this show is for people who crave fanservice. Its excessive nature at times will deter possible viewers away, especially in the first episode. However, if you are willing to endure this, you are in for a real treat.

It was really a inspired serie.First little story preview. Its all about one boy who want to be a writer in Manga/Anime or something similar. And he is obsessed by little sisters. He got a bunch of friends who are also try to be succesfull as writer/anime maker (or something similar). The story is all about friends, competition and work.Story 9: Great story and easy to follow. I did enjoy it alot. There was a lot of fun in it...and some serieus parts were very touching.Art 8: Not the greatest art style but still really good. All the animations were nice to.Sound 7: The opening and ending was good enough. The opening music was very calm and chill. Sound effect in this serie were good. Not really anoying.Character 8: Ok...now the fun part. Yeah all the character were very good. I did like the main character alot. The story of him why he is doing this. And he's past was very sad. The friends of he's were good. The pervert girlfriends was to funny. And the nerdy anime maker. Well he is good in he's job.Enjoyment 9: 3 days of finish it. And the best 3 days to watch this anime. I really cant wait for a sequel?! It really a serie wich everybody can follow easy. Not alot of talky talky.

For that reason, I have mixed feelings.As a story about the LN authors and the world they live in, the show is fun and interesting. But the little sister stuff doesn't work for me, as well as the relationship between MC and the girl that loves him. They have...a rather contrived relationship that doesn't make much sense and doesn't get much development.

There's just not much else that happen, including the title. The characters are consistent as are their portrayals and the voice acting. It's regrettable that the one big secret to all of the characters but obvious to the viewers (or seemingly obvious) was left hanging, although there is an implication that it would be resolved. There is a level of fan service there, however it's not offensively in your face, which is nice because most shows that have fan service just throw...it right at you without restraint.I wouldn't rush out and watch this, but if you're looking for something very light and easy, this would be a good break in between more intense or in depth shows. it right at you without restraint.I wouldn't rush out and watch this, but if you're looking for something very light and easy, this would be a good break in between more intense or in depth shows."", ""Very good show wished it was longer, but don't we all when it's a good show ,also liked the unique alcoholic beverages it shows every once in a while it makes me a guy who recently turned 21 not knowing about any interesting drinks want to try them.

That\'s also the reason why he only writes about little Sisters and why the main girl of his Series is the protagonists little Sister.When he\'s not writing he often hangs out with his friends Fuwa, Haruto a Light Novel author who debuted around the same time as Itsuki, Kani, Nayuta a light novel author that is madly in love with Itsuki and Shirakawa, Miyako a university student. She met Itsuki at University before he dropped out to become...an author. There is also Itsuki\'s little stepbrother Chihiro (who pretty much acts exactly like Itsuki wants a little sister to act) that takes care of him. He makes him dinner, cleans his apartment and is often there when Itsuki meets withe his friends.The main focus of the anime is the comedy aspect. Most of the time the friend group spends in Itsuki\'s apartment playing board games or just talking about stuff. Nayuta the lewd girl always says how she wants to bang Itsuki, Miyako the innocent girl is often embarassed by that and Haruto the mature guy pretty much ignores it and plays it down cool. This may sound dull but every one of the characters is still outstanding enough to make them likable. While some of the interactions may be a bit ridiculous all of them of them are entertaining and the characters really look like close friends that understand each other.While the main focus of this anime may be the main characters hanging out it also shows the problems and struggles of being an author. Sometimes this is done in comedic way and sometimes in a really serious tone. This switch of moods is another thing I liked about this show. The show can switch from a lighthearted mood to being serious in a very short time without making anything or any interaction between characters seem unnatural.Those different moods also give the characters more dephts. They don\'t have just one trait that solely exists to make the viewer laugh. They have problems like everyone has. Those problems also don\'t seem out of character for them, which makes them seem more realistic.Every episode of ""A Sister Is All You Need"" is good and fun to watch. In some episodes it\'s because of the comedy and in some other ones it\'s because of what the characters do, what struggles they go through or what they think about. Some of them are more gripping than others but in the end it makes a show that, despite what the title made you think, is actually good. an author. There is also Itsuki\'s little stepbrother Chihiro (who pretty much acts exactly like Itsuki wants a little sister to act) that takes care of him. He makes him dinner, cleans his apartment and is often there when Itsuki meets withe his friends.The main focus of the anime is the comedy aspect. Most of the time the friend group spends in Itsuki\'s apartment playing board games or just talking about stuff. Nayuta the lewd girl always says how she wants to bang Itsuki, Miyako the innocent girl is often embarassed by that and Haruto the mature guy pretty much ignores it and plays it down cool. This may sound dull but every one of the characters is still outstanding enough to make them likable. While some of the interactions may be a bit ridiculous all of them of them are entertaining and the characters really look like close friends that understand each other.While the main focus of this anime may be the main characters hanging out it also shows the problems and struggles of being an author.

Regardless, Silver Link makes up for it with exciting side characters, as well as great chemistry between the main cast. The show's plot isn't really a progression style plot, it's more of a 'today's shenanigans' type of thing. Not a bad thing, but it is something to note. There really isn't a 'story' per se. Which, I won't lie, kind of bums me out, considering how great the characters are and the potential that was wasted....But there's plenty of comedy, and even if it may be over the top sometimes, it gets the job done.Art: There's some excessive softcore fanservice, which can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. But the actual animation itself is pretty bland. Again, not much to see when most of the show takes place in someone's room.Sound: Although the OST is a bit bland, I very much enjoyed the OP and ED. That's something I don't find in a lot of shows.Character: The characters carry this show 100 percent. Each and everyone of them, including the side characters, are flavorful and interesting in their own way, making sure there's almost never a dull moment when you're watching. The main cast presents the audience with internal conflicts that we can all relate to, making them more likable overall.Enjoyment: It's a fun show to watch. It'll make you smile and laugh all the way through. Sad moments. Wholesome moments. Funny moments. Questionable moments.ENDING: It's a read-the-manga ending, unfortunately. Such is the way of slice-of-life. Many of the things I wanted to see develop simply weren't resolved or touched on ever again by the end of the last episode. Bad end.Overall: Imouto Sae Ireba Ii is an anime worth watching for more reasons than one. It's not an anime that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. It's simply a show where you get laugh and see lovable characters live their lives as adults. I'd recommend it any day.

A lot. It\'s got an incredibly perverted sense of humour with a few characters in particular saying some variation of ""I want to suck your dick"", it\'s not afraid to cross the line in the slightest which plays into the humour nicely and makes it unironically funny.The characters were all boring, I liked the blonde haired girl because I find sadistic anime characters entertaining and funny; and the silver haired girl was the main source of raunchy humour so I couldn\'t hate her too...much, but other than that they all were pretty boring.Plot is also boring on paper, however I enjoyed the character interactions and scenes when they\'re not just sitting in the guy\'s room were fun to an extent.Overall this show is really funny when it wants to be, but when it\'s not you can feel the boredom setting in fortunately it\'s funny a lot of the time so that\'s good.Edit: Also the first scene made me cry much, but other than that they all were pretty boring.Plot is also boring on paper, however I enjoyed the character interactions and scenes when they\'re not just sitting in the guy\'s room were fun to an extent.Overall this show is really funny when it wants to be, but when it\'s not you can feel the boredom setting in fortunately it\'s funny a lot of the time so that\'s good.Edit: Also the first scene made me cry', ""Many potential viewers might have looked the other way because of the title.

It\'s there, but it\'s not the main point of the series.I wouldn\'t watch this anime for the story, this is anime you\'d watch for the characters.

The core of the anime is it's characters, and what a set of characters it is. Overall they're a very strange bunch, and each has a very strong personality that lends them to being immensely interesting and often very likable. There's no overarching plot, but rather the overarching story is centered around...individual character arcs and the arcs of character's relationships. There are of course various plot events that occur throughout the anime, but the purpose of these is clearly to push progress in regards to character and relationship development. In that regard, it does quite well despite there not being that many significant events because each event still does have a noticeable impact and purpose. With that said, this also isn't a story where characters or relationships go through major growth and development very quickly as is often the case in anime. Rather, in a way that feels more realistic, the growth that occurs is pretty slow and steady, and ultimately there isn't a lot of growth in most aspects.Most of the time that this is the case for anime's focused around the characters and their relationships, it often feels like the pacing is too slow. However, this manages to get around that and keep very solid pacing throughout for two reasons. The first is that independent of their growth and development, the anime focuses quite a bit on showing the characters as they are and how they got there, quite a bit beyond what is generally standard for an introduction to a cast of characters at the beginning of such works and approaching the level of a series of character studies. This never feels like a waste even if it isn't explicitly showing progress because it's written well enough that it makes the characters easier to be invested in and gives the development that does occur significantly more weight. Though on the flip side, while that does result in good pacing for the anime, it results in the lack of progress by the ending hitting quite a bit harder in that it really makes me want to know how characters grow and progress beyond the ending.The other reason the anime feels so well paced, is that while all this is going on, there's also a lot of unique and very well done comedy. The uniqueness comes from two traits. The first is how raunchy it is. There are a lot of anime that have more dirty comedy in terms of quantity, but none that I have seen that felt as if they had as much in terms of extremeness. One of the core reasons behind that is that despite it being so explicit, it treats the subject matter as if its completely normal. This is also the first anime I've seen that has such an immediate and extreme normie filter, wherein the first minute and half have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of show, while also clearly setting the tone for it very well.The other cause of its uniqueness is that there was a lot of what felt like creative aspects to it. Most of the cast are authors or other creators, and hence have a creative bend. This manifests quite often in the comedy. Of especial note are the various board games and such that they play, most involving some aspect of story telling or such, which hence makes full use of the uniqueness of the characters personalities in order to tell bizarre but hilarious stories that are both disconnected from everything in reality, while also allowing the characters themselves to shine through quite well. It also often results in very bizarre satire of other series, mainly Attack on Titan. Beyond that though, it was also simply interesting seeing the exaggerated view on the world of light novel authors that the world creates, one that is pretty brutal in a lot of ways, but also quite cozy.The specials were also amusing, being short and sweet and focused around the various characters.The art and animation were really solid with the art style making very good use of characters. The various diagrams and such used for games and random information tidbits were done well. The OP and ED both fit well and were reasonably solid in terms of audio and visuals.

While the show is generally episodic, there is a fair amount of drama (with a little of it being melodrama) and character development which are the show\'s strongest points.However, the DVD-only specials of the Maria-sama ga Miteru Haru are almost the complete opposite of it as far as the mood and themes go. The specials are very light-hearted and comedic....If you are expecting the specials to be exactly like the actual series, you might be disappointed.The art style is probably one of the things that stick out about the specials.

Mazinger Z,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2253/Mazinger_Z,"['Mazinger Z is a classic of the mecha genre. This anime introduced many concepts which we see at any mecha anime, for example: The robot is the last hope of humanity, being piloted by a human (preferably teenagers), mad scientists trying to conquer the world, cronies incompetent or strange-looking people, a proud pilot woman (do you remember Asuka?).In each episode is the same plot: Dr. Hell sends his Mechanical Beasts, Koji Kabuto runs to Mazinger, background music resounds, and the battle begins. Many emotions and feelings are mixed in the battle, but in the end, Mazinger is the winner.I saw this anime in the 1980s...as a kid and I still like it. If you like the mecha genre, you should see this anime.I know these words are not enough to describe it and see it as an adult is not the same when you were a child. This is my humble opinion. I hope you find it useful. as a kid and I still like it. If you like the mecha genre, you should see this anime.I know these words are not enough to describe it and see it as an adult is not the same when you were a child. This is my humble opinion. I hope you find it useful.', ""Unpopular opinion - I did not like this show. I watched the full thing so I can make a fair judgement but it's just not for me. Mecha fans? Definitely should watch. I just watched because I'm going on an old anime binge and wanted to see how much story they could put into a show that's only about robots. Surprise - not a lot. The main female character Sayaka makes me want to slap her; I know it's not unusual for male writers to be unable to really portray female characters in a good light, but wow, she is seriously one of the most...incompetent characters I've ever seen. Her mecha can't even fight, and when she does get weapons, they're literally the most useless thing except maybe to distract the enemy for a few seconds. incompetent characters I've ever seen. Her mecha can't even fight, and when she does get weapons, they're literally the most useless thing except maybe to distract the enemy for a few seconds."", 'When it comes to monster of the week 70\'s mech series, this is pretty much about as simplistic and bare bones as you can possibly get both in characterization, stories, and animation. It had its somewhat great moments and I think what kept me invested was seeing Baron ashura and his many antics and conquests to try and take down mazinger.(But certainly not as great as ""Berge Katse"" from Gatchamon. ) Loved the episodes showcasing the many mazinger upgrades as well and some of the stories were inventive and quite interesting in early parts of the series. It then built up steam quite a bit...around the mid portion of the show and things started to gradually become more intense how ever it lost alot of steam around the last 1/3 of the series which i felt that i just wanted things to move on to the final episodes already.The beginning of the series helped set the foundation of what was to follow and helped establish the characters very well and it felt fresh with each episode offering new and unique ways for Dr hell and his minions to win against the good guys. However, I feel what ultimately ruined my experience was as the series went on, many of the stories and idea’s the writers threw in felt very nonsensical and rehashed to many times. To the point where it felt that mazinger kind of suffered from an identity crisis and the writers even forgot what the initial character motivations were, especially on the antagonistic side.For example, in the premise of the story Dr hell’s main goal was always to conquer the world. World domination was his ultimate goal and many of the MECH beasts that were deployed did just that, started blowing up cities and creating massive destruction in its wake but the writers of this series sort of shoehorned in the the idea that Dr hell and his minions are trying to take over and infiltrate the photon light institute and there where many episodes where he also wanted to destroy the photon light institute. So, you get this constant sudden change of character motivations and goals for the main villain and it just felt a bit strange to see that. It got the point where the writers relied to heavly on the concept of ""lets take over that photon light institute because that is our primary objective"" its like the writers were obsessed with this idea. Ultimatly it kind of derailed from its original story concept of what was established at the start of the series.The series had some decent moments but lacked consistency and especially when compared to something like Gatchamon which aired even before mazinger, was quite a great deal a much better series with greater characterization, larger world with bigger set pieces, greater story arcs, etc. In Mazinger it is mentioned quite frequently that some how these characters are going to school, but we do not even see them attend school except for maybe a few episodes. I realize the series is targeted towards japanese children and needs to mainstain that thematic element of mechs and fights but the world could have been fleshed out a tiny bit more to showcase some other locations in the mazinger verse instead of just consisting of the battle ground locations. Overall, I would give this probably a 7/10. The ending really caught me by surprise and im hoping great mazinger is quite a bit improved over this classic series but will see. With all that being said, it can’t be overstated just how influential and important this series is to pioneering the mecha genre with many of the common themes and tropes you will see in many shows to follow. It certainly left behind a great legacy for mecha and that is something I will never forget. around the mid portion of the show and things started to gradually become more intense how ever it lost alot of steam around the last 1/3 of the series which i felt that i just wanted things to move on to the final episodes already.The beginning of the series helped set the foundation of what was to follow and helped establish the characters very well and it felt fresh with each episode offering new and unique ways for Dr hell and his minions to win against the good guys.

Mary to Majo no Hana,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34541/Mary_to_Majo_no_Hana,"['Mary and the Witch\'s Flower was produced by Studio Ponoc, formed by former members of Studio Ghibli and directed by Academy Award-nominated Hiromasa Yonebayashi. It is based off of The Little Broomstick by the Scottish Mary Stewart, which is why it has a very Nothern atmosphere. Though originally released mid 2017 in Japan, Mary and the Witch\'s Flower only reached Australia on the 18th of January with dubs and subs both available.QualityAs to be expected from former Ghibli staff, the production quality is excellent. The character designs are well done and modern, the artwork and animation is very impressive and the soundtrack, by Takatsugu Muramatsu...who also did the music for When Marnie Was There and Yuasa\'s Lu Over the Wall, is appropriate and grand. The soundtrack and visuals contribute greatly to the atmosphere and the impression we have of magic. The mark of a well directed movie is if it\'s easy to follow what is going on. An example of this concept done poorly is The Last Jedi, which was difficult to follow and was not exciting when exciting things were happening on screen. Mary and the Witch\'s Flower doesn\'t have any of those problems; the movie flows well and everything is clear.The character of Mary is the polar opposite of Anna from When Marnie Was There (the Academy Award-nominated Yonebayashi film). Very energetic, tries to do everything, doesn\'t give up even when she\'s being a burden, etc. This works well to tell the story, especially since Mary is thrown into a place that she doesn\'t understand whatsoever. Willingness to try new things and having no earthly idea what is going on is a smart writing technique to introduce the world and important characters since it doesn\'t have to be preachy or on-the-nose with exposition. However, there is an exposition scene towards the end which didn\'t need to happen and opened up holes in the plot in the build up to that exposition. Unfortunately, although Mary works well as the lead, none of the other characters seem to have much to them. There are the generic antagonists who want more power but are technically not evil, the boy who will inevitably become important and befriend Mary, a plot convenience talking fox thing that shows up at suspiciously optimal times and solves too many problems for what little character he has, and Mary\'s grandmother who has two scenes and does nothing useful. Peter, who is an important plot point but a relatively uninspired character who didn\'t get enough screentime early on, has too much emotional payoff around him for how little he has to his character. This makes the climax slightly awkward.The writing is on and off. Most of the plot is decent enough, but magic is poorly explained. This shouldn\'t normally be a problem, because magic isn\'t supposed to make sense, but the magic academy has some form of magic-infused science which has clear rules. Poorly explained magic in a world where there are rules and scientific principles is not excusable. Inconsistent uses of magic happen a fair amount in the latter half of the film and can detract from the immersion because of how noticeable it is. The motivations of the antagonists is directly related to the theme of the movie, which was that progress at all costs is a bad thing. The film deals with the antagonists in a goofy and whimsical way. There is quite a lot about the film that is whimsical, including character interactions between Peter and Mary, a joke which takes 45 minutes to finally get the punchline, any time Mary uses a broomstick or when there is an escape sequence. It\'s never a big issue but it wasn\'t balanced too well with the substantial parts of the movie, which were lacking.Entertainment FactorThis movie is primarily aimed at children and young girls. For that audience, Mary and the Witch\'s Flower will be a blast. The magic, thanks to the visuals and sound, is impressive and wondrous. The opening scene of the movie is exciting and the lighting is well done. It starts of the movie well, though it\'s a big tonal shift going from exciting magic to watching an ordinary 12 year old girl do ordinary things. There\'s enough going on in the plot that you probably won\'t get bored.The problems come with the inconsistencies with magic and the plot holes accompanying them. They can ruin the immersion, take you out of the scene and annoy you. The exposition scene towards the end is another mistake because it involved telling us things we already knew. The exposition is likely necessary for children to understand how scenes connect, but the exposition didn\'t tell us anything we didn\'t know or anything we needed to know. As far as exposition goes, it was poor. The most fun parts of the movie are where magic is being used to do all sorts of cool things. Luckily, this is the entire second half of the movie.Overall MessageThe core messages were along the lines of ""progress at all costs is not worth it"" and ""you shouldn\'t change yourself for the sake of change"". The messages were clear and shown visually in the latter half. They are well executed because they aren\'t preachy about it and don\'t monologue about what the message is and what they learned. For the intended audience, the messages are appropriate and could apply directly to them.There are some smaller messages, like that you shouldn\'t abandon what you care about, not to ab use power and that you should take responsibility for the things you cause, but they aren\'t emphasised at all and are off cuts of the main meal. Of course, there is that one scene where a cow-person is carving up some meat to serve as food, which is quite morally reprehensible. Mary and the Witch\'s Flower is simple and you shouldn\'t expect anything else. It does enough to be engaging and somewhat impressive, but not enough to be fantastic and has too many flaws to become a classic or cult-classic.Should you really watch Mary and the Witch\'s Flower?Yes.

Yes you should.', ""Mary and the Witch's Flower is on par with the Ghibli classics. As the first work by Studio Ponoc, Mary serves as the default flagship of the studio. As such, a lot of expectations were placed on this movie. Given Studio Ponoc's unproven nature, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I feared that I would perhaps find this movie to be lacklustre and uninspired. Instead what I got was a film that rivals some of the best works from Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki.Similar to my favourite Ghibli films, the best part of Mary's story is how her character grows throughout....The story starts with the protagonist Mary Smith, having recently moved, living with her Great Aunt as well as a maid and a gardener. Her attempts to help with housework and gardening go poorly and to add insult to injury she is teased by a local boy, named Peter, for her frizzy red hair. It's very apparent by the end of the movie that Mary has grown as a character. Originally she views herself as useless and talent-less, this is symbolized by her hatred of her own hair. When magical talent is thrust upon her by means of the titular Witch's Flower, she gains confidence. This gained confidence is perhaps undeserved as Mary only gained her powers by chance. Later, after her talent is stripped away by losing the Witch's Flower, is when she has to face her greatest challenges. Instead of relying on the gifted talent from the Witch's Flower, Mary has to overcome these challenges using her newfound confidence as well as other positive traits such as courage, ingenuity, and staying true to her convictions. Watching the main character gain confidence over the course of the movie is a super satisfying experience that is reminiscent of my favourite Ghibli protagonists; Chihiro from Spirited Away and Kiki from Kiki's Delivery Service. They both have similar character growth in their films.If you want to teach a lesson in a children's film, it should not be too blatant. Any themes should flow seamlessly with the plot and should avoid becoming too much of a focus at the risk of making the film seem preachy. Mary and the Witch's Flower does not have this problem. The primary theme in Mary is probably the dangers of recklessly pursuing scientific advancement. Endor College's experiments on animals are shown as being reckless and unethical. Although these experiments use magic instead of science, it is still easy to make this comparison given that magic is compared to science in the film. Mumblechook, the school's headmistress, explains that electricity is just another form of magic and the character of Doctor Dee is very reminiscent of a mad scientist. It's important to note that the villains are not portrayed as maliciously evil but rather as misguided and with good intentions. The villains are very obsessive over the Witch's Flower which reminded me of Gollum's obsession with the One Ring in Lord of the Rings. As the villains are somewhat transformed by their obsession with the flower it becomes easy to empathize with them. It also adds some moral ambiguity to the story and themes which I prefer rather than having a blatantly unapologetic evil villain.When commenting on his character design for Mary, Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi expressed that he wanted Mary's outward appearance to reflect her inner feelings. He achieved this by giving her large bushy eyebrows and a large mouth. Those physical characteristics are a great fit for her tomboyish personality. However the best and most obvious characteristic of Mary is her bright red messy hair. As stated earlier, Mary's hair acts somewhat as a metaphor for her own character growth. At the beginning of the film she hates her hair and the teasing it causes her. To mitigate this she ties her hair back with bows. Later, at Endor College, she is praised for her hair's uniqueness and rarity with Madame Mumblechook claiming red is the ideal hair colour for a witch. Near the end of the film she removes her bows and lets her hair down in a beautiful shot that is a metaphor for her confidence and conviction that she has gained. In addition to its symbolic qualities, Mary's hair is just really beautiful and nice to look at. Throughout the film I found my attention drawn to her hair. Some of the best moments in the film feature Mary's hair prominently. Mary's hatred of her own hair is absolutely adorable and reminded me of the protagonist from the classic novel Anne of Green Gables. It's very clear that Peter likes Mary's hair despite his teasing of her. The interactions between Peter and Mary are just adorable to watch. Peter also humorously compares Mary's appearance to a monkey. This joke is brought back later when an actual red haired monkey appears leading to one of the funniest moments in the movie.The animation in Mary and the Witch's Flower is comparable to that of Ghibli's works. If you are not familiar, Ghibli is well known for its very high quality. Ghibli has a unique style and feel to their work that Mary and the Witch's Flower also possesses. The studio that made Mary and the Witch's Flower consists mostly of former Ghibli staff so the similarities are not unexpected. My favourite part of the animation are Mary's facial expressions and hair.It is hard to find a weak-point in the film. Every frame seems to fulfill a purpose. Nothing in the film felt like a waste of space or time. In fact my biggest complaint about the film is that I wish it was longer. At the movie's current length it is absolutely packed with content. There is not a single dull moment. The limitations of the kid's movie format means that Mary and the Witch's Flower is probably at its maximum potential length as is. It certainly feels to me like content had to be cut to get down to the 102 minute run-time.From black cats to broomsticks, everything you expect from a witch themed anime is present here. Despite the fact that I am an adult male and the target audience for witch themed things are young girls, I still find myself a huge fan of the witch aesthetic. Ghibli has done witches before with Kiki's Delivery Service and Endor College seems inspired by Little Witch Academia's Luna Nova or Harry Potter's Hogwarts, but whatever Mary and the Witch's Flower lacks in originality it makes up for in execution. The design of Endor College in particular is very whimsical and fantastical. Endor College is comparable to some of the best settings that Ghibli has created such as Laputa or the bathhouse from Spirited Away. On the other end of the spectrum the design of the real world is also very well done. The movie is set in rural England in the 1960s or 1970s and they did a wonderful job of recreating that. Mary's home has the aesthetic of a grandmother's house and it is just so well crafted that it fills me with nostalgia. The voice acting also goes a long way for the setting. All the characters speak with British accents. This movie may be better to watch dubbed due to the fact that the movie has a British setting and that the English language cast includes 2 Academy Award winners. Despite my praise for the English version, I haven't had the chance to watch the movie with the Japanese audio, so I'm not confident in saying which language this film is better to watch in definitively.Overall the strongest thing I can say about Mary and the Witch's Flower is that it made me feel the same emotions that I've felt when watching my favourite works from Studio Ghibli. Mary's character growth is extremely satisfying to watch unfold and reminded me of my favourite Ghibli characters. The themes in the film are not overly preachy and I appreciated the moral ambiguity of the central conflict. Mary's character design is Ghibli-esque but her adorable yet fiery red hair sets her apart. The animation quality is excellent and really pleasurable to watch. The film is thoroughly entertaining throughout all 102 minutes. The worlds featured in the film are both whimsical and fantastical on one hand, while being down-to-earth, quaint, and nostalgic on the other. Studio Ponoc completely succeeded in making a film that contains all the things that made me fall in love with Studio Ghibli. The story starts with the protagonist Mary Smith, having recently moved, living with her Great Aunt as well as a maid and a gardener. Her attempts to help with housework and gardening go poorly and to add insult to injury she is teased by a local boy, named Peter, for her frizzy red hair.

There is not a single dull moment. The limitations of the kid's movie format means that Mary and the Witch's Flower is probably at its maximum potential length as is. It certainly feels to me like content had to be cut to get down to the 102 minute run-time.From black cats to broomsticks, everything you expect from a witch themed anime is present here. Despite the fact that I am an adult male and the target audience for witch themed things are young girls, I still find myself a huge fan of the witch aesthetic. Ghibli has done witches before with Kiki's Delivery Service and Endor College seems inspired by Little Witch Academia's Luna Nova or Harry Potter's Hogwarts, but whatever Mary and the Witch's Flower lacks in originality it makes up for in execution. The design of Endor College in particular is very whimsical and fantastical. Endor College is comparable to some of the best settings that Ghibli has created such as Laputa or the bathhouse from Spirited Away. On the other end of the spectrum the design of the real world is also very well done. The movie is set in rural England in the 1960s or 1970s and they did a wonderful job of recreating that. Mary's home has the aesthetic of a grandmother's house and it is just so well crafted that it fills me with nostalgia. The voice acting also goes a long way for the setting. All the characters speak with British accents. This movie may be better to watch dubbed due to the fact that the movie has a British setting and that the English language cast includes 2 Academy Award winners. Despite my praise for the English version, I haven't had the chance to watch the movie with the Japanese audio, so I'm not confident in saying which language this film is better to watch in definitively.Overall the strongest thing I can say about Mary and the Witch's Flower is that it made me feel the same emotions that I've felt when watching my favourite works from Studio Ghibli. Mary's character growth is extremely satisfying to watch unfold and reminded me of my favourite Ghibli characters. The themes in the film are not overly preachy and I appreciated the moral ambiguity of the central conflict. Mary's character design is Ghibli-esque but her adorable yet fiery red hair sets her apart. The animation quality is excellent and really pleasurable to watch. The film is thoroughly entertaining throughout all 102 minutes. The worlds featured in the film are both whimsical and fantastical on one hand, while being down-to-earth, quaint, and nostalgic on the other. Studio Ponoc completely succeeded in making a film that contains all the things that made me fall in love with Studio Ghibli."", ""As a fan of both Kiki Delivery Service and Little Witch Academia OVA + TV, I was really forward for watching Mary and the Witch Flower because I thought it was going to be another magical experience based on the trailers that I saw as well constant advertisements on many Local Underground stations across London.\xa0 When the movie came out in cinemas in the UK I immediately went to my local cinema and decided to watch it with a big smile on my face. However, as soon as I left the cinema I was not smiling at all. I was pretty sad and disappointed about...it. At first, I was shocked at how sad and disappointed I was because I really wanted to love the movie. Then on the following day, I decided to watch the movie again but online this time because why in a hell should I blow another £10 pounds to watch the same movie again. Anyway, I finished watching the movie the second time just to see why I was not smiling by the film and I got a clear answer in the end. The clear answer is that the movie was not that good at all. While it’s not the worst anime movie I have ever seen but its strong contender of being the most disappointing anime movie I have ever seen in a long while.With that said hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Mary and the Witch's flower and with that out of the way let’s get started.Story and Characters.The story of follows a girl who moves into the British estate with her great-aunt Charlotte. The bored friendless girl tries to make herself useful in the place that she is living by doing everyday chores but repeatedly keeps making mistakes in the process. Because of this, a local boy named Peter would often tease her for both her clumsiness and her wild\xa0red hair, which she hates. She follows a cat one day and finds a flower that she doesn't recognize and upon of breaking one of the bulbs of this flower this substance gets all over her and she suddenly has all of the theses magical abilities. Soon she gets transported to a different realm and this leads to a fantastical adventure where she has to decided to be her old klutzy self or become a new powerful witch.When the legendary director Hayao Miyazaki originally said that he is going to retire after The Wind Rises he has since said he will make one more movie named Now do you live. Members of Studio Ghibli left and formed Studio Ponoc which is now a spiritual successor to Studio Ghibli. When I found about this on the I was really excited because while Studio Ghibli has become a dead studio at this point they still live on under that new name and I hope that the following films are much better than Mary and the Witch's Flower because outside the visuals and soundtrack the movie suffered from having a very predictable plot that barely had any charm and passion and overall weak characters that don't develop at all.Let’s start with what I liked about the story and that is the opening scene of the movie. The opening scene of the movie perfectly captures what the movie should have been from its tone, setting, and character introductionUnfortunately, the best thing I can about the story because the movie literally goes downhill from there.For starters, the movie is very predictable and I know your guys are thinking right now. It’s a kids movie what do you expect out of this. Am not trying to say being predictable is always a bad thing because I have seen anime movie are predictable in nature however what makes separates this movie from the other predictable anime movies that I have seen is that they were actually fun and have a lot of good elements in it. Mary and the Witch Flower was not fun at all, in fact, I was bored out of my mind watching due to how awfully predictable it was. The moment I saw Peter the second time in the movie I knew how the movie is going to end and it clearly didn’t help that the pacing for the second half was rushed and speaking of the pacing. The pacing in the first half was decent overall as it had a slow start that did an alright job as establishing Mary as a character. The problem comes with the second character Peter as we only saw him in the first half as a generic annoying brat who severed no purpose to the plot however as soon as he appeared in the second half of the movie just speeds up to a point where everything in the second half becomes rushed.The world-building was serviceable at first but once again after Peter appeared again in the second half of the movie as a plot device the movie flush its world-building right down the toilet where the movie became inconstant with magic system as well all the plot holes surrounding it.Now that I think about it Peter appearance alone completely killed this movie as it movie devolved into stops the villains and save your lover's life type of plot. It was honestly sad because the movie could have been more than your typical children’s flick that you have seen before in many children anime movies.The characters were not much better.Mary despite being a likable person is honestly a meh character who doesn’t gets much character development. I could easily forgive her shortcomings if she actually learned something through her journey in the film but no at the end of the film there was a piece of dialogue which I won't spoil completely went against the overall message of the filmI honestly refuse to call Peter a charterer because he is just a god damm plot device just to move the plot along. Plus he is just a one-dimensional shit show with no personality thanks to him being an empty husk of a character.As for the other characters they are just disposable moving bodies on screen who are easily forgettable.The one thing that I hated about this movie was how half fasted the relationship between Peter and Mary was. At the beginning of the movie, the movie establishes that they don’t get along with each other to a point where they will never be friends ever. So why in the hell do they suddenly act like they are really close friends at the end of the movie? That was terrible writing 101.Overall the story and characters in Mara and the Witch’s Flower were very lackluster and had no charm at all.3/10Visuals and Sound.If there was two thing that I can praise about the movie it would be the visuals and soundtrack.The visuals were pretty great overall that contained a lot of amazing scenery and visual flair.The animation is great, smooth and still has that Ghibli feel to it.Like with the visuals the music of the film is pretty great and well directed for the most part.As for voice acting I personally found both the sub and dub to be pretty good overall but if I had to say which is better I would say the sub because the audio quality and some of the voice actors sounded better.8/10Final Thoughts.Ah Mary and the Witch Flower you had so much potential to be great but instead we just got an another children's flick that barely has any charm at all. The story is boring and generic, the pacing especially the second half was terrible, the characters are forgetful and the dub was mediocre at best. The only good thing I can say about Mary in the Witch Flower was the visuals and music everything else lackluster at best and at worse it’s a magical train-wreck that has no charm at all.If you want to see a movie that involves witches go watch Kiki Delivery Service instead of this.Hopefully, the following Studio\xa0Ponoc movies would learn the mistakes that were made in Mary and The Witch's Flower.Final Score:\xa04.5/10 it.

I thought it was a good movie, very good for a studio\'s first movie, but it leaves me feeling that there could have been a lot more. I also have some major questions. The biggest one is, you are at a magic school, and you showed all of these students... where are they when all this stuff goes down? It\'s like they are there for the opening, then they are gone. Other than that, it was a beautiful movie visually, and the story was interesting. I would suggest going to see it. I\'ll buy the blu-ray when...it comes out,  it I don\'t think I\'ll see this movie in theaters more than once. it comes out,  it I don\'t think I\'ll see this movie in theaters more than once.', 'Mary and the Witch\'s Flower is the inaugural film from Studio Ponoc and the 3rd directorial effort from Hiromasa Yonebayashi, whose previous films include the respectable Ghibli efforts The Secret World of Arrietty and When Marnie Was There.Being essentially an offshoot of Ghibli, you can immediately see the visual cues Ponoc borrows from its roots. In many ways, it is as if nothing changed. From an animation standpoint, this film may as well have been made by Ghibli staff - but I say this not as a criticism, as not only will it take time for Ponoc to develop its own style, but this anime...is a fantastic visual feast. Gorgeous backgrounds, excellent attention to every detail and nuance  accompanied by fluid and breathtaking animation is what you can expect from Mary and the Witch\'s Flower (MATWF).Unfortunately, this is where the comparisons to Ghibli go from being a worthy tribute to a pale imitation.There are many common themes in Ghibli films that Mary and the Witch\'s Flower attempts to replicate - the core one being essentially the same journey that Sen takes in Spirited Away. A clumsy, naive little girl bored by her mundane life is unwittingly whisked away to a magical place that will be the setting of her coming-of-age story.The set-up for this is perfect - in fact, many ideas presented to the audience in MATWF are enticing. The problem is that movie barely does anything with them, and we are left with a very hollow story and anti-climactic third act. The world of the witches and magic that Mary encounters is just barely explored as she faces her trials, and somehow even manages to be boring at times despite its fantastical themes and overdose of whimsy.As much as I don\'t want to continue to compare Ponoc to Ghibli, I feel the best example is again the comparison of characters between Mary and Sen. In Spirited Away, Sen spends the majority of the film in Yubaba\'s bath house, and meets many memorable and interesting characters while living there. Each one helps her a little bit on her journey - she learns something, makes a new friend, takes another step closer to becoming the hero of her own story. You learn a lot about the inner workings of this ethereal yet perilous labyrinth of a bath house that she inhabits. Miyazaki has always been a master of setting and applying it to a character\'s journey.In MATWF, it will be no surprise to you that Mary is endowed with the power of a witch. Her magical broom flies her to the ""Endor College of Magic"" - an absurdly massive school in the clouds full of what seems to be hundreds if not thousands of students learning to become witches. Yet Mary only interacts with no more than 3 people while there, and most of the time it feels empty - aside from some animals and autonomous magical servants that don\'t utter a word. We get a glimpse of life in the college, but only that and nothing else. Ultimately, everything we see at Endor is nothing but an almost unnecessary loose end.A great example of this is when Mary visits Endor for the first time. Before entering, she is informed that Endor has very strict rules, written on a giant stone plaque outside its gates. The audience and Mary cannot read it because it\'s written in some magical language. The first rule is read to Mary, but the others are left unread because they get interrupted. Yet not only do we never learn the other rules to Endor, the first rule ends up being entirely irrelevant to the main plot despite its supposed importance.I could nitpick the movie and its little faults, but its ultimate failing was the story arc of Mary. Early in the film, Mary meets a boy named Peter. If I must make another Spirited Away comparison here, he is basically the movie\'s Haku, except that he\'s basically nothing more than a helpless pawn with no real attachment to Mary.Peter and Mary don\'t really get along - in fact, they are not even friends, just acquaintances who tease eachother. After interacting with eachother in real life for all of 5 minutes, eventually Mary accidentally puts Peter in great danger and decides to rescue him - she suddenly cares greatly for him as if they were good friends, and act like totally different people than when we last saw them together.While there is motivation for Mary to rescue Peter, it lacks conviction from the weak script. There just needed to be more of what mattered and less of the spectacle. The story feels rushed and cobbled together, sometimes even confusing. As far as Yonebayashi goes, it\'s definitely a step backwards when it comes to characters.Perhaps it is part of the growing pains of transitioning to a new studio. Perhaps it is difficult to succeed without the constant guidance of masters like Miyazaki and Takehata. Perhaps it\'s both. Whatever it is, I hope for the best for the future of Studio Ponoc - living under the shadow of Ghibli is not easy. They stumbled a bit out the gate, but there\'s no mistake that Ponoc employs incredible talent. If they take some time to reflect on what went wrong with MATWF and how to do it right, there\'s no reason why they cannot build on it.Overall, the movie is not altogether terrible. It is a bit of a bore to watch at times, the script lacks subtlety and the moral of the story is ambiguous at best, but it has its heart in the right place and should be a joy for small children, especially young girls. The opening flashback sequence is a great hook (and honestly looked like it would have been a more intriguing film), the animation and backgrounds are fantastic and there are moments of genuine laughs and charm, but they are sometimes far apart.It is, for all intents and purposes, merely decent.I would say don\'t go in expecting a Ghibli film, but even if it looked nothing like one, I don\'t think that would change much. is a fantastic visual feast.

This is Studio Ponoc’s first film, which consists of some ex Studio Ghibli members. After hearing that Studio Ghibli is possibly no longer making films, I was excited to see their legacy continue in Studio Ponoc. Unfortunately Mary and the Witch’s Flower is a little disappointing, but not a bad start to Studio Ponoc.Mary is a fantastic character who’s a lot of fun to watch. She is a care free young girl who doesn’t have a lot of confidence. She is constantly complaining about how she...doesn’t like her hair, and she’s quite clumsy like when she accidentally killed some roses when trying to help in the garden, these certainly don’t help with her confidence. And yet she still tries to help others when she can, even if there are mistakes along the way, and eventually this pays off as she gradually becomes more confident in who she is.Unfortunately the other characters in the film are very one dimensional and boring. Especially Peter, Mary’s friend who is barely on screen and when he’s in the climax, we the audience don’t really care about him. Mary’s grand auntie is also barely on screen, and all she does is provide exposition without developing her character. And the headmistress of the magic school, her motives are not very clear, and it was explained in a poorly put together monologue near the end of the film.The story is very easy to follow, although the pacing is mixed. The story follows Mary and her adventures after she finds the witch’s flowers. The beginning to the film is very slow and dull, although it gets more interesting later on. The start of the film begun at Mary’s home, it introduces many characters, unfortunately we don’t see these characters very much of later on. The start feels like it’s being dragged on too long unnecessarily. Although most of the film was well paced. The scenes at Endor College were exciting, and also showed a sense of mystery about what the headmistress is really doing. The scenes where Mary faces multiple problems at the Endor College were shown really well too.Unfortunately the ending was disappointing. There was no build up to the final confrontation, we only learnt of the reasons behind the final act very late in the film and this wasn’t hinted at much at all, this was mostly explained to us during a monologue which felt too forced.The animation is stunning in every scene, the effort to detail is astonishingly brilliant and very Studio Ghibli like. The animation at Endor College especially was fantastic, the detail in the magical aspects of the film was spot on, whether it’s the water features, or the classrooms. The colours were really bright and vibrant and stood out really well.Mary and the Witch’s Flower has stunning animation with a clear story, and it’s main character Mary is fantastic. However the pacing was mixed and the rest of the cast certainly let the film down. Although this was a mostly entertaining movie. This is a very ambitious attempt for Studio Ponoc’s first film considering they’re trying to carry on Studio Ghibli’s legacy. Even though Mary and the Witch’s Flower isn’t up to Studio Ghibli’s best standard, this isn’t a bad film, and I’ll be looking forward to what Studio Ponoc does next.Constructive feedback for this review is appreciated :) doesn’t like her hair, and she’s quite clumsy like when she accidentally killed some roses when trying to help in the garden, these certainly don’t help with her confidence.

Children’s fantasy as a genre fits these two things correctly. We’ve all grown up with these timeless tales that transformed us at the early stage of our development. There was once a time in anime, specifically in the 70s, when studios adapted old children’s literature from the late 19th to early 20th century. Mary and the Witch’s Flower gives off these vibes from my experience viewing it.This is the first animated feature by Studio Ponoco, a studio founded by former Studio Ghibli lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura and several staffers that joined him after Ghibli decided to pause all...production for re-evaluation. Mary and the Witch’s Flower shows the real intention of Studio Ponoco to continue the legacy of the Ghibli style of animation in case Ghibli decides to go belly up, at least that is my interpretation. They know that if Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata are gone, Ghibli is done for. With all of the talent they brought from Ghibli to make this film, did they succeed in capturing the essence of a great Ghibli film? In the briefest answer I can give: they mimic the technical aspects of a Ghibli film 100%, but not its spirit.When people think of a Ghibli film, they think of how beautiful the animation is and how memorable the characters are, and how its story grabs you through the end. Mary and the Witch’s Flower get half of it right. It isn't very reassuring to think about this as this is their debut. However, I would not mean that the story and characters are awful. They do not reach that higher echelon that many people would expect out of the people formerly from Studio Ghibli.It is one of the most beautiful animated films I’ve seen in many years and the entire Ghibli film library. From the opening scene, I was hooked by how tremendous the fluidity of the character movements looked and the colors from the magical spells. Seeing a character fly their broomstick was riveting to experience. It almost felt like I was flying with them. It still has a lot of fun Ghibli tropes we love, like messy hair and how characters react to any situation. The creativity of the spells and the creatures are always cool to see and show that they have not skipped a beat in making these weird, strange anomalies that made Ghibli unique.I saw this in a movie theater where they showed it with the English dubbing. To its credit, the dubbing is pretty good. It was cool to listen to characters with English accents in an anime film, especially one based on a story written in England. Ruby Barnhill as Mary is excellent, Ewen Bremmer is hilarious as Flanagan, and Kate Winslet is nearly unrecognizable as Madame Mumblechook.Despite my previous remark on the flawed characters, I thought Mary was a fine heroine. She was funny whenever she acted like a tough girl, annoyed at all the frivolous things that you would expect a little girl to do. Her clumsiness was always fun to see as well. It gave some bit of charm to her that made me smile throughout. Now how they write her storywise is a whole other situation.Unfortunately, the rest of the characters do not come off as very memorable. The villains are probably the most forgettable in any Ghibli film. Their motivations for their actions are not explored very well, except that they want to create an abomination based on magic flowers for god knows what reason. It just came off as a lazy way of creating a conflict for our heroes. It is common for many children’s stories to have villains with half-baked intentions for their evil actions, but that should not be a reason to defend poor writing. I am not asking for anything incredibly deep. Give me a little more to care about their intent, but the film failed to do so.David is the male “co-star” of the film, and I use air quotes because he is not given much for us to care about him. One of the film's biggest flaws is the relationship between him and Mary. At first, Mary does not like David because he pokes fun at her by calling her a red monkey because of her messy red hair, and they always argue. It was funny to see, I will admit that, but then later on (without spoiling anything), when something happens to David, all of a sudden Mary acts all worried and wants to save him as if he was her best friend. The way it was paced, it seemed as though the writers did not bother to build up a rekindled bond between Mary and David mid-way through the story. This problem would have been remedied had the film taken at least fifteen minutes to develop. Not to mention David constitutes only about 1/3rd of the entire movie, so we are not given enough room to care about him at the end of it.The simple nature of the story might seem like a positive or a negative depending on how you view children’s stories. I am part of the half that believes children can handle some depth to whatever entertainment or story is given to them. If they had just given a little more development to the characters and paced better, this could have been a tremendous debut for Studio Ponoc. But no, all we have is a film that is only good but not great.Mary and the Witch’s Flower might be a disappointment, but I don’t think it needed to be anything groundbreaking in hindsight. This was merely a film that Studio Ponoc was required to make to get their feet wet so that they could construct themselves into a powerhouse studio like Ghibli. The technical aspects of it are there. All they need is a better story and pace it slower so that the characters can have some breathing room to develop. This is one step from Studio Ponoc to achieve greater things, and this film is at least a good/decent display of what is to come in the future. Whatever disappointment there is to the movie for me, it is only minor.Grade: B- production for re-evaluation. Mary and the Witch’s Flower shows the real intention of Studio Ponoco to continue the legacy of the Ghibli style of animation in case Ghibli decides to go belly up, at least that is my interpretation. They know that if Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata are gone, Ghibli is done for. With all of the talent they brought from Ghibli to make this film, did they succeed in capturing the essence of a great Ghibli film?

The anime film was Studio Ponoc\'s premiere work. Basically, they\'re a group of creators who splintered off of Studio Ghibli, probably because they were mortified by Tales from Earthsea\xa0and the only way to distance themselves from it entirely was to start their own studio. With black jack and hookers. Let\'s see how much of a splash they made.Story:We open with a building on fire and a hooded girl scarpering while magical beasts try to chase after her. We then cut to a young girl, Mary, suffering from boredom since...her great aunt\'s house has no games and a broken television. I mean, she has books so maybe read?\xa0 I know when I was a kid I\'d do that literally all day on occasion until my mum caught me and made me go outside because she thought bug bites built character or some such shite. One day she\'s eating lunch outside when she encounters a pair of cats. She follows them into the woods and down the dell, the path is strange but they know it well. There in the woods she finds a strange flower and thus begins the journey. Basically, it gives her magical abilities and she finds herself in a strange land where there\'s a magic school. Unfortunately for her, this magic school hides a dark secret.And no, it isn\'t copying Harry Potter because there\'s a magic school. The book this is based off of came out way before Harry Potter.\xa0Just like the majority of things that get accused of copying Harry Potter for some reason. Seriously, I\'ve seen the late Sir Terry Pratchett accused of ""ripping off"" those books because of Ponder Stibbons, a character who was introduced in 1990. Seven years before those books existed.The biggest flaw with the story telling in this film lies in the pacing. There are some long, dragged out moments that are mainly intended to build atmosphere but they just go on too long. And, to exacerbate the problem, there are some really important moments that get really glossed over. And the big example of that lies in the big ""important"" friendship betwixt Mary and Peter. They barely exchange a few sentences and go from not particularly caring for one another to besties for no apparent reason. The film is also a bit inconsistent with things like how long the effects of the flower actually last.That being said, pretty much everything to do with the magic school is really good. The animal scenes in particular are fantastic. The film also excels at building up its big twists enough so that they make perfect sense and you can kind of see them coming but not to an extent where they\'re really obvious or come across as contrived. And the atmospheric scenes may drag at times, but they are pretty effective, especially when they actually do end at sensible points.Characters:This varies a bit. Mary is a compelling character and her complex about her hair does add some depth to her and is just very relatable. Her great aunt is also quite interesting, particularly when the film goes into her history. I also like that there\'s effort put into humanising the antagonists, in spite of all the really not okay things they do. In contrast, Peter is just a generic good lad and the other side characters are just ""the gardener"" or ""housekeeper."" And you don\'t really expect the side characters to be super interesting given that the film has to do other things but Peter is a major character. He should not be dull as tepid dishwater. He is, but he shouldn\'t be.Art:You can tell that this was made by former Ghibli staff. It looks gorgeous. The backgrounds are really well detailed. The magic school has a sense of whimsy and wonder about it along with some phenomenal visuals. The designs are interesting. The action flows really well. It\'s just a very nice film to look at.Sound:Young Sugisaki Hana does a great job in the lead role, in spite of having very few voice acting roles. Ootake Shinobu is also very good. As is Satou Jirou. And none of them have a lot of voice roles. Muramatsu Takatsugu\'s soundtrack is pretty good as well.Ho-yay:It\'s based off a children\'s book from the 70s. It has exactly as much as you would think, bugger all.Final Thoughts:Mary to Majo no Hana\xa0may not be the best film out there, but it is pretty damn solid. It has a good degree of charm, adventure and whimsy. Its biggest problems are Peter, some contrived character dynamics and some unexplained inconsistencies. None of which are all that bad everything considered. I\'ll give it a 7/10. It\'s a good film. Tomorrow, Xiao Qian. her great aunt\'s house has no games and a broken television.

Tomorrow, Xiao Qian.', 'You know what you\'re getting when you watch Mary and the Witch\'s Flower.Don\'t lie to yourself. You know why you\'re watching this film. This is the post-Ghibli age. We are now in the age of Studio Ponoc. Yes, the quality is the same. Yes, the aesthetic is the same. If you want the ""Ghibli"" feel, you could come here, or you could play some Ni no Kuni. Instead, you\'re here. So trying to judge this film against its predecessors is almost unfair. Because although Mary and the Witch\'s Flower is cut of the same cloth as other Ghibli films, the main takeaway from this...review that I want to impart upon the reader is: THIS IS NOT A GHIBLI FILM.Why is that so important?The emphasis relies on your acceptance of this film. Many people enter a Ghibli film with nostalgia and glamour on the mind. They expect perfection, they expect jubilance, and they expect an adventure unlike those that have ever been told. Even if those adventures, just as any Disney adventure we\'ve ever seen, may be filled with clichés and contrivances because they ""feel good."" Because they ""make the audience happy."" And they do. It is rare when I can watch an old Ghibli film and say, ""This doesn\'t make me FEEL happy.""Why do I make the differentiation then?Mary and the Witch\'s Flower is meant to make you feel happy. It is a romp. A waltz through a new-fantasy setting, with dabbles of Harry Potter, Little Witch Academia, and all that goodness you expect from a heartfelt Disney film. Did you come for Ghibli references? Yeah, they\'re there - the entire film is an homage to all the best of Ghibli. But this is not a Ghibli film.This, at its heart, is a Yonebayashi film. This is a film of an up-and-coming creator in the industry who wants to make his mark in his own unique way. By the same creator as When Marnie Was Here and Arrietty, we have another fantastical induction of a beautifully animated, well choreographed, outstandingly produced film that will delight literally anyone that watches it. If you have come into this film with expectations, they will probably be met. The animation is simply stunning, with nearly no peer in the industry, except for maybe the subtle designs of Naoko Yamada from A Silent Voice. The art is splendid in every sense of the word, rivaling some of the best background art seen in Made in Abyss. The sound is excellent, the character design and development is everything you\'ve come to expect.Such praise, yet why do I continue?Because this is what you should expect of the post-Ghibli age. This is our norm. The pillars we expect of perfection are behind us, and we have to redefine our expectations of perfection. Is Mary and the Witch\'s Flower a great film? Without a doubt. Is it perfect? No. It falters between its second and third act, has many contrivances of plot that seem to be brushed over less gracefully than Miyazaki would in favour of feeling and emotion. It insists upon it\'s ideas and doesn\'t bend to non-traditional stories.And yet, at the same time, it does everything we want of these films. It\'s beautiful in every way. It\'s artistic and magical. It livens our senses, and fill our hearts with joy. All without trying, almost egging us on to notice just how fantastic its art, soundtrack, and presentation all works seamlessly. This film delights in entertaining us. And that is why this film is such a joy to watch. Because it KNOWS its good, and that despite its homages, it can shine on its own. Maybe not as bright as our memories of beautiful films of the past, and maybe not as grand, but at least as memorable, despite any faults it may have. review that I want to impart upon the reader is: THIS IS NOT A GHIBLI FILM.Why is that so important?The emphasis relies on your acceptance of this film.

She starts off as a bored, lonely kid who appears to have depression. She has no friends, no parents at the moment, no games, no T.V., nothing to entertain her so she offers to help out around the house instead but she messes everything up. Are these people poor or something? Why doesn't Mary have games or toys to play with?The characters seem pretty inconsistent and I'll tell you why here. Mary is a petulant and dishonest character. She despises Peter and shows no respect to him...after he mocked her red hair. I understand that she is a young girl who is desperate to have friends and when she found herself in conflict with a boy around her age who isn't very nice to her, she lashes out at him, but I still think she could've been written to be a little more nicer. Also, she told Tib she would feed him milk. If I'm correct, milk isn't good for cats. Since Mary is naive, maybe she doesn't know how to take care of one.She even lies about how great her day is when she gets home and then has to go save Peter. I feel that this is filler, maybe there could've been another reason for why she had to go back to college or they could've just shortened the film. But due to the film's fast pace, the film does feel shorter.Mary's relationship with Peter was pretty shallow. How did Mary start off hating Peter and holding a grudge against him, then the minute she hears he's in trouble, she starts caring for him as a friend? This sort of relationship has been done many times in animated films, with a character starting off hating and whining about someone they don't like, then they become the best of friends.At least the dub was pretty good, the characters actually sounded British instead of Americans.There were too many rehashes to other Ghibli movies, in certain parts, the movie has scenes that recall Spirited and Howl's Moving Castle for example. I think it's time to do something new. I know it's by Ghibli animators but they shouldn't be making recalls to their older films. It just makes an already cliched film feel repetitive.I couldn't find many positive things about this movie. I did like the fantastical elements and the action but that was about it. The film was silly and predictable, I feel that a younger audience would appreciate it but adults would probably feel it's childish. after he mocked her red hair.

This film is based on the novel, The Little Broomstick, by British novelist, Mary Stewart and is Studio Ponoc’s first feature film. This film is about a young girl, Mary, who has moved in with her Aunt Charlotte without her parents due to them being busy working. Mary has always been an overactive yet clumsy child and this breeds doubt in herself. She spends her time exploring the near empty town and getting use to the area...before she starts school. When she follows two cats into the woods, she stumbles upon a magical flower that turns her lackluster summer into a grand adventure that reveals family secrets and forces Mary to overcome her self doubts. The audience can identify with the hero of the film because she is going through something all young people go through, self-doubt. With an overactive yet clumsy personality she is very relatable to young people particularly.I identify the genre of this film as a fantasy adventure hybrid due to the mix of elements of fantasy such as witches, magical broomsticks, talking animals, cities or buildings in the sky, supernatural items and the elements of adventure such as exploration, new experiences, and exotic locations. Conventions normally associated with the genres include magic or supernatural powers, no official references to the real world, exploration of exotic locations, and overcoming adversity. This film perfectly adheres to these conventions and uses it the strengthen the film as whole. The main item discussed and sought after in this film is magical in nature, the hero explores an unknown school full of mysteries and secrets, participates in a magical school, and has to overcome their self-doubt to rescue a friend and right a wrong.The Witch’s Flower or the “Fly by Night” flower is a mysterious blue flower that ends up being highly controversial. It is magic in nature with potentially endless possibilities of application but like most magical items of infinite possibility it is unstable in nature and can only be used in minuscule amounts or destruction and devastation will follow. This prop is instrumental and metaphorical as it gives the hero of the film, Mary Smith, temporary magical abilities, allowing her to discover the magic school in the sky, and is a symbol of power and ambition. The headmaster of the school and the main professor become obsessed with the flower and the power it brings. They attempt to transform humans, non-magical beings, into witches or warlocks through the power of the flower. It is an overly ambitious goal and like all over ambitious dreams it blows up in their face, twice. Originally discovered by Mary’s Aunt Charlotte, the flower once again is a symbol of ambition. Charlotte found the flower and showed it to her headmaster and professor hoping to use it for the advancement of magic but after seeing them obsess over it and perform immoral experiments she lost her ambition and took the flower, losing it in the forest.I assume that this story takes place in the countryside of Western Europe during the early to mid 1900s due to the scenery, clothes worn by the characters, and the roles of some of the characters. In the English version of this film the characters have British accents and Aunt Charlotte has a maid and a gardener for her house. People in Europe who weren’t wealthy but still had assistance around their big property are rare so I can assume this takes place before World War II, but Mary and Peter’s clothing would depict a more modern period. The historical accuracy of this film is inconsistent, and this fact helps elevate the film. When not worried about the historical or even locational accuracy of a film you can enjoy the small and interesting details of the characters and the settings individually and they can in turn mix and make an even more interesting fantasy setting, which this film does.Due to the location of the film being ambiguous the director and screenwriter could explore the area in as much depth as possible without making the audience feel like they have been there before or somewhere like there. Granted the scenes bring a sense of familiarity due to almost every person having been exploring in some shape or form in their youth but the location is unknown and in this film is meant to be explored, only adding to the depth of the film when the audience discovers something along with the hero. The college itself is a vast landscape of wonders to be explored. Between the courtyard full of magical inquiries, the main tower full of endless floors and endless rooms, and the recreation center there is more than enough for the audience to be enthralled with. The film at its core is a tale of overcoming adversity. Mary is a regular human girl with no magical abilities who gets thrusted into a world, without the Witch’s Flower, she is unable to handle. Regardless she finds a way to navigate through her problems by staying head strong, believing in herself, and finding the courage to stand up and fight even when the odds are against her with minimal assistance.The style of the genre of this film influences the mood of the film to be really wonderous. Whether it’s in the small town or the magical school, you are always looking around the screen and asking questions. A good example of this is the introduction scene of Endor College, the magic academy in the film. The college itself is made up of four differently styled buildings, the courtyard is full of interesting aquatic or amphibious creatures lurking and running around. Some of them almost resemble real animals but when you look at them closer, they don’t. This detail helps the audience feel like they have a grasp or understanding of the kind of magical universe they are currently invested in with room for questions. The inside of the main building of the school is in designed to be like a traditional magical school, big and open with lots of floors with lots of rooms and a myriad of students doing different things, travelling through this school by either bubble or a wireless elevator. Another building is a full recreation center packed with students exercising, something you wouldn’t expect in a magic school. All of these elements prioritize wonder and adventure in the audiences’ head and brings more questions than answers.The inciting incident of the film is when Mary initially goes into the woods, finding the Witch’s Flower. While Mary is exploring, she stumbles upon a black cat that leads her to a gray cat and they lead Mary into a clearing in the woods where the Witch’s Flower is found. Mary finding and picking the flower causes the story to pick up and move fast from that point on. Mary ends up discovering the magic school in the sky, the day after and all her problems begin. This incident introduces the main plot device, introduces two important characters, and is the first scene in the present-day story that makes the film feel like a fantasy. Between walking through unknown woods, following mysterious cats, or finding a pristine blue flower in a field of death, this scene promotes the theme of the film, wonder and mystery.Some of the greatest difficulties faced when creating this film were the animation and the casting. When I say casting, I mean casting for the original Japanese version. This film was produced by Studio Ponoc and thus was drawn in a very anime-esque style and that style takes an incredible amount of time and effort to draw and animate especially at the quality this film was presented in. Studio Ponoc is the daughter company of the famous Studio Ghibli. Ghibli has been known to produce the most top-quality Japanese animation films for over three decades, having a good amount of their films being in the top 10 grossing films in Japan and in the top 10 grossing anime films in the world. Drawing out and animating a story by a British novelist with only the book as reference material that has a balance of Japanese animation style and Western Europe references must have been time consuming and took a handful of animators. Casting Japanese actors to voice originally English characters must have been challenging to say the least. With only the book as a guide into the personality and behavior of the characters, it must have been difficult to assume the voice of certain characters and finding an actor that matches or exceeds that assumption. Luckily the main characters in this film are female and Japan has an abundance of strong female voice actors.Two particularly interesting elements of the film were the animation and the source material. When I originally watched this movie in the summer, I did not know that is was based off of a British novel and that fact alone made the entire composition of the film even more interesting. It explained the inspiration for the relative time period but also made the film more captivating because it showed a synchronization of two different cultures, something that is not always evidently seen. Like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, an anime that takes place in a country very similar to early 1900s Germany, it mixes European references and inspiration with Japanese style. I don’t know a lot of films that mix two different cultures in such an effective yet unnoticeable way. The animation like all Studio Ghibli works is a cut above the rest. The way the backgrounds are so lightly yet beautifully drawn allows for the characters who are drawn more boldly and detailed to flow naturally across the scenes, differentiating the items and emphasizing them at the same time. A good example of this when Tib, the black cat, initially leads Mary into the woods. The landscape is very spread out and lightly drawn not looking more detailed than the characters but has its own individuality that separates it from moving people and animals. Mary and Tib are boldly drawn and are obviously separate entities from the background but when they move into the forest and flow by all their lightly drawn counterparts it brings depth to the animation of the film.Two very important settings in this film are the magic school in the sky and the small country town on the ground. The village is where Mary and Charlotte live and it represents a simple and quaint life, something Mary is trying to escape at the beginning of the film but Charlotte welcomes and is very content with because she has lived a full life and knows of the wonders of the world unlike Mary. The school represents adventure, ambition, and overcoming adversity. Mary stumbles upon the school by accident but is still in need of it at the beginning of the film. Her summer lacks any adventure or excitement and she is having trouble with her self-doubts. The school gives her some adventure and throughout the course of the film she overcomes the challenges presented by the school and the challenges within herself because of the school. Charlotte who is done with most of life and is just living it to enjoy the small things she has left has no place at the school anymore. Even though she use to attend it as a witch, she no longer has magical abilities and no longer has any real interest in the life that she left behind. All her ambition she threw away when she left the school to escape the madness of the staff. I see these two locations as different sides of the same coin like, Mary and Charlotte. They represent different points in your life. You attend well known schools and do ambitious things when you are young and free, but you come to enjoy and appreciate the quaintness of a simple life in a small town as you get older and experience more things. Mary and Charlotte though the same in many ways are in different points of their life and where they spend most of their time in the film represents that.The most compelling scene in my opinion is the opening scene. You are unaware at the start of the film, but Charlotte is a young witch escaping her school with the “Fly by Night” in tow right after an experiment went horribly wrong. Within the first two minutes of the movie you can already identify the film as a fantasy due to the bodyguards running around looking for Charlotte, turn into flying fish creatures in an instant to pursue her. The lightning of the scene is of a medium distinction. emphasizing the bright and vibrant colors of the fires without completely darkening the scene and leaving room for light from the fires to emphasize shadows nicely. Shadows are prevalent through the scene bringing more depth to the in shambles setting, mixed with the compelling background music that turns from simple accompanying music into a thrilling sound that emphasizes the chase into that turns into a questioning music tone that makes you wonder what happened to the mysterious woman at the end of this scene. The framing is mostly all long shots that sometimes transition into medium shots emphasizing the current peril the young woman is in and her desperate need for escape. The scene has very little dialogue bringing me to believe that the writer and director did not have a lot of collaboration when writing this particular scene. Facial expressions, situations, and events are used to convey importance and meaning rather than words.I would not call this film the greatest animated film of all time but unlike a lot of animated films this movie is different. It represents two different cultures in its storytelling, has a strong female lead character with room for development, and beautifully adapts a book into a film without chopping out most of original story. before she starts school. When she follows two cats into the woods, she stumbles upon a magical flower that turns her lackluster summer into a grand adventure that reveals family secrets and forces Mary to overcome her self doubts. The audience can identify with the hero of the film because she is going through something all young people go through, self-doubt. With an overactive yet clumsy personality she is very relatable to young people particularly.I identify the genre of this film as a fantasy adventure hybrid due to the mix of elements of fantasy such as witches, magical broomsticks, talking animals, cities or buildings in the sky, supernatural items and the elements of adventure such as exploration, new experiences, and exotic locations. Conventions normally associated with the genres include magic or supernatural powers, no official references to the real world, exploration of exotic locations, and overcoming adversity. This film perfectly adheres to these conventions and uses it the strengthen the film as whole. The main item discussed and sought after in this film is magical in nature, the hero explores an unknown school full of mysteries and secrets, participates in a magical school, and has to overcome their self-doubt to rescue a friend and right a wrong.The Witch’s Flower or the “Fly by Night” flower is a mysterious blue flower that ends up being highly controversial. It is magic in nature with potentially endless possibilities of application but like most magical items of infinite possibility it is unstable in nature and can only be used in minuscule amounts or destruction and devastation will follow. This prop is instrumental and metaphorical as it gives the hero of the film, Mary Smith, temporary magical abilities, allowing her to discover the magic school in the sky, and is a symbol of power and ambition. The headmaster of the school and the main professor become obsessed with the flower and the power it brings. They attempt to transform humans, non-magical beings, into witches or warlocks through the power of the flower. It is an overly ambitious goal and like all over ambitious dreams it blows up in their face, twice. Originally discovered by Mary’s Aunt Charlotte, the flower once again is a symbol of ambition. Charlotte found the flower and showed it to her headmaster and professor hoping to use it for the advancement of magic but after seeing them obsess over it and perform immoral experiments she lost her ambition and took the flower, losing it in the forest.I assume that this story takes place in the countryside of Western Europe during the early to mid 1900s due to the scenery, clothes worn by the characters, and the roles of some of the characters. In the English version of this film the characters have British accents and Aunt Charlotte has a maid and a gardener for her house. People in Europe who weren’t wealthy but still had assistance around their big property are rare so I can assume this takes place before World War II, but Mary and Peter’s clothing would depict a more modern period. The historical accuracy of this film is inconsistent, and this fact helps elevate the film. When not worried about the historical or even locational accuracy of a film you can enjoy the small and interesting details of the characters and the settings individually and they can in turn mix and make an even more interesting fantasy setting, which this film does.Due to the location of the film being ambiguous the director and screenwriter could explore the area in as much depth as possible without making the audience feel like they have been there before or somewhere like there. Granted the scenes bring a sense of familiarity due to almost every person having been exploring in some shape or form in their youth but the location is unknown and in this film is meant to be explored, only adding to the depth of the film when the audience discovers something along with the hero. The college itself is a vast landscape of wonders to be explored. Between the courtyard full of magical inquiries, the main tower full of endless floors and endless rooms, and the recreation center there is more than enough for the audience to be enthralled with. The film at its core is a tale of overcoming adversity. Mary is a regular human girl with no magical abilities who gets thrusted into a world, without the Witch’s Flower, she is unable to handle. Regardless she finds a way to navigate through her problems by staying head strong, believing in herself, and finding the courage to stand up and fight even when the odds are against her with minimal assistance.The style of the genre of this film influences the mood of the film to be really wonderous. Whether it’s in the small town or the magical school, you are always looking around the screen and asking questions. A good example of this is the introduction scene of Endor College, the magic academy in the film. The college itself is made up of four differently styled buildings, the courtyard is full of interesting aquatic or amphibious creatures lurking and running around. Some of them almost resemble real animals but when you look at them closer, they don’t. This detail helps the audience feel like they have a grasp or understanding of the kind of magical universe they are currently invested in with room for questions. The inside of the main building of the school is in designed to be like a traditional magical school, big and open with lots of floors with lots of rooms and a myriad of students doing different things, travelling through this school by either bubble or a wireless elevator. Another building is a full recreation center packed with students exercising, something you wouldn’t expect in a magic school. All of these elements prioritize wonder and adventure in the audiences’ head and brings more questions than answers.The inciting incident of the film is when Mary initially goes into the woods, finding the Witch’s Flower.

However, the crucial problem with Mary and the Witch's Flower was the story and script. You have interesting character designs and a ripe world ready for world building. There's some great sequences but without the writing to back it up, it's all flash and no substance.Characters were all one note. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but when the core drama revolves around a bland main character, there's nothing to grab onto. Mary...discovers a witch flower and she only reacts to the events that follow. She doesn't have any motivation so when one does appear, it becomes hamfisted and she changes personality. I'm still frustrated with the 'twist' halfway through. All the interesting stuff is relegated to a flashback and I'd rather see that film instead. Hell, I'd follow the random broom keeper. The film didn't really explain why he was there either but at least he had had his eccentricities.Next up is the setting: The wonderful set pieces are spoiled and there's no real sense of place. Hayao Miyazaki was notorious for crafting layouts from top to bottom and even his son Goro always made sure to keep his films vibrant.  However, this film felt really empty. The town consisted of the gardener, the grandma, Peter, and Mary. Even the crazy witch school didn't feel right. By the time the third act rolled around, it stretched out for far too long and I couldn't really bring myself to care as much as I wanted to.TLDR; Overall, this gets a 6 to a mid 5/10. While it is visually great, everything else from the characters and story was middling to fine. The most interesting aspects are relegated to a flashback at the end of the second act and the rest is a lot of wasted potential.

It's got high speed action scenes, fascinating locations, and my personal favorite, incredibly charming character moments. I absolutely loved seeing the cat glare at the camera at random moments, or Mary pat her hair after getting complimented on it for the first time, or the broom bounce around, or a robot roll its eyes over its head. These moments have very little to do with the story, but...I couldn't help but keep my eyes peeled for them because they absolutely made the movie for me.The story was...simple, and for the most part I don't have a problem with that, I always understood what was going on and could therefore let my focus go to the aforementioned visuals. The one thing that did bug me however was how no meaningful progress was made during the second act. Stuff certainly happens, but the main character doesn't learn from it, and we start the third act no closer to achieving her goal of rescuing Peter. It wasn't a huge deal, but it was a distraction and they could have avoided that by structuring the film differently.All in all though, really fun time, I heartily recommend it, and this is only 40% of Studio Ponoc's power I couldn't help but keep my eyes peeled for them because they absolutely made the movie for me.The story was...simple, and for the most part I don't have a problem with that, I always understood what was going on and could therefore let my focus go to the aforementioned visuals.

Only previous staff worked on this, which really showed.This movie felt like it was trying so hard to be  Studio Ghibli movie that it just came out a mess. It was a total rip-off of all Studio Ghibli movies, and is not worth watching. I personally don't think that any part of this movie was good, except for maybe the art.

There were a few things that they did (like the hair bristling thing that you can see in a lot of Ghibli films), that were totally copied from Miazaki's works.If you're looking to watch this movie, I do not recommend it.

Yet, despite all of the similarities Studio Ponoc shares with Ghibli there are also differences which make said studio’s work stand out against that of Ghibli. More importantly, anybody who thinks Ghibli has a monopoly over the given style is actually unfamiliar with older works from studios such as NHK.The style is definitely softer than a lot of the Anime we seen, yet also has a realistic appeal despite not having the level of realism as seen in some of the newer styles...coming out. Instead, said style utilizes a lot of the classic elements while retaining the big eyes which represent innocence, and other similar features without those sharp angles. It’s a style fewer and fewer studios utilize these days, so seeing a new studio utilizing said style is nice.As for the story, there was definitely quite a bit of world building going on, which is again not something Ghibli has a monopoly on – it’s instead good writing. The world created – yes, I was reminded of ‘Kiki’s Delivery Service’ and ‘Spirited Away’, but the movie was it’s own thing which could stand on it’s own, not to mention the characters are able to stand on their own as well.

I know there can be no one that replaces Miyazaki, but I looked forward to what people with his influence could do on their own. I grew up with Ghibli's classics and seeing their evolution over the years, I can see where some of this new studio's inspirations are coming from for this movie.Visually and stylistically, I can see influences from Howl's Moving Castle and When Marnie was There. The magic makes just about as much sense as it does in...Howl's Moving Castle. It's wondrous and looks amazing, but there are points where things don't make much sense. The animation of characters and backgrounds remind me of the style of When Marnie was There, with it being more modern and more noticeably digitally animated. It's definitely not a bad thing though. The characters are appealing to look at and feel like they belong to the world of the movie.The only complaints I have of it is that there are points in the animation where characters feel more 3D than their environments, especially in the early sections of the movie. Mary seemed to be separate from her environment in some parts, so it was a bit distracting for the moments where this happened. Additionally, the story feels a bit incomplete and has some awkward pacing. It feels like they sacrificed work on the story for animating flashy sequences. I say this because the story feels rather linear and predictable. I could tell where the story was going quite easily, so a I feel like it could have been more than what it was. It was good and enjoyable, but I feel like it could have been better flushed out.Overall, Mary and the Witch's Flower is a pretty enjoyable movie. It has it's faults, but it's not bad by any means. I think it's a great first movie for this studio, though I hope they don't rely too heavily on being from Ghibli or on Miyazaki's influence as time goes on.I think an important thing to know before you watch this movie is that though this was made by people who worked under Miyazaki, it's not the same experience. It's new and different and they are stretching their legs to see what they can do and be in this new beginning. Yes, they are influenced and inspired by Miyazaki, but they are their own thing.

If the look of the movie seems familiar, that’s for good reason. Studio Ponoc was founded by and employs several key figures from Studio Ghibli, the famed animation studio that gave us the classic works of Hayao Miyazaki: Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and (my all-time favorite) Kiki’s Delivery Service. Among those former-Ghibli members are Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Takeshi Imamura, who serve as Mary’s writer/director and supervising animator, respectively. So, with that kind of pedigree, Mary must be flippin’ amazing, right? Alas, I’m sorry to say that...just isn’t the case.Now, before you get the wrong idea, please understand this isn’t a bad movie. Not at all. It just isn’t *great*, which is something you want to expect from a talent like Hiromasa Yonebayashi (who also directed The Secret World of Arrietty). The first half of Mary and the Witch’s Flower is, quite frankly, an uneven mess. The tone is all over the place, jumping from supernatural action to quiet countryside life to magical school in the sky, all within the span of 40-50 minutes. Let’s talk about Endor College for a moment. Even though the concept of a “school for wizards and witches” has reached the point of oversaturation and cliché, that’s not my main problem with it. Rather, the mere existence of this school is *completely irrelevant* to the main plot of this movie. It’s bad enough that I was supremely bored by Mary’s endless tour of the school’s classes and facilities. But to later find out none of that really mattered, other than it just being the location where all the main action happens? That’s just sloppy and annoying.Thankfully, the movie dramatically improves halfway through the second act. Once the actual conflict was introduced, I got fully onboard and enjoying the ride.

The talent is there. I just want to see them create something truly original. just isn’t the case.Now, before you get the wrong idea, please understand this isn’t a bad movie. Not at all. It just isn’t *great*, which is something you want to expect from a talent like Hiromasa Yonebayashi (who also directed The Secret World of Arrietty). The first half of Mary and the Witch’s Flower is, quite frankly, an uneven mess. The tone is all over the place, jumping from supernatural action to quiet countryside life to magical school in the sky, all within the span of 40-50 minutes. Let’s talk about Endor College for a moment. Even though the concept of a “school for wizards and witches” has reached the point of oversaturation and cliché, that’s not my main problem with it. Rather, the mere existence of this school is *completely irrelevant* to the main plot of this movie. It’s bad enough that I was supremely bored by Mary’s endless tour of the school’s classes and facilities. But to later find out none of that really mattered, other than it just being the location where all the main action happens? That’s just sloppy and annoying.Thankfully, the movie dramatically improves halfway through the second act. Once the actual conflict was introduced, I got fully onboard and enjoying the ride.

It may not have been perfect in terms of technicalities, but it is a very enjoyable experience nonetheless.Minor spoiler alert.Story: 8/10The story is beautiful in the sense that it explores the innocence of the mind of a child—the troubles such innocence may cause. Despite the fact that it may be troublesome at times, the story also displayed how such innocence drives a child to be very optimistic, kind and loving. The story isn\'t too complicated to understand, but wasn\'t too simple either. There were times...that the story did some foreshadowing (ie. when the headmistress addressed how Mary\'s red hair is rare and is the mark of a powerful witch, it also implied how the witch seen in the first 5 minutes of the movie must\'ve been related to Mary in any way). In essence, the story is very enjoyable, and easy to follow, therefore anyone who watches based on the story will not be disappointed.While there are many positives to the story, I ended up giving it an 8 because I felt that the ending was a little too rushed; there was too lotle tome given for the climax to resolve itself, hence the movie ended in a way that felt a little abrupt.Art: 10/10While art is subjective and is up to preference, I must say that even if I looked at the movie objectively, there was nothing bad I could point out. I\'ve always been a huge fan of Ghibli films, and this movie by Studio Ponoc managed to replicate the Ghibli aesthetic brilliantly. It felt like I was watching a Ghibli film again, and took me back to my childhood where I would watch films like Mononoke Hime with my mum. Heartwarming, beautiful and creative, the art in this movie was truly splendid.If I had to point out my favorite scene in terms of art, it would be Charlotte\'s house. Her bedroom was so beautiful that I had taken screenshots as an inspiration to design my bedroom in the future. The view from her bedroom was phenomenal. Also, an honorable mention would be the scene where Charlotte crashes and the flowers fall to the ground. The blue glow that exploded from the flowers were beautiful, and the transformation of the nature around it supplemented it even more.Sound: 10/10While I\'ve emphasized many times in my articles about how music plays a fundamental role in the success of an anime, this movie does not shy away from proving that point. The soundtrack was very good in a sense that it always matched the mood and settings present while it was being played. It may not have been the greatest soundtrack of all time, like the works by Joe Hisaishi, but it was far from being just average. It was good, memorable, and relaxing.One thing I must point out is how amazing the ending song was. SEKAI NO OWARI have always been well-known around the world for their amazing talent, but the song, ""Rain"" played in the end was indescribable, even by their standards. It ended the journey we experienced while watching the film with a song that felt very comforting. Perfect way to end such a fantastic film.Characters: 8/10The characters in the story were crucial, especially the main character. While the story wasn\'t necessarily character-driven, the innocence of a child that got her into the problem in the first place, as well as her passion and bravery to save a friend are both only possible with a well characterized protagonist. The character development wasnt perfect, as characters like Peter felt a little abandoned by the narrative at times, but overall the quality of the characters are good enough to warrant an 8.Enjoyment: 9/10While individual aspects to a movie may be of value when we analyze said movie, most people are more concerned with the question, ""Will I enjoy watching this?"". Albeit many films have a strange discrepancy between enjoyment and technical quality, ""Mary and the Witch\'s Flower"" had nailed both very well. As previously highlighted the technical qualities of the movie was very good, but more than that, the sheer enjoyment of watching this film was simply intangible. I often lost track of time while watching, and my friends who had watched it with me, showed surprising amounts of enthusiasm with the development of the plot. It was beyond enjoyable. It was so enjoyable that you may start to wish to enter the world Mary was living in.Overall: 9/10While mathematically taking the score for all the factors discussed previously and calculating the mean will give a score of 9, even if we used an arbitrary yardstick to giving an overall score, I\'d give this film a 9/10. It was near-perfect, and will remain in my memory as one of the best films of 2017 for a long long time. that the story did some foreshadowing (ie. when the headmistress addressed how Mary\'s red hair is rare and is the mark of a powerful witch, it also implied how the witch seen in the first 5 minutes of the movie must\'ve been related to Mary in any way).

This review will lean heavily towards the negative side, but as far as enjoyment this is a 7/10.Now picture a stereotypical children\'s movie. This is what I picture. Now there is something charming about the simplistic story line for sure. However, the actual ideas did not play out as well as they could have.I was more than halfway into the movie before being shown what the motive of the antagonist(s) actually was. Before knowing what the primary motive is...you will watch an hour of a girl running around talking to animals as if they are listening to her. The red head, aka Mary Smith, is an entitled girl that thinks the whole world is against her. She hates the boy next door neighbor named Peter, because he made a rude comment about her hair. As she is spending her lunch whining about her life to a cat (as we all do), she runs across a magic flower. Apparently, this is an extremely rare flower that gives magical power. She picks the flower, flys on a broomstick into a shed, and before you know it- there is a young prodigy at the Endor College. Things go down hill from here. Remember Peter? Well to skip some details, he went missing because of the generically-named Mary Smith. So Mary musters up a bit of selflessness to go save Peter in the middle of the night. Mary\'s great aunt becomes a bit suspicious of the sneaking out, and sudden disappearance of Peter (as anybody should be.) Turns out the aunt, Charlotte, was once a witch! WOW real plot twist I know.  She still hates him...until they are stuck in a cave. Now Mary and Peter have this undying love for each other and promise to leave together, no matter what.  While watching this movie you will hear, ""I MADE A PROMISE AND I WILL COME BACK"" about 50 times.  I also wanted to add somewhere that Mary has this weird emotional attachment to her broomstick? lol anyways, The rest of the movie is them trying to stop Doctor Dee and Madam Mumblechook from turning humans into winged creatures. Now you might be asking yourself, why is Doctor and Madam wanting to transform humans...???well duh-- bEcaUSe ThEy WanT To TAke OveR thE wOrlDDD *muahhahaha*Spoiler alert: Peter and Mary, along with the help of animal friends, stop the evil plan.Again the art is incredible, but I have mixed feelings on this movie bc the execution could be better. you will watch an hour of a girl running around talking to animals as if they are listening to her.

I think the author was able to show his deep and interesting world. Hiromasa Yonebayashi always has live characters who interact perfectly. Be it grandma and granddaughter or granddaughter and gardener in this anime, or as in 'Memories of Marnie' aunt with uncle and niece. In his world you believe and understand what the author wanted to say and show. And it gives you the opportunity to fully plunge into history, and follow it with interest.It may not show the magic school’s everyday life, but the school itself, to me, is shown...quite interesting, though schematic. The author must have had a different message. We must not embrace the love of magic, but understand that we can do everything without magic and should do so. Like saving someone you care about with courage and ingenuity.This is a very beautiful anime, in terms of pictures and magic music. Yes, I found music there too. And she betrays her style.I suggest you enjoy watching this anime and having fun quite interesting, though schematic. The author must have had a different message.

I do not think they can fill such shoes, but rather would like to view them as a competitor. They share the same style, and a lot of the staff (at least for this movie), so that much is warranted. Anyways, Mary and the Witch’s Flower is actually a great debut work for the studio.Pros:- Great animation. Studio Ponoc did a really good job in the animation department for their debut work here. The movie looks and feels so much like a Ghibli movie that it is almost...criminal. Considering where the director comes from, it should not really come as much of a surprise. The colors are vibrant, the world feels alive, and there were several scenes where I was just in awe at the animation (especially the water scenes).- Beautiful soundtrack. Takatsugu Muramatsu does it again. I absolutely loved his work on When Marnie Was There, so I had a lot to look forward to when I heard he would be composing the soundtrack for Mary and the Witch’s Flower. He certainly did not disappoint! It reminded me a lot of the Arrietty soundtrack, more so than the soundtrack for Marnie. Even so, the soundtrack was excellent throughout, bringing to life this fantasy world portrayed through the already magical animation. My favorite track ended up being “Magic Science”.Cons:- Generic story. This movie is adapted from a children’s book, so I did not have the highest of expectations going into it. Cannot say I was surprised with how the story turned out, it was just your generic children’s fantasy tale. It is not necessarily a bad thing either, as this movie’s selling points are elsewhere, but do not go into this movie expecting the story to blow you away.Overall:Mary and the Witch’s Flower is a respectable debut work for Studio Ponoc. It definitely establishes them as a studio to rival Ghibli in the future, at least when it comes to style. I recommend it for that aspect alone. Hopefully we can get more works like this from them in the future! criminal. Considering where the director comes from, it should not really come as much of a surprise.

The world seemed very rich and engaging.  The kids were pleasantly childlike and didn't display the decision-making capacities of adults.  And the art was absolutely phenomenal.  Especially in the opening, it really manages to engage the viewer right from the start.However this show got a relatively low score for something that hits all the right notes.  I found the plotline to be completely predictable, and the world too familiar.  Some of the characters and visual concepts...seemed recycled from Spirited Away.  All in all as a story I feel like it didn't hold up.  But the artwork is so phenomenal and the feel of Ghibli, even if a bit recycled, make this generally enjoyable. It wasn't very original and it didn't blow my mind, but it was good.I'd recommend this anime to anyone who likes anime about kids, magic, or heavy-motion animation. seemed recycled from Spirited Away.

I hope their second film will be just as good.Some people are calling Studio Ponoc the new Ghibli, and I can see why. Like most Studio Ghibli films, Mary and the Witch's Flower is based on a British kids' novel rather then a Japanese novel, manga, light novel, or game. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) Plus, it has a similar art style. This gives the film a similar feel to many Ghibli films. Not to mention Studio Ponoc was founded by a producer from Studio...Ghibli.I'm not sure why the creator's of this film left Ghibli to create their own studio. I do have speculations, though. It might simply be because the studio is falling do to Miyazaki's semi-retirement, and they thought it easier to start fresh. When Marnie Was There and The Secret World of Arrietty aren't as popular as other Ghibli films. Which is a shame, considering they're both pretty good.In the meantime, I hope to see more from both Studio Ponoc and Ghibli in the future.

I grew up with it, I admire Hayao Miyazaki’s work, I admire Joe Hisaishi’s work, I’ve rewatched Spirited Away and Howl’s Moving Castle too many...times and was a huge fan of The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, which overviews the interworking of Studio Ghibli’s process.I watched the theatre dub of this film and I’m going to, to the best of my ability, explain why others and myself felt this film lacked “heart” but definitely had the potential impact of that of its Ghibli predecessor.Story & Characters (6/10):Overall, this is what sets the film back. (There's a tldr at the bottom, I feel like I'm ranting in this section)If you watched The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, you know Miyazaki’s process is very very organic. He doesn’t know the ending of the film until finishing the last storyboard and the film is made while he is storyboarding. It shows how much consideration he takes for these worlds and these characters. His films have multiple plots and character journeys because that’s how life works, right? A story is never just a main character going into mischief and people just letting it happen. Its a correlation of many character events clashing into a larger story.[[Chihiro meets a spoiled son that learns to be selfless when turned into a rat. A no-face character that just wants a home but turns malicious when placed in a life of luxury. A river spirit is enslaved after losing his home to pollution but is saved by a girl he met years ago.]]Now with Mary and the Witch’s Flower, this isn’t the case.The story follows Mary. And follows Mary. And follows Mary some more.The adults of the film, not from the Witch Academy, are either out and about running errands, worrying about Mary, or going to work. Then there’s Peter, a village neighbor, that exists purely as a plot device for Mary’s flaws and, eventually, her revelation. He’s defined early in the story as sweet and hardworking and he doesn’t become anything else after the fact. [[He is brave and loyal as well, but those are revealed traits later on]]All the characters in this film are fully developed with no internal arcs except for their events around the Witch’s Flower. Mary is the only one, in the entire film, that really evolves, so we, as an audience, grow with her. She starts with an internal struggle of not being good at anything and disliking her appearance of large frizzy hair. Then she goes on this adventure into a Witch School that praises her for skills she doesn’t truly possess. Then towards the end of the story she accepts who she is, and realizes power and praise are only satisfying when she’s being true to herself.In a way, this film could have worked with focusing on just Mary, but there wasn’t that organic journey of Mary becoming more independent and loving herself and perhaps finding her true strengths before she was off fighting. Instead she went home after day one and laughed off the whole ordeal, and had self love for her hair but there was nothing said about her insecurities at being bad at everything she does. The plot just ran ahead of her to the next action sequence.So, there isn’t much attention to characters, so whats holding this movie like glue? Well it has to be the plot. And considering how smart audiences are today it would have to be rather fun and intriguing to keep attention.The first scene in the film did this the best but the rest struggled to keep a consistent tone.So here is the plot in very simple terms:Intro powerful item, steal from bad guys, lose item for a long time, intro protagonist’s desires and flaws, protagonist finds item, protagonist seemingly happy however bad guys ruin it, item stolen again by bad guys, protagonist feels helpless, karma points helps save the day, protagonist must save the day without powerful item, proclaim a life lesson.Not a bad plot, but basic enough you wonder what makes this film so special? What would make audiences talk about the story? Where is the “heart”, the connection, that resonates in other Ghibli films?Lets talk villains.Miyazaki films are very wholesome for always redeeming their villains. They’re always people who make mistakes or were pushed into difficult situations that become unraveled by the protagonist. Sometimes they’re just greedy, but in the end they realize their flaws and work to bettering themselves in some manner.This film made villains for the sake of villains, and it was rather disappointing.Its explained in a flashback. Two teachers at the academy are introduced to the Witch’s Flower and become obsessed and consumed.Honestly, this explanation sounds fine on paper. But when you see the film, there is an attention to detail to the world building that creates expectation for more explanation.These teachers, prior to the flower, were kind and intelligent. The academy helped further witches and warlocks in all levels of magic to further their studies and these two teachers were at the forefront.Then the flower is just plucked out of no where and they go stir crazy with experiments to make the most powerful witches the world has every seen. But to what end? Is magic dying? Is there a reason powerful magic is needed?Did their obsession to improve their students extend to creating THE best students ever known? Its a such selfless strange obsession that it barely holds up as a motivation to antagonize two children and mangle dozens of animals in experiments. Perhaps if there was a competing school? Or a competition of sorts?TLDR; No character depth beyond the protagonist, antagonists exist to be antagonists, the plot is very basic with a beginning middle and end, and the lack of heart comes from the lack of internal character arcs so the audience cant find a connection with anyone.World building:There was too much expositional dialogue as a form of world building. Ponac has amazing talent for visuals— use them, use them, use them. Their characters seem to say things for the sake of saying something, so there was a lack of realism.Then, there’s that rule in fantasy. You explain all of it, or you don’t try at all. Otherwise you create expectations for the readers and suddenly you’re riddled with holes.The film tried on occasion to explain magic,[[one point mentioning electricity to be a form of magic…which is okay, thats fine]] but it never explained why magic just…existed in the sky? Is there a society somewhere? Is it like Kiki’s Delivery Service, and these kids leave home and live in isolated areas to specialize in their skills? Magic can be acquired through a flower, but it seems to have to be inherited? Are witches a dying breed? Are they worried about losing magic?The world of magic itself was so isolated to the one school, it never really explained the general important questions, instead it narrowed the audience’s view to only see the actions within the school as a plot point. Which is fine, as far as writing goes, but it detracts from the immersion.Animation:No doubt it’s a gorgeous film and obviously descended from Ghibli. I love the style and every scene has great detail. I would never doubt their skills as animators.Music:I liked the soundtrack. I was very much reminded of Harry Potter when they used a hammered dulcimer for “Night Flight” and when Mary entered the Academy. It creates that tinkling sound which I think everyone relates to “oooh look magic is happening”. In Harry Potter they used a synthesizer and a celeste so this instrument was really beautiful and unique.Well, thats that. Honestly, its still a lovely movie and solid for a new studio, I just think they need a stronger lead in future films on why they’re making these movies. The plots need revising and their characters need more depth. times and was a huge fan of The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, which overviews the interworking of Studio Ghibli’s process.I watched the theatre dub of this film and I’m going to, to the best of my ability, explain why others and myself felt this film lacked “heart” but definitely had the potential impact of that of its Ghibli predecessor.Story & Characters (6/10):Overall, this is what sets the film back.

Sometimes they’re just greedy, but in the end they realize their flaws and work to bettering themselves in some manner.This film made villains for the sake of villains, and it was rather disappointing.Its explained in a flashback. Two teachers at the academy are introduced to the Witch’s Flower and become obsessed and consumed.Honestly, this explanation sounds fine on paper. But when you see the film, there is an attention to detail to the world building that creates expectation for more explanation.These teachers, prior to the flower, were kind and intelligent. The academy helped further witches and warlocks in all levels of magic to further their studies and these two teachers were at the forefront.Then the flower is just plucked out of no where and they go stir crazy with experiments to make the most powerful witches the world has every seen. But to what end? Is magic dying? Is there a reason powerful magic is needed?Did their obsession to improve their students extend to creating THE best students ever known? Its a such selfless strange obsession that it barely holds up as a motivation to antagonize two children and mangle dozens of animals in experiments. Perhaps if there was a competing school? Or a competition of sorts?TLDR; No character depth beyond the protagonist, antagonists exist to be antagonists, the plot is very basic with a beginning middle and end, and the lack of heart comes from the lack of internal character arcs so the audience cant find a connection with anyone.World building:There was too much expositional dialogue as a form of world building. Ponac has amazing talent for visuals— use them, use them, use them. Their characters seem to say things for the sake of saying something, so there was a lack of realism.Then, there’s that rule in fantasy. You explain all of it, or you don’t try at all. Otherwise you create expectations for the readers and suddenly you’re riddled with holes.The film tried on occasion to explain magic,[[one point mentioning electricity to be a form of magic…which is okay, thats fine]] but it never explained why magic just…existed in the sky? Is there a society somewhere? Is it like Kiki’s Delivery Service, and these kids leave home and live in isolated areas to specialize in their skills? Magic can be acquired through a flower, but it seems to have to be inherited? Are witches a dying breed? Are they worried about losing magic?The world of magic itself was so isolated to the one school, it never really explained the general important questions, instead it narrowed the audience’s view to only see the actions within the school as a plot point. Which is fine, as far as writing goes, but it detracts from the immersion.Animation:No doubt it’s a gorgeous film and obviously descended from Ghibli. I love the style and every scene has great detail. I would never doubt their skills as animators.Music:I liked the soundtrack. I was very much reminded of Harry Potter when they used a hammered dulcimer for “Night Flight” and when Mary entered the Academy. It creates that tinkling sound which I think everyone relates to “oooh look magic is happening”. In Harry Potter they used a synthesizer and a celeste so this instrument was really beautiful and unique.Well, thats that. Honestly, its still a lovely movie and solid for a new studio, I just think they need a stronger lead in future films on why they’re making these movies. The plots need revising and their characters need more depth."", '- zamandzoe\'s Anime Reviews: Season 2 ~ Review 1 -“When you are content to be simply yourself and don\'t compare or compete, everyone will respect you.”Normally, it would be acceptable for a studio\'s first film to be far from perfect. However, when you have people from the acclaimed Studio Ghibli working on your film, you\'re asking to be compared to them from the get go.As much as I\'d want to deny this claim, it seems that Miyazaki was the key to much of Ghibli\'s success.Story: 6On it\'s own, Mary and the Witch\'s Flower\'s story is flat. The pacing is all over the place, and any...world building falls flat on it\'s face. By all means, it\'s ""passable"" but it\'s far from engaging. We are introduced to a ""normal"" world followed by a magical realm of sorts that exists inside it. Notably, we see a full tour of the school which would leave you to believe that it would be a key asset of this film\'s world.But it\'s not. Following the tour of a well-crafted and inspired school, it is completely dropped from the story. Soon after that, we see a house in the middle of nowhere that once belonged to a witch from long ago. That witch happened to steal a valuable item from the school, but other than what is said at face value, we never get a deeper explanation about why that happened.Those were only some of the story\'s problems. Honestly, a film could pass with a lackluster plot and still be pretty good, but that means that it would need to be good in every other aspect.Art and Sound: 8If there\'s one thing this film did get from Ghibli, it\'s the art style and the sound. Though basic in this day and age, the style works well and a few still shots make the world at least feel alive. The sound compliments this, and makes intense scenes feel like it matters... Even though the characters make it seem otherwise.Characters: 5This is where the film falls flat in every way. We are supposed to like Mary, the protagonist, but all she does is act like a brat in the beginning and magically redeems herself by the end. The film could\'ve gone in an interesting direction with her telling a lie that changes the course of the plot, but it ignores this.As for every other character, they hardly classify as one. No development is to be found, they only do the minimum that the film requires them to do.Enjoyment: 6Ultimately, this is subjective. For me, the pretty scenery and above average soundtrack was enough for me to remain interested. That may not apply to everyone. If you absolutely need an engaging plot, then you won\'t find it here. The same applies for the characters.Overall: 6Is this a bad movie? No. Is it a great movie? No. Should you watch it? Sure, why not?If you want a reason to appreciate Ghibli, then watch this film. It will make you realize how magical they were.Otherwise, this film is pretty generic and not that noteworthy. It plays everything safe and takes no risks. As such, it is clear that replicating Ghibli came first, while being original was second.If you have the chance to watch it on a big screen (theater), then it\'s probably worth a watch.

But by the end of it, I just ended up feeling genuinely upset. It could have been so good, but it lacked so much in it\'s story and character building that could of probably been solved if the movie was simply a bit longer.Without going too in depth on how I would actually change the story to make it better, I\'ll point out the main issues that made the movie...much less enjoyable for me.1. The friendship between Mary and Peter goes from non-existent to BFF\'s without any buildup what-so-ever.Mary just meets Peter twice by chance, he mocks her for looking like a monkey so she gets upset and then he just leaves! Then Mary has the fantastic idea to get Peter mixed up in all of the magic shenanigans happening, which really made me dislike her as a character. Her decisions were so immature and irresponsible at times and for the dumbest reasons. When she cried and apologized to Peter it didn\'t feel like she cares about him and feels bad for getting him mixed up in danger, it felt as if she was just being a brat crying over the mistakes she made. (because their relationship had no buildup, why should she care about someone so badly if she just met them a few days ago?)2. The story was predictable.As soon as I saw the front yard of the school and saw how madam Mumblechook showed up and behaved, I knew immediately that she was the antagonist and from there everything else was predictable. Judging by the scene in the beginning that showed a girl who looked like Mary, and everything about the broom, I knew that the woman wanted the flower that Mary used to get there. I could also immediately predict the ""Twist"" that the aunt was the girl from the scene at the beginning of the movie. It really just left me feeling bored in the end.3. Peter\'s role and him as a characterEnough said, he lacked development and he was sirt of just a prop so that Mary could mess up and have a chance to shine upon rescuing him.I\'m giving the movie an overall rating of 3, because there\'s only 3 things that I liked. One point for the animation for being pretty and fluid and second point for the scene at the beginning of the movie where Mary\'s aunt steals the flower seeds and flee\'s the academy. I know I complained about that scene a little bit, but truly for me it was the best part of the movie, it got me more hyped and excited for what was going on and really just gripped me and made me wanna keep watching. Third point is for the whole animal and human experimentation theme that was going on, I found it to be different and creepy, so it kept me intrigued a little bit longer. much less enjoyable for me.1.

It combines action-packed magic and fantasy with the vibes of your average Studio Ghibli movie (even though this movie isn’t even MADE by Studio Ghibli, it’s made by Studio Ponoc, who did a great job with this film)!The technology and architecture in this film is magnificent, and the conflicts are unlike most films that I’ve ever seen.If you want a GOOD fantasy film about magic and witches, this is the one. Go watch it, you most certainly WON’T regret it!Overall rating:...9/10 9/10', ""I finally got around to watching this series today and I went in with high hopes. The movie started off with a really capturing scene but that was the only scene I truly enjoyed. The characters seemed pretty flat and had no background and their voice acting was flat as well. The art was pretty good but I did see a few blips, but that's just me being used to the ghibli quality. The magic scenes in particular were beautiful. Overall the plot was too slow without any build up, but someone who like smooth sailing, slow movies might get enjoyment out of it! "", ""In my opinion, this movie could have been great but during the movie the story went downhill.Story - 5I think the story at the beginning started strong! It definitely had the potential to be good story-wise but as the movie went on it fell flat to me. It was almost like there was a lot of filler bits or a lot of things just added in but not really thought out properly. It's almost like they had too many ideas and they wanted to include it all but then it made some other bits of the story either making no sense or not being...necessary to include.Character - 3Probably the biggest let down in the whole movie. As I said at the start of this review, the start of the movie was great but the story and the character development throughout the movie are the things that made me give this movie a lower rating. My issues with the characters is the complete lack of development during the whole movie. They go through this massive adventure but it is almost like all the characters are only two dimensional. There aren't many examples I can give without giving spoilers but if you're curious I guess watch it and see...I kind of liked the cats but again there wasn't much development behind them either...just completely bland and boring which could take people by surprise due to how many events happen in this movie but what is really a good adventure without characters you actually care about?Enjoyment - 5Due to issues I've stated early I really didn't enjoy the movie and I constantly was waiting for it to end...Art - 9The art, in my opinion, was great! No complaints but sadly this was the best part of the movie for me...Sound - 6I thought some of the songs were okay I guess. The voice actors were okay but I did always think that the cat's sounds just sounded so much unlike a cat it just became annoying.Overall - 6I guess the art style kind of redeems the movie a little bit but barely...I wouldn't watch it by choice that is why I regret buying this movie...I guess it looks good on my shelf...idk haha but yeah It could have been great if they took their time, didn't rush the story, made it simpler and actually developed the characters. Personally Ii wouldn't recommend. necessary to include.Character - 3Probably the biggest let down in the whole movie.

At the end of the film you might think ""ah, that was nice"" and then forget about it, and continue with whatever you would otherwise be doing - this film didn\'t leave any particular impression...on me, no matter how high the production level was. Because of this, although the animation was great, and the designs were lovely, I couldn\'t rate this above a 7.Considering this, I\'d recommend this to anyone who just wants to sit down and relax for a couple of hours, and not have to think to much, or to keep your children entertained - I imagine this would make a great bedtime film - not to say that it will put you to sleep for lack of interest, but just because of it\'s gentle atmosphere.As far as the plot, well, there\'s not much to it, it\'s a bit predictable, but I guess it relays those good old moral messages, so again would be great for children who are new to any tropes that we may recognise in this film. on me, no matter how high the production level was.

Like every anime adaptation of a novel its best to think this as its own thing not as a replacement for The Little Broomstick by the Scottish Mary Stewart.  This film is because an introduction to determine if this studio in the right direction they took...something from children novel to set the tone so did it succeed. Well, I say its honestly a mix bag, they is alot of reason why is this a bad film nope, is it a really flawed film and overly safe yes it is.Good:It was during the introduction for the school, this was amazing the animators really went tenholds into that section the gym, the chemistry labs.....  the detail, animation the lived in nature was great and fantastic.Animation i have no complaints a lot of hard work and passionate went behind this movie.Mary the character, she doesn't have that much characterization to say but the subtle facial expression, her tone.... really adds to the believability and honestly want to root for her.Art design- again the lived in nature, it's not like generic anime rooms where it all tidy and has no personality.The blend with CGI and 2D was honestly seamlessly only bits I notice was okay that way to detailed to be drawn and Mary interaction in this environment.  But utlise CGI but really the hand-drawn nature is what makes anime look honestly beautiful.Music- solid, i not expert with music so i can't really judge but it was well utilized.Solid English Dub - All the VA does a solid job with they performance, the different accents.... interesting to listen to.Bad:The Plot : The problem this film is messy structurally, it's honestly all over the place. I kinda sick to the beat the bad guy plot, because they messing with..... This is where the Ghibli comparison comes in. The story in Ghibli are honestly never the focus its always the characters and the bad guy stuff is usually a backdrop. Great thing in Miyazaki work like Princess Mononoke they is no bad guy. Everyone has they motivation and a good reason for the actions,  where people associate Ghibli films with is nuanced storytelling.Characters: honestly besides the MC ( even she kinda underdeveloped) no characters really stand out. I again going to compare to Ghibli again ( impossible bar i know). Where characters do they subtle expressions or how they act you have a good understanding with them as characters. My Neighbor Totoro the Main Protagonist Dad you can understanding everything about them for his room, how he reacts to situations, how he works and plays with his daughters ..... You feel like he's a person, or the Main Protagonist Mei and Satsuki that acts like real sisters and act they age Not as stupid idiots just a little naive.Bad Guys: they honestly unremarkable and leave little impact on me.Pacing: This is what honestly killed the film when it comes to structure it felt longer than it should have tbh.ConclusionWell, they are a solid foundation yet it doesn't do anything to distinguish themselves as ex Ghibli employees, what makes Studio Ponoc different. They really don't do much, however, I'm optimistic looking at the next project the 3 short stories it's definitely on the right track a little weird and obscure, I like it.  Hopefully, people do watch it as its a wonderful children film, it's beautiful and polish yet safe and generic which is a problem.I rate this 6.4/10 alot of great elements to do it excited for they future work. something from children novel to set the tone so did it succeed.

Well, to be frank, this is just an above average movie.Now let\'s start with the story. The story is what you get in every Ghibli movie ever. There\'s absolutely nothing special about it. If you are a fan of Ghibli movie, then you might feel nostalgic watching this movie because it combines a lot of elements that made you like Ghibli\'s movie, but it stopped there, they did nothing new with those concepts. If you haven\'t watched any Ghibli movie before, then I bet this movie will give you a lot of Harry Potter vibes,...or if you have watched Little Witch Academia, then this kinda packed a similar setting with it.The characters are fairy decent too. You have your main character who thought that she wasn\'t worth anything until she went to this magical land and found out that she has the greatest magic power there because of the help of a random plant she found at the middle of nowhere. Our ""love interest"", I put the """" because it really isn\'t confirmed but it was hinted, is just your typical love interest in every kids movie ever. Nothing special. So are the main villains, they are just cardboard cutouts you can find in other movies, doing all the things the did because of their own need.However, what makes this movie so much more bearable is the art and animation. The art looks gorgeous. Each scene is well drawn and if your expectations aren\'t too high, the art will easily satisfy you. The animation too is fluid. If you are a huge Ghibli fan, then I bet this part won\'t disappoint you. This level of art and animation is extremely praise-able for a studio\'s first project.The music is heartwarming, well-placed and suit the entire mood of the movie well. I have no complaints on this area. It didn\'t particularly stood out to me, but when watching the movie, I found no issue with the music.Overall, Mary to Majo no Hana/Mary and the Witch\'s Flower is an above average movie, but at the same time is also an excellent movie for a studio\'s first anime.  I will recommend this movie if you like Ghibli movie and want to get the same feeling in some other movie this year or to those who wants a movie like Little Witch Academia. or if you have watched Little Witch Academia, then this kinda packed a similar setting with it.The characters are fairy decent too.

And if you’re not one of those people that enjoy these studios you can at least appreciate the hard work that goes into the animation. With this movie I went in with high expectations as a studio ghibli fan and found this to be very generic, suddenly feeling like one of those people that can only appreciate the animation work that went into it, finding the pacing and story lacking.Hiromasa Yonebayashi is the director of...Mary to Majo no Hana, formerly working for studio ghibli and it shows. The animation quality and sound design isn’t lacking by any means, but to be quite honest the story was a chore to get through. Nothing about the characters was compelling or interesting and the pacing was off in many places in the film. I appreciate the work that went into this film and I will say a child will be less critical of this film as a given, it’s not aiming to be a masterpiece, but it delivers less than expected of something so closely related to studio ghibli. I hope studio Ponoc improves with it’s writing in the future. Mary to Majo no Hana, formerly working for studio ghibli and it shows.

I've seen a few people act like this is like Ponoc's Kiki's Delivery Service ripoff or something. It's not. Other than the superficial fact that both films include a witch, the two films have almost nothing in common. Unfortunately among the things that they dont have in common is the fact that Kiki's Delivery Service is good.Mary and the Witches Flower does have its strong suites. This film looks and sounds amazing. The opening scene absolutely blew me away. Yonebayashi not only masters...Miyazki's style, but he seemlessly mixes it with his own and arguably improves upon it. Between this film and When Marnie was There, I am incredibly optimistic for the future of Studio Ponoc and Yonebayashi.That said, this film is bad. It's bad because of its script and it's bad because of its characters. Nobody feels like a real person in this movie. They're all 2-dimensional caricatures working their way through a contrived plot. I really felt like I was watching a chidrens cartoon. Its weird too because it seems to set up Mary's arc in this overly simplistic and audience-patronizingly explicit way, and yet it doesn't even really pay it off. Mary's conclusion is honestly just weird and doesn't really make senseI know Yonebayashi can do good character work.

It's bad because of its script and it's bad because of its characters. Nobody feels like a real person in this movie. They're all 2-dimensional caricatures working their way through a contrived plot. I really felt like I was watching a chidrens cartoon. Its weird too because it seems to set up Mary's arc in this overly simplistic and audience-patronizingly explicit way, and yet it doesn't even really pay it off. Mary's conclusion is honestly just weird and doesn't really make senseI know Yonebayashi can do good character work.

A significant element is the wonderous and amazing nature of magic, which is captured through the beautiful animation of the spells and magic energy.

She follows a cat into a forest and discovers a ""Fly-by-Night flower"" which blossoms once every seven years. Upon picking the flower up, the flower engulfs Mary in a bright blue light where a broomstick whisks Mary away to Endor College. This college resembles Hogwarts from Harry Potter as it is a school of magic. But things aren\'t all good here as the headmistress of the school has her own agenda and is using Mary to try and get to the flower.Visuals: A+ *Beautiful...animation that resembles those of the Studio Ghibli films.

Ruby\'s voice was not only cute and emotional when the story needed it to be, but her crying sounded believable too!Film Score: B *Like most film scores, there\'s some repetition and some filler, but overall, this has a lot of really pretty melodies which makes this a lot of fun to listen to both in and out of context of the film.***My favorite track: Mary\'s Theme(How could it be anything but Mary\'s Theme?

Not to be discouraged, some of these employees decided to start a new facility of their own. Now christened as ""Studio Ponoc"", this team of former Ghibli animators, led by Hiromasa Yonebayashi (THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY and WHEN MARNIE WAS THERE) begin their career with MARY AND THE WITCH\'S FLOWER, based on a children\'s book by the late Mary Stewart. The end result could very well be described as basically a ""Greatest...Hits"" of Ghibli as opposed to something that would establish a new identity for the studio, but considering the alternative, which would be a complete extinction of a beautiful form of art, for once, this isn\'t a flaw.Probably the best way to describe this feature is that it\'s a sort of KIKI\'S DELIVERY SERVICE meets HARRY POTTER, with a dash of SPIRITED AWAY, and occasionally PRINCESS MONONOKE, HOWL\'S MOVING CASTLE, as well as CASTLE IN THE SKY for good measure. While MARY AND THE WITCH\'S FLOWER doesn\'t quite live up to the standards of those titles, it is nonetheless a pleasant enough venture. It\'s also refreshing to see an animated feature targeted at kids and adults which goes all-out on being ambitious. In fact, the film\'s action-packed opening scene, in which we see a mysterious girl flee from a burning laboratory on a broomstick while chased by dolphin-shaped watery-like creatures, provides a great start.After this thrilling sequence, we meet Mary (voiced in the English version by Ruby Barnhill), a bored little girl who has just moved to the countryside to stay with her aunt. She\'s friendless, depressed, and even clumsy. The only other person her own age in the town she has recently moved into, a boy named Peter, also rubs her the wrong way: he jokes about her red hair, which for some reason she is sensitive about. While pursuing a runaway cat into the woods beyond her house, Mary discovers both a little broomstick and a glowing flower. Before you know it, she is suddenly transported to Endor College (no, it\'s not a reference to STAR WARS), an elaborate fortress of a university which doubles as a school for witches. She is ""welcomed"" by the school\'s domineering headmistress Madam Mumblechook (Kate Winslet) and scientist Doctor Dee (Jim Broadbent). But things get ugly when she takes a spellbook that doesn\'t belong to her and accidentally puts Peter\'s life in danger. The last act of the movie involves Mary trying to correct her mistake, building to an edge of your seat climax with just enough pyrotechnics and thrills to please any fan of such suspenseful finales.It\'s evident that director Yonebayashi is paying homage to his former master with every scene in his film. More often than not, there are visual references that one will make to classic Ghibli films along with visual touches of its own. Endor College is located on a tall mesa stretching above the clouds, bizarre assortments of chimera creatures abound in cages, and there are also the sort of rubbery, shape-shifting, ooze-like creatures that can be found from HOWL. At one point our heroine crash-lands in the forest, with her broomstick broken in half. And the entire climax involves scaling a massive tree which houses scientific technology. The animation is also as richly detailed and colorful as anything from Studio Ghibli, with the character designs each containing Miyazaki\'s signature style, from the cherub-like faces of the protagonists to the grotesquely proportioned ""caricature"" creatures.Musically, too, MARY AND THE WITCH\'S FLOWER excels. Although Joe Hisaishi\'s musical services are missed, Takatsugu Muramatsu supplies a beautiful orchestral soundtrack with occasional Hammer-dulcimer strummed interludes for good measure. There are times when the director does allow the music to take a back seat and let occasional still shots filled with environmental sounds do the talking instead of spoon-feeding us.Perhaps the only issue with this otherwise enjoyable feature is that it doesn\'t quite achieve the same heights of Ghibli\'s classic films. It might be due to Yonebayashi trying to do a bit too much within 104 minutes or so, but there are a few plot points that feel a bit unresolved. I was unclear about Mary\'s issue regarding her hair, for instance, especially since the film decides to discard it in the second half. Her relationship with Peter also could have used a bit more fleshing out as well -- her sudden shift from annoyance to wanting to rescue him feels abrupt, even for a kid her age. The ending itself, while thrilling, also seems a bit rushed as well. Moreover, Mumblechook and Doctor Dee aren\'t all that scary for being antagonists, and despite Yonebayashi\'s claims that they are ""misunderstood"", all we\'re permitted to see in the film is both characters mostly engaging in despicable acts.Probably the most interesting character in the movie is the one that doesn\'t utter a word, and that is Tib, a black cat who very much resembles Jiji from KIKI\'S DELIVERY SERVICE. He pretty much acts like any ordinary cat would. He meows, prances, acts independently, and mostly communicates with facial expressions. For good measure, Tib even has a girlfriend. Not that the other characters are unlikable by comparison, but these two animals, for some reason, really stand out.Following in the tradition of the Ghibli movies, this movie also employs some well-known actors and actresses to provide the voices for the dub -- only this time, the dub is recorded at England\'s Tambourine Studios, resulting with a mostly British-accented cast. Considering that this is based on a British children\'s book, this provides a nice change of pace, and is arguably all the more fitting for this film perhaps because of that. (None of this is a slight against any of the Disney-produced dubs for the Ghibli library -- they\'re still excellent, warts and all.) Oddly, the only performance that took a while to grow on me was that of Barnhill as Mary (recently seen as Sophie in Steven Spielberg\'s THE BFG). Her voice is a bit grating at first, with the occasional moment of tentativeness, but she gradually steps it up as the film goes on and by the end her Mary grew on me. Broadbent and Winslet are fine in their roles as Mumblechook and Dee, by contrast, while Louis Ashbourne Serkis (son of Andy Serkis from LORD OF THE RINGS fame) speaks appropriately for the role of Peter. Strangely, my favorite performance of the dub might be that of Ewen Bremner as as Flannagan, a pompous fox-like character who chastises Mary for how she handles her broomstick. The Scottish accent is a great fit, and he brings a lot of character. There are a few moments where the lip sync is less than perfect, but not distracting enough to take away from the film. I can\'t speak for the Japanese version, as I haven\'t seen it.In the end it doesn\'t matter which version you watch. MARY AND THE WITCH\'S FLOWER, inferior though it may be to Ghibli, is nonetheless lovely and a great way to spend two hours. Although it does little to set Ponoc apart from the studio it takes inspiration from, there\'s plenty to enjoy.

So maybe keep that in mind the next time you lie. Ghibli wouldn't butcher Peter's hair) The story all ties together towards the end which makes for a very enjoyable ending. (would've been better if they cut Peter's hair) The animation is very nice and was so beautiful I often found myself getting goosebumps. The characters for the most part are enjoyable, (Excluding Peter) although Mary shows very little character development, at least from what I could tell.

The beginning was amazing, very captivating.Story: 6I thought it was very childish, but that makes sense since it is a younger adult film. The characters are alright, but altogether, the story and plot were a bit dull. The story sort of jumps around and doesn't engage the audience.Art: 8similar art to Ghibli, lots of the scenes are quite beautiful.Sound: 10...It has a wonderful soundtrack, which I feel makes up for the story. It goes well placed with each scene.Character: 7There's little character development and the protagonist is a little hard to love. It has a wonderful soundtrack, which I feel makes up for the story.

The style of the animation is very clearly trying to replicate classic Ghibli productions like ‘Kiki’s Delivery Service’ and ‘Castle in The Sky’ as well as other fantasy series, most notably Harry Potter, with concepts like a magical school a child protagonist and environmental themes. For those that are familiar with Ghibli’s...past filmography the film’s similarities may come as redundant however while it may not be ground-breaking, Mary and The Witch’s Flower is still a well-executed, charming adventure that’s worth a watch if you’re a fan of Ghibli, animation or fantasy in general.The movie follows Mary Smith, a young girl with red hair living with her Great Aunt in the English Countryside. While she’s sulking about her apparent talentless and boredom, she ends up discovering a strange flower in the forest that allows her to use magic. This eventually leading her to Endor College, a secret school for witches. While she is initially hailed as prodigy, she eventually realises the Headmistress and her head scientist who run the college may have more sinister intentions for her and the flower.The plot starts off a bit slow but picks up the pace as the plot begins to unfold. Visually the film is very strong, starting with the drab and washed out (yet still very well detailed) landscapes of the English country side to the vibrant colour palette of the Witch College. This is further emphasised with the animation itself, which managed to handle several fast-paced action scenes while still maintaining an expressive amount detail. The different characters and creatures while somewhat generic in terms of designs are well drawn and work well with the scenes that they’re in and it is exciting to see them in the eventual climax. The voice acting for the English dub was also very good, and the fact that they had actors with different regional British accents help adds to the authenticity of the setting.Mary as a character is an enjoyable protagonist. For the most part she feels like an actual young girl with a lot of energy and curiosity to keep her very likeable and easy to route for. I will say however, that she can come as a bit too over dramatic. She is shown to have self-esteem issues, believing herself to be talentless and is bored of her life in the countryside. I actually thought these were good traits since as previously stated, they seem like actual insecurities that a young child would have, making her feel more realistic. This however gets a little too angsty with her continuous monologues about how much she dislikes her red hair and how bad it makes her look. While I can see a young child being a bit self-conscious about something life that, the amount of times that Mary sulks about it makes it feel a little too contrived, especially as the other characters don’t really bring it up beyond a little teasing.This leads to probably the biggest issue with the film. It has a bad habit, especially earlier in the film, of telling parts of the plot as opposed to showing it. This mainly comes in the form of Mary simply talking to herself, explaining what she is doing in certain parts of the plot. This doesn’t ruin the movie however it does feel very unnecessary and does take you out of the film to an extent. It’s especially a shame considering how good the visuals themselves are and could have been used to display the narrative more naturally.With that being said, I really felt the character development of Mary was good and how it tied into the overall theme of the movie: change and transformation. An interesting concept that the film develops is the idea that magic and science are quite similar as opposed to other fantasy stories where the two are portrayed in conflict with one and other. This works as magic in the film is more or less an allegory for the dangers of scientific progress and specifically about unnaturally tampering with the natural world. This is explicitly seen when the Professor is shown experimenting on animals with magic, a clear allegory for scientific animal experimentation.Environmentalism is a common theme in Ghibli films, so I was nice surprise to see a more different take on the topic. I also like that the film is far less black and white about the topic than the majority of Ghibli’s films. Even though they are ultimately in the wrong, the main two villains of the film are not shown to be truly evil. They genuinely believe that their actions will benefit the College and are more misguided than malevolent. The moral greyness is a welcomed addition and gives the film more depth and meaning to its topic.This of course, ties back into Mary’s development. That despite the insecurities she has, she does not need to use magic to change herself in order to be talented or unique. By the end of the film it is her courage and determination that saves the day more than any actual spell. It’s a simple and well executed message that I feel is good for children to here.Despite a few rough patches, Mary and The Witch’s Flower is an enchanting and well animated film that will please those looking for a good fantasy movie. It isn’t up to par with some of Ghibli’s masterpieces, however it is still a charming adventure with a well-developed protagonist and interesting themes. It bodes well for Studio Ponoc and I’ll be interested to see more from them in the future. past filmography the film’s similarities may come as redundant however while it may not be ground-breaking, Mary and The Witch’s Flower is still a well-executed, charming adventure that’s worth a watch if you’re a fan of Ghibli, animation or fantasy in general.The movie follows Mary Smith, a young girl with red hair living with her Great Aunt in the English Countryside.

However, I think there is just a serious problem with the overall message of this movie.  Perhaps it was unintentional, but it\'s still there.Story:This is mainly the thing I have a problem with.  In general this is a fun children\'s adventure story about a little girl who learns that magic is real in the most terrifying way possible and terrible things happen because of it.I think this film would probably be quite nightmarish for some kids, but that\'s not the main...issue.Here is the problem I have here: obviously a lot of the ""magic"" in this story is an allegory for science.  But I don\'t think it really comes off as a cautionary tale about science.  What I think it really comes off as, is a story about how dangerous it is to leave home, expose yourself to new ideas, and look for adventure.  It\'s much better to stay home and be happy with what you have. Ultimately Mary learns that her mother left her powers behind to become a normal girl, and she does the same: she rejects her magical heritage and is content to return to her normal life and the destiny of a normal girl.It just seems like a strange message to give to children.  ""Don\'t believe that you are special.  Don\'t believe in magic.  Just be content with what you have, because believing in fairy tales and trying to do amazing things is scary and turns people into monsters.""It just seems like a very anti-witch message for a movie that bills itself as being about a witch\'s flower.ArtThe art is lovely as usual for this studio.  It would be very hard to complain about the visuals.  Although, I will say, that the overall aesthetic is very similar to (but not quite as good as) Howl\'s Moving Castle.SoundThe music is also very lovely, and compliments the art very well.CharacterThe main character is a young girl who has this attitude that shows up a lot in the main girl characters of books set in some indeterminate time that is after 1850 but before 1910.  She is unhappy with her life and she is going to make sure everyone around her knows that she is unhappy.  It\'s not easy to like her at first, although she does grow on you as the story goes on.Sadly there aren\'t really many other characters in this story who are developed very much.  In particular the boy who becomes fairly significant to the plot later on really doesn\'t get very much development at all.  I really wish that we could have known a bit more about it, since he is one of only two human characters in this movie.  I think he he\'d been more of a real character, the whole thing would have been a good deal deeper and had more character development.EnjoymentIt\'s a fun movie to watch but it just leaves you feeling a bit hollow at the end.Overall:These kinds of stories are best when they let you dream about something that isn\'t real, or when they teach a child a lesson, but I feel like the major lesson that Mary learned was to stop daydreaming and grow up, because the thing that made her special was bad, which is a pretty boring and hollow message for a film like this to have.Go watch Howl\'s Moving Castle again instead. issue.Here is the problem I have here: obviously a lot of the ""magic"" in this story is an allegory for science.

The characters were unique and out of the box, yet near the end of the movie you begin to feel short changed by the story. You're left with feeling like something was missing.

This was their first movie and other than the art style, it reminded me a lot of Ghibli's classics such as Totoro, Laputa, Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke and because of this, I quite enjoyed the movie.It will be interesting to see what Studio Ponoc will come up with in the future.

Natsuyuki Rendezvous,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13585/Natsuyuki_Rendezvous,"['Love. The four letter forbidden word. What is it really? Is it an idea? Is it an expression? Is it a feeling? Perhaps it\'s something that all of us feel like it must be part of us because it\'s the central theme of human life. No but, seriously, think about it.In a nutshell, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is a rare romantic josei series presented by Noitamina. In fact, Noitamina is known to present all sorts of unique and strange series that expands beyond the typical male audience such as the original [C], the musical Nodame Cantabile, the horror Shiki, and the ghostly story of Anohana. Ah...yes, speaking of ghost stories, that brings us to Natsuyuki Rendezvous.The series has three main characters. First, there\'s a delicate flower named Rokka Shimao who owns a flower shop. She is the manager but more importantly, the widow of the deceased husband of Atsushi Shimao. Then, there\'s Ryousuke Hazuki who has poor eye sight but knows a delicate flower when he sees one. As one might expect from the pilot episode, he is in love with the flower manager. Last but certainly not least is Atsushi Shimao. He is a ghost who has been haunting the flower shop, or more specifically his wife for the past three years. Talk about stalking on a whole new level.Three main characters, two of them guys and one of them a gentle flower. What do we get? Well, by common anime logic, a love triangle obviously. It\'s quite a peculiar love triangle too especially with the given circumstances. Rokka still grieves for the ghostly husband that have continued to haunt her for the past three years without her knowledge. Shimao is there but unable to cope with his former wife either mentally or physically. Hazuki-kun is trying to get the attention of his dream girl but can\'t seem to do so with his conflicted ideology.Now, pause and stop reading this review. Do you still want to continue watching the series? That\'s a tough question to ask especially in the beginning since there\'s already conflict and animosity between the two main male characters. Ah, love is so damn complicated.At any rate, this series is lighthearted and presents romance in a more realistic as well as naturalistic way despite the supernatural theme added in. But the real challenge is, can Hazuki-kun flower the pot? It\'s hard to say especially with interference from a certain ghostly someone. That being, the troll husband Shimao. But more than that, this series seems to have a rather slow pace especially in some of the later episodes. A slow paced romance series is never good especially fans into more intense drama. Bring on the intensity? No. It\'s more like bring on the slice-of-life feel. So, anyone looking forward to some intense drama in this series might be disappointed.Despite this though, I do find some aspects of the series to be well executed. The rivalry between Hazuki-kun and ghost Shimao is a dynamic focus in the series. They are like eternal rivals, like cat and mouse, like mongoose and cobra, like ying and yang. Without them, this series would probably make you fall asleep. But with them, realism and amusing twists in the form of supernatural romance comedy is bought forth into the eyes of the viewers presented courtesy of Noitamina.As being a josei anime, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is crafted out of simple artwork that is expressive and naturalistic like the plants of the flower shop. Life is natural and so is love, so why shouldn\'t the artwork be of the same? The beautiful flora backgrounds and some of the key visuals maintains that josei and lighthearted feeling that defines the rhythm of the series.Speaking of rhythm, the music seems to continue with that in the form of a lighthearted soundtrack. The opening song, ""See You"" by Yuya Matsushita is sung softly but with empathy and with feeling. It presents some of the characters and their ways of struggle in not only life but also in death. The title of the song serves as a form of symbolism as Shimao sees Rokka every day but seems so far away. He\'s dead but still can\'t seem to move on to the afterlife to enjoy his days.In the end, we should look ourselves and treasure  every day we breathe in and out. Losing a loved one is never ever easy, more so in this series as the person you once knew still continues to stand besides you but seems so far away. People views it in different ways. Some shed endless tears. Some tries to move on like in Rokka but continues to struggle every day. And some just moves on flawlessly. What binds this emotion is once again the four letter forbidden word, “love”. It might seem normal but not in the case of Natsuyuki Rendezvous as love binds the ghost of tomorrow in the form of Shimao. Love here, love there, but will a viewer love this series?To me, this series can be enjoyable at a realistic level. It has the soft rhythm and slow pace that can be relaxing to watch. And of course, being dual tagged as supernatural and josei is quite a rare case in today\'s anime series. Most cases you see these days are series tagged “action, romance”, “ecchi, romance”, “horror, romance”, “school, romance”, dot dot dot. Along with that, lighthearted soundtrack and the simple yet realistic artwork defines Natsuyuki Rendezvous at its finest form. Despite this though, there are flaws in this series. The pacing, conclusion, and focus are a few to name. Along with that, it\'s painful to watch Hazuki-kun struggle on in the subsequent episodes that may make us facepalm ourselves a few times. But, I hope you don\'t facepalm yourself and enjoy this series.All in all, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is an anime that is difficult to be loved. Yet, it has its moments that are enjoyable.

The one who departed...or the one who was left behind""//Before giving me a non-helpful tag please read the review. //After finishing Sakamichi no Apollon, I wondered if there was another josei anime who would make the same impact on me...and I know now for sure I found it. If else, it had made a hole different one.Natsuyuki Rendezvous is a beautiful work. The story, the art, the characters, the music, the production and direction...every thing is  balanced prefectly.There´s so many things that are remarkable about this show:a grieving couple that shares everything...not knowing it, the loneliness of being together and appart at the same time, the fear of moving on, the untasteful way of living everyday without a purpose, the pain that comes when you don´t know if to leave or to stay.The characters: ""as long as there is love, someone´s going to be hurt"". We´ve seen that along the way God-know-how-many-billion-hundred-times on different series. Yet, this is one of the few times it felt it so real.  Their actions, their selfishness and the way they behave arround each other is so full of mistakes that it makes you want to scream at them. Yes, it is, and it keeps being that way during the hole thing (I mean it). BUT, even if they do things at a brand-new level of wrong, it´s clear that if it were you who were there, you wouldn´t know either, because when it comes to love there´s no right nor correct answers. That´s one of the things which makes us humans, and that is, for sure, one of the major lessons (if you want to name it that way) of this anime.Another plus of this series is the music. The OP and the ED are so full of messages and blend so well with the story. Each one gives us the side of the story of each part: the OP reflexes Shimao (Rokka´s late husband) and Hazuki´s feelings,while the ending gives you the feelings and thoughts of Rokka.If you´ve reached this point on the review I know you´ve wondered if I liked it or not.Answer: yes, I do. But,  I won´t tell you to watch it if you´re looking for something, ´cuz, as we all know, surprises on life come when you´re not looking for them.So, shall we move on  to the first episode? not knowing it, the loneliness of being together and appart at the same time, the fear of moving on, the untasteful way of living everyday without a purpose, the pain that comes when you don´t know if to leave or to stay.The characters: ""as long as there is love, someone´s going to be hurt"".

Some believe the dead come back to the world while others believe the dead stay amongst\' us due to  unjustified deaths or unfinished life works.The love triangle of Natsuyuki Rendevous left me with a feeling somewhat disappointed, not because of the story, but because of slow progression and lack of fill.The major problem I saw with the story was how the writers invested so much time into the Shimao and Hazuki body swaps. The first few episodes were fair,...but after that everything went downhill filling viewers minds with a fairy book world and little real world interaction. Even based on the dialog the ending was predictable, and I wasn\'t even the least bit surprised with Shimao not moving on. The tales of Thumbelina and The Mermaid could have been summed up into a couple episodes without killing half the series. Getting Hazuki to realize how much he wanted ""The Manager"" could have been done without useless information.I wasn\'t too fond of any of the characters. To me, if you believe that you see the dead or follow acts of spirit possession you should be locked up with the white suits. These three were generally cute as you might call it.  I feel Hazuki could have confessed much easier without seeming like a stalker however and by stalker I mean being everywhere possible where Rokka was.The animation was really the only strong point for me, I wasn\'t happy with the way everything else went. Im a huge fan of non norm animation styles and colorful representations. While not liking what I call the ""Fairy-tale Book"" arc I kept going because the colorful representations. But josei and shoujo animators aren\'t far off, the demographic isn\'t that wide. Typically you see big and bright eyes and over exaggerations of what women should look like in both josei and shoujo genres. On the other side of genders its usually pretty boys.I have nothing particular to say about the opening and ending themes. They were performed very well, I tend to skip both in everything I watch, I\'m just not a fan.Unfortunately, I lost interest mid way though, I really only found enjoyment out of the first few episodes and Natsuyuki Rendevous ended up being a disappointment. but after that everything went downhill filling viewers minds with a fairy book world and little real world interaction.

It may be a josei. It may even be billed by the creators themselves as a romantic story. But the way I see it, this series is simply not meant to be a traditional romance, regardless of how it\'s being sold.Natsuyuki Rendezvous, simply put, is a story about life and death. Love is used as a theme in order to make the story more understandable and easy to relate to, but at its core this anime focuses on...the aspects of living and dying and loving while living and dying more than anything else.Although it\'s easy to interpret this series as the love story between two characters, Hazuki and Rokka, I tend to believe that it is actually more about Shimao and Rokka and their relationship before and after Shimao\'s death. After all, there are probably more flashbacks shown of Shimao and Rokka\'s life together than of Hazuki trying to woo Rokka, or even of Hazuki and Rokka spending any time together. When you see this anime as Hazuki\'s story; told from Hazuki\'s perspective, it becomes very confusing and at times, uninspired. But it\'s when you see this as being told from Shimao\'s point of view that everything begins to make sense. Hazuki is simply the catalyst; Shimao is the one this series really revolves around.Which brings me to the main point of my review.At first glance, Shimao is an easy character to dislike, or even hate. He seems selfish and spiteful, only hell-bent on keeping Rokka to himself even after he has died. However, if one looks deeper, Shimao becomes quite complex. No one could possibly know what it feels like to be dead, yet able to watch over the one you love. ""Out of sight, out of mind"" would probably be the concept one would fear most in a situation like this, yet Shimao refuses to give up on Rokka. This determination comes not out of selfishness, but deep, unconditional, perhaps even irrational love. It\'s love that made Shimao a little selfish, a little crazy, and a little possessive. But it\'s also love that made Shimao able to set Rokka free in the end.Rokka is innocent and naive, not like a child, but in the way that only a young woman who has already gone through so much pain can possibly be. In many ways, the world of love is completely foreign to her. Shimao was like her other half, and they fit together so perfectly and naturally that Rokka wasn\'t even aware of what they had was half the time. When Hazuki enters her life, Rokka is so unaccustomed to being sought after that she continues to reject his advances, even after she knows she has fallen for him.And finally, Hazuki, the catalyst. In many ways, Hazuki is not the idealized character we\'ve come to expect in romances. But then again, as I mentioned, this really wasn\'t a romance in the first place. Hazuki represents a symbol of new found hope in Rokka\'s life. He\'s rough and unpolished, but he\'s enough to make her happy again. In my opinion, Hazuki would never replace Shimao completely in Rokka\'s heart. Yes, Rokka loves him and cares for him deeply, but he will forever be the reason Rokka was finally able to move past the pain of losing her true love. Hazuki is the catalyst to repairing and concluding the relationship between Rokka and Shimao, and in many ways he ""saves"" Rokka from despairing for the rest of her life. But he isn\'t the one who was able to set Rokka ""free"". Only Shimao had that power, and when he finally uses it, Hazuki is able to support Rokka and get her back on her feet.What happens after we die? Do we simply close our eyes for the last time and slumber dreamlessly for eternity? Or will we come back to watch over the ones we love? What if the ones we love cannot move past our death? And what if we\'re the ones who cannot move past our own death?At the end of the day, those are the questions Natsuyuki Rendezvous tries to answer. It doesn\'t do this perfectly, nor is it without some flaws. But I\'ll affirm wholeheartedly that this series made me cry. It made me rethink the meaning of life and death, and life after death.And perhaps, it also made me wonder about *love* after death. the aspects of living and dying and loving while living and dying more than anything else.Although it\'s easy to interpret this series as the love story between two characters, Hazuki and Rokka, I tend to believe that it is actually more about Shimao and Rokka and their relationship before and after Shimao\'s death.

And to be honest i'm surprised I enjoyed it as much I did because romance animes aren't really my favourites.Anyway the story focuses on the relationship between a flower shop owner and her new part-time employee that has been admiring her from afar. If it was just this I myself would...be a little disappointed but then they throw in the fact that the owners late husband is haunting her and her admirer is the only one that can see him, the ghost husband tries everything in his power to keep his wife. (I won't reveal anymore as it will reveal to much about the stories major plot points) .the music and art work are also extremely beautiful and you are just taken away into a new world. I don't really have any negatives about it but some episodes suffered from a lack of pace which did not bring the story forward. Nut it all pays off in the end of the conclusion leaves no questions unanswered and is one of the most romantically moving endings I have ever seen since I have been watching anime.Trust me you will need tissues at more than one point during the series.Anyway just please go and check it out it's one of those amazing underappreciated animes that are the best to watch. be a little disappointed but then they throw in the fact that the owners late husband is haunting her and her admirer is the only one that can see him, the ghost husband tries everything in his power to keep his wife.

From the color palette, with...brushy textures, fresh spingtime greens and friendly yellows to the entire relaxed athmosphere. Too soon to place any bets yet, considering first impressions this looks like a happy ending kind of show, but one that will definitely walk around the usual boring love story routine. Because....The male lead,  Hazuki, looks like the average ""loser"", falling in love with the pretty short black haired widdow to whom he is too shy to confess. He is composed, he looks like he doesn\'t give a damn about anything, and he looks like he\'s the type to quit before really trying. Or maybe not: what makes this character particular is the fact that he proves not to be that easy to anticipate and he overcomes the ""danger"" of becoming that kind of annoying guy who can\'t take the challenges. Hazuki is the kind of character that grows to be loved by the viewers, being bitter but realistic, bored but passionate, limited but resourceful.It seems the creators managed to avoid the clichee of the love being confessed only in the end, and that this show will actually focus on the ""war"" between Hazuki and the ghost husband. Far from being a comedy tho, it does have some intelligently hilarious moments in the scenes that contain the both determined guys, one dead and one pretty much alive.Sadly, Rokka, the female lead, didn\'t make a too big impression. She\'s playing the sad kind widdow, but at least without being annoying, didn\'t look like anything too deep. But then again, for an 11 episode summer show I think anything else would have been too much and unnecessary.Another strong point of this show would be the animation and the art. The character\'s gestures and poses is something that hits you from the first few minutes as they emanate grace where needed and they express the character\'s attitude very good - talking about body language. I can\'t say if that\'s something you often see in josei shows, but here in particular shows that a lot of attention has been put into these kind of details.If this will be a good story or not - we will see. But either way, it looks promising and flowlessly executed. brushy textures, fresh spingtime greens and friendly yellows to the entire relaxed athmosphere.

The title itself is not misleading, this is one quality anime that doesn\'t follow your typical run of the mill entertainment, though it still has the usual restless spirit thing that come with this  anime and so as someone who can let go. It may have some similarities with ""AnoHana"" and Tasogare Otome, it cannot be compared with it, one, is that unlike ""AnoHana"" this one is more...of seinen, as for ""Tasogare Otome"" well it does had a bit of a dark side but only  in a subtle note where Shimao is having some thoughts of bringing Rokka to the afterlife, good thing he didn\'t or o else he\'ll end up in hell and Hazuki get\'s to go to jail. Then again ""Tasogare Otome"" is more of a dark comedy side than with this one. Also, since there is competition between Shimao and Hazuki to be with Rokka this anime minus well have a reverse harem in it. So for the story I\'ll give it an ""OUTSTANDING"" number 10, co\'z the story is more of soap opera standards than an anime.Art: Mediocre 5.I\'m not an art critic, but.....I would have prefer that Rokka has long locks that short hair, kind makes her look like a man, a very beautiful man that is.Sound: Good 7.Since I like the opening theme.Characters: OUTSTANDING 10.Ok, so far for the roles of the characters really did play up, I really like that there is this sotacon arc that exist between Rokka and Hazuki since Rokka is 8 years Hazuki\'s senior, but it is kind disappointing that in the fast forward scene of the final episode where Hazuki has to die ahead of Rokka who is  now a grandma. But It kinda pissed me off that after so many years she still hasn\'t got rid off Shimao\'s stuff and we see Shimao still wondering around only this time he just paid a visit to the shop and it was Rokka\'s grandson who sees him. Also, the moment that Hazuki lead his body to Shimao was for me to ask as to WTF was going on his mind, then again at the end he got his body back and was able to keep Rokka as his wife. So a very beautiful ending.Enjoyment & Overall: OUTSTANDING 10.Ok, I really did enjoy this anime very much and I like that this anime has that soap opera standard that would really make one feel this thing as if you felt sorry for Shimao for having to go ahead of Rokka to the afterlife where both are expecting to live happily. Also there is that thing where I felt sorry for Rokka for not letting go of Shimao which would have been the reason why he can\'t go to the other side, overall Hazuki is very much the happy ending waiting to fill Rokka\'s void and reminding Shimao that her life has to go on, Hazuki really does serves as the overall filler of Rokka and Shimao\'s void, indeed such high rating is what this anime deserves. of seinen, as for ""Tasogare Otome"" well it does had a bit of a dark side but only  in a subtle note where Shimao is having some thoughts of bringing Rokka to the afterlife, good thing he didn\'t or o else he\'ll end up in hell and Hazuki get\'s to go to jail.

I can see Pearl running through the hallways like a whirlwind rushing to class. I only hope to catch her attention for a second just to exchange ‘Hi’s. Stephanie is crying at a train station because of an argument we just had. All I can do is watched through the foggy glass of the train doors. Jayce is sending me a text telling me that she’s willing to go on a second date.Hope, failure and success, are the three memories I feel love leaves us with.I don’t know if I am...just naive or young, maybe both, but the story hit all these notes within its short one cour run. The emotional journey that Hazuki, Shimao and Rokka undertake is a roller coaster, twisting and curving as their fates become intertwined with one another. As the car comes back into the station, my notion of love wasn’t changed, but reinforced by those serpentine tracks.Sometimes a story doesn’t needs to tell something new. The premise of the series isn’t exciting on paper. Hazuki is a young man that happens to fall in love with the owner of a small flower shop, Rokka. He eventually begins to work there as a means to get close to her. As he tries to muster the courage to confess, he meets the spirit of her dead husband, Shimao, who is bent on stopping him.The prospect of a ghost in love is charted territory. The same stands for love triangles and unrequited feelings. But the universality of these themes and their ability to evoke relatable experiences within the audience is what makes them important. These are the hooks that pulled me in and made me much more receptive to the characters and the events that unfolded.It isn’t what the story is telling, but how it’s being told. Fantastic writing is the foundation for an engrossing tale.  The seamless dialogue flowed from one scene to the next. Monologues weren’t overbearing and acted as signposts in the direction the plot was moving. The pacing was slow but it gave the ideas of the series enough breathing room to simmer, resonate, and turn it into something memorable.==========Characters==========The series focuses on the lives of three characters: Hazuki, Rokka and Shimao. There aren’t many others that play a substantial supporting role but considering the brevity of this series, they would serve as distractions. By limiting the size of the cast, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is able to build complex characters that are very believable.Hazuki is a young man who doesn’t seem to have much going for him. His only driving force in life seems to be his feelings for Rokka. As the show progresses we find a man that is deeply in touch with his emotions, with an astonishing lucidity when it comes to understanding others.Rokka on the other hand seems to be a secure and independent middle aged woman that runs her own flower shop. Soon enough her insecurities about her past and her inability to come to terms with her husbands death come to bear. She always seems to be at odds with catching up to the present as her memories threaten to hold her back.Shimao comes off as a selfish ghost that can’t let go of his wife. Every action he takes solidifies this idea of him. But he is just an individual that is struggling between letting go of a world that is constantly trying to pull him back. As with all ghost’s he wants closure, but at the cost of ruining the lives of those that still have it.Each character has their own personal dilemmas to overcome of the course of the story. They not only deal with the ramifications of their actions but are clearly conscious of the reasoning behind them as well. Careful attention to cause and effect is a powerful tool for developing strong characters that learn, grow and ultimately evolve.==========Production==========To be quite frank the art production in the first half of the series isn’t amazing. The bright palette and attention to foreground detail does redeem it slightly, but it is otherwise only serviceable. The second half of the series takes a stark upturn in creativity. The introduction of the storybook world of Shimao creates an interesting collage effect that contrasts the sketches of his realm with the solid colors of the real world. Little details in both settings are highlighted by the differences and give life and vibrancy to each.The opening theme ”See You” by Yuya Matsushita is simple, accented by a piano melody. Matsushita has a strong vocal performance that drives this song. “Anata ni Deawanakereba” by Aimer, is a fitting closing theme that evokes an atmosphere of melancholy. It’s one of my favorite songs in recent memory. I could feel the heartbreak in her voice. Her delivery combined with the fantastic lyrics served as a proper punctuation to each episode.The excellent audio production continues with the great voice acting. Yuuichi Nakamura (Hazuki), Sayaka Ohara (Rokka) and Jun Fukuyama (Shimao) all give great performances that actualizes the well written script. Nakamura is a clear standout as his acting gives a sense of progression as Hazuki develops as a character.==========Overall==========Natsuyuki Rendezvous doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel but gives a story that is easy to relate to. The elements of its tale evoke the summer and all its brightness and warmth. It proves that well written characters and dialogue are sometimes all it takes for a show to succeed. For fans of the Josei or romance, this one rendezvous you don’t want to miss.For more reviews, previews, and anime discussion, check out www.sushigokart.net ! just naive or young, maybe both, but the story hit all these notes within its short one cour run.

I am an architect from the future who has seen basically all the anime airing this summer season. Out of the best, Natsuyukki Rendezvous is the one I must write a review for before I meet up with my peer, JohnTitor.Now, the story of Natsuyuki seems very typical with a supernatural twist. However, it is much more genius than one can expect. How far is the director willing to take the comedy aspects while examining a serious topic. Well,...the directing does take the liberty in making fun of ghosts, and putting up traditional Japanese culture jokes. However, this one is special. While being able to manage a some-what serious drama, Natsuyuki actually explores further than just family values, it goes even to the extent of using symbolic meaningfuls such as flowers, and the imagery of death, rather than say, a pastoral imagery, which it actually also includes, to eradicate the details and justices of this cruel world.I am very touched by the story personally, and I can guarantee that it will to...as long as you don`t mind ghosts getting in your way.The typical developments of characters, ah. What a pleasant way this anime is heading. This is basically a reverse-harem, without the harem part. Two men fighting for women...yet one of them is a ghost, that is what it seems on the surface, yes. However, as stated above, the treasure which subsides in a complex drama as this one deserves not to be spoiled. To put it in a nutshell, though, the characters have matured already when they are introduced. Utilizing a traditional aspect of the shows of the same genres, however, Natusuyuki reveals secrets about each of the characters, bits by bits, by showing flash-backs. And, the suspense which partakes each bits is considerably great.The art, as stated, is josie. Meaning, it is meant for the demographics of women between adolescence and adulthood. But, I claim that tag is bullcrap. This tag has appeared in many shows like Eden of the East, and I can tell you that is more or less a shounen show than anything. Ergo, watch this anime regardless of your age group, sexuality, etc, as long as this anime`s genres, or plot, interests you. Music is fine, and powerful during the correct times.Enjoyable as a romantic comedy can be.Please, I have already written a full version of the review. Do look forward to it when this heart warming anime finishes airing during your time period! Now be a man, and do the right thing!

(Watch Natsuyuki Rendezvous)', ""Keep in mind that this review is going to be pretty spoiler heavy.InfoThis is a prime example of when a great idea and concept is made but then the show just falls flat on its face as it doesn’t fully understand how to utilize the great premise.Natsuyuki Rendezvous is a 2012 anime of only 11 episodes, backed by Doga Kobo it’s a supernatural, romance drama based off the manga of the same name, and it’s so fucking boring!StorySo what is the premise of Natsuyuki rendezvous I hear you ask, well it’s basically ghost cucking. Our protagonist Hazuki has fallen in love with a much older...lady - Rokka - who owns a flower shop. Due to his love for her he stops by the shop daily and buys small potted plants despite owning a very small apartment, because of this his apartment is filled with tiny plants.The point is that eventually Hazuki decides to take up a job at the flower shop in order to be closer to Rokka, however Hazuki eventually encounters Shimao, Rokkas dead husband. He is bound to her apartment which is above the flower shop so he can also be there however no one has ever been able to see him before Hazuki.What follows is Shimao using his ghostly-ness to try and stop Hazuki’s advances on Rokka, eventually he even pulls off some poltergeist and is able to throw objects or make a room shake and the whole time he’s really only able to effect Hazuki as he doesn't want to hurt or upset Rokka and she can’t see or hear him anyway.Now the show starts off pretty interesting, Hazuki tries his best to develope a relationship with Rokka and to his credit he does a great job, the two become close rather quickly and he gets very close to kissing her and at one point possible sex with her however Shimao is always able to at least stop anything big from happening.So this is a pretty neat concept right, Hazuki and Rokka have a budding and interesting romance and there’s this constant Ghost who has entertaining banter with Hazuki and the situation is always weird as we the audience can also always see this ghost. The romance is good, the banter is good and the situations are interesting and there's tons of possibilities. What could possibly go wrong?Episode 4 is what. So the show is going along strong and episodes 1-3 I loved and watch in a single sitting and I bet I would of the got the whole show done in one sitting if it hadn't hit such a hard wall. Episode 4 itself isn’t that bad but the things that happen in this episode set up the downfall and it's because of this episode that I take issue with the show.Throughout the show Shimao (the dead guy) is constantly asking Hazuki to lend him his body, Shimao says he can posses people but only if he has there consent, it's weird how he would know this since he claims up to this point no one has been able to see him so I don't know how he got someone to consent, so I can only assume there's some kind of ghost handbook you get if you die with unfinished business, cause there's really no way for him to know he can do this.Shimao wants Hazuki’s body so he can talk to Rokka and if he's able to do this then he will be able to move on, or so he tells Hazuki at least. His true intentions are a lot more malicious, he plans to permanently take over Hazuki and then continue on with Rokka where he left off, it's pretty fucked up, trying to just move on to a new body.At the end of episode 4 Hazuki, in a drunken state, submits and consents to letting Shimao taking his body and then we get greeted to a scene of Shimao (in Hazuki's body) getting emotional and seeing Rokka and actually being able to make contact with her, this is a good scene and at this point I still had no issues with the show, this is just the thing it needed to spice things up and help the plot more fuel so it wouldn’t slow down however this very thing is what causes all the problem I have with the show later down the line.While Shimao is in Hazuki's body we still get scenes of Hazuki doing stuff and his in some weird alternate world that’s the book world from a book that Shimao was writing but never ended before he died and overall it’s really weird and poorly explained. Overall these scenes are really boring because nothing happens and he also keeps running into different girls that are all just Rokka but she's a fairy or a mermaid of something and doesn't go by that name or know who he is, since they’re just characters in the story that Shimao obviously modeled off his wife.Every time we cut to Hazuki is this world is the worst fucking experience of my life, they go on for way too long have no purpose and don’t forward anything, they’re extremely boring and I can’t find a way that this show was made and people thought it was okay for these scenes to play out the way they do. It’s like Hazuki tries to move a giant pot but gives up because it’s heavy and then Rokka as a mermaid shows up and then Hazuki realises that he loves Rokka so he tried to move the pot again and that's it, but it took like half the fucking episode to show it. Its ridiculous and I absolutely hate this, however right away it’s not all bad.Seeing Shimao in Hazuki's body is actually super interesting, the way Shimao has to try and act like Hazuki and can’t easily completely do what he wants to. He’s so close to his old wife and yet he can’t actually do anything about it, he isn’t fully back, she can still only see him as hazuki. This all comes to a head when he straight up asks her is she loves him of course she thinks hazuki is asking this question and answers with a yes admitting that she has fallen for hazuki however Shimao is the only one who receives this information and of course hazuki doesn’t get to know it.Now up to this point I’ll admit that while I still hated the hazuki parts I was overall still enjoying the show as a whole however the Hazuki sections begin to get even worse as they begin to kinda consume the show, I’m not really sure why this is but rather then shorten the lengthy and pointless hazuki sections down they start to make them longer and almost the focus. While yes hazuki is our protagonist, he’s not what made the show interesting and by himself he actually works really horribly, he works best when he has someone else to bounce off, but I’ll come back to this later basically these sections don’t work because they’re mostly useless and feel like filler. Cutting them back so they took up less time and thus hit the important points more often and had less fluff would of been the much better part and while I can’t remember for sure I’m pretty sure there's an entire episode in the book world with hazuki and it’s just… pain.Eventually we start to learn some more about Shimao’s past which is kind of a mix between the book world and real world that helps us piece things together, turns out he got cancer and was writing the book hazuki is now in when he died, he never got to finish it or something like that. Now while this is a kinda cliche thing it can be done right, ‘Princess Tutu’ uses this as the basis for the entire show to exist and that show is freaking amazing and while it has a few episodes early not that aren't super interesting it never gets as boring as this done and that's because it doesn't do anything interesting with the book world.It also never explains how Hazuki gets into the book world or how it even works or what rules it's run by, which is weird because they spent a lot of time in there and it's clearly an important part of the plot and if they spent more of the time in there explaining what it is or how it works, then maybe it would've been slightly better. Plus these Shimao backstory parts are also boring as dirt, they move so slowly and have a bunch of still or barely moving shots and I feel like the show might be trying to be deep or moving but it's just too much of a slog to really be able to pull it off in any way shape or form.Anyway eventually Shimao tells Rokka what's going on or she figures it out I can't exactly remember but either way, she knows. And then Hazuki comes back to the real world as a ghost that only Shimao can see and this is all also never really explained at all, it's super fucking weird and also not interesting in the slightest. You may think I'm going on about this stuff for too long but it seriously is some boring crap, don't watch this show it's crazy how much of a wall it hits. Anyway in the end it's a happy ending or something. The show had put me through so much boredom that at this point I didn’t care about the characters in any way by the end and so I just kinda watched it to be done with it.CharactersHazukiHazuki isn't an interesting protagonist, he’s a rather boring person who has lives a mostly boring life and is so useless that he buys flowers everyday despite living in a god damn apartment just cause he likes the girl there, like just talk to her dude.Either way the main reason that Hazuki is able to work as the protagonist is because of the way he interacts with those around him, he has a serious kinda dead pan way about him and doesn't get easily agitated.The interactions between Hazuki and Shimao are at the core of the original premise and some of the interesting stuff, after all Hazuki is the only one who can see Shimao and so Shimao will constantly be floating around or trying to annoy Hazuki and make him slip up and the way Hazuki and Shimao have small banter sessions at each other is fun to watch as Shimao is kind of dick and Hazuki can't really do anything in response.Hazuki's interactions with Rokka are also good because he's like a completely different person when he’s with her, he clearly cares about her and wants to be with her and it's shown multiple times in many different ways in the early good part of the show. Early on in the show we get very few to no scenes were Hazuki is by himself and there's good reason for that, he's always interacting with someone so that he isn't just some brooding guy.When he's trying to forward his relationship with Rokka but Shimao is also there shit gets interesting and this is when the shows is the most enjoyable to watch and what got me into it originally, SO THEN WHY THE HELL DO THEY LEAVE HIM ALONE IN THE BOOK WORLD!Okay they don't really leave him alone, he's always interacting with a different rendition of Rokka as I've stated before but for some reason she's like, kinda dead inside or something. She doesn't have much to say or is super cryptic and it mainly is just a bunch of boring stuff, it's not really Rokka and Hazuki knows that so he has no reason to try and forward the relationship and these side Rokka’s usually go away after an episode or two so they don't develop or really matter in any meaningful way and it's because of this that it’s not the same as in the real world where he has a real goal that's tangible and he knows how to get it while facing an obstacle that only he and the viewer are able to understand and that isn't easily removed. Nothing means anything in the fucking book world.And now I've just spent more time complaint about the premise of the show but really there's not much to say about Hazuki, he loves Rokka, hates Shimao and is useless and the source of my pain once in the book world.ShimaoShimao is a weird character and an interesting one for me to talk about while not interesting himself. Not at first he's basically the villain since he is the obstacle to the protagonist's goal but for some reason he kinda ends up becoming the protagonist by the end, not only does he take over Hazuki's body but his backstory becomes a huge focus.After all he constructed the book world since it's a book he wrote while he had cancer and so we get a bunch of flashback stuff to before he was dead and he was quite different back then in reality, he was much more nice and sweet and overall he seemed happy where in his ghost state he just seems depressed and even when trying to act caring or panicked he just seems dilated and emotionless.The problem here is that sweet and caring dude who has cancer and that we know is going to die doesn't make for a good or interesting character, it makes for piss boring shit as he just spouts generic crap in a way to maybe make the show feel deep or something, I'm not really sure why they do it cause it sure as hell isn’t interesting.The other issue with having him take control of Hazuki and basically become the focus of the show if the fact that this then means that there is no villain in the show, nor is there any real conflict, as I said the juxtaposition of all of these characters and there various relationships and how they all play off each other is key and while you can still create a dynamic like that and take people out of it, you can't in this show specifically and that's a for a few reasons.Firstly it's all the show has going for it, if you stuff it up then you got nothing interesting left to show and so you'd have to be careful with removing someone from the dynamic of changing there situation so drastically that they're not even in the same god damn world. And also because it's a fucking trio, destroy the trio and you have only two damn people left and that's very bad for the dynamic as you just can't have as much going on between two people it also doesn't help that Hazuki really was the heart of it and while Rokka still thinks he is there he's not and it ruins the whole thing.Maybe I'm just repeating myself at this point but I really did enjoy the show a lot at first and it just went and ruined itself hard.RokkaSo now let's talk about Rokka, the love interest of Hazuki and Shimao's ex-wife. Now she's meant to be a pretty interesting character because she's still dealing with losing the love of her life while falling in love with this much younger boy and the whole time she's still running this flower shop that was Shimao's dream in the beginning anyway.Now, Rokka is interesting early on, since her juxtaposition is indeed interesting and how she deals with it seemed very real and like the natural progression for her character to take and the fact that she can't see Shimao really helps Shimao and Hazukis interactions shine, after all Shimao can do some crazy stuff and Rokka has no idea about any of it.However she's kinda bland outside of that and it becomes a serious issue once Hazuki is gone. She's meant to be bland anyway, she's meant to be the pretty normal person in all of this while Hazuki and Shimao do all the real interesting stuff, she's just a means to an end off the show, used to set things up despite not actually really being the one who does, she's the reason things happen without actually being the exact reason things happen, if that makes sense.This causes her character to fail completely once the focus shifts and it really is a shame since before that I was somewhat kinda liking her character despite the obvious blandness she presented. Doesn't help that Rokka doesn't fucking change or grow at all. Yes she does eventually fall in love with Hazuki however as soon as she finds out that Shimao has taken over Hazukis body she reverts right back to being in love with him again.Now I know it might be considered normal to fall in love with your dead partner if they come back in the body of the new person you love, but I feel like it's not. Now obviously we can't know but Rokka does truly fall in love with Hazuki and I feel like if that happens you truly have to be over you old partner to a serious degree and I know there's the always loving them and crap but if they come back wouldn't you at least be a little weirded out.Instead Rokka reverts back to fully loving him and sitting around just being with him and then he has to go and Rokka gets all upset about it again cause she has to say goodbye again and it's just like why did you even come back you dumb fucking ghost, you didn't change anything, you just made the show worst’ so Rokka ends up basically having some kind of reset button pushed if you will and now she has to try and get over him all over again and I'm sure this only hurts Hazukis current relationship with her to a great degree.Her character design is also god awful, I know there are people like this out there I'm sure but she has a huge forehead and her hair is done in such a way that really fucking shows it and my god it doesn't look good, her eyes are also done in a weird way that doesn't complement the rest of her design and that doesn't help her, especially when the eyes are right below the god awful forehead.It doesn't look good and it took me a while to even get use to seeing it cause most of the time it's just a really off putting look to look at normally, I don't know what exactly it is but something about it makes me have trouble looking at it even though I've seen shows that are arguably much worse in this area and have no issue with it.Overall all the characters are bad on their own or eventually devolve to that state due to the story writing them into situations that don't work for them or flatter them very well. But this is going on for too long and I’m really just starting to repeat myself and getting more angry plus I really just wanna get this done. But hey at least there's no chance of it being longer than my New Game! Review.PresentationThis is gonna be fast, you see all aspects of the presentation can be summed up in one word. Generic. The animation is generic to the standard animation that doesn't really do anything or special I guess the book world does mix it up a little but it’s a blending of styles that first of all doesn't even look good. Secondly it’s been done a million times so it’s not like the show is special or breaking new ground and lastly it’s just a still frame that the characters look really weird in front of, it’s like when CGI is used and looks weird cause its a 3D model. Well the 2D characters look weird in the book world because they have shading and the bookworld environment doesn't making it lack depth and thus the styles clash way too hard.The animation in terms of actually animating is very low effort, all the movements are simple and only things that need to be done, the characters can spend a lot of time being very still or there mouth is hidden so it doesn't have to be animated when they talk, the camera rarely moves most of the time it just stays still and it’s rare for the characters to move too much. It’s very simple and very lazy and can be a real annoyance as it continues to just stay that way as the show goes on. It’s not exactly horrid, I’d say it’s bearable but still a problem nevertheless.Music and sound effects are basic and unmemorable, I’m sorry but I actually can’t talk about it because of how bland it is, and again very unmemorable, so I don’t even fucking remember it. I guess next is the OP and ED which are also really bad, the OP is bland, slow and uninspiring, the images used are mostly still shots and even before I started hating the show I very much didn’t enjoy the OP, but I watched it anyway cause I’m not a scumbag who skips the OPs. (#ForwardingMyOwnAgenda) It’s slow and boring and I don’t like it, and the ED isn’t much better.The ED just kinda slaps visuals together and I feel like it’s going “Look how I deep I am, I’m only using pretty moving visuals for my ED and pretty music” and while the music is nice and pretty the music doesn’t belong to the anime, music shouldn’t make you enjoy or hate anime or the OPs and EDs, enjoy what ever music you want but what the show does for it is the animation and that’s the interesting part and here it’s just horrid. I could get more meaning out of looking at a kaleidoscope for the same amount of time and I bet I’d have more fun.Ang guess what I can just have the song play in the background because it’s not a part of the anime and I can have it play while I do a number of things better then watching crap, so don’t tell me I’m wrong cause the music is good, that doesn’t matter.The voice acting is also super generic, it’s just what it has to be, no one is really that good but none of it’s really that bad either, well some of it’s bad but some of it’s good too so it evens out and hit a dead average. I said this would be done fast, not much to say about the presentation really.Wrap-UpSo Basically this show is really bad and after those few early episodes there was little left to enjoy from it, I overall regret having watched the show and I hope that if you have read this and can understand why I found the show horrid that you will also avoid it, I think this show is liked by more people then it’s hated by but that's the same for Sword Art Online and Re:Zero so general consensus isn’t a good way to judge something.If you understood what I was saying and don’t like the kind of things I bought up then don’t watch this show, it’s painfully boring and I wish I had known more about it before I jumped in with high hopes, it’s a good concept gone wrong.Overall I have to give this generic piece of crap a 3/10I didn’t enjoy watch it at all in the end, the negatives outweigh the positives way too heavily and those positives are the only reason this isn’t a 2. lady - Rokka - who owns a flower shop. Due to his love for her he stops by the shop daily and buys small potted plants despite owning a very small apartment, because of this his apartment is filled with tiny plants.The point is that eventually Hazuki decides to take up a job at the flower shop in order to be closer to Rokka, however Hazuki eventually encounters Shimao, Rokkas dead husband. He is bound to her apartment which is above the flower shop so he can also be there however no one has ever been able to see him before Hazuki.What follows is Shimao using his ghostly-ness to try and stop Hazuki’s advances on Rokka, eventually he even pulls off some poltergeist and is able to throw objects or make a room shake and the whole time he’s really only able to effect Hazuki as he doesn't want to hurt or upset Rokka and she can’t see or hear him anyway.Now the show starts off pretty interesting, Hazuki tries his best to develope a relationship with Rokka and to his credit he does a great job, the two become close rather quickly and he gets very close to kissing her and at one point possible sex with her however Shimao is always able to at least stop anything big from happening.So this is a pretty neat concept right, Hazuki and Rokka have a budding and interesting romance and there’s this constant Ghost who has entertaining banter with Hazuki and the situation is always weird as we the audience can also always see this ghost. The romance is good, the banter is good and the situations are interesting and there's tons of possibilities. What could possibly go wrong?Episode 4 is what. So the show is going along strong and episodes 1-3 I loved and watch in a single sitting and I bet I would of the got the whole show done in one sitting if it hadn't hit such a hard wall. Episode 4 itself isn’t that bad but the things that happen in this episode set up the downfall and it's because of this episode that I take issue with the show.Throughout the show Shimao (the dead guy) is constantly asking Hazuki to lend him his body, Shimao says he can posses people but only if he has there consent, it's weird how he would know this since he claims up to this point no one has been able to see him so I don't know how he got someone to consent, so I can only assume there's some kind of ghost handbook you get if you die with unfinished business, cause there's really no way for him to know he can do this.Shimao wants Hazuki’s body so he can talk to Rokka and if he's able to do this then he will be able to move on, or so he tells Hazuki at least. His true intentions are a lot more malicious, he plans to permanently take over Hazuki and then continue on with Rokka where he left off, it's pretty fucked up, trying to just move on to a new body.At the end of episode 4 Hazuki, in a drunken state, submits and consents to letting Shimao taking his body and then we get greeted to a scene of Shimao (in Hazuki's body) getting emotional and seeing Rokka and actually being able to make contact with her, this is a good scene and at this point I still had no issues with the show, this is just the thing it needed to spice things up and help the plot more fuel so it wouldn’t slow down however this very thing is what causes all the problem I have with the show later down the line.While Shimao is in Hazuki's body we still get scenes of Hazuki doing stuff and his in some weird alternate world that’s the book world from a book that Shimao was writing but never ended before he died and overall it’s really weird and poorly explained. Overall these scenes are really boring because nothing happens and he also keeps running into different girls that are all just Rokka but she's a fairy or a mermaid of something and doesn't go by that name or know who he is, since they’re just characters in the story that Shimao obviously modeled off his wife.Every time we cut to Hazuki is this world is the worst fucking experience of my life, they go on for way too long have no purpose and don’t forward anything, they’re extremely boring and I can’t find a way that this show was made and people thought it was okay for these scenes to play out the way they do. It’s like Hazuki tries to move a giant pot but gives up because it’s heavy and then Rokka as a mermaid shows up and then Hazuki realises that he loves Rokka so he tried to move the pot again and that's it, but it took like half the fucking episode to show it. Its ridiculous and I absolutely hate this, however right away it’s not all bad.Seeing Shimao in Hazuki's body is actually super interesting, the way Shimao has to try and act like Hazuki and can’t easily completely do what he wants to. He’s so close to his old wife and yet he can’t actually do anything about it, he isn’t fully back, she can still only see him as hazuki. This all comes to a head when he straight up asks her is she loves him of course she thinks hazuki is asking this question and answers with a yes admitting that she has fallen for hazuki however Shimao is the only one who receives this information and of course hazuki doesn’t get to know it.Now up to this point I’ll admit that while I still hated the hazuki parts I was overall still enjoying the show as a whole however the Hazuki sections begin to get even worse as they begin to kinda consume the show, I’m not really sure why this is but rather then shorten the lengthy and pointless hazuki sections down they start to make them longer and almost the focus.

You may think I'm going on about this stuff for too long but it seriously is some boring crap, don't watch this show it's crazy how much of a wall it hits. Anyway in the end it's a happy ending or something. The show had put me through so much boredom that at this point I didn’t care about the characters in any way by the end and so I just kinda watched it to be done with it.CharactersHazukiHazuki isn't an interesting protagonist, he’s a rather boring person who has lives a mostly boring life and is so useless that he buys flowers everyday despite living in a god damn apartment just cause he likes the girl there, like just talk to her dude.Either way the main reason that Hazuki is able to work as the protagonist is because of the way he interacts with those around him, he has a serious kinda dead pan way about him and doesn't get easily agitated.The interactions between Hazuki and Shimao are at the core of the original premise and some of the interesting stuff, after all Hazuki is the only one who can see Shimao and so Shimao will constantly be floating around or trying to annoy Hazuki and make him slip up and the way Hazuki and Shimao have small banter sessions at each other is fun to watch as Shimao is kind of dick and Hazuki can't really do anything in response.Hazuki's interactions with Rokka are also good because he's like a completely different person when he’s with her, he clearly cares about her and wants to be with her and it's shown multiple times in many different ways in the early good part of the show. Early on in the show we get very few to no scenes were Hazuki is by himself and there's good reason for that, he's always interacting with someone so that he isn't just some brooding guy.When he's trying to forward his relationship with Rokka but Shimao is also there shit gets interesting and this is when the shows is the most enjoyable to watch and what got me into it originally, SO THEN WHY THE HELL DO THEY LEAVE HIM ALONE IN THE BOOK WORLD!Okay they don't really leave him alone, he's always interacting with a different rendition of Rokka as I've stated before but for some reason she's like, kinda dead inside or something. She doesn't have much to say or is super cryptic and it mainly is just a bunch of boring stuff, it's not really Rokka and Hazuki knows that so he has no reason to try and forward the relationship and these side Rokka’s usually go away after an episode or two so they don't develop or really matter in any meaningful way and it's because of this that it’s not the same as in the real world where he has a real goal that's tangible and he knows how to get it while facing an obstacle that only he and the viewer are able to understand and that isn't easily removed. Nothing means anything in the fucking book world.And now I've just spent more time complaint about the premise of the show but really there's not much to say about Hazuki, he loves Rokka, hates Shimao and is useless and the source of my pain once in the book world.ShimaoShimao is a weird character and an interesting one for me to talk about while not interesting himself. Not at first he's basically the villain since he is the obstacle to the protagonist's goal but for some reason he kinda ends up becoming the protagonist by the end, not only does he take over Hazuki's body but his backstory becomes a huge focus.After all he constructed the book world since it's a book he wrote while he had cancer and so we get a bunch of flashback stuff to before he was dead and he was quite different back then in reality, he was much more nice and sweet and overall he seemed happy where in his ghost state he just seems depressed and even when trying to act caring or panicked he just seems dilated and emotionless.The problem here is that sweet and caring dude who has cancer and that we know is going to die doesn't make for a good or interesting character, it makes for piss boring shit as he just spouts generic crap in a way to maybe make the show feel deep or something, I'm not really sure why they do it cause it sure as hell isn’t interesting.The other issue with having him take control of Hazuki and basically become the focus of the show if the fact that this then means that there is no villain in the show, nor is there any real conflict, as I said the juxtaposition of all of these characters and there various relationships and how they all play off each other is key and while you can still create a dynamic like that and take people out of it, you can't in this show specifically and that's a for a few reasons.Firstly it's all the show has going for it, if you stuff it up then you got nothing interesting left to show and so you'd have to be careful with removing someone from the dynamic of changing there situation so drastically that they're not even in the same god damn world. And also because it's a fucking trio, destroy the trio and you have only two damn people left and that's very bad for the dynamic as you just can't have as much going on between two people it also doesn't help that Hazuki really was the heart of it and while Rokka still thinks he is there he's not and it ruins the whole thing.Maybe I'm just repeating myself at this point but I really did enjoy the show a lot at first and it just went and ruined itself hard.RokkaSo now let's talk about Rokka, the love interest of Hazuki and Shimao's ex-wife. Now she's meant to be a pretty interesting character because she's still dealing with losing the love of her life while falling in love with this much younger boy and the whole time she's still running this flower shop that was Shimao's dream in the beginning anyway.Now, Rokka is interesting early on, since her juxtaposition is indeed interesting and how she deals with it seemed very real and like the natural progression for her character to take and the fact that she can't see Shimao really helps Shimao and Hazukis interactions shine, after all Shimao can do some crazy stuff and Rokka has no idea about any of it.However she's kinda bland outside of that and it becomes a serious issue once Hazuki is gone. She's meant to be bland anyway, she's meant to be the pretty normal person in all of this while Hazuki and Shimao do all the real interesting stuff, she's just a means to an end off the show, used to set things up despite not actually really being the one who does, she's the reason things happen without actually being the exact reason things happen, if that makes sense.This causes her character to fail completely once the focus shifts and it really is a shame since before that I was somewhat kinda liking her character despite the obvious blandness she presented. Doesn't help that Rokka doesn't fucking change or grow at all. Yes she does eventually fall in love with Hazuki however as soon as she finds out that Shimao has taken over Hazukis body she reverts right back to being in love with him again.Now I know it might be considered normal to fall in love with your dead partner if they come back in the body of the new person you love, but I feel like it's not. Now obviously we can't know but Rokka does truly fall in love with Hazuki and I feel like if that happens you truly have to be over you old partner to a serious degree and I know there's the always loving them and crap but if they come back wouldn't you at least be a little weirded out.Instead Rokka reverts back to fully loving him and sitting around just being with him and then he has to go and Rokka gets all upset about it again cause she has to say goodbye again and it's just like why did you even come back you dumb fucking ghost, you didn't change anything, you just made the show worst’ so Rokka ends up basically having some kind of reset button pushed if you will and now she has to try and get over him all over again and I'm sure this only hurts Hazukis current relationship with her to a great degree.Her character design is also god awful, I know there are people like this out there I'm sure but she has a huge forehead and her hair is done in such a way that really fucking shows it and my god it doesn't look good, her eyes are also done in a weird way that doesn't complement the rest of her design and that doesn't help her, especially when the eyes are right below the god awful forehead.It doesn't look good and it took me a while to even get use to seeing it cause most of the time it's just a really off putting look to look at normally, I don't know what exactly it is but something about it makes me have trouble looking at it even though I've seen shows that are arguably much worse in this area and have no issue with it.Overall all the characters are bad on their own or eventually devolve to that state due to the story writing them into situations that don't work for them or flatter them very well. But this is going on for too long and I’m really just starting to repeat myself and getting more angry plus I really just wanna get this done. But hey at least there's no chance of it being longer than my New Game! Review.PresentationThis is gonna be fast, you see all aspects of the presentation can be summed up in one word. Generic. The animation is generic to the standard animation that doesn't really do anything or special I guess the book world does mix it up a little but it’s a blending of styles that first of all doesn't even look good. Secondly it’s been done a million times so it’s not like the show is special or breaking new ground and lastly it’s just a still frame that the characters look really weird in front of, it’s like when CGI is used and looks weird cause its a 3D model. Well the 2D characters look weird in the book world because they have shading and the bookworld environment doesn't making it lack depth and thus the styles clash way too hard.The animation in terms of actually animating is very low effort, all the movements are simple and only things that need to be done, the characters can spend a lot of time being very still or there mouth is hidden so it doesn't have to be animated when they talk, the camera rarely moves most of the time it just stays still and it’s rare for the characters to move too much. It’s very simple and very lazy and can be a real annoyance as it continues to just stay that way as the show goes on. It’s not exactly horrid, I’d say it’s bearable but still a problem nevertheless.Music and sound effects are basic and unmemorable, I’m sorry but I actually can’t talk about it because of how bland it is, and again very unmemorable, so I don’t even fucking remember it. I guess next is the OP and ED which are also really bad, the OP is bland, slow and uninspiring, the images used are mostly still shots and even before I started hating the show I very much didn’t enjoy the OP, but I watched it anyway cause I’m not a scumbag who skips the OPs. (#ForwardingMyOwnAgenda) It’s slow and boring and I don’t like it, and the ED isn’t much better.The ED just kinda slaps visuals together and I feel like it’s going “Look how I deep I am, I’m only using pretty moving visuals for my ED and pretty music” and while the music is nice and pretty the music doesn’t belong to the anime, music shouldn’t make you enjoy or hate anime or the OPs and EDs, enjoy what ever music you want but what the show does for it is the animation and that’s the interesting part and here it’s just horrid. I could get more meaning out of looking at a kaleidoscope for the same amount of time and I bet I’d have more fun.Ang guess what I can just have the song play in the background because it’s not a part of the anime and I can have it play while I do a number of things better then watching crap, so don’t tell me I’m wrong cause the music is good, that doesn’t matter.The voice acting is also super generic, it’s just what it has to be, no one is really that good but none of it’s really that bad either, well some of it’s bad but some of it’s good too so it evens out and hit a dead average. I said this would be done fast, not much to say about the presentation really.Wrap-UpSo Basically this show is really bad and after those few early episodes there was little left to enjoy from it, I overall regret having watched the show and I hope that if you have read this and can understand why I found the show horrid that you will also avoid it, I think this show is liked by more people then it’s hated by but that's the same for Sword Art Online and Re:Zero so general consensus isn’t a good way to judge something.If you understood what I was saying and don’t like the kind of things I bought up then don’t watch this show, it’s painfully boring and I wish I had known more about it before I jumped in with high hopes, it’s a good concept gone wrong.Overall I have to give this generic piece of crap a 3/10I didn’t enjoy watch it at all in the end, the negatives outweigh the positives way too heavily and those positives are the only reason this isn’t a 2."", ""Talk about a big waste of potential. On paper, Natsuyuki Rendezvous's premise seemed like a unique one in its focus on a love triangle involving a young part-time flower shop worker, his older manager, and the ghost of his manager's dead husband. The dynamics of the triangle involved Ryosuke trying to start up a relationship with Rokka, Rokka learning to move on with her life following her husband's death and Atsushi learning to let go of his attachment to his wife. The series shows some signs of its potential with Atsushi later possessing Ryosuke's body and realizing how short-sighted his actions were with wanting to...stay with his wife, while Rokka starts to slowly fall for Ryosuke throughout the course of the series. The presentation for the series is also quite good with vibrant color, gorgeous scenery shots of locations like the sketchbook world that Atsushi's soul is transferred into and some nice animated sequences coming from Atsushi's presence in the mentioned sketchbook.So with such a unique premise, what could lead me to want to rate it so low? Maybe mostly because of the title's two male leads. While both are supposedly kind and gentle with their actions to attract Rokka, both frequently wind up being jerks with their behavior. Atsushi treats Ryosuke like crap and even considers committing murder later on in an attempt to keep Rokka and Ryosuke apart from one another. Ryosuke isn't much better as he is often insensitive to the desires of both Rokka and Atsushi. The series suffers greatly in the fact that both male leads fail to make any attempt to empathize with one another and try to understand the issues each of them face with their predicaments. The second half of the series remedies this to an extent when Atsushi possesses Ryosuke's body. But by that point, I only cared more for how Rokka was affected by all this instead of the two male leads.Issues with the male leads weren't the only issues I had here. The series is prominently focused on the perspectives of the three central characters throughout their conflict and with exception to one character (who doesn't get enough presence to influence the plot in any way), we don't see any other characters related to the three central ones whom we could get to know so we could better understand and empathize with them. Sure, the sketchbook world allows one a look into the head of Rokka so we could better understand how she views both the men she has attraction to so she is better fleshed out as a character. But the two male leads don't get this kind of focus so I could better relate to them and not perceive them as bad love interests for Rokka.Overall, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is a series that has quite a bit of wasted potential. While having a potentially unique premise for a romance anime and a likeable female lead in the form of Rokka, the unlikeable behavior of the two male leads and a lack of major focus on elements that would allow one to better empathize with them hurt the quality of this series greatly for me. stay with his wife, while Rokka starts to slowly fall for Ryosuke throughout the course of the series.

It's not everyday you stumble across a description like that, I had high hopes of the anime(and let's face it, I needed another josei manga after Sakamichi no appolon), and it didn't disappoint. The story is wonderfully done, it keeps you engrossed so that the 23 minute episode just breezes by. Even with the supernatural touch, the romance has...a realistic and warm feel to it. I'll give the story an  8/10.The art is wonderfully done. It's clean, simple and beautiful, specially the flower arrangements and the shop. The characters are not specially beautiful but still pleasant to look at, and the expressions are very well done. And the animation maintains the same level though all the episodes. 9/10Rokka(the store manager), Shimao(the ghost) and Hazuki(the protagonist) all three of them have very likable characters. Their doubts, reasons, hopes and attachments are all explained, so that it's difficult to dislike any of them. And they have multiple facets to their characters, which are fun to explore. Like for example, from Rokka's memories, Shimao doesn't appear to be a guy who'd get attached to anyone, but that's obviously not the case, or he wouldn't have stayed back as a ghost. For me, the characters are the most important in any josei manga, and I'll give the ones in Natsuyuki Rendezvous a 9/10.The music is probably where the series seems to be lacking a bit... The ending song is very nice but I feel like skipping the opening most of the time. The rest of the soundtrack is nothing extraordinary, but it doesn't feel out of place either. 7/10OVERALL, the series gets an 8/10. A must see for any fan of the genre(and a good starting point for those inteested). It's a thoughtful, beautiful and, of course, romantic story that I'm glad I picked up. a realistic and warm feel to it. I'll give the story an  8/10.The art is wonderfully done.

It was one of those shows where instead of watching it just to talk about it with other people on the internet, and checking the progress bar on at the bottom of the media player to check how many more minutes are left, I watched it because i actually really enjoyed it, and I was captivated.I will list the bad thing out of the way first: low budget, not as bad as Muv-Luv Total Eclipse. Fairly typical for josei though, so I\'m not knocking too much off. The animation is simple and there are no moments where the quality is bad.Now...the good things:The story is very touching. You will definitely come to care a lot for the characters. Hazuki (the male lead) is a likeable guy that seems very down to earth and believable. He is kind of infatuated, even obsessed with Rokka (the female lead) to the point that he seems stalker-ish in a loveable way. As for Rokka, you really do feel pathos for her as she laments over her dead husband in a series of flashbacks him, and you can\'t help but see great strength of character within her as she tries to ""get over"" him. Meanwhile, her dead husband (Simao) watches over her as a ghost, unable to interact with her, but silently observing her, like some kind of guardian spirit. The chemistry between Hazuki and Simao as they both try to fight over Rokka is absolutely hilarious; Simao\'s ""cockblocking"" gets to absolutely insane levels. This anime is a complete adaptation as well, meaning it adapted all of the manga. No crappy ending, it\'s complete and very fulfilling.The soundtrack compliments the touching story as well. I think it\'s definitely clear that a lot of effort was put into the soundtrack. Although admittedly the OP isn\'t particularly noteworthy, I the ED is lovely and the piano music is great; it\'s very calming and fits so well that sometimes I didn\'t even notice it was playing. It\'s a nice contrast from the other stuff this season that is full of garish high pitched singing and synthesised Jpop. (that isn\'t to say I don\'t like the stuff, but it\'s just a nice contrast). Another nice contrast is that there are no highschools in this romance. Everyone\'s a grown up adult, and in the grown up adult world which is ironic given Simao and Hazuki sometimes seeming rather childish when they try to compete over Rokka.Also, another thing I really admire about this anime is its simplicity. There are only four characters in its entirety, three main characters, and one side character. Without a ton of forgettable side characters to clutter the experience, I felt that the story felt very tightly focused. Not for once did I feel bored and waiting for the story to move back to the main characters, because there is literally no-one else. it\'s just Hazuki, Simao and Rokka. Miho, the side character is very minor and never feels like she is intruding on the plot.Finally, the colour palette is pretty glorious. Flowers and botany play a huge role in this anime, and this gives the animators and artists plenty of opportunity to just go all out with the colours. The backgrounds in forests have this beautiful and subtle paintbrush like feel. Each episode is a joy to look at and a visual feast. If only it had the budget to match that artistic merit! Then I would be sad that 10 is the maximum score I can give!In case you do not know, the demographic for the manga and this anime adaptation is ""josei"", so it\'s aimed at women 18-30 years old. But hey I\'m a guy and I enjoyed it.Josei is often neglected, people often skip over it thinking it\'s either for women or the drama is too heavy, but I say that this is a great anime to take a look in if you are a fan or if you are pretty new to josei, and it\'s a great anime in it\'s own right. the good things:The story is very touching.

It is these interactions which keep you watching.Natsuyuki Rendezvous is a very good anime which perhaps at times is sad and at times uplifting but could have been better if the story tried to do less than it did."", 'I really liked the poster and it is 11 episodes only so i decided to dig in finish it quickly, it looks really cute i thoughtthe first 3 episodes or so were really good hazuki was so adorable i liked him i was wondering why it has a score of 7 ?i was kinda guessing what is going to happen but oh well everything just  .. got really twisted and i was like wait-what(?)..the storyits about mainly a ghost of a dead young husband shimao and his widow rokka and the poor young man hazuki who got stuck in their twisted...world, because he just decided to fall in love with rokka, who i think was trying to move onit would have been a nice story if there wasn\'t so much complications really, i dun wanna put any spoilers but seriously the begging was so promising it hurts.YES the Arti loved it that\'s why i decided to watch it, so simple and cute, was deceiving thothe art sighthe soundwas really good i have nothing against itDE charactershazuki, poor lil hazuki that bright lil man i was almost attached, well almost.

I feel that the characters could've been developed a little more.. or at least show a little bit more of emotion. Personally I didn't feel sadness, joy, or pity for any off the characters. The feel of it was just too dull. "", 'There used to be a time when the Noitanima timeslot was synonymous to uncommon stories and quality shows but those good times are now over. Even Noitanima succumbed to the stereotypes and fads that plague modern anime, and thus we get this show. Don’t fool yourselves to thing it isn’t because it came out during the ghost/zombie fad and is nothing more than a rehash of the premise of AnoHana, which also aired in the same timeslot half a year ago.THE STAFF- The animation is also not done by a bigshot studio but rather a minor one called Doga Kobo. These guys haven’t even produced...a single above average show in their whole career, so what the hell are they doing here, collaborating with a top tier production?- The directing is done by Matsuo Kou whose roster is filled with nothing but mediocrities. I sincerely see nothing good coming out of this combo.SPECIFICSSTORYThe premise is about a guy who wants to have a relationship with a widow but the ghost of her deceased husband is still lingering around her life. And he is not the scary haunting type, since tortured souls and animated rotten corpses are presented as moe in anime. He is a bishonen who occasionally doesn’t wear clothes, or has an open shirt so we can feast on his hairless chest. KYAAA fujoshi service! So this ghost refuses to move along to the afterlife because he doesn’t want to leave his wife behind. So when another man tries to take his place in her heart, he gets annoyed. This new man is the only one who can see the ghost, and constantly has it in his way every time he wants to advance past the safe zone with the widow. Imagine a steamy scene where he is about to kiss her but the bishonen ghost appears in front of him making it look like a gay kiss. KYAAA more fujoshi service. Other than that, a lame cockblocker.And that is the whole conflict in this show. What do I think about it? It’s totally boring! Aside from being a rehash and a fad chaser, it also lacks any hook to keep the viewer interested. There is no love triangle or dilemma going on in here to spice things up, since one is alive and the other one is dead. How hard is it to tell whom the heroine will choose? There is simply no motivation to keep watching further.Of course in the minds of the fujoshis there is a lot of interest in how the live dude is going to win the widow’s heart. Maybe the ghost can give him advices on what he knows about her as means to press the proper buttons to win her heart. Maybe it will be somewhat interesting to see how they will open up to each other and reveal… well, hopefully something more than typical stuff. Maybe her grief will come out, the live dude will smile for a few times in his life, and the ghost will move to the afterlife.ENJOYMENTWell, you can stop hoping because the plot is running on convenience and not logic or even free will. All you get is a line of asspulls and the characters acting completely out of sync with what is going on. Imagine the woman getting sick out of nowhere and the ghost runs to tell the live dude to go help her. Yeah, how nice to have an asspull of a disease being the only reason the plot can move forward. How about some free will instead? How about hiring an exorcist? How about telling her the truth instead of letting her think he was stalking her all day and night?For a romance, the story is never character-based and that ruins everything. Every single event is based on the whims of the author and not the will of its characters. For example, while the ghost was still alive, the only reason he proposed to the woman was because he found out about his illness. The only reason he asked for a divorce is because he found out it would be incurable. The only reason the new guy asked her to go steady is because the ghost started getting in his way. Although you can say the characters are simply adjusting to life’s everyday problems instead of acting autistic to their surrounds, it still feels like they are completely passive and weak-willed. The scriptwriters controls them as he likes and not as they should behave.CHARACTERSEven if we put that aside, everything in this show happens without much emotion, since the characters seem to be very cynical about everything. And not just because they are adults who have control over their emotions. They don’t seem to care much even about supernatural stuff like ghosts, or about serious stuff like proposing to marry someone. There is nothing worth anticipating. There is no way to like such passive and weak-willed characters; most people today prefer dynamic and active ones. Not only that, but as the episodes go by the characters become more and more annoying exactly because they don’t care.- The heroine does ridiculous things such as trusting a guy who knows where she hides the keys to the house and when she is in need of help. What kind of mature woman would tolerate a guy who seems to stalk her and talks to thin air? And for someone who is an expert in decorations, her style in clothes is terrible! What is wrong with that hat of hers?- The ghost nags all the time, kicks things and acts like a spoiled brat, surely not something a married adult would ever be. Later on he possesses the live dude and tries to seduce his woman again, while the spirit of the live one is in some dreamland. What is this crap? Mature romance my ass.- And the living dude… well, he doesn’t care or does much; he passively strolls through the events like nothing much matters. Why is he even blocked from kissing the heroine just because a ghost was in the way? Just close your eyes and go for it man.PRODUCTION VALUESIf there is something nice in this show, that would be its looks. The atmosphere is nice for a josei anime, as it takes place in a flower shop with lots of fancy colours, and the two main males are hairless chest bishonens. Of course even that can only mean it is just tired rehash of the same old stuff we get for over a decade. As for the music part, I found it too soft and unnoticed, while voice acting doesn’t excel anywhere exactly because the characters are so cynical.VALUEThe whole thing is basically a ridiculous supernatural ghost romance where common sense flies off the window. I know many who found that awesome in Dusk Maiden of Amnesia but lets be honest here; this is all crap. No sane person would want to spend his life jerking off to hot air… And yes, anti-social otakus are not sane so of course and they would choose hot air as their waifu.I have seen what those who liked the show have to say in its defence and pretty much they all repeat the same thing. “The mature romance of the summer season”. Meaning, just something to watch for the summer and as soon as fall kicks in they will dump it for the next mature romance that comes out. And wait a second, mature? How the devil is it even mature if it has such a retarded story? Ghost romance? Seriously? Is this the legacy of Twilight? Improbable couplings between a human girl and a random undead creature? What is this, did normal romances all of a sudden got dull and beyond salvation? Or perhaps are all modern romance anime totally crap to the point you grab at straws?Ok, how about this? The guy is lost in an accident at sea and everybody think he is dead. His wife grieves for a year but eventually moves ahead in her life and gets into a relationship with another man. So the guy finally manages to return and finds her now in love with another man. Wouldn’t THAT be an awesome hook for a show? What is this bullshit with ghosts? There is no room to create any decent plot. Bring an exorcist and move along with your lives dammit!So in all, it’s a shitty show for fujoshis. The conflict is bollocks, there is no hook to interest you into watching further, the characters are cynical, everything runs on convenience, and the ending is dull and predictable. Go watch Nana instead.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 1/2 (generic)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (pretty flowers)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (average)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 2/10Premise 0/2 (boring right away)Pacing 0/2 (dull)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 3/10Presence 0/2 (annoying)Personality 2/2 (cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (random)Catharsis 0/2 (no free will to get any)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (too stupid to bother rewatching)Memorability 1/4 (nothing special to bother remembering)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 1/1 (pretty flowers)Sound 0/2 (sounds meh)Story 0/3 (feels stupid and does nothing to redeem itself)Characters 0/4 (they are annoying)VERDICT: 3/10 a single above average show in their whole career, so what the hell are they doing here, collaborating with a top tier production?- The directing is done by Matsuo Kou whose roster is filled with nothing but mediocrities.

StoryI found the premise interesting. Romance and the supernatural are frequently paired together,  but I found the premise somewhat fresh. For the most part, the story kept me interested but had its flaws. In a series that focuses on romance the characters are key, so my issues with a couple of the characters subtract from it.2. ArtI think something both fans and detractors can agree on is that that the art in this series is no slouch at all. Whether its the more tame colors of the streets, the vibrant colors of the various flowers in the shop, or the more abstract settings,...everything looks very well-done.3. SoundScore-wise, the use of music is far from frequent, resulting in a more atmospheric feel to the series, which I think works well and highly appreciate. The voice actors did a solid job in their respective roles. The background noise was fairly well-done and quite detailed.4. CharactersThis was, in my opinion, the weakest part of the show, although it isn't all bad. The lead female character felt believable to me, and I enjoyed her interactions with the two male leads. My issues stem from both male characters. For starters, I felt Hazumi was missing something that would make him stand out on a positive note. In my honest opinion, while his character initially interested me, he seemed somewhat bland and kind of unrealistic.  I also didn't completely buy his motivation for pursuing a relationship with the female lead. Either that, or his motivation itself was a little underdeveloped.Another issue I had was with Shimao's evolution as a character.  Part of it felt somewhat unnatural to me. Other than that, I felt the interactions between the main characters was rathet enjoyable to watch.5. EnjoymentWhile the series has its merits, another issue I found was with its pacing. The first few episodes were fine. Most of the last episode was fine. A good portion of the in-between felt kind of sluggish to me. While their are moments of interest in this slower gap, the slow down in the pace did sap my enjoyment at times.OverallIf you are a fan of romance, this could merit a watch. I don't think its the best, but there is much certainly a lot worse shows to spend your time on.If you aren't particularly a fan of the genre, I would actually say that, aside from the pacing, it could still be an interesting watch. everything looks very well-done.3.

What Rokka doesn’t know is that her husband spirit is still there with her. Rokka may not know, but Hazuki does, and, oh, boy, Shimao (the husband) doesn’t make Hazuki’s life easy at all.Art: The art is simply splendid.Sound: The music made the atmosphere perfect for a sad, yet happy, love story.Character: As for the characters, they are probably the...best part of the anime beside the art.Enjoyment: It's very hard to tell if I was happy with this anime or not.

I feel that the series did not put enough effort to making you like the characters and instead focused straight on the drama of the story and made me not care...for the series.The art and animation are middle of the road nothing bad but nothing particularly good either.

I enjoyed some of the visuals on the later part of the story where a few things visually changed slightly.My advice for watching the series is to watch about 3 episodes of the series and if you like it then go and watch the rest if you don't then don’t bother with it.

This anime is a good example of how far our 'love' can go. From our first meeting, and even further, even until we die, our love still stands it's hold. The story itself is beautiful. I really love this anime.The Story 10/10--------The story starts of where a woman, 'Rikka Shimao', who's husband died from an illness. Then comes a man, 'Ryousuke Hazuki', who is eight years younger than Rikka (i think), who then falls in love with her. After that, he then asks if...he can work at the florist shop where Rikka works at. While helping Rikka, he then sees a man beside her and thought that the man was her boyfriend. Suprisingly, the man was Shimao! Rikka's dead husband in a ghost form. The story then continues on after that.This plot certainly is great and most unique i have ever seen! *yes I wrote it myself because I was too lazy to copy from MAL's desc*Art 9/10--------There's not much to say about the art. It is very nice to be quite honest, nothing out of the ordinary.Sound 9/10--------Yea, I'm pretty sure no one cares about the sound that much.Character 10/10--------This is interesting. The characters are very unique and gave me the feeling to want to see more of what happenes next after the ending.Enjoyment 10/10--------Really enjoyed this anime!

I opened Crunchyroll late at night and expected to watch a short and cute anime after watching My love Story.BOY. I cried at every single minute. At the time, my boyfriend was diagnosed with a tumor but didn't want to tell me, I just grabbed my iPad one day and I noticed he left a tab open about Cancer. Since he didn't wanted to tell me I still wasn't sure about the tumor at that time. Something was just wrong and he was being too quiet. That's why I was watching a ton of romantic anime, he...was being too cold and distant and I was so worried about our relationship that I wanted to feel something nice about love.So this anime dehydrated me.Some other people have rated this 6 o 7. It might be too soft, too slow at times, but I, with that experience, was feeling every scene. Sometimes I felt chills. I cried by several minutes after finishing every episode, even the cute ones. My pilllow was soaked in my tears.But this anime had super cute and funny moments that made me feel good. I often laughed while crying because it is that awesome. Life goes on and you have to care for yourself no matter what. It really helped me to mature a little bit about my situation at the time.My boyfriend told me about the tumor the day before the surgery to remove the bastard. It was in the morning and I was still getting ready to go to work. He broke in tears while holding me. I didn't know what to expect after that surgery. Whatever happened I was ready to support him. Everything went fine and we are still very happy, thou, there's a chance for a tumor regrow, so we will live with the cancer shadow forever.The lesson: enjoy every moment with the people you love.You have to be very mature to enjoy this anime. Like in your 30s or something. Maybe past 25s. It's worth a rewatch. was being too cold and distant and I was so worried about our relationship that I wanted to feel something nice about love.So this anime dehydrated me.Some other people have rated this 6 o 7.

It was in the morning and I was still getting ready to go to work. He broke in tears while holding me. I didn't know what to expect after that surgery. Whatever happened I was ready to support him. Everything went fine and we are still very happy, thou, there's a chance for a tumor regrow, so we will live with the cancer shadow forever.The lesson: enjoy every moment with the people you love.You have to be very mature to enjoy this anime. Like in your 30s or something. Maybe past 25s. It's worth a rewatch."", ""A dead husband spirit still wanders his old place, because he is too attached to his wife. Sounds creepy but romantic.

When you think you've seen all kinds of romance animes, full of cliches and love triangles, this comes with a twist.Hazuki in love with Rokka, works part time at her shop, to try and form a relationship between them, only to find out that Rokka is widowed and her husband's spirit still lives at her house! The interesting thing is only Hazuki seems to see him.It's refreshing to see the leading female character with short black hair and i like the idea of how it'll explore what it's like to move on from losing...someone you love. The art is quite beautifully done too.I look forward to see what happens. It'll be interesting to see how the characters interact, whether Hazuki can be in a relationship with Rokka and what Rokka will do. someone you love.

Some parts were out-of-place didnt get how that was related to the main story.but overall, i really enjoyed watching it. "", ""He is young and have loving, beautiful wife.What's a pity that he died few years ago.What worse, now there is this new man - younger, a bit immature and... still live.Of course, Shimao will not give up as easily.But, what he really can doing?In a first sight, it's almost typical history about love triangle. Boring, ordinary? I thought in this way. But when I started watching this movie, I couldn't stop. I wondered, why? Here are a main reason.Characters in “Natsuyuki Rendezvous” are really good constructed. It's important for me, 'cause I hate too ideal or too bad creatures. I prefer...when people who I watch are real. Everybody in Natsuyuki Rendezvous are people like most of us.It isn't story about handsome, clever, rich boy who met naïve, beautiful girl, then they fall in love and everything is easy. Hazuki and Rocca, main characters in this story, aren't too sweet and good. Sometimes they irritated me. They showed a lack of understanding of each other's feelings. Rocca still was living in her past. She is afraid of showing affection and too often tries to be unavailable. Hazuki is younger than her and sometimes behaved too rude. But after all, they aroused my sympathy.Even Shimao, dead husband, who (in theory) is villain of this story, is really easy to understanding. His spite and jealousy are very normal, considering his situation. And his behavior gives to the series a bit of humor. Maybe it's grim and black humor... but it's fine, I guess.It's true story of maturation of two (maybe three) people. It's a story of birth of love, too. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny. Just like life. when people who I watch are real.

The lyrics of Aimer\'s song include, ""In my dreams, you\'re always laughing / Hey, why  won\'t it disappear?"" and ""If I hadn\'t met you, I wouldn\'t have experienced such a heartrending clenching in my chest, but still... / If I hadn\'t met you, I wouldn\'t have learned of strength and kindness."" These words and the way Aimer sang her song resonated with me because it depicts remembering or longing for someone. Loving someone so deeply that you feel sadness, joy, and you experienced growth... You feel and experience so much with someone, like...a beautiful angel you feel you were fated to meet and they change your life forever. There is no regret in ever meeting them. However, what do you do when that person dies? How do you cope with their death? What does it mean to move on from their death? (ending theme: 10/10)I appreciate this series for trying to demonstrate answers to these questions. ^ Keep in mind that I originally gave this series a 9/10, but then it went down to a 7/10, which I hope I\'ll make clear as to why below.Story (8/10): This series had an intriguing setup. Should there ever be a point when you should give up in pursuing someone, because you know they\'re still grieving over their dead spouse, and if -strangely- you could see their dead husband\'s ghost? What kind of love are you looking to have with them, when you are aware that they love their spouse so deeply and haven\'t moved on? What about the dead husband? This series focused a lot more on Atsushi and Rokka\'s relationship than any interaction between Rokka and Hazuki. I would even say that love is a theme, not the entirety of the series. This anime challenges the complex topics of life and death themselves, including love after death and life after death.Characters (Atsushi: 9/10, Rokka: 6.5/10, Hazuki: 4/10):Atsushi was the character who grabbed my heart. The dead are supposed to rest in peace, but why did Atsushi become a ghost? What would be the point of that when Rokka can\'t even see him? Atsushi may appear childish and even possessive for watching over his wife, and even trying to stop Hazuki from his advances initially. However, none of that is foolish - Atsushi has a very deep and unconditional love for Rokka. Maybe Atsushi is \'crazy in love,\' although it\'s understandable because Atsushi and Rokka are very, VERY compatible. The two shared the same interests and wanted to have a future together, but Atsushi unfortunately passed away, leaving Rokka as a young widow. If not for Atsushi\'s early death, the two would have lived many longer and happier years together. Maybe Atsushi\'s devotion to Rokka is viewed as sheer stubbornness, but it was touching to me because he cared for her well-being and wished he didn\'t die so early, because he wanted to stay by her side and take care of her. We receive monologues from Atsushi\'s perspective where he mourns over what little he could do for her, such as not even being able to put a blanket over her when she\'s asleep. Atsushi was stuck in his own way.Rokka\'s conflicting emotions made sense in the story. She shared such a deep love with Atsushi, he was her soulmate, so of course she couldn\'t forget about him easily. When you continue to run the flower shop the two of you opened together and live in the same place, there will be many things that will remind you of your dead husband... Do you have the heart to throw ALL his belongings away? That\'s difficult. So, I appreciate that Rokka didn\'t force herself in that sense. She tried to move on by continuing to live and she acknowledged when she struggled. Atsushi was very much a part of her life and influenced her growth after all. However, I was unsatisfied with the way she handled her situation with Hazuki, beginning around the middle of the series… x.x There were moments when Rokka made selfish requests or said what was on her mind without considering the other party’s feelings, which bothered me. I wish Rokka had considered the other party’s position, so both Atsushi and Hazuki wouldn’t have suffered in their own ways to the same extent…Hazuki... The series never demonstrated why Hazuki was so determined to pursue Rokka. Yes, we saw Hazuki recalling the moments he spent with Rokka, but those were surface-level or emotions you would have for your crush. So, I found any relationship focus on Rokka and Hazuki lacking because the two were initially seller and customer, and then boss and employee. I\'m not denying Rokka\'s feelings for Hazuki, but I couldn\'t pinpoint when exactly her feelings changed, because she friend-zoned him initially, and there were moments when she and Hazuki were together where she would grieve as she thought of her husband... :/ It\'s one thing to give someone a chance (or expose yourself to a possibility of something new), but genuinely falling in love with their character and being compatible is completely different.Hazuki\'s character was intended for Rokka to move on from Atsushi. I think Rokka needed to move on in general, but it didn\'t need to come in the form of someone having a crush on her or a new potential relationship.So, I found Atsushi nicely developed. We saw his perspective as someone who grew up sick, understood his love and undying care for Rokka (literally)... Hazuki came out flat, and certainly should have been more developed beyond being the-boy-who-had-a-crush-on-Rokka. Rokka was going through a complicated time after Atsushi passed away, but that meant she needed to form her own life outside of Atsushi, not that she needed someone to have a crush on her and consider being with them to move on.Enjoyment: I enjoyed the beginning because it dealt with grieving and angst so beautifully. I felt the frustration Atsushi did at his helplessness. I felt so sad for Atsushi because he never wanted to die so early and leave Rokka as a widow. If Atsushi was given the choice, he would have lived many years with Rokka as the two could have traveled together, and even have their own children. We saw not only Rokka\'s struggle with moving on, but Atsushi\'s struggle as well. Atsushi couldn\'t understand why he became a ghost either, but he eventually knew he had to come to terms with that too. The living move on, including their outlooks and feelings changing, while the dead are the ones who look at the past. Atsushi only desired for Rokka to be happy :( (8/10)However, my enjoyment began to fade and fade starting from episode 6... Due to what I\'ve mentioned above, including Hazuki\'s flat characterization and Rokka and Hazuki not being very developed, it\'s easy to question what the aim of the story is. Should Hazuki continue pursuing Rokka? But how would anyone be okay with knowing they\'ll be entering a 3-people relationship, since Rokka could never forget Atsushi and Atsushi is such a significant part of her identity and life?? What is Atsushi\'s purpose? What difference would it make if Atsushi had the ability to talk with his wife or not? And what about Rokka? Does she consider Hazuki because she\'s lonely and wants to believe she loves Hazuki? (2.5/10)I felt like half-way into the series, the story or the author herself must have given up... :/If you\'re the type of person who gets drawn easily by the sound (e.g. voice actors like I do; LOL I literally paused episode 1 after 4 seconds because I recognized Nakamura\'s voice as Hazuki) or by the visual art, I think you could enjoy the series. One significant reason why I was so sympathetic and saw from Atsushi\'s perspective was because of Jun Fukuyama. Fukuyama EMBODIED Atsushi; Atsushi\'s pain at seeing Rokka grieve over him and wanting to protect her but realizing there was NOTHING he could do :’( ... Atsushi received the short-end of the stick LOL. But anyway, that\'s one example. The other voice actors played their parts nicely. Meanwhile, the art is pleasant, including the vibrant colours of the flowers Atsushi chose and the dull and simplistic hospital scenes. (7.5/10)Overall (6.5/10): I have mixed emotions. Some parts were portrayed beautifully, including the anguish that death brings to us, both for the dead and those who continue living... What does it mean to move on from someone? Erasing them from your life completely seems impossible, because there will always be a part of them that carries on with you, including your memories. So, that\'s something your next partner would need to accept. But is that fair to your next partner? What is love, for it to make us struggle but be so thankful to have experienced it? What is love, for us to accept it if our partner still holds someone else so dearly in their heart, and we have no right to ask them to forget about that person from their past? Maybe the answer is that we all have an undeniable tendency to be attached to what was once so important to us, that we never want to let go of it, no matter how much time passes...Maybe for some of us, there is no such thing as completely moving on from someone we cherish. So, we will always remember them and have reminders of their presence and the history you shared together, through your usage of their belongings or keeping your home arrangements the same. It could be strange to see people\'s insistence to keep parts of the dead alive, even if we continue living and develop aspects of our lives separate from them. Does that come from stubbornness, selfishness, or the love you have for the dead? Maybe that choice is a mixture of all three. Perhaps, this anime\'s message is simply acceptance. To accept it when someone has passed away and to accept it if you still long for them. Moving on does not mean forgetting someone and you could have your own ways of continuing your relationship with the deceased, whether it\'s through materials, habits, or memories alone... There is no perfect answer. a beautiful angel you feel you were fated to meet and they change your life forever. There is no regret in ever meeting them. However, what do you do when that person dies? How do you cope with their death? What does it mean to move on from their death?

This is a story about the heart of a widowed woman, about her vulnerability and the emotional baggage that surrounds her, in this case literally.Unfortunately, this whole series is just a little bland. While there are some very poignant moments with Rokka Shimao, the majority of the series is slow and mundane, lead by a main character in Ryousuke who it is incredibly hard to feel any compassion or connection towards.The idea is good, and at moments this series is quite touching.

It might have taken it's time in some spots, even for a series that's only one cour long.It's definitely a pleasant plot to watch unfold, but sometimes it doesn't feel like anything new and can be predictable.

Hazuki's adventure inside that dream world was unnecessary and too long. But after all anime is only 11 eps so nothing takes too long to watch. It tells the sadness of someone lost and also the difficulty to love again, mixed emotions about loyalty, love of a young man etc. Story is unique as far as I know. We all have seen animes with talking ghosts but its focus is different from other shows like this. Art style and songs are fitting for the story, they are perfect. Characters were well...rounded. I dont't see any plot holes. rounded. I dont't see any plot holes."", ""I have never in my life, watched an anime with pure interest, to only end in annoyance and disappointment. (Contain spoilers)The story starts so well, I thought it was about a widow who was gonna overcome her grief, and find new love with someone else. I thought it was about acceptance of the events that happened in the past but no, the time when the most annoying character I've ever seen in an anime gets to ruin the next half of the series, which is such a shame since I really love the premise.The art, it reminds me of Kimi No Todoke. Though I think...the animation is slightly off at times. But I don't think there's really a huge problem here.Sound, well it's Aimer, I think the theme song is really pretty too tho. The background music, does suit the flowery motif though sometimes it feels out of place at times.The character portion are usually my favorite parts of making reviews like this.Kazuki-kun, I think he really deserves better, he really was the MVP of this story. He would go all these lengths, even if Rokka, she doesn't see him as her lover, as long as she is happy. (Also he's 22 btw and he has an 8 year age gap so that makes Rokka 30 years old, idk why people think having an age gap is illegal, as long as they aren't a minor and adult relationship or known each other since one was very young, I think it's fine.)Rokka-san, I think she is fine, it was really refreshing to see a grown woman in anime be assertive, and a bit tomboyish on her part. I really like her arc, about grief but I think it was executed really poorly.Okay, now we get to the best worst part of this anime, the husband, annoying ghost-san. OH GOD THERE'S SO MANY TO UNPACK HERE.FIRST OF ALL, HE LITERALLY TOLD HIS WIFE TO DIVORCE HIM WHILE HE IS DYING, it's like he sees his wife having no feelings at all.Second, after his death he still haunts his wife, I know she did say to stay, but please if you really want her happy, just let her go.Third, he is very possessive of his wife, even if he was dead, he doesn't even let Hazuki-kun talk to her.Fourth, instead of being grateful Kazuki-kun lent his body to him, he decides to mess with it, like cutting Kazuki-kun's pretty hair, and spending his money for glasses.(And not to mention, Kazuki was drunk when he said yes, so I don't think that's very consensual)Five, in the body, he's messing with her feelings, making her think that Kazuki-kun doesn't like her anymore.Six, dude literally goes to have ### with her, and then leaving her alone after the next day. And he has the right to call himself a husband?Seven, he does commits thievery, and tries to frame it on Kazuki-kun.Eighth, he sees his wife as an object to be won, no wonder he's so possessive. And Kazuki-kun even points that out.Ninth, dude literally puts his wife into dangerous situations like making her look for him through the cold nights, and EVEN GUILTRIPPING HER INTO KILLING HERSELF?!And the worst part is, the story trying to make him a sympathetic tragic character. I know he has health problems, but you shouldn't be this unlikable and put the two other characters in pain. I think I found the character I truly hate in anime now.Enjoyment, I say the first episodes where good, but skip to 13:45 on the eleventh episode to not waste your time on stupid annoying ghost-san.

It all went downhill after the deceased husband took over Hazuki's body. After that happened the show was just full of flashbacks/useless shit while our MC, Hazuki was stuck in a dream state. I had absolutely no interest in the husband's and the wife's love story.

And that the ghost didn't think to switch back at certain moments (aka, when Rokka confesses to Hazuki, or when she feels comfortable enough to open up...to him without knowing it's Shimao she's talking to).

Aand it lasted whole episode, in the second one plot is turning to a flat line of nothingness. Does not develop from that in any smart way. Plot is full of illogical twists, besides, it has link to wonderland (it is not spoiler but you have to be prepared, you need special mind set for that...and i am not even joking).Art is just poor, unfortunately it was nothing special to me and animation was often blurry. In one episode i almost got seizure when image per second dropped to 0.5ish.Sound was also something poor, it is like putting icing on a ruined cake, in a few moments it did emphasize melancholy but other than that it had no 'character'. It was as plot, just a strait line.Characters... Oh my.. where to start. Well we have some basic 'stereotypes', like boy in 20s who has split personality between obsessed teenage boy and sexual predator. Another boy and that one is definition of pathetic dude in every way possible and in the end a retarded girl who don't know how to express her feelings, sorry for expression but i am so mad writing this... THERE WAS NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NO SIDE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.I did not enjoy single second of watching after 1st episode.This anime is illogical, unreal and so twisted up it makes me sick. It has no point what so ever, except to kill yourself or be immoral and stupid. Anime which relies and has base on reality and relationship between people in one second and few minutes later makes contradiction without explanation why in the first place and then continues expanding deeper meaning in opposite.The only good thing in this anime (for me) was the idea how it all started and that is why i watched till the end. I would have dropped loong time ago. This was just waste of my time.If anyone says that this anime make sense please do private message me explaining me how. Maybe i missed something or i am just too plain stupid for this one. I would write more but i will stick to that spoiler free part.I will throw a bone here, just to explain my claims.

Nerima Daikon Brothers,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1655/Nerima_Daikon_Brothers,"[""Nabeshin, most famous as the afro-sporting director of Excel Saga, thrives with material no one in their right mind would even think to create. With Nerima Daikon Brothers, he molds the story of two brothers, their cousin, and a soft... VERY soft... panda, who want nothing more but to turn their paltry daikon field into a concert dome where they can perform their music. But this is Nabeshin, so there has to be a catch, and it's a doozy... you see, Nerima Daikon Brothers is an anime musical. Singing, dancing, and lots of it.Every episode deals with the Nerima Daikon Brothers looking for a break,...finding corrupt rich people, and taking their money then losing it all once again. Though the episodes are formulaic, enough elements carry over and alter the story so no episode is exactly the same as the last. Ongoing jokes seldom get old.The characters themselves, including a shadowy Nabeshin, are not so much in it to grow or learn, but to wreak havoc, and they do it in spades. Hideki is a loudmouth horndog, Ichiro is a monotonous douche, and Mako is a materialistic bitch. They're selfish, foul, and incredibly loveable. Though they are nothing more than caricatures of themselves, the whole show feels like a caricature of itself, so it works well. Even when a certain infamous pop star becomes a recurring role, it just works because at that point, you're willing to believe anything the series throws at you.The art as zany and colorful just like the show's atmosphere. Much of the time it straddles the line between American animation and Japanese. This gives it a unique and fun look, energetic but never sloppy, that can really be appreciated after the same constant anime designs over and over for the average otaku.Also keeping in mind this is technically a musical, the show thrives on the sound element. Dialogue turns into well-timed puns with bizarre numbers on panda sex and following inane laws. The energy and pure randomness of it really sell it though. Recurring numbers such as the money song and rental shop song are fun, catchy, and brilliantly written to keep in line with the series structure. The dub especially so.Nerima Daikon Brothers is a show you don't have to think about when you watch. It's pure, zany fun beginning to end. Many comedy shows these days are full of more cynical, deadpan humor, but Nerima's selling point is it's cartoonish brand of comedy that is actually funny more than it is groan-worthy. For a good belly laugh, just pop this in and enjoy. It's nothing memorable, but it's a solid 12 episodes of fun.Overall, I give Nerima Daikon Brothers an 8 out of 10. finding corrupt rich people, and taking their money then losing it all once again.

This is the first ever anime musical comedy.  While fans of the typical Nabeshin screwball comedy will love it's off the wall flavour, it was also the pioneer of a new subgenre.  Unfortunately...the pioneer was drunk off his ass and ran his covered wagon into many a ditch.Story:The show does have a basic plot that tie all of the events together.  Hideki, Ichiro and their cousin...Mako have big dreams of building a concert dome on their daikon field in the suburb of Nerima, where they will perform for sold out crowds of adoring fans.  The problem?  The brothers and cousin are perpetually broke due to freak acts of nature, evil corperations, and Mako's horrible spending habits.  The plot, believe it or not, can be heavily paralleled with 'The Blues Brothers' and the main characters even dress similarly to Jake and Elwood Blues.In all actuality though, the series is actually a scathing political commentary on Japan in the year 2005.  Nobody is safe from Nabeshin's satire.  Issues dealt with within the series include privatization of land, the Japanese health care system, partner abuse, police corruption, sexual harassment, homosexuality, the horrors of the music industry, the Korean Wave and gambling, to name a few.  Some political and social figures are even spoofed.  The Prime Minister, Michael Jackson, and Johnny and Associates are all satirized.  The political commentary was very clever, but is now unfortunately outdated, and fairly irrelevant to American viewers.Art:It's...Nabeshin.  So expect a lot of eye poping, over the top visuals, and for stuff to literally come out of nowhere.  The laws of physics do not apply.  This is far from the fluid animation of animes like Fullmetal Alchemist, or with the detailed scenery of Le Chevalier D'Eon.  It's zany, cartoony, and it fits.  Scenes and visuals are routinely recycled along with musical numbers, which gets slightly grating.  Charicatures of real people are often diformed and discoloured (Michael Jackson's counterpart 'Yukel Hakushon' has purple hair, yellow skin and a detachable nose.)  There are also plenty of visual references and puns, though with quite a few of them you need a basic knowledge of Japanese, which the English language team tried to adapt, sometimes ineffectively.Sound:Hideki's Japanese voice is perfect for the lead singer of a blues band.  The Japanese crew has a much better balance than the English crew, but the dub still manages to convey all the humour of their Japanese counterparts.  One main complaint the fandom has is Mako's Southern Belle accent (she speaks in Osakan dialect in Japanese).  It can get fairly annoying after prolongued viewing.  Another complaint is that the songs, while pretty good, and catchy, get repeated from episode to episode, with different lyrics.  Remember what I said earlier about the pioneer for this genre drunkly driving the covered wagon?  Well...this is probably a mistake future anime musicals can learn from.Character:If you knew them in real life, you'd probably want them institutionalized.  Since this is an anime comedy however, all disorders can be forgiven for the rule of funny.  Hideki wants to marry his cousin Mako, who repeatedly lies to him about how the Japanese constitution bans first cousins from marrying (it doesn't) while Mako herself is in love with Ichiro.  Ichiro in turn loves a panda found in the daikon field.  A female police officer Yukika 'inspector gadget' also falls in love with the panda, but is torn between her love of the fuzzy panda and the fishcakes found in ramen.  And that...that's just the main love tri...octa...love plot.Characters have a lot of negative traits, though most of these are played for humour.  What makes them more sympathetic though is that they are constantly being ripped off and stolen from by larger corperations, clearly making the Brothers underdogs.  The one problem is in the later part of the series, the writers try to create drama and tear jerking situations in a Nabeshin comedy, creating mood whiplash at times.  It's hard to genuinly feel sorry for someone who was just involved in a high speed chase on a unicycle.Enjoyment:I loved this anime for it's political satire and clever pop culture references.  The musical aspect too to an extent, but once songs started to be repetedly recycled, it got kind of old, even annoying.  My personal problem was that this series tried to do too much.  It tried to be a scathing commentary on the times, a pop culture riddled comedy, a screwball random comedy and a musical.  While it was still a fun anime, it just felt like the show could not decide what it wanted to be.  At any rate, anyone interested in a social commentary on Japanese life might want to have a peek at this, but keep the internet on hand so you can understand all the references.Warnings:  Nudity (some sexual positions are displayed in the art in Ichiro's Host Club) foul language, bestiality, cousin-love, mind rape (it's Nabeshin) sex based humour and racism against Koreans.  Also, cue a pink Darth Vader just for added wtf-value. Mako have big dreams of building a concert dome on their daikon field in the suburb of Nerima, where they will perform for sold out crowds of adoring fans.  The problem?

There are also plenty of visual references and puns, though with quite a few of them you need a basic knowledge of Japanese, which the English language team tried to adapt, sometimes ineffectively.Sound:Hideki's Japanese voice is perfect for the lead singer of a blues band.  The Japanese crew has a much better balance than the English crew, but the dub still manages to convey all the humour of their Japanese counterparts.  One main complaint the fandom has is Mako's Southern Belle accent (she speaks in Osakan dialect in Japanese).  It can get fairly annoying after prolongued viewing.  Another complaint is that the songs, while pretty good, and catchy, get repeated from episode to episode, with different lyrics.  Remember what I said earlier about the pioneer for this genre drunkly driving the covered wagon?  Well...this is probably a mistake future anime musicals can learn from.Character:If you knew them in real life, you'd probably want them institutionalized.  Since this is an anime comedy however, all disorders can be forgiven for the rule of funny.  Hideki wants to marry his cousin Mako, who repeatedly lies to him about how the Japanese constitution bans first cousins from marrying (it doesn't) while Mako herself is in love with Ichiro.  Ichiro in turn loves a panda found in the daikon field.  A female police officer Yukika 'inspector gadget' also falls in love with the panda, but is torn between her love of the fuzzy panda and the fishcakes found in ramen.  And that...that's just the main love tri...octa...love plot.Characters have a lot of negative traits, though most of these are played for humour.  What makes them more sympathetic though is that they are constantly being ripped off and stolen from by larger corperations, clearly making the Brothers underdogs.  The one problem is in the later part of the series, the writers try to create drama and tear jerking situations in a Nabeshin comedy, creating mood whiplash at times.  It's hard to genuinly feel sorry for someone who was just involved in a high speed chase on a unicycle.Enjoyment:I loved this anime for it's political satire and clever pop culture references.  The musical aspect too to an extent, but once songs started to be repetedly recycled, it got kind of old, even annoying.  My personal problem was that this series tried to do too much.  It tried to be a scathing commentary on the times, a pop culture riddled comedy, a screwball random comedy and a musical.  While it was still a fun anime, it just felt like the show could not decide what it wanted to be.  At any rate, anyone interested in a social commentary on Japanese life might want to have a peek at this, but keep the internet on hand so you can understand all the references.Warnings:  Nudity (some sexual positions are displayed in the art in Ichiro's Host Club) foul language, bestiality, cousin-love, mind rape (it's Nabeshin) sex based humour and racism against Koreans.  Also, cue a pink Darth Vader just for added wtf-value."", 'The show is really stupidly silly. But unlike Puni Puni Poemy and Excel Saga, this one has a story that he sticks to. I like the story because its heart wrenching but because of the black comedy, it doesn’t make me want to cry. I wanted to keep watching because of the characters and how they interact with each other, and to see if they ever would make their dream come true. They had me laughing from the start even if some of the jokes were a little gross.The animation is not really all that wonderful, but it works with the fact that this...is a comedy and not a normal show. The characters at times lose all proportion, turn chibi, stretch out strange or have their arms and legs move strange but it all works.When we get down to the music, It’s wonderful! Sometimes then they have a show that is all about the music, they will either fail or like this one, rock out! I loved ever song even if I won’t look for most of them on a CD.

Excel Saga was great, but got old near the end, and I hated Poemy from minute one. Nerima Daikon Brothers is the third Nabashin related work I've seen thus far, and this one is sliightly better, but suffers from the same problems.The comedy is pretty much what can be expected; an insane...vault of madness with little rhyme or reason. And it works great at first. I pretty much loved all the parodies featured, even if I'm not native Japan and don't get 98% of the cultural references. The English dub is pretty damn funny, and worth checking out. I think it's Greg Ayers at his best. The songs are enjoyable, until midway through the show, then they begin recycling instrumentals and juggling mildly different lyrics.And that's precisly the problem with Nabashin's style of humor. Aside from it being foul-mouthed and crude (which i can deal with), the show is seriously repetitious with the jokes it cycles. It became unfunny to me around episode 6 and becomes pretty mediocore from there out. The wackiness gets really predictable and I was lulled into a state of calling which song numbers were going to start before they were even cued. That style of comedy is very sketch-based, which means it's lifespan is not very long. Thankfully, it's only twelve episodes, so I found the fortitude to sit through the remaining four episodes I had on DVD for three years, hoping that the jokes I got tired of would be somewhat refreshed when I back into it. Not really so much.The characters are pretty vibrant and off-the-wall, my favorite is easily Officer Yukika, who kept the show very enjoyable throught the end. Hideki, Mako, and Ichiro are decent, but become overbearingly annoying on a South Park level, as there's only two jokes between the three of them. The villians are episodic, but the bad guy in the very first episode was just so terrible I found it awesome. Every other villian afterward gets progressively more suggestive and borders on trying too hard to push boundries that it gets sad.IN CLOSING: What starts out as a really fresh comedy, something that is drastically lacking in anime today, turns into a double entandre-filled, genitalia referencing, one liners and predictable, bland toilet humor that caters to this generation's Family Guy audience. In my book, only Great Teacher Onizuka and Azumanga Daioh have managed insane humor for 26 episodes or more because of clever writing, various characters to write jokes around, and a solid set of scenarios to keep you watching. Watanabe's humor work best in short bursts. For a pioneer who does a great job promoting retail purchases to keep anime a viable revolving door for entertainment, it's a shame that I really don't like his stuff.

When I first watched it, I was like, wait a minute, can you put this on T.V.!? I watched the entire series in the english dub, and let me say, one of the best dubs I've seen, next to Full Metal Alchemist ( Not Brotherhood. The first one. ) I laughed, I cried because I was laughing so hard, and I absolutely adored it. If you're easily offended, then don't watch it, but if you can take a joke or million, watch it. If you don't like musicals, you ought not to watch it either. I honestly thought the series was...pretty amazing, and the humor just never stopped. I recommend it if you're looking for some good clean fun, nothing really intense in the story line. Just funny. pretty amazing, and the humor just never stopped. I recommend it if you're looking for some good clean fun, nothing really intense in the story line. Just funny."", 'For lack of a better comparison (never saw Blues Brothers, and I’m not totally well versed in the Blues as a whole) Nerima Daikon Brothers is kinda the closest we’ve ever gotten to an anime version of Elite Beat Agents, except less dancing and more singing. It’s got a rather simple premise, as it takes place in little town called Nerima and follows a goofy trio of that live on a stage in the middle of a daikon field that’s owned a by the leader of the group, a square-jawed daikon farmer named Hideaki. Oh and their mascot, Pandaikon . He along with his cohorts,...cousin Mako (the clingy gold digger) and Ichiro (doesn’t seem to care about anything, and oh yeah, he works for a sleazy bar) aim to rake in enough cash to build their own stadium and share their music as the “Nerima Daikon Brothers”, get famous, and become the pride of their city. Most episodes plays out in a rather formulaic path, they normally include get rich quick plots that have the Nerima Daikon Brothers run across rather nasty swindler each episode. The Daikon Bros then take it upon themselves to rid the town of this threat (with the help of a rental object from my favorite afro’d director of course) and get try to get the money they need to fulfill their dreams, the latter failing miserably each time.The fact that the majority of the humor and story of this show is done through song is what sets this title apart from any other formulaic comedy out there. However, if the term “formulaic” hasn’t been used in this review enough for you to notice, the show’s pretty darn repetitive. One thing worth noting too is that even though this is a musical comedy, the show’s got a rather limited pool of tunes, seriously, it’s got like 5, MAX. They also all play at the same given time each episode. There’s the “I’m the villain and here’s my evil plan” song, the “Mako being a vain bitch” song, the “hey Nabeshin, we’re looking pretty screwed, so give as a random Deus ex Machina to kick some jerk’s ass” song and the “hey we’re the Nerima Daikon Brothers and we’re here to wreck your evil plan and get rich at the same time” song. It’s strange, I honestly suspected that a show this repetitive would’ve worn me down to my last nerve by the time it ended, but it never did. I credit that to the fact that it seemed to me that the show knew which parts to keep the same, and what to change each time in order to keep itself from becoming dull. The length of the series also helps since this is probably the only comedy I liked, finished, and was glad their was never anything more made of it. I’m sure that had it taken another cour of my life, the act would’ve gotten old well before the end.So what is it that the show did right to preserve the routine? The fact that even though the plot structure and tunes played out similarly each and every episode wasn’t enough to take away from the humorous dialogue and occasional pop-culture reference that we’e different each episode (it has it’s running gags, but these don’t feel overplayed at all and I found them rather funny at least). The fact that the song lyrics we’re always different in order to suit the occasion is what really made this a memorable experience. It also helps that not all the episodes essentially boil down to the same rinse-repeat formula. After the first 3rd or so, the show tosses in police babe Widget who adds her own set of unique quirks to the show (including a romance with a Pandaikon of all things) and a new song, which is something I appreciate given the aforementioned lack of tunes.The last third of the show also puts a stop to the episodic shenanigans in favor of taking a bit more of serious look at what the Daikon Bros are willing to do accomplish their dreams. It’s great to see a comedy take itself a bit seriously without losing sight of what made it fun to begin with, and that’s something Nerima Daikon Brothers got right….for the most part. The actual ending was a bit too random rushed and anticlimatic for my tastes. Weird to comment on a comedy not having a satisfying ending, I know, but given that the show was actually doing a story arc reasonably well beforehand, I think it’s still worth mentioning. That and the fact that the show also shoehorns in some political commentary into it’s humor a bit too. That’s all fine and dandy, but good luck catching that humor if you don’t have a good understanding of the political arena of 2006 Japan.Last thing I want to bring attention too is the dub/sub comparison. I personally dig the radical script changes (and in Mako’s case, character change since she’s pretty much turned into stereotypical dumb trailer trash in the dub, and it works) Can’t really comment too much on the Japanese version since I never saw much of it, but I’ve seen enough to know that with each versions you get different jokes, which lends the show some rewatchability. I personally preferred watching the dub version since during the end credits, the actors thank you for buying the show. You can’t beat that.So yeah, it’s a pretty good comedy I’d say. Just don’t marathon it, something tells me that given the nature of the show, this ain’t something you’d want to watch in large doses. Also best to stay away if you don’t like Nabeshin stuff too, or object to having catchy tunes reverberate in your head.

Since anime tends to be just 12-24 episodes which can be watched quickly and without having to care much(unlike, say, novels that I also often read and can take days or weeks to finish even if you read several hours a day). Feeling like dropping it in episode one, with that feeling just getting worse until I drop it at episode four... Yeah, that\'s just plain horrible.First of all, the art is the only fairly good part of this anime. Not too shabby, especially not for its age....The sound is poor, which is an issue in an anime that relies so heavily on singing or ""musicals"". The characters are all unlikable, the main cast consists of one obnoxious ingrate that spends way too much money, one character that condones this because he\'s in love with her(which is used against him to steal his money) and who seems to be retarded in more ways than one, the last person of the main cast is a fairly soulless and quiet ""pretty boy"" that somehow seems to be the most intelligent, but the only reason he\'s somewhat likable is exactly because he\'s too bland to be disliked in this type of story, he\'s got nothing much to offer.Every episode is full to the brim with bad singing. Seriously, they start singing and dancing every minute because of every small detail imaginable, effectively dragging a very small issue out too long and overdramatizing things. The singing isn\'t even done well, although I guess that\'s obvious when you make shoddy half-arsed songs out of everyday dialogue. When I picked this up, I imagined that there\'d be 1-2 songs per episode, because that honestly seems to be the maximum possible in 20 minutes. Nah, prepare for 5-10 songs at least. It\'s honestly dreadful and very annoying after a few episodes whenever they start singing, because it literally brings nothing good to the anime itself. It\'s not as if their songs are particularly funny or good in other ways, it\'s just there to be there. This might\'ve been the deciding factor to make me drop it so quickly.That brings me to the next part, which is comedy. The comedy in this anime is... horrible. It\'s not good at all. At most I found a few parts to be somewhat amusing, but in the way this show rapid-fires gags every second, it\'s like one out of a hundred jokes is funny. The rest is just... boring and makes you question the writers sense of humor. Of course a few jokes will hit home when you try a few hundred of them. It\'s more like they didn\'t even think about what they were writing and just added every possible thing anyone in the writing team could think of. ""Oh, this seems to be slightly amusing, let\'s add it!"". The main component in the comedy here seems to be about how hyperactive they are to start dancing/singing all the time and how they exaggerate small issues to big ones. Oh, and how they blow stuff up at the end of an episode to steal money from ""bad people"". So, maybe you\'re the type who thinks it\'s hilarious when people do that, this could be the anime for you.To finish thing off, let\'s talk a little bit about the story. To me, this was the worst part of it all. There\'s no story at all here and everything is way too chaotic to make sense. Mind you, I came here expecting a story-less gag/slapstick anime. I just didn\'t expect it to be bad to this extent. Usually you have a fairly interesting setting at least and some basic story to let things make sense. But here you have absolutely nothing and the story is one of the most boring ones I\'ve ever seen. It\'s episodic and the same thing happens every chapter. They get tricked of their money or something similar and then they blow things up thanks to nabeshins alley store which provides weapons or similar stuff. The setting is just that they\'re three people with a daikon farm who wants to be famous singers/a famous band and wants to build a dome they can sing in, at least one of them want that while the rest seems to just hop onboard. The comedy routines got old after the first try, sorry, but that\'s just how it is. This setting isn\'t good enough to provide proper comedy. Nothing really happens or makes proper sense in this anime.

They didn't show much interactions between the male and female leads. The interaction between the female leads, specially how they met, didn't seem forced. In fact, it was okay & I liked how they became friends. But, as for the interaction between the female leads & male leads, I guess many scenes were cut. So it kinda seemed forced.I think it'd be better if this movie showed more interactions among the leads.

So, if you are looking for a light hearted romance anime just like me, you can watch it."", 'Tl;dr:- Movie suffers from a pacing issue- Unrealistic and uninteresting characters- Forced character interactions- Cliched and cringe dialogues- Good animation, character designs and music.- Targeted for a relatively younger audience.What\'s the worst thing you can do with your romance anime?...Unrealistic characters?Cliched and cheesy dialogues?Forced character interactions?Or maybe all of the above?Omoi Omoware Furi Furare should be named as ""Rejection Compilation"" as rejection is everything that happens.Am I exaggerating? Ofc but not too much.The premise of this movie is interesting enough. 4 main characters with different views on the love end up together in a high school as a classmate. Will they be able to achieve their wished youthful romance? It\'s not bad I liked the first 22 minutes of the show (yes exactly min 22). I wish I could say the same about the rest 1 hour and 20 minutes. It was just a complete mess with a huge Love Triangle.The characters are nothing new and interesting. Yuna is just like your everyday annoying shoujo character who is living in her fantasy and confessing to someone who already rejected her once. Akari may seem like a mature girl but she is selfish af. Kazuomi is that one character that every anime has that even the author must\'ve forgotten about halfway through their work. He was the most interesting one but had the least screen time. His having to hide his passion and dream of being a movie director from his not well-mannered family was interesting, but the author decided to ignore his interesting side and just focus on boring love triangles. Rio is just a (cool) character that every anime has who is mysterious, tall and handsome. He loves his sister ( not blood-related). So he is jealous when Kazuomi is together with Akari. Nice incest going on here.Our leads meet with a complete coincidence. Yuna helped Akari once and Akari invited herself to Yuna\'s house. Kazuomi was Yuna\'s childhood friend while Rio was Akari\'s brother who was someone Yuna was interested in.It\'s not a bad way to introduce a character to other characters as it is done way too much in animes already, but I don\'t like when this happens coz this will take away the entire important factor of ""How our leads met and became friends first"". The movie did a pretty okay job of this on Yuna and Akari, but this movie is not Yuri so it doesn\'t matter much. Because Rio and Kazuomi are brother and childhood friend of Akari and Yuna they are already friends before even interacting with each other much. So I think this is an easy and boring way to introduce the characters, but not everyone has the same opinions. So there is nothing I can do about it except for putting my own opinion.Except for how characters are introduced, how characters fall in love is not well executed either. I believe 2 things are important when it comes to romantic progression between the leads and that is "" Why they fall in love "" and ""How does the love affect their lives"".But I think the author has a different view on what\'s more important. The movie is full of confession, but none of them feels like genuine love and that\'s because they don\'t have much reason to fall in love.Yuna loves Rio coz Rio (coincidentally) has similar hair to her prince from what they read in her childhood. Wow, interesting. If the fairy tale prince had black hair instead of blonde does that mean Yuna would\'ve loved Kazuomi and not Rio? Guess we will never know.Rio loves Akari since childhood and love at the first sight. Interesting too.Akari loves Kazuomi and the author dismissed it by making Akari a kind of girl who easily falls in love. How interesting too.Rio later in the series loves Yuna and that\'s after literally kissing Akari like 10 minutes earlier. Is that what society calls Fuccboi?Okay people can defend him and I can understand it as Yuna did help Rio to make up with her sister, but is that enough to make Rio forget his first love and move on? I don\'t think so.And last and not least Kazuomi loves Akari. Idk why and I don\'t think the author knows it too. They had few interactions with each other and none of them helps to justify his feelings. Okay, he once saved Akari from falling as most anime characters do, but it it\'s not a reason. And to make the thing worse. The synopsis said, ""Kazuomi doesn\'t understand the concept of love and he is dense about these things"".So why will Kazuomi love Akari?The movie suffers quite a bit from the pacing issue too. The movie is kinda fast-paced than it needs to be. Due to it many of the character interaction seemed forced. The future couples don\'t have much interaction with each other. A lot of my IRL manga reader friends said a lot of the scenes were cut in the movie. This can be the case but we are not talking about the manga here so it\'s a con here.Even though I said earlier that the characters don\'t have much interaction and when they do have some it\'s all filled with cliched and cringe dialogues which are simply frustrating to sit through and watch. Just think of any cringe and cliche lines used in romance anime. What can you think of?- It\'s okay, you rejected me. I am fine with it. I just wanted to get this off of my heart. (Cries like a bitxh later)- Please apologise to him/her. He/She did nothing wrong. ( but is shivering with fear ) and characters of the anime will say "" Oh wow you were so cool "" No it was cringey.And all of the other things you can think of. It\'s available in this movie. Yes not even exaggerating.If you don\'t know "" I love Nitpicking "". Nitpicking is my favourite hobby and something I can do all day. And I have 2 things, in particular, that might not look significant but are something I can\'t get over with. And both of them is related to Akari\'s family.[Spoiler Ahead]1: In one scene Akari\'s mom hurriedly comes to the house with a scared look on her face as she thought Rio and Akari were together in the room. So it\'s kinda obvious she thought they were doing something immoral. But why does she think so?Is it because Akari\'s mom knows that Rio loves Akari ? or just because they are 2 people of different sex of the same age? or maybe Rio tried something like that already before? That\'s something I wanted to know the entire time coz it\'s not a small deal. The family having no trust is a huge issue that has to be solved but the author forgot that she even included something like that in her story.2: During the ending part of the story when Akari leaves the house because of her ( Internal Family Quarrels ) you know how and why did she get over with it? Yes, because Kazuomi confessed to her. Yes, as easy as that. If anyone of you is having trouble with family, then just ask your crush to propose to you. They will solve the problem for you.Kazuomi who has nothing to do with Akari\'s problem with her family solved it just by confessing to her. Is that how confession and family problem works?Idk if it does and if it does then my bad but I don\'t think this is how it\'s supposed to work.Moving on from all the criticism I have with it. I do have some positives to say as well.I am a huge fan of Io Sakisaka\'s character designs and Bump of Chicken\'s music. So the movie has pretty great character designs and music (animation is decent too). Lol and that\'s all about its pros I will say.I am a huge fan of light-hearted shows in general if you can tell from my favourites, but I think what Io Sakisaka prioritizes in her story is kinda different from what I want from a story ( Hal, Ao Haru Ride and now Omoi omoware furi furare suffering from kinda similar problems for me ) so Io Sakisaka\'s stories are not something that appeals to me, but it may appeal to a large number of people so I don\'t want to deny it by saying she is a bad writer.If you like this movie then good for you it was just not my kind of thing. Well, reviews are not 100% objective.Thanks for reading.Have a nice day/night.

It did not take long for the movie to turn extremely cheesy with most of the character interactions being frustrating and hard to sit through. As I said earlier, the writing for the characters towards the middle of the movie started to show a constant inconsistency. The two characters that were introduced presented a common dichotomy that isn't new, but was rather charming, with both of the characters actually fitting into what the synopsis of the anime described them as....However, towards the middle of the story, both characters started to turn into the same characters and lost the charm that was given to us at the beginning of the movie. The movie isn't all bad however, the art was rather impressive for A-1 Studios and surprised me in certain key scenes, but wasn't anything special nor unique other than the bubble motif that was presented towards the end of the movie. Music was excellent as it was not too distracting from the dialogue but when paid attention to really sets the mood of most of the scenarios in the movie as BGM should. BUMP OF CHICKEN really impressed me with a their performance with once of the scenes in tandem with the fairly impressive animation. All in all, the movie is quite a letdown especially with the encaptivating exposition, but slowly derailed into a romance drama with no passion, creativity, or good character development. If I were to describe this anime as an equation, it would be y = -x + 8.

We got to see two romances for the price of one, by doing that, it killed two birds with one stone so yeah why not.Just after my viewing, I was convinced that the film was good and that nothing was missing.On...the other hand, the next day, I wondered about the film, and it's never very good when you get there. Indeed, there are elements that are completely forgotten and characters that are not well developed or have disappeared. I think the film is about 20 minutes short of being very good. In those 20 minutes, they could have shown us what happened after high school and so on.Nevertheless, it remains a good romance and if you are a fan of slice of life with romance, I recommend it for sure. the other hand, the next day, I wondered about the film, and it's never very good when you get there.

It's just that without even having glanced at the source material, even I could immediately tell that things were being cut out, to a dramatically bad effect.

I understand that they needed to chop a lot because of time but they should have just made this to a series because this was not it. Don't get wrong I...love the confession scene between Rio and Yuna but it just didn't make any sense how or why Rio came to like Yuna, sure she helped him but is that just all?

If you want to fully enjoy this movie, read the manga first or else you will feel like its too rushed and prolly wouldnt understand how much time passed between the scenes which can make you feel lost as the movie contains the complete manga in it so a lot of chapters, scenes got cut off to squeeze the story in.As someone who read the manga while it was still ongoing I enjoyed this a lot as it contains every important scene (except one sweet scene between one of the couples in one's room > read...it to get what Im talking about 😝) which is kinda disappointing but overall I'm very satisfied with how it turned out. Also the movie doesnt really portray the character development because the movie didnt go too deep into them or rather didnt have time for that. But that's not missing in the manga, actually all four MCs got their fair share of development so thats another reason why you should read the manga beforehand to just fully focus on and find pleasure in the major scenes in this movie.So my recommendation is read the manga first, if you enjoy it then you will love this movie because you will see all the important and favorite scenes in motion and sound (and with incredible art, just look at those backgrounds, OMG) which is more than enough I would say, something that people who likes Ao Haru Ride (another story by the same mangaka) didn't get in its adaptation. it to get what Im talking about 😝) which is kinda disappointing but overall I'm very satisfied with how it turned out.

The animation is pretty standard but the character design of the main leads are overly simple making them feel very bland and they have very little personality.I also kinda thought that the character development didn't go smoothly. the characters falling in love felt a little awkward because the plot had many holes and didn't bother to make the characters likable.However the good thing I like about this anime is although there were countless potholes that made the viewer(me) not love the characters I did love that...the ending was neatly done without exaggeration. the movie overall was pretty decent, I liked the soundtracks and thought that the initial premise of how the fl friendship developed was splendid.After saying all that , I would recommend you give it a watch because its decent and I do know its adopted from a manga , so would recommend to read the manga and watch the anime after :-) the ending was neatly done without exaggeration. the movie overall was pretty decent, I liked the soundtracks and thought that the initial premise of how the fl friendship developed was splendid.After saying all that , I would recommend you give it a watch because its decent and I do know its adopted from a manga , so would recommend to read the manga and watch the anime after :-)"", ""I would recommend this a million times over Ao Haru Ride (I gave that a 3).The story is fine. I expected the melodrama from Io Sakisaka, but the decently and mature enough characters make up for it. Sure, there are some communication problems, but given the age of the characters, it's understandable. In the end, they all find a mature way to resolve them.My first impression of the girls was that they were going to be childish and annoying, but they surprised me being far more likeable than I anticipated. I ended up rooting for them halfway through (especially Yuna).The acting was good (nice...debut for Marika Suzuki) and the sound aswell, with some nice music. The art was easily the best part.

It's mainly due to the fact that this manga is around 10 volumes and they shoved that into a short movie.There are so many scenes that are cut out in order to fit its length. A huge portion of Akari's past and therefore her growth as a character is cut out. Yuna and Rios christmas date is totally missing.

Since when did Kazu and Rio become bestfriends that Kazu would sacrifice his love for him, thinking that his bestfriend likes Akari? There was so much important scenes that was cut out, which made parts of the story making no sense. I wish there were more interactions between the characters.

This is my first time making a review.', ""I read the manga for this a wee while ago so the story was fuzzy but still familiar, and I enjoyed it enough that when I saw it had an anime adaption I dropped everything I was doing to watch it immediately.As a standalone film, it definitely could probably do with some work. I already had the benefit of knowing a bunch of context from the source material so I'm not sure just how much in the film was confusing or unclear.I've seen reviews criticising its cheesy dialogue and use of tropes; personally, this played right into what I love about the shoujo genre. During...the confessions and the scenes when characters realise their own feelings, it did a beautiful job of connecting me with the flutter of emotions that come with high school romance. A truly gorgeous soundtrack and art, and the voice acting is stellar.I enjoyed Yuna and Rio's relationship the most and animated their fairytale romance is beautiful. I would have liked to have seen more moments between Yuna and Akari though, and I noticed that quite a bit of Kazuomi's personal story has been trimmed down; I vaguely remember the manga addressing his family situation in more detail that shines a light on his family dynamic: a dynamic that Akari can sympathise with a lot and fuels their affection for each other. That kind of happened in the film, but it wasn't focused on as much.The manga is 12 volumes, while the film is just over 90 minutes; obviously, you get the condensed version of the story but I actually think it worked out in the film's favour. Gone are the chapters that just dragged the story out, leaving you to focus on the stuff that actually matters. I didn't find the pacing rushed at all - not any more than your average romance film. I don't necessarily think you need the extra context from the manga to enjoy this either; if you enjoy cheesy shoujo romance tropes then you'll probably find something to like about this film.To be honest, I really enjoyed this; I can totally see myself rewatching this to experience the story when I don't have the time to reread the manga. It was a lovely adaptation, and I'm really happy to see more of Sakisaka Io's work being animated - especially in 2022 where the art just looks so beautiful and fluid. the confessions and the scenes when characters realise their own feelings, it did a beautiful job of connecting me with the flutter of emotions that come with high school romance.

I’m so disappointed.My main gripe is with how the characters were handled. The reason why this film is boring and difficult to get through is because they cut so much important characterisation that made the characters stand apart from each other and made their relationships interesting. SPOILER >>>>>>> Rio and Yuna’s mutual confession holds so little emotional weight because SOOOO much development that led...up to that point was cut out, especially from Rio’s side. It just all feels very sudden and pointless.I missed the internal dialogue of the characters; from Yuna in particular cause to me it’s what made her an MC worth caring about. A lot of the internal conflict of Yuna and Akari was cut. Not to mention Agatsuma appearing as this one dimensional nice guy from the jump. In conclusion all the characters felt very flat and it was hard to care about any of them.I love the animation in this I thought it was pretty and I was happy to see the characters in colour and motion, but I really wish this manga had been adapted into an episodic anime and not a movie.

Unfortunately the plot is still the same as it looks more like a remake of some sorts that anything  else, only the antagonist and the addition of the POG as Kaito\'s allies have change.  But still there is that thing where you\'ll be wanting to see Kaito kick them Orpheus Order\'s ass. So for the story I\'ll give a ""Fair"" number 6, because one might wanna screw the story and just get on with solving the puzzle and make Kaito win.Art: Poor 3.This is because, I\'m not getting the idea of as to why  Kaito, Gammon, Ana and Cubic are not in their proper school uniform. I really don\'t like the way Kaito dresses up, co\'z he kinda looks like a dorky gangbanger whose style fits those of  geeky hippies who hasn\'t taken a bath for a long time. Gammon, looks like a typical biker gang who is into S and M, as for Ana, I\'d wish the author has made him a girl than a cross dress fag who dresses like your typical grandmother and as for Cubic, he\'ll be better off just ditching the white robe for a Root Academy\'s school uniform. For Nonoha, I really like her better with her hair down.Sound: Mediocre 5.I just like the ending theme.Characters, enjoyment and overall: Fair 6.So far what keeps me from dropping this season 2 is the challenge in which one would empathize with the characters, unlike the 1st season where Kaito is all alone this time he has friends and acquires new allies. However I really hate it when Kaito who\'s seemly oblivious to Nonoha\'s feelings, it cannot be establish if he is protecting her or was he gay, co\'z the thing about this anime is that it has this yaoi innuendo where the main villain seems to have that kind of desire of that of a woman who is obsess with a man, and in this case it is with Kaito. Then again I really do admire Nonoha, co\'z she kinda serves as a mother figure to Kaito and it is nice that at the last episode of the anime Kaito wants her to be part of his puzzle solving quest. In the upcoming season 3, it is gonna be obvious that the Orpheus order would be part of Kaito and the gang\'s allies, so far thought this anime\'s overall should get a higher score, it simply doesn\'t deserve such high score co\'z of the predictability and it woun\'t be a surprise if the upcoming season 3 will also used the same route as the 1st season only with some slight difference. But it was enjoyable enough to see as to how the big antagonist get\'s beaten by a bigger antagonist and I\'m referring to the Freecell woopping Klondike\'s ass in which klondike\'s ass big time and seeing Melancholy acting like a kid being bullied thought I was kinda hoping that Kaito would have been the one to do that.PUZZLE TIME IS OVER.

I don't know about anyone else but the series definitely makes you confused and also eager for the next episode because you are so curious about what's going on with Freecell.

So, you know what it's all about.Puzzles.Yes, there is a lot of puzzle-related stuff going on in the series and, to a degree, it's like Yu-Gi-Oh when it comes to puzzles.Season One stands to reinforce that statement...However, while the 2nd Season could stand to do the same, it also negates it.The second season IS better than the first. Heck, the main antagonist is even a better villain than Rook was. Kaito is seriously challenged in this season and there are quite a few moments in the show that I would define as epic and just straight badass.There's also better character development in the Second Season as well. A lot of characters are given more backstory. And the backstories aren't too bad.The damning quality of this entire season is simply that it's about puzzles. Take away the puzzles and the story is actually capable of being ten-worthy. After all, Phi Brain in general was a story about people trying to become God. Though, the puzzles themselves aren't too bad either, it's just hard to believe a bunch of teens being so interested in solving puzzles for fun. Harder to believe that people would just set up a bunch of death puzzles.Still, it's a great series. And, from time to time, I have a little fun trying to solve puzzles too. At the least, if you've watched the first season and liked it, I suggest you try this one. If you watched the first season and disliked it, I suggest that you try this one.

Take away the puzzles and the story is actually capable of being ten-worthy. After all, Phi Brain in general was a story about people trying to become God. Though, the puzzles themselves aren't too bad either, it's just hard to believe a bunch of teens being so interested in solving puzzles for fun. Harder to believe that people would just set up a bunch of death puzzles.Still, it's a great series. And, from time to time, I have a little fun trying to solve puzzles too. At the least, if you've watched the first season and liked it, I suggest you try this one. If you watched the first season and disliked it, I suggest that you try this one. It's a redeemer by some stretches.""]"
Persona 4 the Animation: The Factor of Hope,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14267/Persona_4_the_Animation__The_Factor_of_Hope,"[""Those of you who feel inclined to look back on the events of Persona 4: The Animation, find yourselves here. If you didn't watch P4: The Animation, the series this movie is a complete recap of, you'll be unable to make sense of what you just watched. And for this reason, it cannot substitute watching the whole 25 episode series in an hour and change.But that's not its intended purpose. While it can be seen as a money grab (profits made from this series will probably go toward the Persona 5 Animation, if there is one), it's just an entertaining review of the series itself....As P4's plot takes many turns, this movie may help you recollect what happened or explain a part you didn't get.The selling point of the movie is the aspects that made P4: The Animation an enjoyable watch. The sounds, soundtrack, characters etc. are all in par with the original show. The criticized art style this series has does not improve in the movie the but it doesn't get any worse. If you're used to this art style (which is why I recommend watching this soon after completing the Animation), you should be fine.Recaps can be discouraging but this one is acceptable. If you really need that refresher course or just have to see everything Persona 4, it's worth your time, or at least some of your time. If you've played the video game Persona 4 and the Animation clicked with you, Factor of Hope isn't a mandatory view but it's your call.

Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta... X,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42282/Otome_Game_no_Hametsu_Flag_shika_Nai_Akuyaku_Reijou_ni_Tensei_shiteshimatta_X,"['I know I wrote a review 2 months ago giving the anime a 3/10 before, but I never actually expected it to continue to be this bad. So here is full review of the entire season.I really dislike generic harem anime. The ones where the MC has a conversation with a new girl and suddenly, she falls for him with almot zero reasoning. So color me surprised when there was a show that is even worse than that. One that pushes that idea too far that just by looking at someone, the person falls for him regardless of their gender.Hamefura 2 is probably...the worst harem/reverse harem I have ever seen.*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINTS SPOILERS ***It has been a while since the last sequel that made me really disappointed in an anime. I guess it was to be expected for this one as the ending of the first season was fitting enough and a perfect stopping point. I liked the first season of Hamefura and I even gave it a 7/10 in my list but the moment season 2 was announced, I felt like it would be a repition of the first season but I didn\'t expect it to be this bad.To sum it up, the first season was following this pattern, MC is a goof and she meets someone, tries to avoid her death flag and then that person falls for her. There were some characters that had decent reasons that could justify that and some that just felt forced. This season however, the whole reasoning was thrown out of the window (bar 1 character).It goes as follows,Katarina: *Exists*Everyone: *Falls in love*It became even more shallow than the first season and the anime doesn\'t try to justify anything at this point. It\'s like they are telling us that because she is the MC, it is natural to fall for her. I have seen better in the worst harem anime that I have watched over the years.The characters didn\'t get better as well, they are either the same as season 1 or even got even worse.We have ones that stayed consistent like Maria and Nicol. You can even argue that a character like Alan became better.Then there are ones that got worse like Katarina who became downright stupid and Gerald and Keith who became way too annoying.The new characters have been nothing but fodder to add to the harem with Anne being the worst one out of them and Selena being the best.Finally, we have Mary who is pretty much the worst character in the anime with how obnoxious and rude she is. Probably the only character out of the cast that makes me wanna turn off the episode when she appears.The anime is also full of random cliches. It also had the same idea repeated through 2 consecutive arcs. The idea of a kidnapping happening. The anime also used very bad cliches to solve both of them and trying to make you feel sad for the characters which was just forced and annoying. I didn\'t expect it to become even worse than before.I get the idea that the anime is trying to maintain its over-the-top feeling but it isn\'t trying to do so at the moment. It\'s reusing the same idea a million times to the point it became stale. You could even have a counter of how many times the character were ""surprised"" by some random shit Katarina said even if it didn\'t make any sense at all. It also became unbearable how stupid katarina is when even after being pushed to bed and kissed, she still doesn\'t understand what was happening specially when her whole character before becoming Katarina was about her playing RomCom games.The anime no longer tries to do or justify anything which is a point I never saw in the worst harem shows that were being produced in 2018-2019.Overall, I would give it a generous 2/10. Great art but nothing else is worth watching bar like 1 or 2 episodes which I think one of them was a filler.Wouldn\'t recommend it. the worst harem/reverse harem I have ever seen.*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINTS SPOILERS ***It has been a while since the last sequel that made me really disappointed in an anime.

In short, if you liked season 1, you’ll love the second season as the stakes, plot and characterisation see dramatic improvements.Hamefura season 1 was one of the most talked about shows of 2020. It was really a breath of fresh air for the isekai genre. There hadn’t been many otome style isekai, focusing on female MC’s with harems. There was comedy, a ditzy MC and lots of fun slice of life moments. While the season was great, I feel it lacked depth at times. I struggled to really get an idea...of the direction of the story other than Bakarina having to eventually choose who she’d be with romantically.This season did a much better job of advancing the overall story, developing Bakarina and the side cast and creating drama. With the exception of a couple anime original episodes, I really enjoyed the more serious tone that we got this season. While that usual comedy is definitely still there, it does feel like there’s a lot more serious heartfelt moments with characters this time around. I think the pacing was awesome as well. The mini arcs that characters got in episodes were the perfect length and flowed seamlessly.The art is just as good as the first season, it feels like they picked up everything right where they left off. I hope that will be the case for a season 3 as well. Really, watching this is a no brainer if you enjoyed the first season you’ll find the improvements a welcome addition.I think Hamefura could be a turning point for the isekai genre and as a result we’ll see more Otome style isekai series adapted. While I love the usual OP male MC shows, it’s nice to get a change of pace, different scenery and a different type of story every now and again. Given the commercial success of the anime, BD and LN’s, I’m confident this is the start of something great.Hamefura X gets 9 out of 10. of the direction of the story other than Bakarina having to eventually choose who she’d be with romantically.This season did a much better job of advancing the overall story, developing Bakarina and the side cast and creating drama.

Where can they go from here ? We already had our everyone-remains-friends -route right?”But it seems like the author of my next life as a villainess knows his genre and its audience real well …..The most hurtful and flawed part of an harem anime is generally blue-balling the audience where in the confession almost happens but then is interrupted by  a PHONE call , accident or maybe the wind was blowing too hard AND MC couldn't HEAR HER etc which really frustrates the audience since...they are so into the moment and it all falls flat in the end , here however the only reason katerina is unaware of the others feeling is because she is an adorable baka and we will FORGIVE HERE BECAUSE KAWAII SELLS WELL imagine a male MC in place of katarina and surely many would drop the show within 6 episodes .What yall need to know is there is no major changes from season 1 , now this may not be tolerable for some people but those who want it , there is a season 2 and it is the same stuff as season 1 so don't get your hopes up over a conclusive ending and just show up for the ride okay? they are so into the moment and it all falls flat in the end , here however the only reason katerina is unaware of the others feeling is because she is an adorable baka and we will FORGIVE HERE BECAUSE KAWAII SELLS WELL imagine a male MC in place of katarina and surely many would drop the show within 6 episodes .What yall need to know is there is no major changes from season 1 , now this may not be tolerable for some people but those who want it , there is a season 2 and it is the same stuff as season 1 so don't get your hopes up over a conclusive ending and just show up for the ride okay?"", 'It\'s more of the dense Black Hole Bakarina and her reverse-harem dousing comedy bits on your screen! And you\'d think of this very question: ""Catarina has already friendzoned everyone, and the supposedly doom flag is pretty much gone now, so where could Season 2 go at the very least?""My answer to you: More relationship shenanigans with Catarina being love-blocked at every corner, especially with her love interests solidified that is Geordo, the adopted brother Keith, and the rest of the character cast whom doesn\'t want to let Catarina go for their own embellishments. And embrace it with fun, laughter and happiness...down by a notch.To compare...the story elements between both seasons, Season 2 takes a noticeably deeper dive into the side quest that is the whole ""dark magic"" realm with the engagement with the Department of Magic in dealing with new issues with the head of the Deparment of Magic Larna Smith. Some new characters are weaved into this scenario, like Rufus Brode in the whole Stuart family debacle of becoming king, and Keith of his status as ths son of a mistress in the complicatedness of the Claes family name. In the midst of all of this, the dense Catarina will always be dense, but at least she is made aware of their advances which are more fervent and with motive than the last.Other than that, everything is pretty much the same as what you\'d expect of Season 1 in the same tried-and-true forumla with a few improvements on Silver Link\'s part, and an OST which I felt that while it was good, it was a step downwards. So if you liked what the prequel showed, then the sequel here will not disappoint you, and vice versa if otherwise. the story elements between both seasons, Season 2 takes a noticeably deeper dive into the side quest that is the whole ""dark magic"" realm with the engagement with the Department of Magic in dealing with new issues with the head of the Deparment of Magic Larna Smith.

It managed to develop every single character decently without wasting much time and brought with them a good story.With that said, this season has been, for me, a huge letdown. Every single character around Catarina blatantly shows their love towards her, but, despite that, she seems to be unaware of how much they truly love her, like she has some sort of mental disadvantage. I know she's created as a dense character on purpose, but it's overly exaggerated. Adding on, she seems to like everyone around her and fills them with compliments but never actually develops...feelings for them. She lacks personality.The story seemed to be developing interestingly at the start of this season but went downhill from there. No actual relations are set around Catarina's circle of friends since they only love HER, and SHE has to be the one they get engaged with, while the only thing Catarina loves is food.Little to no action has happened so far, which brings me to the score of 4 out of 10.In conclusion, this has basically been a boring version of a Harem, lacking any possible story enjoyment whatsoever. feelings for them.

Its story was eh, but when you watch it, it\'s fun.Art was great, sound wasn\'t really noticeable (imo) and the characters, oh man the characters. Since their gimmick was introduced in season 1, I wont really touch on that. So, the characters, they are very fun to watch and their interactions are hilarious, but their mindless obsession to Katarina just takes away points for me. I know that that is a trope in harem, but damn do they take it to the max, however, that\'s what makes the show good. Let me explain,...the over the top character tropes are what makes the show enjoyable and fun to watch, but at the cost of the overall character rating.(APPROACHING ACTUAL SPOILERS)New characters. First is Sora, he basically kidnapped Katarina and fell in love with her, classic Katarina. He\'s purpose is basically, ""I was bad, but now I\'m good, we get his sob story and that\'s about it. Thought, he adds to the overall story, indirectly setting up Katarina\'s and Geordo and playing as a companion in the rescue Keith arc. Next, is Lana, she\'s just there to expand the world and to bring more things about magic and stuff. Then there\'s, Frey and Ginger, Ginger is just a Katarina admirer, that is all, and Frey who is inspired by Katarina and has a date with Nicol. They don\'t add much to the overall story, just new harem members I guess. Last, is the bear (Alexander), he\'s just comic relief. Then again, this whole show is comic relief with a dash of cringe and clichés.Next, my main problem, the story. Ok so, the story is very wacky and weird. first, you have kidnapping of Katarina, this gives a love interest and accomplishes nothing, except make the harem more protective. They give no real motive behind the kidnapping, because ""I was just being used"". This arc also brings Katarina to realize that Geordo actually loves her, which is a nice plot point and is really fun to watch. Next is the Magic Association mini-arc. tbh I was excited, because they would expand on the magic, but no, they just added magic items, and not the characters using magic, so that was a disappointment. Last, is the Keith kidnapping arc, more dark magic shenanigans and Keith confessing love. This part was pretty cringe, but most  last arcs are cringe and full of clichés. Then the ending, in harem fashion, ends with no one winning, and it basically staying the same, other than the growth of Katarina and Keith. Their growth basically is, Katarina, realizes that people actually lover her and that makes her feel flustered and Keith, who is now open about his love for his sister. Still, I enjoyed watching it, because of the stupid nonsense, since this anime is just stupid nonsense ( I really can\'t stop stressing this point).Overall, cringe at times, decent character development, wacky shenanigans, but still being very enjoyable.(Note I kinda forgot most of the details of the plot, I think this is accurate  tho) the over the top character tropes are what makes the show enjoyable and fun to watch, but at the cost of the overall character rating.(APPROACHING ACTUAL SPOILERS)New characters.

Loved it. This is the first reversed harem I love. Some characters were kind of bland but others I absolutely loved. The plot seems to be growing stronger as each episode passes. The art is great, especially how they were able to convey a certain setting so perfectly with the lighting and such. The perspectives were amazing as well. Voice acting? Amazing. Some episodes were a bit boring others were some of my favorites of all the anime I've watched (which is a lot).Do I recommend it? Yes absolutely if harem/romance is your thing. Can't wait for more!I enjoyed this so much and...I hope more people discover it.If you loved the first season, you'll love this too. If you want more battling between the rivals for her love, you've got it right here. I hope more people discover it.If you loved the first season, you'll love this too.

Also, some of these shows can still make the viewer reflect, relate, root for a character to win because you developed symphathy by it, its not only pure entertaiment.Hamefura S2 overuses the first part and completely ignore the last one.The show ultimately lost it interesting premise of S1, the touching moments like in the irl side of the MC in S1, back there she had a purpose for...her actions, she affected the other characters in a more meaningful way. Actions actually matters back then and the MC was committed, it had a purpose.Now Hamefura S2 is unimaginative. It got worse. Every single comedy gag is a copy pasta of what we got in S1. Hell, we even got an episode that was the same in S1, but in a different setting. Katarina says the most frivolous things that she barely gave much thought about it and other characters buys it right away fixing the ""problem"". They even advance physically in order to provoke her, but the show insists to take that effort and put it in the trash.The tropes are multiplied by 100, specially Katarina\'s dense mechanism. It is so over the top that render any moves a character do to improve anything with their relationship status with her pointless. It\'s so aggravating that a guy on top of her in bed kissing her neck is considered  by her ""that was just a mosquito bite"". When kissed she even tried to distort reality and thought it was a dream, even when the kisser do it again right after, she negates, blush or whatever and that stituation never actually makes her reflect, care or debate in her head what she gotta do, how to react, what\'s going to happen with their relationship the other day. Interactions have no continuity.This is beyond a comedy formula, you ruin the most potential move a character can do with her (a kiss) in other to spice the harem, and you just ignore character development or any character progression whatsoever. It\'s insane. It\'s not funny anymore when you just realize any interaction with the MC will be disposable 10s later and never brought back again. This is my biggest criticism as any action a character do is not meaningful. You don\'t do this with your story ever, even if you prioritize the comedy aspect (that\'s subpar) you just ruined the romance part.The problems are just solved so easily, sometimes painful to get involved when things are so simple, effortless. I think the episode I have the most fun wasn\'t a comedic one, but when they developed Nicol\'s struggles with the introduction of a new character that was a breath of fresh air. It\'s hard to say, but when things are supposed to have Katarina as the center of attention, the anime becomes so predictable and bland that the outcome isn\'t rewarding. It were indeed a few instances where I could laugh because it wasn\'t a gag used in S1.The designs are fine, but the animation is pretty poor, with a static model of the character in place and just the mouth moving, if you\'re attentive this may hurt your experience.Overall disappointed with S2. I thought they could be at least funnier and creative with the many situations presented. That the characters that got development and realized their feelings and decided to take action torwards the MC could be at least rewarded. This show is stagnated, it is in an endless spiral of overused trope lines, repetitive gags and mired relationship - with every character in the same spot as S1, because kisses are irrelevant, confessions doesn\'t affect the MC for more than one episode.

It honestly feels like it never left the first, or least feels like as if we've stepped into the next episode, right after the previous one. Continuing on our adventures with our beloved Katarina and her friends, as they not only continue their lives, but their school life. But how is the story?The story seems to have taken a little more serious route. Not that the first wasn't serious, but more that with a lot of the supposed doom flags done and dusted, now it's time to focus on...the new path of the story, and each and every week, it's honestly keeping me glued to the screen. Not just from the story either, there are other elements too. Like of course, Katarina's own failings to read a situation clearly, providing some very comedic moments, which are just borderline funny, much like how they were in the first series.I for one, can't wait to see how this progresses.The art and sound almost feel a little more on the up. As if it's more colourful in areas, and darker in others, some nice touches there. The style of this show has always been great to look at, from te art itself, the colours of backgrounds, outfits, the works. Top notch stuff. While the sound? It's good as usual from this show, not a foot wrong on either end.The second season has been a steady fun experience so far, and will only progress better and better! So pick it up, watch season one if you have not, and let's go watch the second season together! the new path of the story, and each and every week, it's honestly keeping me glued to the screen.

Like of course, Katarina's own failings to read a situation clearly, providing some very comedic moments, which are just borderline funny, much like how they were in the first series.I for one, can't wait to see how this progresses.The art and sound almost feel a little more on the up. As if it's more colourful in areas, and darker in others, some nice touches there. The style of this show has always been great to look at, from te art itself, the colours of backgrounds, outfits, the works. Top notch stuff. While the sound? It's good as usual from this show, not a foot wrong on either end.The second season has been a steady fun experience so far, and will only progress better and better! So pick it up, watch season one if you have not, and let's go watch the second season together!"", ""Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika Nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shiteshimatta... X (2021)Honestly, I did wonder where they would go with this season since it sort of ended last time. I thought maybe a spanner in the works but no it's just a reverse harem which is fine don't get me wrong but it has 100% detracted from the purpose of the anime in the first place. There is no doom route in this season until you see the end which has led to a movie but that is the very end.This is just a reverse harem with a slice of life actions...and an occasional 'oh no' moment. It is just a group of people doting on the main character constantly to a point of not being characters anymore rather more dogs barking love me.Art wise it is a nice looking show, it does have flaws and drops quality drastically randomly for tiny moments and that is not good. If a game dropped graphics every time you went through a door it wouldn't be a great thing anymore.The sound is standard for the show, I did enjoy the first season op coming back at the last episode to close it off with.Characters now are soulless, they have no purpose but to dote on Caterina which would be fine but that show is about the main character avoiding doom flags not being like this. Quite a lot of NTR people seem to want to be doing in this one too since boundaries of engagement don't matter.I would say this comes across more like an epilogue since nothing really happens in regard to the story itself and somehow they managed to stretch that out into 12 episodes. If they had just done what they show at the end of episode 12 as the season then it would have been marvellous. Slap on OVA in between the seasons to catch us up and get straight on with the doom flags. They did not do this and it has ruined the show in this season.3/10. and an occasional 'oh no' moment.

Im not particularly a fan of the stupid harem lead who never catches on that ppl are in love with them, but season 1 had charm, interesting plot, and backstory for the characters.Season 2 is a complete waste of time. There is hardly any character development to be found. No plot. Its like watching a bunch of filler episodes. It's not very funny and as some said before alot of the characters come off as annoying. By halfway through the season i found myself skipping thru alot of the episodes.If one really has to...give it a try then watch a few episodes. If you find yourself enjoying then youll be fine with the rest, if you think they are boring then just stop cus it doesnt get any better. give it a try then watch a few episodes.

I went into this with an open mind because I enjoyed the first season quite a bit, and was horribly disappointed with this. In retrospect, it was predictable that it would fail, because the second season really has no purpose apart from worshiping the main character.None of the characters are memorable apart from the fact that they all like Katarina for one reason or another. I struggle to even remember their names; they literally barely even have a personality. That was more forgivable in the first season which did have a purpose,...but the second season is all about the characters--and the weakness of the anime really starts to show.This was a complete waste of time for me. Now the third season seems like it's going to be even more bloated with too many characters--which was already a problem to begin with. but the second season is all about the characters--and the weakness of the anime really starts to show.This was a complete waste of time for me.

The element (kidnapping, etc.) that has been used to progress the story has been recycled throughout the season. To put it simply-- it's plain boring and offers nothing new to the audience.  I just continued watching it for the sake of completing this anime.The harem genre often follows a certain pattern and is full of cliches.MC *exist*and then everyone falls in love.They attempted to push the story forward by having character development (Nicol, Geordo, Keith, Mary), but they failed in the execution. Mary, specifically, gets more annoying. Sora...is the only new character that has more depth than the established main cast.OSTs and sound are pretty mediocre, and the only saving grace of this anime is the art, which is as good as season 1.Overall, I rated this anime 5/10 as it is average in pretty much everything—just your average cliche harem but with no exciting development. is the only new character that has more depth than the established main cast.OSTs and sound are pretty mediocre, and the only saving grace of this anime is the art, which is as good as season 1.Overall, I rated this anime 5/10 as it is average in pretty much everything—just your average cliche harem but with no exciting development."", 'My daughter and I enjoyed Season 1 very much. It was cute, light and funny, and the characters were likeable and the progression of their relationships with the MC and why they all loved her were fairly believable within the suspension of disbelief that comes from knowing you\'re watching a harem anime. She actually did help them all grow and overcome some things, and they had an entire child- and teen-hood to become close to each other.However, in Season 2 her cluelessness about their feelings for her was no longer excusable, cute or silly; it was extremely frustrating, particularly since some of them...started getting much more forthright in their wooing. The ""who are they going to fall for?"" plot device cannot be stretched this thin without breaking. By episode 10 we were ready to throw things at the screen every time she said, ""Huuhh??"" or did not understand what a character meant even by an outright declaration or clear demonstration of romantic love. This is a person who loved otome games and romance novels so there is NO WAY she could be this clueless. And even if she was, did either of her moms not teach her ANYTHING about sex or relationships? She\'s 17, for goodness\' sake. The excuse the writers give her is that she thinks so little of herself that she can\'t imagine anyone would love her that way. Oh how noble, she\'s so humble. Nope, it makes her look like an absolute idiot the entire season. And her reactions when someone went \'further\' than she was comfortable with was not cute or funny but just weird.I actually enjoyed the first arc because the new ""love interest"" she meets is the first one who is immediately up front with her about his attraction and she also expresses more open admiration for him as a person than I recall her doing with any of her other friends. And she doesn\'t recoil at his advances. So I actually kind of got my hopes up that maybe he was ""the one"" she would end up with. But nothing went anywhere with that the rest of the season and it focused on the other people, and he became just one more groupie.There is almost zero story progression. It takes the entirety of season 2 (instead of the first few episodes as we expected) to even progress to the point where two of her suitors have finally gotten Catarina to realize they are in love with her and it\'s only because one of them said it loudly in her face, understandably frustrated at her complete cluelessness, and the other kept \'wooing\' her with gifts and clear advances. And even AFTER they did this, she went into one of their rooms to show him her new PJs and the guy did the best thing in the entire season: exhorted her to realize they\'re all now adults and that people are sexually attracted to her, and not to put herself in situations she\'s not ready for. (If you\'ve seen Ouran HSHC, he used the same tactic as Kyoya did.) When he asked her how she could still not realize he was in love with her after he actually outright told her, she said, ""I thought it was a dream."" That is the laziest possible writing right there.And of course they ALL still love her and want her to \'choose\' them, not just the two whom she finally knows do. So they\'re all still at square one in the relationship department. And now for Season 3 there are even MORE characters being introduced who, in her previous world, show up in the sequel game, so of course the same thing happens in the game world.

Catarina once again excels in being what fans have come to call ""Bakarina"": an amusing yet charismatically caring buffoon who seems eternally oblivious, but manages to stumble backwards into solving problems with her friends and her five brain cells. The dissonance between the situation and how Catarina perceives (or doesn\'t perceive) it makes for great comedy and permeates much of season two. The large, jovial, central crew of characters who came to love and admire Catarina in the first season reprise their roles,...remaining great friends with one another aside from the sparks of romantic rivalry, and continue to showcase their personalities when the central cast faces dilemmas.Having cleared the doom flags of Fortune Lover, Catarina has been freed from the shackles of turning into the archetypal otome game villainess. However, without that clear threat looming over the protagonist, most of this second season could possibly be titled ""The Hijinks of Catarina Claes and the Friends She Made Along the Way"". There\'s not really a broader plot that ties the season together aside from the romantic tension that Catarina has helped foment between essentially all of the core cast. One could reasonably argue that Hamefura X counts as slice-of-life. There\'s a lot of screentime dedicated to backstories for new secondary characters and throwbacks/callbacks to previous events (such as before the season 1 timeskip). Several episodes are wholly dedicated to opening and closing a particular incident or story ""arc"", nipping the bud for any further growth of the story. It takes until episode 9 for the show to take itself a little more seriously and hold and develop a plot point with stakes for more than one episode. These serve to flesh out the characters and their attitudes, but might be a drag for viewers wanting more forward progression. The backstories and the diversions that lead to them can be fun and intriguing, but many ultimately don\'t contribute a whole lot to the plot, and some of the introduced characters don\'t add a whole lot. In fact, one of the episodes is essentially a recycling of an episode from season 1 re-envisioned in a different setting. The characters don\'t change substantially throughout the season, though some of these diversions give them some additional depth.As a whole, Hamefura X doesn\'t particularly stand out as far as comedic reverse harems are concerned, but viewers who liked the comedy and characters from the first season and their united pining for Catarina will probably enjoy season two, with clearer romantic beats. Those looking for a renewed focus from season two or a deeper dive into the ""escape from an otome game fate"" storyline from the first season may be left wanting more.

Never before had I seen such a carefree, bisexual, romantic comedy. Every element was done so well. This is, in large part, a worth sequel. In many ways it's an absolute catastrophe though. I'll just focus on what it screws up, as if you liked the first season you'll like this one (outside of stuff I mention)First up let's talk about Geordo. He was just another suitor in the first season with his own motivations. His character gets more context in this season but all character depth is removed, he becomes someone who, on multiple occasions, forces himself on Katarina...and the rest of the time demands that he owns her, that she's nothing more than a possession of his. He actually gets into an argument at one stage with the others where they're saying she's her own woman and he's saying no, she's my possession. The fact that in this otherwise progressive comedy this is acceptable is insulting. By the way, he's not painted as a bad guy in all this, it's her fault for being oblivious and wanting friends.Second is dark magic. It goes from being a malevolent force to just 'Because dark magic. Something bad happen? Dark magic. Drop your coffee? Dark magic. It's absurd. When they try and raise the tension and tell a story arc it's obvious it's going to be 'because dark magic'. This'd be fine if they didn't dedicate half the season to these idiotic arcs. One dimensional bad guys are another issue, but let's be honest here that's a real issue in anime in general.The second season takes time away from the fun characters and replaces it with fake arcs and one line jokes and a deeply flawed obsession with Geordo. It feels more like The Matrix 2 and Aliens, in movie terms.Katarina remains a fun and powerful protagonist and at times the writing is better than S1, but for the most part it really feels like the writing/author has no-where to go and is desperately out of ideas.SPOILER(ISH)This last point is most obvious in the set up for the movie/next season.

While Season 1 was enjoyable, since it dealt with Catarina trying to avoid her doom flags, Season 2 falls flat. There is no main plot of Season 2. Each episode is somewhat its own mini-sub-plot with no major correlation to the previous episodes (except some mini plot). Catarina's character was enjoyable in Seasons 1, however, in Season 2 I found her to be super annoying. There has been no character development in over 24 episodes (12+12). She has remained the same simple minded, dense, optimist. She has never realized how...she impacted the storyline, nor any other character's feelings for her when it was blatantly obvious. She is always so focused on her doom flags that she never stops to think about anything else.Regarding other characters, Mary Hunt's obsession is borderline toxic and creepy. It surpasses the boundaries of friendship and develops into toxic yandere behavior. The whole plot of Keith being a love interest is super uncomfortable since he is her adopted brother and distant cousin. Overall, there is no depth for why they like Catarina except the fact that she was nice to them.In addition, it is highly unrealistic that out of the 7 LIs, not one moved on (knowing full well she is engaged to Geordo). The lack of insight and retrospection in each character is astonishing. All the LI's basically have a pack mentality and feel the need to be present every moment with Catarina. After a while, it becomes hard to differential between them.Perhaps my added displeasure comes from watching S2 right after S1.

If it wasn't for Sora's story (which I loved) and the ending, it definitely wouldn't have been a 7. It was messy, mostly no explication given, boring and felt more like a filler than an actual season. The possesive harem gets more and more annoying, with Mary and prince Geordo becoming totally unlikeable in the end. It isn't funny anymore; it's just annoying and unecessary. Catarina's oblivion to anything romantic also becomes unamusing at some parts, like you just can't be THAT much of an airhead, you know?Aside the downgrade of characters that sometimes are just straight up stupid...and annoying (ahem, the older prince that has an obsession with his little brothers), the story also wasn't... anything.

While the characters are enjoyable and offer some good chemistry when on screen together, the main issue here is that the focal point of the series no longer exists. Catarina Claes is no longer in danger based on the rules of the game world is based on. This lends itself to both a positive and negative point about this season. The Positive is that this season holds what made the first season enjoyable, but the negative is that a significant portion of this season (I'd...say almost a third of it) can feel like a waste of time as the season can come off as padding time in order to hit that 12 episode mark.The main takeaway here is that if you really liked the first season, then you probably will like this season as well.

And since I watched season two right after season one, the bad qualities of this season were really highlighted in comparison to the last, not that it was perfect but definitely better than whatever they thought they were trying to accomplish in this season.Firstly, any good story needs some sort of character development in order to feel like it's progressing somewhere. Absolutely nothing changed between seasons one and two. Everything ridiculous was kept intact, and there was little to no development in the characters and the storyline. It felt like all they were...doing was stalling time for 12 episodes. In many areas it was totally unrealistic how the female lead would get out of situations (by asking for snacks, and being nice, seriously?!).The premise of the story was captivating - a villainness trying to escape her doom - but the end result was so exaggerated. Eight different people who are all somewhat in love with her, and the anime did not even bother to conclude even ONE of those storylines. They just dragged the story on and on with ridiculous sub-plots that did not move anything forward.This season was really disappointing, and I felt like a large chunk of my life was wasted by investing in it. doing was stalling time for 12 episodes.

Without a doubt, there are a lot of things in the 2nd season that I enjoyed, such as the addition of new characters, the opening song (way better than season 1\'s opening), moments to make you smile, and getting to know about the past of the characters in more detail, but all these good parts seem to have been overshadowed by the 2 biggest flaws of season two, which I will be discussing in detail...(Nope no spoilers so rest easy).The first flaw of season 2 is the episodes that exist just for the sake of completing the 12 episode requirement. These episodes do not make sense as to why they are there because they neither sync with the previous episode nor the next episode. Not to mention that whatever is shown in that episode is not ever again mentioned and holds 0 importance to the plot. They are just randomly there cause y\'know, gotta complete 12 episodes.The second and in my opinion the biggest flaw of season 2 is none other than our protagonist Catarina Claes. Her personality which I enjoyed in season 1 had become the most annoying thing in season 2. Her so-called refreshing personality which comprises of her being happy-go-lucky, talkative, and naive may have been suitable for season 1, but this time it\'s making her look purely dumb. No matter how optimistic and cheerful you are, there is a thing called as normal human response to a situation which Catarina definitely doesn\'t display. There are so many scenes that are straight-up infuriating and will internally make you scream ""WHY IS SHE SO STUPID!? "" or ""THAT\'S NOT EVEN THE CORRECT WAY TO REACT TO THIS SITUATION"" I know that her personality is like that to make stuff funny, but it\'s not funny. Then, there comes an intriguing question that Catarina was a high school girl in her previous life and she plays otome games then how come she is so oblivious to the advances that male characters make at her and their feelings? She should be the first one to figure it out. To sum it up, she\'s the dumb shoujo manga heroine stereotype which the author has covered up by the whole Villainess concept.Do I recommend Hamefura 2? Sure, watch it, after all, everyone has their own opinions, and you might enjoy it more than the first season. (Nope no spoilers so rest easy).The first flaw of season 2 is the episodes that exist just for the sake of completing the 12 episode requirement. These episodes do not make sense as to why they are there because they neither sync with the previous episode nor the next episode. Not to mention that whatever is shown in that episode is not ever again mentioned and holds 0 importance to the plot. They are just randomly there cause y\'know, gotta complete 12 episodes.The second and in my opinion the biggest flaw of season 2 is none other than our protagonist Catarina Claes. Her personality which I enjoyed in season 1 had become the most annoying thing in season 2. Her so-called refreshing personality which comprises of her being happy-go-lucky, talkative, and naive may have been suitable for season 1, but this time it\'s making her look purely dumb. No matter how optimistic and cheerful you are, there is a thing called as normal human response to a situation which Catarina definitely doesn\'t display. There are so many scenes that are straight-up infuriating and will internally make you scream ""WHY IS SHE SO STUPID!? "" or ""THAT\'S NOT EVEN THE CORRECT WAY TO REACT TO THIS SITUATION"" I know that her personality is like that to make stuff funny, but it\'s not funny. Then, there comes an intriguing question that Catarina was a high school girl in her previous life and she plays otome games then how come she is so oblivious to the advances that male characters make at her and their feelings? She should be the first one to figure it out. To sum it up, she\'s the dumb shoujo manga heroine stereotype which the author has covered up by the whole Villainess concept.Do I recommend Hamefura 2? Sure, watch it, after all, everyone has their own opinions, and you might enjoy it more than the first season.', ""Imma be honest, I didn't enjoy this season as much as the first. The harem got to big, Caterina even got dumber and more oblivious, and the episodes just seemed random and like filler. Caterina is also too forgiving and has zero sense of danger even when being kidnapped. She honestly has become an annoying character to me. They also kept using the same kidnapping plot over and over again which got annoying as well. I honestly think they should've focused on Caterina's relationships more and give hints on who she is falling in love with instead of her being taking advantage of all the...time by three specific characters . Like the anime/manga Kiss Him Not Me did an excellent job at making a harem but also making the mc slowly understand who she likes the most and picking someone and it making sense.

With Keith it's just kind of creepy cause she clearly sees him as a brother and nothing else, but not only does Geordo have no sense of boundaries, his character is so bland and two dimensional he makes Nicol seem interesting. The way he kept kissing her without her consent was just gross.I knew from the very first ep based on the intro that the season would...take this route but I honestly didn't think it'd be as bad as it was. I wish Maria had gotten even 1/4th of that screentime, as she was the most appealing love interest imo and unlike all the others, she seemed to respect Catarina's pace a lot more instead of forcing herself onto her like everyone else did. At least with Mary it was played up as comedy but they really expected us to swoon with Geordo's bullshit and i was NOT having it.The comedy in general wasn't as funny as the previous season's either BUT the ending was extremely funny, so i'll give them that. take this route but I honestly didn't think it'd be as bad as it was.

Yes, you will. Think of it like The Hobbit...franchise. It’s much worse than LotR, but at least it’s a chance for you to revisit that world and spend some more time in it.

I believe it’s fine to have an arc like that in your story where multiple individuals compete for the protagonist’s affection before you establish your OTP, but on the condition that you actually do establish your OTP and then move on with the story, and you also don’t take 400 episodes to do it.

Towards the last couple of episodes, I was certainly begging for it to just end already.

It was one of those where you wish there would be more of for each episode you watch. It had great characters, a fresh take on Isekai in the anime scene and Catarina was fun to follow, and the harem took shape in a somewhat decent manner (both girls and boys and enough difference between characters yet not really any...extremes) where everyone could shine.However, the first season was a strong story because of clear progression. It had a premise that was easy to understand and with a clear finish line. It is in the title after all. So how would a second season of this actually turn out when the first one had such a strong finish? Well, what we got was a second season that feels very lacking but kinda paradoxical because they are very similar. A shining moment of the previous season was how it handled childhood and dared to spend a lot of time on it. You have a lot of childhood scenes in this as well, but this time as flashbacks which is not really as impactful. The protag acts the same, but this time it feels like everyone is more of a Sisyphus (rolling a boulder up a hill that always comes down), since ""some"" try hard yet get little to no actual response in the end.One of the biggest problems is what others point out, which is Catarina herself. She has the nickname of ""bakarina"", being stupid, to many IRL and that factor is way too forced in the show as the characters tries to make more ""adult"" moves on her, and she win OS for mental gymnastics every time. They try to balance out the harem like so many other harems having a dense protagonist, but this one is straight out stupid for logic and for love, or rather denser than titanium since she does get clues somewhat, and she does see it but forget and choose to forget. It makes you wonder if she actually sees these people as humans, or if she is still playing a game despite the last seasons ending. What are these characters to her? Friends? There is nothing wrong in not wanting something more and Catarina does seem to care for others but only when things go wrong as otherwise she preoccupies herself in her own joy and food. The longest character arc starts by addressing this yet nothing seemed to be learned after it. There is charm in being the way she is, but it is also growing as an annoyance as the characters get older.This leads into another big problem and that is that as a harem and catering to ""shipping"" this season was unbalanced in screen-time. Mainly because they introduce another strong male candidate and also focuses on side characters to an extent and shove the girls aside for arcs more involving the men. The result is a series which should have episodes about all previous characters getting some points in or falling harder feel like having cast aside some characters and introduce new characters which are harder to care about, and it looks like that is how they will go on with the upcoming movie.Despite feeling like an unfocused season bordering to total filler, it actually happens a lot in it. It had me intrigued to know what would happen and kept me engaged, but as each episode went on, I did not find the same joy as I did when watching the first season.Like many others it would be easy to say that I was disappointed and while I would not say this series is a masterpiece like its predecessor it still glued me to the screen like a must-see anime.The sound design and music felt the same.The art looked the same.The ending was better this season, but the OP took some time for me to warm up to.The story might be similar to the LN, did not read it, but this season\'s story was by far its downside despite confessions, kisses and whatnot.The real conundrum is if I want to give it 7 or 8 in score.

So take it like that.', ""This feels like it suffers from a sort of second season curse. The interesting part of the story ended with season one and all season two does is turn the series into a sitcom. There doesn't feel to be any direction, just hijinks. The first season was well-rounded, even if I don't care for harem anime. Though I will admit, with harem anime, there is an expectation from me that the potential love interests to start being narrowed down and a deeper, cuter romance start to blossom. This feels like it just tries to add on more love interests because how wacky would that be,...right? Well... the story is starting to feel more shallow as a result.In fact, certain scenes - like a play they put on - start to feel absolutely cringey. Like cringe to the point of getting physically uncomfortable.The main narrative journey was completed in season one, and while there was potential for season two... the second season feels aimless and unguided. They have taken the show's premise to its completion, and now all you have left is a sitcom seemingly devoid of narrative structure, with random happenings sprinkled here and there. right?

Did they need to make a season 2? Nope. But we got one anyway, and this was good. The misadventures of Catarina still holds true and it's nearly a masterpiece in my book. Honestly, I prefer the...1st season but the 2nd season still holds it's flame regardless if it should have happened or not.Honestly, if they make a season 3.

How she managed to make everyone fall in love with her but still being totally oblivious.All of this changed for me in the 2nd season. Since she managed to pass the bad endings the only thing that was left for her was her romance options. This is where the story really fell...apart for me.

All Routes Lead to Blue Balls X.Catarina is back and she is just as loveably stupid as she was in season 1.Now that we\'re pasted the ""game"" section of Catarina\'s life the story start to expand on the world, it\'s politics and delves a bit deeper into the lives and relatives of the main cast. The season does kick off with an absolute banger of a first episode which had me in stitches as it re-introduces Catarina\'s accidental harem members as well as other characters of which Catarina has accidentally seduced through sheer stupidity.I enjoyed the...direction the story went for the most part. The first arc had Catarina reverse Stockholm Syndrome her own kidnapper, the second arc was used to expand on some of the newer characters as well as look back on the crews childhoods to give more context as to why Catarina\'s kindness had such an effect on them growing up and the third arc revolves around another kidnapping.There was some very good character developing moments throughout the season. I really enjoyed how bold the harem members are becoming toward Catarina now. Geordo especially doesn\'t shy away from kissing her to make his feelings perfectly clear and I like how Alan and Mary knowing that the other loves Catarina (even though they\'re engaged to each other) started to form a tag team like relationship to help each other which was fun to see. The only character who didn\'t have any stand out moments was Maria and I felt she was very under-utilised throughout the season. I also think Nicol got robbed of some proper character development in his own stand alone episode which was a shame. It went in an excellent direction, but had a very unsatisfying conclusion.And as much as I love Catarina I did get to a point where I sometimes had enough of her own stupidity, especially during the last arc where tensions are supposedly high. She does own up to own foolishness and admits that she needs to become smarter which is great, but I highly doubt that will actually happen.The last arc itself is the only real problem I had with the show. It involves a kidnapping so I won\'t spoil it for you if you haven\'t watched it yet, but though the characters say that there\'s no time to waste and that they had to find said person as quickly as possible their actions are very relaxed and slow paced and creates a narrative dissonance for the viewer. At worst it becomes boring.Overall I had fun with Villainess X. I don\'t think it\'s quite as good as the first season and there were a few bumps here and there in it\'s narrative, but I consider this to be one of the good light novel adaptations out there and when the world finally realises that *sigh* light novels are the source of all our problems I will save a few copies from the grand light novel book burning to keep for myself.7/10 Good. direction the story went for the most part.

Yes, I do believe this is better than season 1, despite the fact, or rather because the main plot line is over.So it came as a shock that despite the recency bias, season 2 of Hamefura is somehow performing worse than its first season on MyAnimeList. At the beginning I thought that maybe my opinion wasn\'t the absolute truth, maybe people were entitled to their own opinions and had as much of a right to dislike this season than I did have my right to enjoy it.Of course, I quickly dismissed that idea, as it would imply...that I\'m wrong, and in comes this review, telling the people who disliked it that they watched this anime wrong and telling those who didn\'t feel like watching a season 2 that they actually should.So, let\'s think about the most important thing first. Season 1 started and finished the whole plot line of ""MC gets thrown into another world as Catarina Claes, evil rival of an otome game where the vilainess has no good ending"". This is true, arguing against that is pointless. So now the question is: How can an anime that has completed its plot can be any good? And to that, allow me to ask another question. What was the major strength of Hamefura?The answer is of course the characters. While the story served as a decent hook, personally, I lost interest when put in front of the cast, which took the social setting of the higher class and combined it with the chaotic energy of Catarina to create something unique when it comes to the otome game type (speaking out of my ass, but I could be right).So what remains from the anime is actually its biggest strength, its characters. Now the author is free to expand on the world, deepen their characters and basically take us to a whole \'nother kind of ride.And what a ride it was. By the end of it, a non negligible part of our cast grew better, a new character was introduced and a new mystery appeared. Overall, it was a great use of 12 episodes, everything had a purpose and nothing felt rushed.Although, it did lose one point because of what the last episode tried to pull off.

I actually binged it in about a day or so and thought it was a really fun new anime. It was almost therapeutic in a way how things moved along in a fun happy go lucky type of way.That being said, this new season has been a pretty big unfortunate let down. After Catarina effectively stops her doom in the first season, the second season picks up with little direction. Everyone is still infatuated with Catarina to the point where, it's kinda weird...now, and it consumes them almost completely.There are a few fun episodes, the play they put on comes to mind, however this time around the show seems to have trouble re-establishing its footing. It takes way to long for this season to re-establish where it was trying to go, and by the time it gets there, it feels like its over.I am getting kinda tired of the villains present in the show too, very quickly confrontations are completely thwarted because the villain cant help but admire Catarina so much that they become good, and no repercussion follows as Catarina just forgives them cause that's what she does. It makes these conflicts feel like they carry little to no weight.If you liked the first season, you will probably ultimately like the second, however don't expect a whole lot going into this season. Without the doom time line and the overarching story, we get a very messy follow up that takes too long to find its ultimate footing. now, and it consumes them almost completely.There are a few fun episodes, the play they put on comes to mind, however this time around the show seems to have trouble re-establishing its footing.

This is still a generic Slice of Life story more than anything..The annoyance that is harems was lessened a LOT compared to the first season and subsequently became more enjoyable. And with Geordo finally being more assertive, the conflated love from Bakarina's harem members was finally dampened as they realize their feelings are 1) unreciprocated, and 2) never going to be reciprocated. Even tho most aren't actually *in* love with her. Side note: those with actual...romantic love are Geordo and the new romantic rival, Sora. The others are still just conflating their love for her with romantic yearning.The plotline no longer pretends to have a plot, allowing this Slice of Life a much more entertaining story.

Unfortunately, the lack of progression in story and character relationships make me doubt this season is worth watching unless we have a solid story continuation in a season 3 (or the movie).STORY (6): There just wasn't much of a sense of progression this season. Relationships looked like they were beginning to change, but they kind of fell back to where they were before instead of developing the cast. The beginning and last couple of episodes had story arcs....I think the second story arc was weakened by slow pacing, not much active action by the characters present, and a lack of detail in the mystery set-up.Outside the two arcs were standalone episodes of varying quality. There was an episode that just felt like a repeat of one of the fillers from the first season, so that just felt reused, and some episodes didn't feel particularly memorable.Filler isn't necessarily bad: there was filler that delved into Geordo and Nicol as individuals that was excellent character building, and I found those bits more interesting than the actual final arc of the season. The last episode's stinger holds promise, and I hope that potential follows through.CHARACTER (7): Catarina, while still charming, is beginning to incite some frustration because she doesn't seem to grow as a character. I think members of the harem are beginning to outshine her. Catarina's status as a reincarnation also isn't quite touched upon or plays a strong role in the story, especially compared to when her reincarnated identity is what fueled the plot for season 1.It was great to see some characters take more action, especially in regards to the harem. Unfortunately, some cast favorites may have been sidelined in favor for the new characters. The new cast members do add a lot to the world of Socier, especially people at the Ministry of Magic and even some characters from foreign lands. They each have personality and some even complete small character arcs that solidify them as characters that can stand independent of the harem.PRESENTATION (8): The animation feels a little more stiff than the first season, but perhaps that's because quality bumps were saved for some serious magic effects. Still, some shots were absolutely stunning, and the characters are as colorful as ever. The soundtrack choices served the atmosphere and time period well. The OP and ED took some time to grow on me, but I ended up loving them and their visuals just as much as the first season's.ENJOYMENT (7): I still looked forward to watching each new episode, even if sometimes I wondered what the purpose of an episode was. There were some heartwarming bonding moments, but I was waiting for something to hit me with the emotional weight of the finale of the first season and never got it. I understand it's a harem anime, but the first season set the bar and I just kept holding out hope that the second season would uphold that standard.CONCLUSION: A decent season that never quite reaches its potential, but if you enjoyed the first season for its character interactions and the squad just being the squad, then this season still has those fun character interactions. I suspect this season would be better if you set your story progression bars low and just enjoy it as a slice-of-life.

It’s a shame that Season 2 abandoned that innovation for genericism.I’m not a big fan of isekai, and I’m especially not a fan of harem, but HameFura S1’s take on the themes was a joy to experience. I had so much fun watching Bakarina dodge dangers that weren’t dangerous at all, accompanied by an all-gender cast of genuine and interesting characters. I binged the series in a day, and while I knew it wasn’t perfect, I gave it a 7/10 for its creativity...and entertainment value.I knew that S2 wasn’t likely to eclipse S1 when minding the nature of the light novel series, but I didn’t expect that it would fail to even come equal to the last season. It’s ironic, really, seeing how Silver Link put a lot of energy trying to recreate a similar atmosphere to S1. The music, down to the artists that performing the OP and ED, remain the same. There is no dip in animation quality compared to last season. Everything is decent. They could have gotten away with it if the story and the characters hadn’t taken such a nosedive.S1’s story wrapped up nicely, but perhaps it was so nice that it had nowhere to go. As a result, the episodes jump around aimlessly. Half of the season is a bunch of shenanigans that have only loose connections. The other half is dedicated to seeing how each Claes kid survives getting kidnapped. It did finally get interesting...in the last episode, with the reveal that the Fortune Lover world has a sequel. When that was revealed, I could only ponder why S2 didn’t focus on that. Regardless of the light novel’s progression, there may have been a missed opportunity to fix the pacing.The characters were by far the worse offenders. The season introduces four new characters that were supposed to have a major bearing on the plot, but two of them were left behind in the first half of the season, and the other two have a presence that barely makes a memorable impact. They solely seem to be introduced to add to Bakarina’s harem (especially since Sora makes his moves on her literally 15 minutes after meeting her and continues on for the rest of the season). This was the first hint that the series was starting to lose the creativity that it had in S1.The returning characters don’t do well, either. Most of them are demoted to supporting roles where they endlessly cycle through interrupting other characters’ alone time with Catarina so they can fight over her attention. Outside of that, the struggle to work with such a large cast of characters begins to shine through with how the female cast was treated. Aside from the recurring “Catarina arguments,” the female characters take a backseat to the male development. Mary and Maria, the characters who I enjoyed last season, fell victim to this trap so badly that I began to find them annoying.Despite so much time dedicated to the male side of the cast, not all of them get meaningful development. Geordo and Keith’s “routes” are the main plot points of the season, so most of the attention and the conflict falls on them (Nicol has a standalone episode that was a nice watch, but Alan gets basically nothing). This would have been fine, but the conflict was stale, ranging from boring to watch until it got uncomfortable at the end. The morality of Japan’s tendency to go “it’s okay, they’re not blood-related” when dealing with adopted sibling relationships is a debate topic that the community could go on and on about, but for someone who has personal issues with it, it wasn’t a good way to end the season. While I acknowledge that it was clearly foreshadowed in the opening, I blazed ahead because the way it was handled in S1 didn’t bother me. But it definitely bothered me here. These character interactions overall always reminded me that I was watching a harem - I never had that constant reminder in S1.With everything being said, HameFura probably isn’t a series I’m meant to stick with until the end. S1 was fun, but it seems I’m not interested in what the rest has to offer. However, the dynamics and the inanity of S1 are still here, and if that’s all you need, and the rest of the problems I’ve listed here aren’t a dealbreaker, then you’ll probably find S2 as enjoyable than S1. I’m walking away from HameFura S2 with a 5/10. The production qualities are undimmed, but its storytelling defaulted to the traditional harem tropes to the point where there was no reason left to watch.

I used to consider her one of my favorite characters, what the hell happened...?This series has always been a bit dumb, after all it\'s a parody of otome games, it makes sense to not take itself seriously. It worked perfectly well for the first season which was a comedic slice of life. So why the hell did they introduce actual plot threads in this season...only to do NOTHING with any of them?Catarina is starting to seriously think about marriage and how she doesn\'t want to do it? Nope! Just an excuse for Geordo to become the typical rapey handsome type, which was a joke in the first season but now has become canon.The circumstances of the royal world and how love can be difficult within the court? Nope! Another excuse to introduce a evil butler who is also pretty damn rapey, just like Geordo, making me question why he\'s even here if his character role is already being fulfilled.Keith finally confessing his love and making it ABSOLUTELY CLEAR to Catarina that he is in love with her? NOPE! Catarina\'s braincells have unfortunately died out so she doesn\'t understand even the most basic line of ""I love you"". Oh also he\'s become the third rapey handsome type now, sadge.The yuri goes completely ignored in this one, which is a shame. Maria is the only one who gets any sort of intimate moments with Catarina and even then it\'s quickly made sure that it\'s just a wacky comedic scene and nothing serious because clearly Catarina HAS to get with the (now) awful cast of male love interests...Well, except for Alan and Nicol, they\'re still pretty great.I am upset, my crops have died and my water supply has been poisoned.4/10 only to do NOTHING with any of them?Catarina is starting to seriously think about marriage and how she doesn\'t want to do it?

On 2nd season there's more characterization and the routes actually made move. Especially when Sora (new character) was introduced, it shook the friendship zones and made it more chaotic and romantic. The characters are great because they emphasize how much everyone feels about MC. Like how Mary will compete for MC vs Sophia who likes MC but roots for her brother.the cons:Some parts felt so cliche but thats unpreventable on anime. Catarina being this oblivious is just sad because she probably liked someone in...the game, she plays otome games in her past life. Otome games with route often have factions and their oshi that they support. She felt strongly on Catarina on the 1st season how she's so evil in original plot. So her not having hots for anybody kinda flattens her character. She becomes everybody super kind and ditzy self-insert for anybody. Almost becoming holier than thou. It has its perks of course, the characters doing more advancement to make her realize, good fanservice :). the game, she plays otome games in her past life.

We also have Sora and Sirius, too much of supporting cast but shallow development. They just appear without function or added value to story.Moreover the doom flag has been cleared in first season. What the point of...making sequel if Maria (the true heroine of the game) did not make much impact to story. Catarina become boring character because we don't know how the game Catarina fate will come in sequel game.In conclusion the series is still good to watch, but it not the same level as first season. The supporting cast like Nicol, Sophia, Mary and Alan become burden in this season. If they introduce us new character, it will be better if they focused in developing the new character. making sequel if Maria (the true heroine of the game) did not make much impact to story.

Not gonna lie, Hamefura was never outstanding or anything; the negative aspects were already there in the first season but they still managed to make it worse and worse, until it became unwatchable for me.The ending for last season was really anticlimactic, I wasn\'t expecting a relationship happening but It felt empty without a real confession, especially if the anime keeps putting in your face that EVERYONE is in love with Catarina (also the whole magic subplot was a mess), so I started to...realize that maybe this series was not as good as I was thinking. But after watching the first three episodes of the second season I finally realized how badly done this story is.The first problem I have is that they started putting certain jokes, but they never let them go so it became old pretty fast. The whole ""haha I\'m Catarina, I\'m so dumb, I don\'t notice anything romantic at all even though I read a lot of love stories"" was never funny, but if you don\'t exaggerate it so much I could still take it.From repeating it so much they made me HATE Catarina, she\'s just stupid, she has no personality and I\'m supposed to believe that everyone loves her? I don\'t get it.Also the fact that everyone is in love with her is not exciting I mean, because they always help her and always believe her nothing really goes wrong, the plot no longer makes sense and everything became very boring for me. The characters are all very ""Disney"" too, they all live perfect lives and have no problems other than saving Catarina from her stupidity.In conclusion, it\'s not that the first season was much better, but they managed to take everything bad about it and exaggerate it too much, until it ended up being a disaster. realize that maybe this series was not as good as I was thinking.

We still follow Katarina in her adventures with her group of friends, and multiple shenanigans happen as usual.We get introduced to new characters who technically are only new members in Katarina's already huge harem, but hearing about their backstories is often really interesting. I particularly liked the stories that were told outside of the castles, in the poor villages and cities. It gives more credibility...to the whole world building in my opinion.The main characters are still here, but they are developed a little more for some of them (mainly Geordo, Keith and Nicol). We also understand more about their motives and why they act like they do based on their past.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience, quite satisfied with the show’s single season run. However, come 2021 and we received another season, seeming to come from nowhere after the first season so neatly wrapped a conclusion onto the original premise. Altogether, it felt like milking a somewhat popular anime of the season for all it was worth, with a movie also being announced to be in the works. To say I went into the season with hesitant...expectations would be putting it lightly. So what did I think of My Next Life as a Villainess X? I wouldn’t say it blew me out of the water, but I found it a still enjoyable time overall.As with the first season, the strong characters remain a primary part of the enjoyment. Are any of them particularly deep or fascinating? A bit more than before, but nothing I’d consider really impressive. But, regardless of that fact, everyone just oozes so much personality and charm that it’s pretty easy to overlook the somewhat tropey characters. Seeing their interactions and reactions with and to one another is part of the show’s main target, and I at least found it hard to resist liking them all.And the characters fuel what is largely the show’s most notable and best element; its consistently humorous and side-bursting comedy. Be it a simple exaggerated character interaction, a running gag, or just our main character being an absolute moron again, every episode of this season had me just about ready to give out with the laughs I had. Much like with the characters, I wouldn’t call the humor particularly nuanced or advanced, but it’s just simple fun gags and character comedy, and sometimes that’s all it needs.That fun value is what I would cite as Villainess’ continued strength. At this point the character personalities and actions often border on absurd, the comedy nonsensical, and the story largely minimal. But everything is just done in such good fun, with a clear conscience of the kind of story it wants to be. Is it more of the first season quite fundamentally? Yes, and not too much more. At this point though, one watching should really know if they do or don’t care for the kind of anime this is, and, as such, I don’t find much issue in that fact.As I previously mentioned, the overall plot is rather simplistic, lacking much of whatever nuance or intrigue the first season had in its story. It’s a very straitforward and generally rather unfocused story, not particularly stringing together into an overlying narrative up until the few final episodes. Early episodes do have use in introducing new characters or allowing us to better explore our existing cast, but it’s a notable thing to be so aimless in nature.-This lack of an overlying story leads to the other main issues this season suffers from, and that’s its pacing. When you never know what an episode is going to do or be about, only for a series of two or three episodes to contain fully focused stories in their own right, suddenly the rhythm of the show becomes a lot more noticeable in how completely nonexistent it is in any tangible form.Of course, with such a season that seems so pointless compared to the first, questions of its comparisons will likely arise. In turn, I’d say that, rather than being strictly better or worse, I find the two seasons to be different kinds of stories. Season 1 of Villainess was a kind of comedic psychological experience, aimed to tell a story with a definitive end. However, it may be more accurate to not even consider this as a “season 2”, since the main overarching set up story from the beginning has already come to an end. Rather, Villainess X is more of a series of comedic short tales and character studies that occur after the end of the main “story”. In short, it’s more akin to an epilogue than a continuation.In summary, while I wouldn’t say My Next Life as a Villainess X lives up to the standard set by the first season, I believe it wasn’t meant to. It seems, I think, designed to be watched by those who enjoyed the characters and humor of the first season, and wanted to see more of them, as well as a more definitive closure to some arcs rather than the open-ended one of the first season. In all, the characters are as fun as ever, the humor as excellent, and the overall package just as enjoyable, if perhaps for different reasons than the first season.Grade - B expectations would be putting it lightly.

I wasn't wrong. Unfortunately, the same tropes that made S1 so funny have started to become...stale in S2, and the majority of the season doesn't feel nearly as innocent as S1.

RideBack,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4618/RideBack,"['Rideback tells the story of Ogata Rin, a ballet prodigy who, due to an injury, was forced to stop practicing ballet. Rideback also tells an alternate future story about a world government, the GGP, against the terrorist group BMA. These two seemingly unrelated plotlines come together and quite possibly make Rideback one of the best show to come out of the Winter 2008 anime season.The first thing that caught my eye when I saw Rideback was the quality of the animation. The CG work in this show is amazing. From the very first episode to the very last episode, the Ridebacks were given extremely fluid...animation and modeling, almost to the point of realism. I found it very neat to not have to suspend my disbelief too much at the Ridebacks, since they were animated so well. The character designs and movement were also done quite nicely, and having the show air in HD helped a lot. Madhouse did a fantastic job of creating a living, breathing, alternate universe Tokyo in the year 2020.The second thing that caught my eye, or in this case, my ears, were the sound and the music. Music composer Takafumi Wada went all out, mixing techno, classical, and heart-thumping action pieces throughout the show. The music really coordinated with the scenes, especially during the action sequences along with the soliloquy sequences. The opening song is a jumble of Engrish, but once you figure out the lyrics, it creates a nice motif to the show. The ending song is a slow ballad, which goes nicely with the slideshow of solemn redemption scenes.The characters, given the time constraint of the show, were given enough development for the audience to care for. We get to see Ogata Rin\'s desires and motivations, the BMA\'s desires and motivations, and we are able to empathize with them. However, many secondary characters were one dimensional and only appear in the show to create plot devices. Sadly, with only 12 episodes, these characters were unable to become fully fleshed out. We can only see the police chief as only ""the police chief,"" the reporter as only ""the reporter,"" and the Rideback club members as only ""the Rideback club members.""The story is also a mixed bag. Frankly, Rin\'s soliloquies were much more fascinating than the game of cat and mouse between the terrorists and GGP. Madhouse, however, did a fantastic job to meld the two storylines together. I can see why some people would scoff at sudden climax in the last episode, or at the disregard for physics in some of the action scenes. But all in all, the story provides a nice tinge of sentimentalism, which is not overbearing or underwhelming. The allegory between Rin\'s Fuego and her desire to continue ballet is done very well, I must say.When I started watching Rideback, I didn\'t know what to expect, other than awesome animation. After finishing it, I found out that it had a little of everything: political intrigue, amazing action scenes, intense ballet, and lesbian tendencies. On Anidb\'s comments for Rideback, some people have complained that this show is all animation, no quality. I must politely disagree. Most shows hit you over the head with repeated symbolism. Rideback, however, does it with style, by layering the symbolism with multiple story backdrops. I recommend this show highly to those who enjoy action and mecha series in general, and to those who like to see quality coming-of-age stories.I forgot to mention that the voice acting in this show is superb, especially commendable is Nana Mizuki as Ogata Rin. I want to end by imploring whoever is reading this not to get discouraged by Anidb comments, and give Rideback a chance.

Do you get back up and continue what you are doing? Or do you simply wait for someone to come along and pick you up?In a futuristic Japan where vehicle's know as Ridebacks are all the rage Ogata Rin must try to pick herself up from ruining her career as one of Japan's finest dancers.Rin herself may be one of the best things to come out of Rideback, as she is a terrific main lead. Throughout the entire series she tries to come in gripes with herself, and why she does the things she does....Why is it that when she rides Fuego does her heart pound so much? Why did I make that jump? Why in all of these flames do I feel truly alive? These are the type of questions she ask's herself throughout the series, and her coming into gripes and realization of each of the answers is truly a wonderful journey.Rin is most definitely a rare character, but sadly that's all this show has to offer in terms of characters. Unfortunately all of the characters are nothing more than one-dimensional cut outs used simply to move the plot forward. You never get to know any of the characters, on really any level, other than their purpose inside the context of the plot. Which is definitely a draw back, from an otherwise great show.One of Rideback's successes is that it's plot is believable. I am not talking about the motorcycle's with arms. No I am talking about how everything comes together. How Rin comes into mix with the terrorist organization and why she becomes wanted by the GGP. It's brought together, by a couple of really believable coincidences. Rin getting caught in the middle of this doesn't feel forced at all. On the contrary, it actually feels like she got caught in the middle of everything.However, just because everything comes together in a believable way does not forgive the very shaky plot of Rideback. The problem with Rideback is that it's only 12 episodes long. I think that a longer series would've benefited Rideback a lot more. The viewer never fully understands what happens in the show. Why is the BMA leader want revenge so bad? It's clear he was screwed over, but how? Why? Who is this mysterious lady who seems to have the answers? Why is she helping take down the government she works for? The anime itself is full of questions that never get answered. If this series was extended and had the time to answer, explain and expand on everything already present that this anime would have truly been a masterpiece. But alas it's 12 episodes holds it back and keeps it an average level.The two biggest successes of Rideback have to the art and soundtrack. Both entirely entrancing and add so much more depth to this series. The animation of Rideback is breathtaking. The character designs are top notch, and the background visuals will leave you in a state of awe at just how beautiful they are. The Rideback animation is flawless and the action sequences done with the Rideback have so much detail in them that they will raise your heart levels tenfold.The soundtrack in anime(Outside of Mells consistent bad English in the opening) is fantastic. From the adrenaline pumping techno to the beautiful piano scores. The OST adds a depth to this anime that the story and characters weren't able to. It adds so much emotion as Rin tries to figure out who she is, and really gets your heart pumping every time she gets on a Rideback. Truly one of the better Sound Tracks out there.Unfortunately do to the jumbled messed of the plot and lack of any character depth(Outside of Rin} leaves this anime easy to forget and easy to pass by. It's a good anime, but at the end of the day that's it. The stunning visuals and beautiful OST does not make up for the other area's that are lacking. Rideback is definitely worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to find one of the rare gems of this decade. Why is it that when she rides Fuego does her heart pound so much? Why did I make that jump? Why in all of these flames do I feel truly alive? These are the type of questions she ask's herself throughout the series, and her coming into gripes and realization of each of the answers is truly a wonderful journey.Rin is most definitely a rare character, but sadly that's all this show has to offer in terms of characters. Unfortunately all of the characters are nothing more than one-dimensional cut outs used simply to move the plot forward. You never get to know any of the characters, on really any level, other than their purpose inside the context of the plot. Which is definitely a draw back, from an otherwise great show.One of Rideback's successes is that it's plot is believable. I am not talking about the motorcycle's with arms. No I am talking about how everything comes together. How Rin comes into mix with the terrorist organization and why she becomes wanted by the GGP. It's brought together, by a couple of really believable coincidences. Rin getting caught in the middle of this doesn't feel forced at all. On the contrary, it actually feels like she got caught in the middle of everything.However, just because everything comes together in a believable way does not forgive the very shaky plot of Rideback.

I am pissed off. Completely.In the first episode, I was heads over heels in it. I breathed, smelled and laughed with RideBack. That delirious-like state continued for a few more episodes, even intensified. I was sure right then that this is the best anime I have watched in a long time now. And then came the cold shower.I should probably mention that I finished watching the last episode 5 minutes ago. So I might not be the most rational being at the moment. The promise and the letdown are...the biggest two I have ever faced when watching basically anything up until now. The emotions portrayed as she stopped dancing, the feeling of pure joy and life as she discovers RideBack.. It was like I was watching a creation of universe. Immense, deep and indescribable. Ofcourse the story goes on, but the biggest disappointment for me were Rin's emotions, intentions and willpower. She is able to give up something she loves more than anything else just because circumstances changed. She hurt her leg. She managed to hurt someone else by some miracle. No, no, can't do. Let's stop. A nap sounds so much better. Bullshit.So, she discards it all, never to do it again, then does it all over again for someone else's sake. Imagine this scenario in a different setting. You absolutely love playing basketball. Nothing else like it. A friend of yours manages to get hurt badly. And yes, it was caused by you, since he was coming to see you play and a car hit him. And now you decide never to play basketball again because it made someone you love get hurt.  Wtf? Oh, I forgot to mention that even tho you swore never to play it again, you still do it in the end because that friend wants to see you play. So you play for him and not for yourself anymore, appearing saint-like. Not even allowing yourself to enjoy it as before. Seriously, there is not much more that could be piss me off than this whole charade. Bah.As for other topics.. Animation is amazing. CGI fits in well, the scenes and background are simply amazing.Story is mediocre, but it works. There are some untied ends, but it was enough to hold everything together without flinching.Sound department I think lacked. The soundtrack could be amazing, but it was just something that goes along with everything..Characters. You might have read my initial pissed-off complaints about some aspects, but I was generally happy with everyone. Else.Also, I shoulfd mention, I would rate this by the end of first few episodes as almost 10. Judging purely by personal enjoyment. Then it just went downhill. The are freaking lucky that they had a scene with panties twice! Look, RideBack is like one sport at which your panties would be on display ALL THE TIME if you were doing it in skirt. Which Rin manages to do alot. But they always chose perspective that obscures them. The wind was also behaving non-windy. Really stupid details, but as they keep repeating over and over again, it gets to be really annoying. But there are two scenes in which they managed to give a split second pantie-shot. I am a pervert, sure, but here are the basic laws of physics being denied. The barely managed to get out of that spot by that maybe one second altogether. Meh. Btw, they are white and really plain looking. Enjoy your spoiler. the biggest two I have ever faced when watching basically anything up until now.

It starts out on the highest highs with a masterfully crafted first episode, then it slides down on the next two, still a great show with a great premise but not quite living up to the opening. Then the fourth episode drops, and the whole series falls off a cliff. From then on we get to watch our promising mech-racing show drown under all the needless drama and shoehorned war stories that nobody wanted to see. Rideback draws you in with the promise of an engaging, introspective sports series full of potentially...great characters, then leaves you with a half-assed Gundam story and bitterness.The first episode of Rideback is a masterpiece. If that was the only episode ever made, I'd give it a 10/10 and lament the fact that we never got to see such an amazing story told in its entirety. Rin Ogata is a ballet prodigy whose career is cut short by an on-stage accident in high school. Though she recovers, Rin is no longer able to dance at the same level and is forced to give up the greatest love of her life. The themes of this episode are constantly and expertly reinforced by the visuals and settings. Rin's post-accident life is shown in drab, gray tones. Her graduation from high school is a lonely, solemn affair. She slowly walks out with her head down, thrust into the outside world with no direction and no motivation. Her one friend rushes to her side, but is unable to cheer her up, as the camera pulls far away and cherry blossoms fall over the screen like tears. College initially seems like a second chance, but she is hounded by memories of her past, tormented by her well-meaning fan, a constant reminder of her happy life snatched away by fate. When Rin reaches her lowest point, she's caught alone in a rainstorm and forced to hide in an unfamiliar garage. There, she finds her salvation in the form of a Rideback. The feeling of exhilaration from her first Rideback outing is hammered home by the shot of her flying high over the city, sun beaming in the distance, the colors dancing across the screen, life flooding back into her face as her passion is rekindled. The combination of story, themes, visuals, and sound is nothing short of pure art, and would have earned a place in every anime fan's heart, if only the rest of the series had reached the lofty goal set by the opening.The next few episodes are less inspired, but still lay a solid foundation for a 12 episode series to build on. Rin's talent as a dancer gives her a leg up in the Rideback world, with her unique sense of balance and movement occasionally translating into expert level racing maneuvers. Tamayo is initally presented with an awful lot of depth. She's both a rival and a mentor to Rin, simultaneously frustrated at Rin's seemingly flippant attitude about Ridebacks while also wanting to nurture a natural talent. Hishida is a dorky outcast with an endless love for Ridebacks, providing a visual metaphor for the public's distrust and disgust towards Ridebacks. The rest of the Rideback club are all shown as unique individuals with various personality hooks that could be fleshed out later on. Rideback racing itself shows hints of some great new concepts for a racing anime. Ridebacks can go essentially anywhere on land, teasing the audience with the idea of never before seen settings for races. The combat in the first (and only) major race shows us that there's much more to Rideback strategy than we've seen, and that we can expect a twist at any time during a race. The stage is set for a fresh, exciting racing series with a well-rounded cast.Then the fourth episode hits. It hits hard, with guns and bombs and military Ridebacks. It knocks down everything you've seen built up, derails the entire story, and rips the focus away from Rin and her personal redemption. Instead of watching Rin further her budding racing career while learning to enjoy life again, we're instead suddenly given a ragtag rebel group fighting against a big oppressive empire. Rin's friends change from a quirky racing team to terrorist liberators. Everything you learned to care about is callously tossed aside in favor of a color-by-numbers military plot. None of the original themes are ever explored again. Despite Rin's efforts (and many times because of them), Ridebacks are overall presented both in-universe and out as tools of war and not as racing vehicles, again robbing Rin of her purpose in life. Rideback racing is outlawed and heavily policed, eliminating the chance for even clandestine nighttime Rideback touge with drifting and eurobeat. Tamayo's conflict with her father goes nowhere, same with the rest of the cast, and the whole “racing to win popular support” side of the story is torpedoed. All of the careful foreshadowing and subtle metaphor is abandoned so Rin can have a conversation with a guy while Rideback waltzing in the middle of a firefight, and it's sadly as silly as it sounds. Rideback plummets from its high standards like a bird with clipped wings. If the whole show had been like this then it wouldn't be so painful; Rideback could just be tossed on the heap of other boring rebellion stories. But the initial impression and betrayal are so powerful and unforgettable that it's impossible to separate those bitter feelings from the overall show as it is presented.Rideback hurt me. It gave me the best first episode I've ever seen, and tarnished that memory by piling disappointment on top of cliches. It gave me a wonderful story of personal redemption before smothering it with a forgettable, aimless and messy rebellion. It gave me an exciting spin on racing that could never have been done elsewhere before mercilessly cutting it out forever. It gave me a reason to always doubt my first impressions. And it gave me a reason to warn you, before Rideback hurts you too. great characters, then leaves you with a half-assed Gundam story and bitterness.The first episode of Rideback is a masterpiece.

After her mother\'s death, Rin decided to advance more into national competitions. From there she tells the story of the GGP, a new government formed by a takeover. One rainy day, she encounters a strange machine, Fuego. Now the second act begins......From the previews, Rideback was the most promising of Winter 09. A mix of political conflict and internal conflict and of course, mechs. But these aren\'t Gundam-esque mechs, these are original, these are Ridebacks. It can be a normal Motorcycle or...it can be piloted as a robot. When Rin breaks her leg during a ballet routine, she ends her dream of it. It\'s really amazing that she can do the same routines in a machine, i like the transition there.Animation:The animation is another big thumbs up from me. From the Rideback scenes, to just a casual chat, the animation is on par with some of those more popular but less creative animes.Sound/Voice Acting:Another reason i was excited for Rideback was because of Rin\'s seiyuu, Nana Mizuki. A very talented person with tons of effort in her works, i can say this: A great job well done. Then comes the sound: Really good, even just a simple engine turning on makes a good apperence. The OP is okay, but kinda boring. The ED is alright, but Younha (Who also sung Bleach\'s 3rd Ending) matured too much, her voice just doesn\'t fit.Characters:Rin is your typical young lady: Puts in an effort for anything, a loyal friend and a little klutzy. Her friend Shouko, just the same, only more unaware of the Ridebacks. Then we have the Rideback Club: A group of college students, each with a different background. Tamayo, the group\'s leader, has an older brother working at the GGP. She\'s more interested in riding than politics, a good thing there.Enjoyment:Rideback is a show worth watching, it has all the makings of a great plot, combined with top-notch voice acting and a complete spin on mechs. I can\'t wait for the dub.The Good(+): Voice Cast, Mix of Political and Internal settings, A new spin on MechsThe Bad(-): The fact that we don\'t see Rin\'s Rideback training (it was a timeskip), however note that this show will only be 12 episodes.

Some questionable character designs and a lackluster theme song.', ""This series could have worked better if it was entirely focused on how Ridebacks influenced Rin's character instead of the focus on corruption from a military-driven government and terrorist activity. For the most part, Rideback does do a decent job in exploring the development of Rin's character as she finds herself taking an interest in the vehicle as a replacement for her lost interest in ballet. As she becomes entangled in the military-terrorist conflict and realizes the original use of Ridebacks, Rin becomes disillusioned in the show's second half as she comes to grips over what would make her happy in spite of the hardships...she has come to deal with.On the other end of the coin though, the military/ terrorist conflict comes across as rather flat. Both the GGP and BMA factions don't get much in the way of fleshing out other than we know they have their own radical agendas and come across as morally corrupt. Beyond Rin, there isn't much fleshing out provided of most other characters within the series as they only serve as supporting characters among Rin's friends or represent the GGP and BMA, many of whom serving to influence the development of Rin's character. The series also often gets in the annoying habit of having situations occur rather conveniently with Rin or other characters whenever they get in trouble as they are quite saved in the nick of time.Visually, Rideback does have a slick presentation with highly detailed and lush shots of urban environments and the Ridebacks being almost lifelike in appearance as they are rendered in CG animation. Scenes with Ridebacks in action are very fluid and pleasing on the eyes to see onscreen, especially in some elaborate sequences whenever Rin is on a Rideback fleeing from GGP forces. Music in the series mostly consists of light instrumental pieces with the OP being a nice techno track, all of which go along well in conveying Rin's developments.Overall, Rideback does do decent with its character exploration with Rin while lacking quite a bit in its political focus on the GGP/ BMA conflict. While it was entertaining to see the premise concerning Ridebacks, the series is marred by enough flaws where I can't picture myself wanting to see it again anytime soon. she has come to deal with.On the other end of the coin though, the military/ terrorist conflict comes across as rather flat.

I will be the first to admit that I believe animes glory days were found in the late 90\'s and early 2000\'s.  But once in a while I\'ll break from my skeptisism and venture outside my comfort zone.  Rideback was my break from the usual.Immediatly with the opening credits I was hooked.  A somewhat techo-pop song rips through my body, shattering all other introductions, and with its stunning visuals and perfectly blended 3D graphics, grabs my attention like it hasn\'t been grabbed in a while.  The main lead, Rin, tears...through Tokyo on an altered motorbike that now looks like a robot.  The music pumps on.  Now she\'s dancing, ballet it looks like, in front of thousands.  Who is this Rin?  What\'s Rideback all about?  I needed answers.As the credits end, you quickly see that the painstaking efforts put into the art and animation in the opening scene, are going to carry on throughout the series.  Jackpot!!!  For someone used to bright neons and dull hues found standard in early animation, the crisp lines and shading stand out like a midget on a basketball team.Each character is beautiful.  And unique.  The clothes they wear, their hair styles, their movements.  No time or money was skimped on when the animation team was put on the task to create something truely beautiful.  And then you have EVERYTHING else.  In each scene, in each background, you are completely blown away by how perfectly the lighting captures the mood and totally inhances a scene, transforming a simple conversation between two people into an epic dialogue or a high-speed chase around a track into a life and death road race.After the inital shock of the animation you relise that the plot itself is a true work of genius as well.You have Rin, a ballet dancing prodigy, who hurts herself somehow.  This is a blow to her ego and perhaps her way out of something that she was never REALLY that into in the first place.  So she quits and goes off to school instead.  There, she finds herself attracted to ""the next cool thing"" to hit Japan.  Ridebacks.  They are half motorcycle, half robot.  100% bad-ass.  This is the first aspect of the show that I really liked.  These Ridebacks, thought not feasable yet, COULD, ONE DAY, MAYBE, exist.  And that\'s an exciting thought.Somehow, Rin is a born natural on the back of these futuristic machines.  You get to see her race her rival and in competitions.  But that\'s not what the show is about.  It\'s about when she Rides against the GGP.  You see in the future, the GGP (and organization) takes over every country and every organization and becomes the ultimate rulers of the world.  A dictatorship of such.  Anyways, when Rin Rides against the worlds superpower, when she Rides for what she believes in, that\'s when you get that tingily feeling running through your body.  That\'s when you start getting excited.I\'m not going to get to much into the plot, but the great thing about the story is that this normal girl gets put into these situations, reacts the same way any normal person would, and gets deeper and deeper in trouble.  This makes the plot very believeable and easy to like.Until now, I have raved about the series, and with due cause.  The one thing that was lacking however was character development.  Now I am not one that needs hours and hours of background information pertaining to each and every person.  But the ONLY individual to get ANY kind of story relating to her past experiance is Rin.  Rin is an amazing lead, no question about that.  Her struggle to come to terms with who she is and what she wants, is very appealing throughout.  But with the sheer volume of secondary characters, you would expect a little more than a 10 second flashback for each.Other then the simple, cardboard cut out characters, Rideback, to me was a huge success.The animation and unique story telling, along with many humanistic emotions that Rideback will throw at you, will easily make this series a fun and exciting watch. through Tokyo on an altered motorbike that now looks like a robot.

In each scene, in each background, you are completely blown away by how perfectly the lighting captures the mood and totally inhances a scene, transforming a simple conversation between two people into an epic dialogue or a high-speed chase around a track into a life and death road race.After the inital shock of the animation you relise that the plot itself is a true work of genius as well.You have Rin, a ballet dancing prodigy, who hurts herself somehow.  This is a blow to her ego and perhaps her way out of something that she was never REALLY that into in the first place.  So she quits and goes off to school instead.  There, she finds herself attracted to ""the next cool thing"" to hit Japan.  Ridebacks.  They are half motorcycle, half robot.  100% bad-ass.  This is the first aspect of the show that I really liked.  These Ridebacks, thought not feasable yet, COULD, ONE DAY, MAYBE, exist.  And that\'s an exciting thought.Somehow, Rin is a born natural on the back of these futuristic machines.  You get to see her race her rival and in competitions.  But that\'s not what the show is about.  It\'s about when she Rides against the GGP.  You see in the future, the GGP (and organization) takes over every country and every organization and becomes the ultimate rulers of the world.  A dictatorship of such.  Anyways, when Rin Rides against the worlds superpower, when she Rides for what she believes in, that\'s when you get that tingily feeling running through your body.  That\'s when you start getting excited.I\'m not going to get to much into the plot, but the great thing about the story is that this normal girl gets put into these situations, reacts the same way any normal person would, and gets deeper and deeper in trouble.  This makes the plot very believeable and easy to like.Until now, I have raved about the series, and with due cause.  The one thing that was lacking however was character development.  Now I am not one that needs hours and hours of background information pertaining to each and every person.  But the ONLY individual to get ANY kind of story relating to her past experiance is Rin.  Rin is an amazing lead, no question about that.  Her struggle to come to terms with who she is and what she wants, is very appealing throughout.  But with the sheer volume of secondary characters, you would expect a little more than a 10 second flashback for each.Other then the simple, cardboard cut out characters, Rideback, to me was a huge success.The animation and unique story telling, along with many humanistic emotions that Rideback will throw at you, will easily make this series a fun and exciting watch.', 'Just about any idea has the potential to be good. It all depends on the execution. Rideback is proof of this because the story of an armed conflict between a corrupt militant group and a resistance group is nothing new. Isabel Allende likes to do it in her novels and we\'ve also seen the idea in quite a few anime/movies/television shows and it\'s usually absolute garbage.Rideback proves that this concept can be written well. How does it do this? It uses a few tactics. It puts the focus on a small group that\'s only connected to the conflict as a result of a misunderstanding and...even then remains largely outside of it. It also keeps the focus on this group without connecting them to the larger conflict for about half the series which allows the audience to acclimate to them. It also avoids demonizing either side of the conflict. In a lot of media involving this basic storyline one or both groups are portrayed as being made up of inhuman monsters. In Rideback neither side is particularly likeable, but that\'s the result of their human qualities. The military is corrupt and brutal but not in an exaggerated, cartoon villain way. They\'re brutal and corrupt in ways that military groups who have a disproportionate amount of power actually tend to be. You root for the resistance group, not because they seem like great saints, but because they seem like they wouldn\'t be as bad. A big part of what makes Rideback powerful and emotional is that it isn\'t unrealistic. It uses futuristic technology that doesn\'t, and may very well never, exist but the characters and their actions seem very real.That being said there are some story issues. The pacing isn\'t very good. Not because it\'s slow, like the problem was with Bakuretsu Tenshi, but because it moves too quickly. It\'s a very fast-paced series that doesn\'t give you time to fully absorb everything that\'s happening, which makes sense when the action really gets going but feels out of place in the early episodes. An even bigger problem is that it has a very scant dénouement. For those of you who aren\'t familiar with story structure there are three broad parts. The setup, the confrontation and the resolution which includes the climax and the dénouement, which serves to tie up the loose ends and bring the characters from the climax back to a semblance of normalcy. The climax is very nicely done but after it ends you only get about five minutes for the action to fall and the series to conclude. This results in a feeling that the series is unfinished and it doesn\'t give you enough time to wind down after the climax.The graphics are pretty nice. They aren\'t the best I\'ve ever seen but they\'re definitely good. They have some great voice acting from great Seiyuu like Paku Romi, Mizuki Nana, Morikawa Toshiyuki, Matsumoto Megumi, Toyoguchi Megumi and Miki Sinichiro. The music serves to enhance the mood and help set the stage.Moving on to the yuri factor. Rideback contains hints of yuri, some of them very strong, like Rin saying that Shouko is her ""light"", and others that are only really there if you\'re looking for them. Overall it has yuri potential but the actual content is pretty mild. So I\'m giving it a 6/10 for the yuri factor.Overall I give Rideback an 8.4/10.

Instead of having your plain old robot and person with an eerie past, Ride Back used a dancer and a motorcycle, then blended them into what you would call genius! I loved all the action packed into here with the twist up of a political feel. Plenty of fighting scenes for those who enjoy action and a very lovely animation design. A driving point for this anime could also be the fact that it stood out amongst all the other robot anime out there, and the fact that this short...show equally balanced plot twists and action without overloading itself. Plus the music in here is well timed an the opening theme song is made by the same person who did the Black Lagoon opening, which in my tastes is awesome!There are some elements this anime lacks though.1) For those who expect humor in their anime, this doesn't have that (nor does it have a pink haired anime chick).2) You will not get those one episode dedications to character backgrounds.3) Not a real lacking element, but there were those times where the anime slowed down a bit and was slightly boring.4) There is no romance (yeah I cried for some, but hey no complaints), but the way everybody cries for Ogata Rin's sake, you would think there is some sort of lesbian love affair in here.Overall 10/10, the series could have been longer, but everything was as it should be. In my opinion, everyone who loves that classic feeling anime should watch this. show equally balanced plot twists and action without overloading itself.

This vehicle is somehow central to a dichotomy of two competing plots in...the story, one being the progression of Rin as a rideback pro racer and the other being some governmental/military conspiracy involving the usage of ridebacks that allowed them to dominate the world.Besides the mecha aspect, this anime does have characters and boy are they interesting. Well there is Rin, the main character who was once a rising ballet star but have decided to give up the grandeur of her mother's profession to become an engineer. So essentially a giant leap backwards in terms of societal recognition. She eventually comes into contact with a rideback called Fuego, which she instantly becomes attached to as it provides her the same joys of body control that she experienced in ballet (and no the ridebacks are not sentient). Other than Rin there are some other extremely memorable characters that I will fail to mention.Honestly what truly drew me to this anime was my shallow appreciation of the animation work spent on this project. Madhouse knows its stuff. The races and artwork for the ridebacks are breathtaking and are what kept me watching this anime. If there was less of an emphasis on the characters and the overiding military plot, leaving the highlight of the show being the races to take the center stage in the story. IMO this is something to wait on to see if it gets better, but at the moment is not worth the time watching.Oh and the music is kind of cool and fitting for the theme of the series. the story, one being the progression of Rin as a rideback pro racer and the other being some governmental/military conspiracy involving the usage of ridebacks that allowed them to dominate the world.Besides the mecha aspect, this anime does have characters and boy are they interesting.

"", ""Story  6/10The background story is very vaguely presented and very little more is explained throughout the series.

There are people that love this show, but I just cannot get behind any of it. I initially found the premise of the show interesting. Racing, terrorism, mech-bikes with arms, and so forth. Unfortunately RideBack is never interesting enough where I would suggest anyone watch it before a myriad of other anime.The characters just never go anywhere until the very end. Sure we learn more about them along the way, but most of them don\'t round out until the end of the anime if at all. The protagonist in particular just stays in this annoying depressed state for most of the anime....Blaming herself for things that are clearly not her fault. I found myself saying ""can we just get over this already"" to the very unnatural reactions.The dancing motif can also get old. We get the main character was a dancer that got hurt and chose to give up dancing. We get that the Rideback is her pseudo redemption. But wow to they just never stop repeating the same flashbacks over and over again to drive the point across. Time that could of been better spent further revealing character motivations and backgrounds, which is severely lacking.The music is pretty mediocre too. I usually don\'t notice this much, but they repeat a lot of tracks I dislike. Maybe it\'s because these tracks are often associated with scenes I dislike, but it is still something I wanted to say. Opening and closing themes are amazing.All this adds up to one big borefest. In only 12 episodes they were unable to maintain my interest. You just want them to get to the point.

Watch something else.', 'TL;DR REVIEW: A really fun and original show with a focus on character. CGI and quirky character design may be a turn-off to some, but its worth a try for those who desire a grounded and unconventional story.Hey! Just a few quick things before I begin. Surely you know by now that its difficult to reliably put numbers to anime, so take my ratings with a grain of salt. They should give you a general idea though. Also, I have no experience with the source material, so I can\'t judge this as an adaptation. Lets dive right in.STORY 8/10: The first and most important thing...to note about RideBack is that it is a blend of several genres which, though strange, are integrated pretty seamlessly. A story about a ballerina riding robot motorcycles in a distopian near-future may sound silly on paper, but in action it is extremely enjoyable. The pacing is consistent throughout and the story has a fairly satisfying conclusion, despite the many turns the story takes which can at times be mildly jarring if you are expecting a straightforward sport anime, mecha anime, or any single thing. Frequently were my expectations about where the plot would go proven wrong, yet always made sense when I thought back on it.It also avoids many anime tropes and gags which would normally be standard which was something I just recently realized looking back. No boke/tsukkomi, no ""umi-da"" or ""hentaiiiiii~~~"" or boob grabs or anything of that sort. And to top it off, there is not a highschool in sight. Thank god.Another point for those interested, is that I found the world to be incredibly grounded. Everything felt very real. Events that should have weight did so, and when people should have been seriously injured they were. The ""mechas"" (ridebacks, basically robot/motorcycle hybrids and the anime\'s namesake) in particular seemed believable enough that it really enhanced the concept immensely.ART 8/10: Here\'s where some people might jump off the wagon. Almost all vehicles in RideBack are entirely CG. At first it was uncomfortable, but I warmed up to everything pretty fast since the ridebacks look great; in motion especially. The CGI is a fair trade off for more fluid vehicle scenes. Some might also be turned off by the quirky character designs, but I found them brilliant. There is an immense variation in facial structures and body types, which makes it easy to identify characters by something other than their hair. In the same vein, there is no fanservice in this. It was honestly surprising since its about a girl riding a motorcycle robot in a dress. There was not one panty shot, and it was only for a second at a realistic time. No attention was drawn to it either, which was refreshing.The backgrounds were pretty good and there was little to no ""QUALITY"" scenes. This anime managed its budget well apparently.SOUND 6/10: Not much to say here. The music was appropriate and pretty good, the voice acting was also good. Nothing bothered me during my watch, but not much stood out either.CHARACTER 9/10: At its core, RideBack is a character driven (vroom vroom) anime. The main character in particular is exceptional, and the supporting cast is endearing and believable as well. I could have done with some more exposition on some of the side characters, but honestly the story is fine without it. If you\'re looking for a goof female protagonist in particular, this is fantastic.ENJOYMENT YES/10: I don\'t know what more you\'d need there.Overall, this a seriously good anime and one of my favorites. Its a really splendid experience that constantly had me in the zone enjoying every minute of it. Although quirky, RideBack is seriously unique. You might not feel the same if you aren\'t into the possible hangups I listed above. But hey, its seriously something you should try if any of this sounds interesting at all.

At that time I'm no mecha fan yet but since this is done by Madhouse (one of the anime studios I really respected), I gave it a try anyway.The story started with a young girl whose life takes a drastic turn when her dream of becoming a ballet dancer came to a complete halt when she was very young after an incident that prevents her from performing anymore. During those time, the world is experiencing a series of changes brought about by an organization in...possession of a powerful new vehicle that will guarantee them military victory and political power for years to come. Years later, the young girl eventually becomes a young woman going in college with a very uncertain future. But, after she accidentally tumbled to a college club in possession of the same vehicle and learned the dynamics of it, she found passion in this new hobby of her and will lead her in a series of events that will make her the focus of many conspiracy theories as she struggle to win against herself and against the people trying to exploit her. The pacing of the episodes are good, it never feels boring. The story is told gradually and has the right amount of details in each episode to keep me excited to watch the next episode. The most exciting parts are probably the middle episodes when Rin uses her Rideback and the media, the police and the general public began noticing her.The animation was probably one of the strong points of this series; the environment is well detailed, the sceneries are beautiful, the lighting effects that are used looks superb as it produces really great background arts, and movements are very fluid. The production in general is of high quality and the use of CG in many parts of the series (especially when the Ridebacks are involved) is very good in my opinion as it blends really well. The character design itself is good; it feels appropriate for the story. The color tones give the impression of seriousness. The fights scenes are nicely choreograph.  The designs of the Rideback are fairly unique and gave me a really hard time whether I should classify this series as a mecha anime or not.The OP theme is tuned in a modern beat but it’s not catchy enough for me. The ED theme is a bit mellower and it matches the overall mood quite well. The BGMs is not really noticeable, however there are few that I remember which feels good to listen when watching the scenes it is played upon.The series has a good cast of characters. The heroine of this series is not your average one, Rin has a strong personality and although her dream of becoming a ballet dancer came to a halt. The Rideback pave way to her comeback as the famous mystery girl riding on a Rideback showcasing very good stunts as well as pushing the said vehicle to its performance limits. The other cast are also well develop, especially the people close to Rin. It is very nice how the series has able to develop their characters, the story of Suzuri is a good example, as well as others, such as Rin’s bestfriend, another is a former revolutionist, and the likes. It is good to see how everything connects together. Voice acting are also very top-notched, I like how the voices matches the characters they are portraying.Rideback is a mecha, sci-fi anime that offers a more serious plot, drama is also evident but not over the top which is good, nor are over-powered robots, the series is well balance. Overall I like Rideback, the story is great, the inclusion of mecha, sci-fi, and drama in a college-life environment is particularly refreshing. More importantly for me is that the main character is a girl and has a strong personality, pretty uncommon because most of the mecha anime that I watched always has a male lead or group of male leads, so it is refreshing seeing a heroine doing some kick-ass actions. I would recommend this series to people who want some good mecha anime that has a decent story and a good balance of action and drama. possession of a powerful new vehicle that will guarantee them military victory and political power for years to come.

Good show. It's major problem was it's pacing. I suspect it didn't do as well viewership wise during the season and so got rushed. I really enjoyed the development and stories behind the first 4 episodes or so. The races were nice and you got to learn more about the characters. The problem I feel is the plot got a bit contrived (maybe it was before hand and I just didn't realize it) and instead of more character development with asides to the battles in the background with gradual immersion into the fighting; you go from an interesting nicely...paced racing show into a fairly serious show about an armed conflict.

A year later, October 2013, I watch it again, I wanted to make sure it really deserve a 10 and also, since I liked it a lot, I had to watch it again. The story might be a little incomplete, not enough dept. Like another reviewer wrote, the story would have been more complete if it were a 26 episode instead of 13. There is a lot of stuff that remain clouded, lot of unanswered question. But, the Art,...Sound/Music and great characters make up for it. Being a musician, I relate a lot with the main character, her connection with Fuego, the rideback she he using during the show, is the same feeling I have when I play the guitar, it's a extension of myself, and when I am really into it, the guitar and me make one. The same happen to Rin when she ride Fuego, her dancing + the rideback = one. The other character in the series, even if they are not as well developed as Rin, are great too.

It was well-produced and visually good, but it never made the whole rideback concept even as plausible as a random Gundam, it gestured at something more to ridebacks which never cashed out, the world was poorly constructed so the politics at the end come as nonsensical, and so on. "", 'This series in it self similar to a rideback-easy to get on, hard to control, powerful and hard to get off.I was very excited when I first started to watch this series because the art looked amazing and I had heard good things about the series and in many ways Rideback met my expectations.Story-6This is where the series fails to satisfy. The series is only 12 episodes and the series needed more like 24 episodes to tell its story properly. I suspect that the story\'s short comes were a result of the anime directors blunders and not the person who wrote the manga since...the manga was a fair length. The viewer spends the first few episodes being introduced to the main characters, ridebacks and the wonderful society which the people seem to like in. A few hints of the main story are put in but when the main story finally begins it feels rushed. You haven\'t seen enough of the villians to hate them properly and don\'t know enough about the past to really care about the revolutionaries or the government. This in part is why the main story feels separate from the main character\'s story.Art-10Possibly the thing I love most about this series is the amazing character design. It is hard to describe what makes the art so unique but I think it has to do with the realistic shape of the body, imperfect hair an beautiful eyes. In addition to the wonderful character design the landscape and ridebacks have a sleek look to then though I do admit that sometimes the machines don\'t seem to fit with the lush world which they inhabit.Sound-10I thought the soundtrack to the series suited it well. I wouldn\'t say that it was not without flaw but the flaws were just a question of the level of drama it was able to convey. The opening and ending songs are suited to the adventure, peaceful and violent natures of the show which is wonderful to see.Characters-I will be honest and say that I felt disconnected from most of the characters by the end of the series. The characters in the beginning of the series were very clear and well formulated however near the end it feels that the rationalization is no longer clear. In add there were characters that the viewer never gets to know which leads to a ""what the heck"" moment at the end of the series that leaves the viewer dumbfounded. I found the characters overall like able but they could be improved if the series was longer.Enjoyment-8I was excited to watch each episode to see what happened next however, near the end of the series I started to lose interest because it was clear that there was no way that the series could have a solid conclusion just because of all the lose ends which had yet to be addressed.Overall-8The series is a fine, quick series to watch but it isn\'t a series that you will likely be re-watching. I have never read the manga however I think I might pick it up only to see the level of missing information in the anime with that knowledge I suspect that many of the gaps that I had were because of the rush nature of the series.

An ex-Prima Ballerina, turned humaniod- motorcycle driver?  Yep. Thow in a corrupt faction, intense drama, vivid animation, and some character growth, and you get ""Rideback"".  I liked the MC and the supporting cast of this series from the beginning, they were liikable or atleast understandable in their reasons for taking action or not to take certain actions.The freindships are felt deeply and the characters are worth investing in even in this shorter series.8/10 all around. ', 'Some spoilers up to episode 3, but they’re minor at the most.“And the world…… changed.”- Rin OgataSoft. In a word, that’s how I would describe the first episode. Not as a disparage, but rather as a positive opinion on the human way the story introduces Rin and world of Ridebacks. The first episode set high expectations, and the for the most part, Rideback managed to follow through.In a time much like our own, Rideback follows the story of former dance prodigy Rin Ogata as she interacts with a new type of mechanical motorcycle, called Ridebacks. Her skill lands her in the middle of a war...between a worldwide government called the GGP and a terrorist cell called the BMA.Rin herself is one of the best parts of the series. An extremely strong main character, her development is fantastic as she struggles to discern the driving force and moral responsibility behind her actions.However, that’s about as far as good characters go. With the exception of Tomoyo, all the other characters are pushed aside in terms of any sort of depth. Most of the cast are used only once or twice at specific points to advance the plot. And that’s a major disappointment, because the creators had several chances to make the characters great. For instance, the animosity between the the GGP leader and the BMA terrorist leader is never explained, despite the fact that the incident itself is hinted at multiple times over the course of the show. And that’s not the only relationships that isn’t fully explained.One positive aspect of the plot is its realistic nature. The manner in which characters react to certain situations and trauma is very similar to real life. Entire episodes are devoted to showing character’s reactions to certain events. This is both a positive aspect and negative aspect. Though it helps keep the show grounded in reality, it plays havoc with the overall pacing.Which for me, is the main problem with the show.The first couple episodes are extremely fast and interesting. Rapidly moving through Rin’s past and her education on using a Rideback. By episode 3, Rin has already reached her peak level and is participating in the world championship Rideback tournament. As we move on to the government centered part of the show, the tempo slows as we are gradually feed the message that the GGP AREN’T GOOD GUYS.Rin is mostly inactive in these episodes. Interest in the show becomes reliant heavily on the action of side characters who aren’t good to begin with. Luckily enough, the story picks up at the last couple episodes for a awesome conclusion.However, if there is a positive aspect to this, it’s that the rate the story progresses at allows for a slow build of tension, transitioning nicely from the fun adventures of a Rideback club to a darker story of death and loss.A large criticism of the show is that there weren’t enough episodes to squeeze in a plot as large and detailed as Rideback’s. However, I would argue that they had a perfect amount of time, but invested it in all the incorrect parts. Instead of devoting an episode to Rin’s emotional state, they could have had an episode long flashback detailing what specifically happened on the day the GGP scored their biggest military victory and why that lead to the formation of the BMA from former GGP members. They could have had an episode about Tomoyo, or to any other side character.As opposed to say, having a cliche reporter create pointless tension while looking for the identity of the mysterious “Rideback Girl” that the government already knows about.One thing that I can’t criticize is the animation and sound of the show. The CG used for the Ridebacks is absolutely amazing. When they happen, Rideback to Rideback fights are fast-paced and stunning. I find it interesting enough to mention that Rin’s past as a dancer is heavily reflected by her Rideback style, specifically in the final fight. The soundtrack complimented high tension moments perfectly, helping produce maximum impact from certain scenes. Despite the bad English, I found the OP “Rideback” by Mell to be a awesome stand alone song.Overall, Rideback has flaws. Plenty of them. But if it seems like I have an altogether negative opinion of the show, I don’t. Because at the end of the day, Rideback left me fulfilled and fairly happy with the softspoken perspective on dreams and awesome fight scenes from Rin.  It’s not enough to be considered one of the missed series of 2009, but its definitely better than its made out to be.Just a background note for those of us who didn’t know: “Fuego” literally translates to “on fire” in Spanish. between a worldwide government called the GGP and a terrorist cell called the BMA.Rin herself is one of the best parts of the series.

Amazing production values (Madhouse is the king of tv anime shows), lively characters, well directed racing choreographies, political intrigues, and a pilot episode that promised a dozen different side stories. And it made a complete mess with them because of lack of proper duration and naive storytelling.The story begins with the heroine Rin being considered a mediocre ballet dancer compared to her mother. In an almost stroke of luck, she finds a racing club in her university and drops ballet in order to delve into racing by using a new form of motorcycling called...Ride-Backs. At the same time public unrest leads to various terrorist attacks happening around the world and the army plans to use Ride-Backs as a new form of weaponry in the upcoming battles. So this is the double story of a girl who chases her dream of beauty and grace by leaning how to ride properly a motorcycle that can transform to a robot, while all around her a war around terrorism takes place. It really sounds captivating and original.In practice though, the premise was simply too complicating to fit in just 12 episodes, plus various events were presented in a most light and eventually passable way. Most of the disbelief lies in how Rin is pretty much undefeatable while on her Ride-Back and no matter how dangerous or hard is the situation she gets into, she always comes out a winner. So imagine mastering how to ride properly in a few attempts or storming in a battle field, finding her friend, and taking her out of the dangerous area, while being shot at a hundred times without a single shot managing to hit her. It looks completely immature.If you see past the realism part though, the racing and battle choreographies are very well done. They are exciting in the way Ride-Backs can use their arms to maneuver properly or how they can use ballet moves in order to change direction or angle fast (and gracefully). Along with the mostly impressive production values, even during the simplistic slice-of-life moments, this is an easily enjoyable watch.Still, not even that is enough to eventually save face in the show’s inability to cover properly all its potential. There is simply not enough time to develop its characters or expose the setting to all it could have been. Rin’s dream to be a great rider is left incomplete, and so does the whole war against terrorism theme. What feels weirder than that is how the interaction of these themes makes them both look bad. Do you know how stupid it looks when hundreds of elite soldiers are owned by an unarmed rookie civilian? Or how ridiculous it looks to have girl trying to ballet using a motorcycle while entire buildings blow up around her? Despite the show’s attempts to look realistic or serious in its themes of racing or political unrest, it ends up being a silly children’s adventure with magical robots.And yes, they are magical since they have a lot of supernatural stuff going on around them, such as somehow choosing their riders or dancing their way out of trouble, even if their rider doesn’t directly tell them to do so. So even the lead robot Fuego ends up turning from an interesting and somewhat realistic racing machine into a (literal) Deus ex Machina that saves the day no matter what happens. This has the effect of trashing both the attempts of Rin to be a good rider-ballerina (because she doesn’t have control over the machine) as well as the whole social-political backdrop (because the military is unable to handle a civilian machine).""She is not fighting... she is dancing!""I was shaking my head while listening to this.Skip that; not even Rin is that great of a character even without Fuego stealing the spotlight. She is very dynamic for a girl but always does it in a most annoying way. Every time she sees something dangerous going on, she will immediately rush to intervene. Although that sounds a lot more interesting than just standing still, it looks as if Fuego does all the work, while she is yelling, or crying, or feeling helpless, or showing off her pantsu to whoever is behind her. She just loves to ride while wearing an inappropriate skirt. Gets annoying fast.The rest of the cast are just too simplistic to matter and the duration does not allow anyone to become memorable for any given reason. You basically get silly teenager stereotypes and cartoony military cop-outs talking and talking and supposed doing something that doesn’t matter because Fuego jumps gracefully and does things however it likes. Where is the interest in that?Nice attempt Madhouse but you seem to think that the only way to have slice-of-life and political intrigue in the same package, is by making a silly fairy tale. Didn’t work out well.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 9/10General Artwork 2/2 (amazing production values)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (detailed and with good CGI)Animation 2/2 (very good for a tv series)Visual Effects 2/2 (good I guess)SOUND SECTION: 7/10Voice Acting 2/3 (good but rather cheesy on ideology)Music Themes 3/4 (fitting but not memorable)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 6/10Premise 2/2 (Captivating)Pacing 1/2 (erratic)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 1/2 (mentally challenged but there)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 7/10Presence 2/2 (bold)Personality 2/2 (rather cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (mostly for Rin but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 4/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 1/3 (the action is interesting to watch again)Memorability 3/4 (generally memorable for its weird premise but could have been much better)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 3/10Interesting for awhile but the lack of proper duration and the idiotic magical robots kills it in the longrun.VERDICT: 6/10 Ride-Backs.

So you're telling me there's a ballet girl making art in motion with a transforming motorcycle while recapturing the fire of a dancer? Hell yeah! Not since Speed Racer (the film) has a motor vehicle been able to capture the simultaneous grace and exhilaration of a performer in the zone, using the visual poetry to channel a culmination of pure passion and raw emotional energy. This all owes to the mechanic of the Rideback itself rather than the crafting of the story. The Rideback's design allows it to partake in adrenaline...pumping races while showing off the flexibility, dynamicism, and elegance of a ballet dancer. It has the same balance of power and grace that is in the best fight choreography and best action set pieces in general. In Speed Racer, they achieved this by having ridiculous race tracks and cars that could jump, but by having the Ridebacks operate like Transformers, it gets even better. Speaking of which, Michael Bay's Transformers also achieves the same thing every time Optimus Prime or Bumblebee switch between their robot and car modes in the middle of the fight.Then there's the story. It's so illogical I don't even have time to hate it--- I'm just baffled at why the author is trying to put a square peg in what's clearly a round hole. As everyone else says, the first episode is great and leads you to think this is going to be a hidden gem. The problem is that it sets up the story like it was going to be a sports anime about a dancer getting a second chance. Instead, it tries to force in a badly written terrorism/oppressive government plot that has nothing new to say and clashes with Rin's personal story.First of all, the rebellion plot is as simple as, we need to stop this brutal dictatorship, but with Ridebacks. Like, why??? You're not saying anything new, you're not exploring any political/social ideas, and your antagonists have about as much nuance as the evil empires from a young adult novel. I guess the author really wanted to tell a government rebellion story.Secondly, the show has to go through all types of mental gymnastics to try to make the rebellion stuff jive with Rin's story. It tries to tie Rin's desire for the adrenaline rush of riding Fuego with her accidental involvement in the terrorist activities, but in order to do that it has to devise all sorts of contrivances and irrational character decisions. Furthermore, it's clear that Rin's arc could've been told entirely separate from the rebellion stuff using plain racing. Speed Racer did it fantastically, using a little racing corruption to amp up the action and stakes, and Rideback could've done the same thing. You don't need a full fledged terrorist war to have action sequences. Hell, The Fast and the Furious did it better. Yeah, it later ends up much more ridiculous than Rideback, with characters redircting submarine missiles with their hands while riding in a car on ice in order to save the world from Charlize Theron, but remember that the first movie started with an undercover cop investigating illegal street racing. Perhaps Rideback could have done the rebellion stuff, but only after a tournament arc followed by a racing gang war arc, something along the lines of Tokyo Drift. If you want to take it from the dancer's stage to the world stage, fine, but you have to escalate it gradually.The mental gymnastics also mean that Rin's personal struggles are irrational. Her point A and point B are fine- with point B being her realization of what ridebacking means to her just like Speed's spectacular arc completion, but the obstacles to that realization feel extremely contrived. Like, if you wanted the adrenaline rush, why would you risk your life to do it instead of just participating in a race? Why do you feel so bad about wanting that adrenaline rush? That's a perfectly normal reason to do a sport.Basically, if you took out the rebellion stuff and added Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and Speed Racer, you'd have a masterpiece. I'm extremely disappointed in this show because I still love the art and concept and can't stop thinking about what could've been. Hell, I might put the show in my favorites just so I can look at its gorgeous cover. I still recommend you watch the show, though. Watch the first episode, then only watch the action sequences, which alone make the show worth it (along with its cool aesthetic). Other than that, you're not missing out on much.If you want action AND a story, just go watch Speed Racer. It's great. pumping races while showing off the flexibility, dynamicism, and elegance of a ballet dancer. It has the same balance of power and grace that is in the best fight choreography and best action set pieces in general. In Speed Racer, they achieved this by having ridiculous race tracks and cars that could jump, but by having the Ridebacks operate like Transformers, it gets even better.

It's great."", 'SPOILERS BELOWRideback is one of those shows that evokes an odd sense of nostalgia, but perhaps for the wrong reasons. As I write this review I think back to what about this show causes this sensation – is it the animation? No – as a kid I saw perhaps part of one episode. Is it the plot? Couldn’t be, as it wasn’t until last year that even realized this show wasn’t a typical sports flick. My best explanation is that this show is nostalgic for me due to its music, with a good OP and excellent ED that has a plethora of plays on my...old iPod. However, looking back now after seeing the entire show over the course of several months as part of my college anime club, I’m disappointed that it fails to live up to my admittedly unrealistic nostalgic expectations. Rideback is a show of lackluster plot, poor pacing and frustrating characterization that fails to standout in any particular facet and fails to deliver in most other aspects.As usual, I’ll turn to the categories. This show follows a typical sports-esque plot line that soon branches into a pseudo military-mecha. Protagonist Ogata Rin, with her ballet career permanently suspended due to an injury, finds solace in learning to ride and operate “Ridebacks,” bizarre motorcycle-mecha hybrids that remind her of dance. These machines become an integral part of the military plot, which involve typical themes such as powerful governments and terrorist movements. My problem with the show’s plot not comes in the fusion of these two lines, but in that neither of the two are developed meaningfully. Indeed, the show’s major theme revolves around Rin coming to terms with the loss of her mother and passion, but is constantly interrupted and overshadowed by devious government leaders and their dubious desires to turn the nation into a police state. There were several times throughout the show where the plot seemed almost political in nature, detracting from the characterization and storytelling. The plot-fusion, in my opinion, is also frustrating just because it’s very hard to tell sometimes exactly what is going on – Rin’s involvement in the military intrigue seem connected only tangentially at her incredible ability to ride the same mechanisms that threaten the wellbeing of the public. I found the plot generally contrived and unbelievable (as believable as an anime can be, at least).What, then, of the characters? Here is where the show is at its most polarizing. Ogata, the MC, is extremely well developed, and grows and changes in a myriad of ways throughout the course of the show. Perhaps my favorite example of this is how she slowly comes to understand how ballet provided meaning to her not due to her skill but because of how it represented her late mother, and how working past inadequacy does not require perfection. It’s a powerful message, and developed progressively throughout the entire course of the show. However, the rest of the characters truly fall flat in terms of meaningful characterization. Rin’s best friend Shouko, along with the rest of the Rideback club, are almost entirely flat characters, with very little defining personality. They seem to exist almost entirely to admire and support Rin as she progresses from rider prodigy to wanted criminal #1, and constantly show up at opportune times to drive her own characterization forward, just to disappear as soon as they aren’t needed anymore. My favorite example of this is Suzuri, who basically exists just to die for Rin’s benefit in episode 10. It’s almost as if the writers spent all their characterization efforts on Rin through sucking them away from all of her friends.The rest of the characters aren’t much better. Tenshirou “Goblin” is supposed to be a dark, secretive rogue who betrays choice bits of wisdom when the protagonists are at their lowest, but himself lacks any meaningful characterization that would cause me to be interested in him. He doesn’t change or grow besides grudgingly providing Rin with the tools she needs escape the bad guys. His relationship with Romanof, himself a generic and two-dimensional villain, somehow manages to remain ill-explained even after several episodes diving into it. Even Kiefer, mysterious figurehead of the resistance, seems to show up only to make mysterious comments and then disappear until he’s needed again for more of the same. Essentially, I found any character who wasn’t Rin to be poorly and insufficiently characterized, which damaged my interest in the show and plot as a whole.Let’s turn next to a quick look at the art and music. I’m not connoisseur but I found the art fine, even good at some parts, and the animation generally consistent. I did think some of the opening ballet scenes, along with the ending dance, to be the best showing of the studio’s creative muscles, but the rest of the show did a decent job as well. The OP and ED, as noted, have really stood the test of time for me, particularly with the latter fitting well into the mood of Rin’s characterization. The rest of the BGM was neither fantastic nor noticeably distracting, so it’s hard for me to make any further comments.In summary, Rideback is a show that succeeds greatly in the characterization of its main protagonist but fails in doing the same to its other players. The fused-genre plots, while not a bad idea in theory, are somewhat poorly implemented and lack the engagement that comes with other shows. Ultimately, I think the unbalanced characterization really feeds into my frustration with the plot, as having little interest in the characters causes me to lose focus on the story being told. I can see that evidenced even in this review, as I struggle to find anything else notable to say about the show. In terms of recommendation, I’d honestly look elsewhere if you’re looking for either an excellent sports anime or an engaging military intrigue story, or meaningful character development for anyone besides one character. old iPod.

The RideBacks themselves are a rather intriguing take on mechs, the premise seems as though it should be epic, the art and animation are impressive, and the soundtrack is one of the best around. Unfortunately though, the success that the show could have attained is never reached. Don\'t take that to mean it\'s a bad show however, it is good. It\'s just that it could have been a true masterpiece if they didn\'t falter in a few crucial areas.The biggest issue in my opinion lies in the shows lack of...explaining the central plot. Basically, the story takes place in the future, where a military organization called the Global Government Plan, or GGP, is rapidly obtaining power, seemingly with a goal of ruling over the entire world. Romanov Kallenbach, the commander of the GGP, has decided to implement the use of new, military grade RideBacks as police units; but they prove to be nothing more than a heavy handed way for the GGP to display their dominance. Opposing the GGP is the Borderless Military Alliance, or BMA. This organizations goal of preserving the countries government and way of life puts them squarely in Kallenbach\'s crosshairs, and they\'re officially dubbed terrorists. A prominent(?) member of this group, a man known simply as Kiefer, along with Tenshiro Okakura, the head of Musashino University\'s Rideback Club, both have a past with Kallenbach as they created a special ""RideBack Squad"" when they worked together in the GGP before the group became what it currently is.And that\'s about all I can say I\'m absolutely certain of. Beyond that, the show doesn\'t make anything clear. For example, the show never makes Kallenbach\'s motives clear. Why is he going to all these extremes? It\'s clear that he doesn\'t have peoples safety in mind since the first time the new ""White Rider"" police RideBacks are put to use in the field, they murder a petty street gang member who willingly gave himself up. So maybe he\'s trying to set himself up for a coup to take control of the GGP himself? Nope; to the very end he follows his orders like a good soldier would. The only thing left to assume is that he just...takes his job really, really seriously, contrary to what his characters attitude and personality would suggest.But the vagueness doesn\'t come close to ending there. We\'re never told exactly what the GGP\'s goals are. We can assume they want to rule the world, but it\'s never actually said; in fact events eventually start to hint heavily that that isn\'t their intention at all. In the end, I found the only real reason I saw the GGP as a bad organization was becuase the show simply presented them in that way, other than that, I really can\'t say with certainty that they\'re actually evil in any way. This in turn reinforces the idea that Kallenbach\'s regime, if you will, is something of a splinter group...but again, he follows orders from the top brass the whole time so... The BMA on the other hand is much more clear cut. They make it very clear that they\'re fighting to keep things the way they have been, the way the people want it. Unfortunately, were not told exactly who the BMA is fighting for. ""Borderless"" would imply they fight for the world, but they make no mention of that at all...rather than think too much on it, I just resigned to the assumption that borderless means they don\'t limit themselves to the borders of any one country.Those are just a few parts of the plot that are left unclear though, as you watch you\'ll end up having tons of questions that just never get answered at all. It\'s truly unfortunate; the story bears many similarities of the ever popular Code Geass; a globe conquering, corrupt, military organization contested by a group of rebels who aim to keep things the way they are, and given the things the GGP put Rin, our lead, through she would have made an excellent champion of justice on the side of the BMA...sadly though, that doesn\'t happen.Speaking of Rin; she\'s actually an extremely well done character. I\'ll even go so far as to say she\'s one of my favorite characters. Before the events of the show, we\'re shown her past as a famous ballet dancer. The daughter of a likewise famous ballerina, Rin is hailed as a prodigy, her future and success assured...until she sustains an injury in her leg while performing one night. Though she eventually recovers and should be able to get back on stage, she is left rattled and unsure of herself, effectively ruining her career. Succumbing to this fact, she decides to go to college, where she happens upon the schools RideBack club, and a unique RideBack called ""Fuego"". The club quickly realizes that Rin is a natural on the bike, displaying skill and control on it nearly on par with Tamayo, a fellow club member who also happens to be one of the best RideBack racers in the country.If that seems pretty unlikely, you\'re right, it is. But what makes Rin such a good character is her acknowledgment of that fact. See, hers is a story of self discovery. She realizes right away that she somehow has a natural talent for these robot/motorcycle hyrids, despite not even knowing of their existence until she started classes at the school, and she can\'t figure out why that is. Why is it she can control Fuego, when Tamayo, one of the best riders there is, has so many problems with it she claims the machine to have terrible handling? Why is it she feels something akin to a connection between herself and this machine? Why does she get a feeling of excitement amidst chaos and danger when she\'s on Fuego? It\'s her quest to find these answers that is the main draw of this show. If you ask me, the plot would have been much better had they decided to focus on Rin\'s personal journey to get these answers. I get that they were sticking to the manga\'s story...but it\'s hard to ignore the potential that was missed here.Unfortunately, the rest of the cast isn\'t nearly as well done. At all. The only other characters that get anything close to a backstory are Kiefer, Okakura, and Kallenbach, and even then, it\'s minimal. Once again, it\'s a shame as there was quite a bit of potential in all three of the aformentioned characters as well as in Tamayo and her brother, both the children of a prominent polititian...but again, they missed that opportunity.Back on the bright side of things, the shows art and animation are superb. As is evidently the norm, it all bears a striking resemblance to the stuff Kyoto Animation puts out; it isn\'t quite as good as their stuff, but it\'s close, really close. What I do like is the shows avoidance of making the female characters ridiculously moe. They\'re much more...normal looking here, which is refreshing since all these studios seem to think the only way they can make a female is if they all look and sound 12 years old. Aside from that, environmental and lighting effects are well done and not over used, as are the use of camera effects, partcularly during the high-intensity scenes, which all look great as well.Out of everything though, I was most impressed with the way they did the RideBacks themselves. A motorcycle that has arms sticking out where the handlebars should be sounds pretty wonky, and if you were to imagine it before seeing this show, you\'d probably think it would look ridiculous, but they pulled it off flawlessly. Short of a couple of scenes, they addition of arms looks and feels completely natural, and by the end of the show, you could even say it looks pretty cool on most of the various models of the vehicle you see in the show. Even more impressive is their bi-pedal forms. The moment I first saw Rin and Fuego stand up, I was instantly reminded of Final Fantasy VI\'s Magitek Armors (more specifically, the rendition shown on the modern artwork for the games logo, look at Final Fantasy VI Advances box art to get what I\'m saying), just with wheels.Finally, the shows soundtrack is also very well done, particularly the opening and ending. The general theme is a very techno-ish sound during most of the action scenes, aside from the bouts between the GGP and BMA which take on a fitting military sound. The emotional scenes take a minimalistic tone generally sticking to a piano piece. All the other music is pretty run of the mill, but there\'s nothing that sounds bad.Honestly, RideBack is a show I wouldn\'t recommend passing up. Despite the mess it made of it\'s plot and the general lack of character development, Rin\'s story and the art and animation manage to make this show rather memorable. Halfway through the show I realized that I could really care less what happened between the two opposing factions, and usually I\'d say that makes a show a clear failure, but that wasn\'t the case here. I kept watching because I wanted to see how things would turn out for Rin. I wanted to see her get the answers to her many questions. explaining the central plot.

She finds that her ballet skills make her a natural rider, and falls in love with the sport. However things quickly deteriorate because the political situation in country is ruled by a global military regime which begins to implement martial law. And she finds herself unwittingly falling in with some terrorists who oppose the regime, and finds herself reluctantly...forced into making tough decisions about who she wants to be and what kind of life she wants to live, and how dance for her, is integrated in all of that.It's a great anime with really good character development, action, and is shorter at only 12 episodes. And has a really nice story. Go check it out. 😉 forced into making tough decisions about who she wants to be and what kind of life she wants to live, and how dance for her, is integrated in all of that.It's a great anime with really good character development, action, and is shorter at only 12 episodes.

Go check it out. 😉"", '""RideBack"" tells the story of a young girl and her friends struggle against a somewhat evil government using cool transforming motorcycles with arms. This anime falls into the ""so bad it\'s laughably good"" category, so I\'d only recommend this if you like to chuckle at trashy television or if you\'re a diehard Madhouse fan. Full review follows. It does contain minor spoilers.Anime that use heavy CG animation tend to be easy targets, but let me start this review by saying the animation quality in this show is fantastic. During my time watching this show, I don\'t really remember any scenes where I thought ""god I...hate CG"" like I usually do. The RideBacks are all shiny, with varying textures and intricate parts that make them interesting to look at and even more satisfying when they are fighting and racing around.And of the course the traditional 2D is all up to standard as well, with no glaring errors, but no big surprises either. Madhouse is known for producing quality anime, and their reputation should not be tarnished because of this show. The big problem with this show, is that the quality animation is attached to a god-awful story and forgettable characters.There\'s nothing inherently wrong, in my humble opinion, with a good old fashioned ""innocent-person-caught-up-in-revolution-against-dystopia"" story. The thing is, for this story, they forgot to explain why the government is evil. Sure, we know from the get-go that the Colonel character is evil, but only because we are TOLD. Why couldn\'t we be just be shown a backstory where he kills a bunch of innocents for the GGP, the evil government? Why don\'t we see anything evil actually being done by the GGP? Every major evil act feels like it is carried out by the Colonel, as opposed to the organization he works for. This makes it really strange when our main character, Rin, gets dragged into the fight against the GGP- when we are also told that other characters are actually.... just fighting against the Colonel.Speaking of Rin, this kind of story needs a main character who we can actually get behind and root for. Someone who has their own strength, and doesn\'t just get pushed around. Basically, anybody except the character they actually used. Rin rides a RideBack for the first time because somebody tells her to. She joins the club and rides in a race because someone told her to. She fights... because someone tells her to. The only decisions she makes on her own, are stupid ones. She initially becomes targeted by the government BY ACCIDENT, because she couldn\'t wait for the GGP to save her friend from terrorists, and instead of standing down to the GGP after saving her, keeps running away. You know, like a criminal would.  She decides to give up on RideBacks... because she made one guy cough up blood?But you know, all stories can be saved by having an interesting, well-rounded supporting cast with interesting designs. So not this story! Their designs are generic and forgettable, and I actually kept getting one characters name wrong right up until their death- whereupon I actually laughed out loud. Of the only two characters I found interesting, only one was even actually named out loud! Kiefer is the edgy white-haired rebel who\'s kinda just cool, but at least he was fun to watch. Similarly, Misao, whose name I literally had to look up on AniDB, is the sassy subordinate of the Colonel, and is also just a treat in the few scenes she\'s in. The rest of the characters either do nothing (Shoko and the the RideBack Club boys) undergo boring, cliche arcs (Tamayo and Okakura) or are just plain stupid and annoying (Suzuri).Credit where credit is due, the music is really nice. The piano heavy score does it\'s best, but it\'s put over a story that doesn\'t deserve it. It\'s present at all the right moments, and their are no pieces that stick out as weak or annoying.So how do I quantify this as ""so bad it\'s good""? Well, I\'d say the editing. See, I wouldn\'t count this as animation quality per se, it\'s more some of the technical aspects. For example, there are plenty of awkward scenes that end with just a long shot of a character\'s face, and their are many cuts between scenes that just feel tone deaf. If you can laugh at these kind of things easily, you will probably have a good time watching this anime.The only other way I\'d watch it again is intoxicated.Tallies:Story: 0/2Art: 2/2Sound: 2/2Character: 0/2Enjoyment: 0/2* (2/2 for the B-Anime Lovers)Overall: 4/10Closing remarks:This anime has a cool concept hindered by it\'s story and characters.

Typically, sci-fi series with political intrigue seem to be voraciously consumed by fans in the West and so, why wasn\'t ""RideBack"" given more recognition? With the heated political climate and a dissatisfied populace at the hands of our current world crisis, now seems the best time, if ever, to discuss this series that is both tantalizing (with its action-packed, stimulation of mecha scenes) and a thought-provoking gander towards the world\'s societal structure!⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersEven before the GGF (the ""Global Government Force"") became the pivotal antithesis to the free-spirited group of...robotics-loving rebels, this series caught me. I have always been fascinated with the limber performance art of ballet, ever since I was a little girl — heck, Swan (created by ""Kyōko Ariyoshi"") is one of my favorite shōjo manga series of all time! So, to see something as restrained, feminine, and graceful get unleashed with a transforming, robot motorcycle... the concept was just too cool. The blend of some innately masculine, imbued with a feminine charm, and the fluency of an orchestral dance gave a fresh breath of air to what would have normally been a manly show! It reminded me of how I was captivated with Belldandy (from ""Aa! Megami-sama) becoming a motorbike goddess, and practicing with the club, alongside the impassioned Kei\'ichi.Though the visuals were stunning in the accelerating climax of Episode 4: ""Shōko, In the Nick of Time"" — the logic that got Rin Ogata, the protagonist, caught in the fray between the rebels and the GGF seemed somewhat forced. ⚠️ Light spoilers here, please skip to the next paragraph if you don\'t want to know what happens in this episode! ⚠️ So, Rin hurries into a hostage situation and saves her friend, Shōko... that part was well and good, it made Rin a more captivating protagonist and displayed her grit against the terrorist faction, albeit still reckless, but when the government commands her to stay put, she crashes through the window of the high-rise, the government agency shoots missiles at her ""RideBack"" (named the ""Fuego""), and then (after being saved by the leader of the terrorist group) she is deemed a radical revolutionary, and the GGF is out for her blood. My question is this: she had already saved her friend at that point and had escaped Shōko\'s captors, why couldn\'t she have stayed put for a few more minutes? Was it pure adrenaline? Or did she have some kind of ""Newtype""-like intuition that the terror organization wasn\'t completely in the wrong, in that situation? This is left vague in the anime version, perhaps because of the single-cour time slot.I won\'t give away anything, but there\'s a really great episode where Rin\'s younger brother (""Kenji"") is, shall we say, a little bit ""misguided"" and Rin epically kicks butt, and manages to save him from himself. I thought the little side plot was very touching! If I talk about how deep the GGF trench deepens, there will be massive spoilers, so I\'ll just leave the sentiment off with — the story feels a little bit rushed towards the end of the series, stitches are left bleeding in the plot, but it\'s still a show that is exemplary in its subject matter and a worth-while viewing experience!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Atsushi Takahashi (director), notable works:* Ao no Exorcist: Movie* Doraemon Movie 37: Nobita no Nankyoku Kachikochi Daibōken* Kemonozume — Assistant Director ✅※Mr. Takahashi is going to direct the upcoming ""Godzilla"" anime, airing Spring 2021 — ""Godzilla: Singular Point""!

I would compare her role in ""RideBack"" to her voices as Ken\'ichi Harakawa (""Dennō Coil"") and Ren Tao (""Shaman King"") — both characters are full of fiery passion, though it often comes off as pure arrogance, but are both skilled and dedicated in their respective fields.

Ahem, so anyway, Mr. Koyama mostly plays Dads or fatherly characters, and Tenshirō Okakura isn\'t much different. He guides Rin through her tumultuous journey and is a seasoned veteran in the ways of battle, especially when the rebellion comes into play! I would compare Mr. Koyama\'s performance in ""RideBack"" to his roles as Jōichirō Yukihira (""Shokugeki no Sōma"") and Kiritsugu Emiya (""Fate/Zero"") — both are stoic, paternal figures that are competitive, and can be ruthless against their adversaries. Not like the jovial, drunk Kogorō Mōri — who only gets real when his daughter is in danger or when his drunken fists are activated! Brilliant seiyū!Conclusively, as I said from the start, this series is grossly underrated. I can\'t see why it isn\'t more popular in the United States; we love action, robotics, and divisive political dramas over here! If you haven\'t seen ""RideBack"" already, I would suggest watching it during these trying times: the ""pre-"" and post-2020 political climate is strangely similar to the corrupt government in this narrative (strange, since ""RideBack"" takes place in 2025) — causing the people to rise up, albeit with mechanized motorcycles! The plot could have been more complete towards the end, but hey, that\'s what the manga\'s for, right? I give ""RideBack"" a 6/10 and a recommendation to anyone who is curious!Rating: ★★★☆☆ robotics-loving rebels, this series caught me.

I would compare her role as Rin Ogata to her roles as Colette Brunel (""Tales of Symphonia"") and Hinata Hyūga (""Naruto"") — both of these characters come off as demure, blank slates in the beginning, but then, the story reveals how powerful they can really be: whether it be through prowess or through mental fortitude Amazing performance!Romi Park as Tamayo Kataoka, notable roles:* Maki Aikawa, Air Master ✅ ✅* Kuchiha, Amatsuki* Tōshirō Hitsugaya, Bleach ✅ ✅* Zola, Blue Dragon* Teresa, Claymore ✅ ✅* Akane Owari, Danganronpa 3 ✅ ✅* Ganta Igarashi, Deadman Wonderland ✅* Ken\'ichi Harakawa, Dennō Coil ✅* Ken Ichijōji, Digimon ✅ ✅* Reiji Ōzora, Dragon Drive* Edward Elric, Fullmetal Alchemist ✅ ✅* Natsume Hyūga, Gakuen Alice* Nayuta Moriyama, Gakuen Senki Muryō* Emma Guzman, Garo* Seimei, Garo: Guren no Tsuki* Alex McKenzie, GR: Giant Robo* Switzerland, Hetalia Axis Powers* Higepiyo, Higepiyo* Dahlia, Highlander: The Search for Vengeance* Padparadscha, Hōseki no Kuni ✅ ✅ ✅* Pakunoda, Hunter x Hunter (2011) ✅ ✅* Popo, Kaiba ✅ ✅ ✅* Rei Batsubami, Kakegurui××* Ragyō Kiryūin, Kill la Kill ✅ ✅* Gyubid, Kuromajo-san ga Tōru!!* Angelina Durless, Kuroshitsuji ✅ ✅* Kuromitsu, Kurozuka* Ichirō Irabu, Kūchū Buranko ✅ ✅ ✅* Taiga Shimizu, Major S3* Heimdall, Matantei Loki Ragnarok* Myōri Unzen, Medaka Box ✅* Regene Regetta, Kidō Senshi Gundam 00* Falis, Murder Princess* Nana Osaki, Nana ✅ ✅ ✅* Temari, Naruto* Adam Blade, Needless* Tora, Nyanbo!* Omasa, Onihei* Naoto Shiragane, Persona 4 the Animation* Jiro (""Brock""), Pokémon ✅ ✅* Yūjirō Shihōdani, Princess Princess ✅* Alma, Radiant* Noboru Maeda, Rainbow: Nisha Rokubō no Shichinin ✅* Katsushiro Okamoto, Samurai 7* Shute, SD Gundam Force* Karasuba, Sekirei* Kenshin Uesugi, Sengoku Basara* Ren Tao, Shaman King ✅ ✅* Hange Zoë, Shingeki no Kyojin ✅* Ayumi Saitō, Shion no Ō* Chloe and Kurt Klick, Sōsei no Aquarion* Maguro, Sushi Ninja* Kōta Koga, Suteki Tentei Labyrinth* Hamyuts Meseta, Tatakau Shisho: The Book of Bantorra* Maria, TO* Sana Maniwa, Toji no Miko ✅ ✅* Komatsu, Toriko ✅* Loran Cehack, ∀ Gundam ✅ ✅* Kōsuke Ueki, Ueki no Hōsoku* 044, Ultraviolet: Code 044* Yayoi Shinozuka, White Album ✅ ✅* Syrup, Yes!

Ahem, so anyway, Mr. Koyama mostly plays Dads or fatherly characters, and Tenshirō Okakura isn\'t much different. He guides Rin through her tumultuous journey and is a seasoned veteran in the ways of battle, especially when the rebellion comes into play! I would compare Mr. Koyama\'s performance in ""RideBack"" to his roles as Jōichirō Yukihira (""Shokugeki no Sōma"") and Kiritsugu Emiya (""Fate/Zero"") — both are stoic, paternal figures that are competitive, and can be ruthless against their adversaries. Not like the jovial, drunk Kogorō Mōri — who only gets real when his daughter is in danger or when his drunken fists are activated! Brilliant seiyū!Conclusively, as I said from the start, this series is grossly underrated. I can\'t see why it isn\'t more popular in the United States; we love action, robotics, and divisive political dramas over here! If you haven\'t seen ""RideBack"" already, I would suggest watching it during these trying times: the ""pre-"" and post-2020 political climate is strangely similar to the corrupt government in this narrative (strange, since ""RideBack"" takes place in 2025) — causing the people to rise up, albeit with mechanized motorcycles! The plot could have been more complete towards the end, but hey, that\'s what the manga\'s for, right? I give ""RideBack"" a 6/10 and a recommendation to anyone who is curious!Rating: ★★★☆☆']"

Senjou no Valkyria 3: Tagatame no Juusou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9793/Senjou_no_Valkyria_3__Tagatame_no_Juusou,"[""When I first played Valkyria Chronicles 2 (I don't have PS3 for me to play the first one), I got addicted to it because for me it's well done and since then, I have become a fan of the franchise.Here, I'm about to write a review about Valkyria Chronicles 3, set in the same time of the first game, and since this is my first review and I'm not a native English speaker, expect it to be somewhat meh.When it comes to the same series with different setting type, Valkyria Chronicles is no exception to it for it having a Valkyria and a group or...squad fighting the Empire and because of that, people may feel disappointed because of the repititiveness. In a way, I sometimes can't help but to feel the same.An OVA composed of only two episodes, I must say that Valkyria Chronicles 3 is rushed because you just can't fit the whole game into an anime with two episodes but I can't say that it's that bad. Valkyria Chronicles 3 still gives you the goodness of the game and despite of it being rushed, the action scenes and how it's done is pretty good imo.As for the art, it's the same as the first anime, neat and clean and fitting for the theme. Every uniform is well detailed and the color combination is appealing and the equipnments and tanks as well.Valkyria Chronicles 3 isn't far from the quality of the sound of its predecessors, it's still as good as before. From the voice actors to the background music, the OP and ED, it doesn't give you a tiny little bit of annoyance at all. Every voice actor's voice suits the character they are playing pretty well. As for the music, I listened to it for like 20 times and unlike some of the new songs being used in new anime, the quality of the music is far better than today's.Because of the series being short, you may not quite get the personality of every character in the series. You may have known a little of their personality but for me it's still not enough and therefore it shouldn't have been an OVA but a 12-episode one or like Valkyria Chronicles, a 26-episode one and because of this, I'll give the character rating a 6.tl;dr Valkyria Chronicles is a short and rushed series and the overall goodness of it comes from the art, sound and  on how the fight is done.If you're looking for a short OVA that has action, Valkyria Chronicles 3 isn't the best but it can give you the action you're looking for though Valkyria Chronicles is better and can satisfy you in all aspect or you can just play the game though VC3 is only in Japanese. squad fighting the Empire and because of that, people may feel disappointed because of the repititiveness.

The setting of the story is in the same time as the original anime, but at different place. The story pacing is very rushed, in the 1st OVA they did a fair job of introducing the 'Nameless' squad an overall look of all soldiers in the middle of a war. That's is the end of it with some other talks. 2nd OVA skip straight into Riela...valkriya's power action, and the meeting up with 'Squad 7' members. Finally it the OVA ended. Terrible story pace, but is to be expected for 2 OVAs it would be much better for for it to be adapted into an anime, because you will not fully understand the story without playing the game.Art- 7The art looks good, good CG in the battles, but the game's art is much better.Sound- 10I am a fan of Valkyria Chronicle's soundtrack, and so I would love the music in this one too. Tones of the war music is serious as the theme address. Great to listen to them again.Character- 6The only characters that you will get a good grasp on is Kurt the leader of Nameless squad a very smart strategist. Next is Imca one glace she is a tomboy. Riela can't be more obvious. As for the other members very brief details, but you do get some ideas of what their personality is upon their way of speaking.Enjoyment- 4The game dominate the OVAs. If you don't have the chance to play the game well you won't like the OVA, but is not like you have a choice anyway becuase their is not english version of the game.

This is not however something I would recommend to anyone who hasn't played the game. Contrary to the misinformation from other reviewers, they are -not- cramming the story of the game into a two part ova. This is coming from someone who has played all the games to date. This is an original side story that takes place around the midpoint of the game, it is NOT an adaptation. They barely establish anything about the characters or setting because they expect you to already be familiar with them. If...you haven't played the game you've very likely to be confused and have trouble following along, wondering who these characters are, how/why they're in this situation and so on.I should also point out this ova contains very massive spoilers for the game, so again not really something I would recommend if you haven't played at least half way into Senjou no Valkyria 3.The plot seems 'fine' for a side story of this sort. It's very simple, clear cut, and straight forward. I rather appreciate that they used an original story for this ova, rather than adapting anything from the game. They also do a pretty decent job of illustrating one of the more desperate points of the overall story during the first half of this ova, even if that part of it was indeed a bit rushed.For art I did notice there were some drops in art quality here and there, but for the most part the art retained a fair level of consistency. It wasn't top notch and could have used some better detail, but it was serviceable.For sound, I appreciated that they had all the same voice actors from the game and used the same soundtrack too. There was one point where I couldn't help but notice they used the out of place sound of a tire screech for the tank coming to a quick stop on dirt, but aside from that I can't complain about the sound one bit.It's a bit tricky to comment on the characters. I think they're all great personally, but in this OVA alone they don't really establish them much at all. From this ova alone you'll probably not learn much of anything about them, and they'll probably come across as lacking much depth or personality.Overall: Great fan service if you enjoyed the game, but without having played the game you're probably not going to get much out of this aside from some minor enjoyment of the action on a superficial level. you haven't played the game you've very likely to be confused and have trouble following along, wondering who these characters are, how/why they're in this situation and so on.I should also point out this ova contains very massive spoilers for the game, so again not really something I would recommend if you haven't played at least half way into Senjou no Valkyria 3.The plot seems 'fine' for a side story of this sort.

Ever since Valkyria Chronicles (game), words spread that there\'s an anime adaptation of it and i watched it like all day until it\'s finished.Okay, since this is Valkyria Chronicles 3, i just gonna talk about it.Valkyria Chronciles 3: Unrecorded Chronicles is an OVA for Valkyria Chronicles, which tells you about the ""unrecorded"" story about what happened while our main hero squad, Squad 7 fought against the Imp. What\'s you going to see is a group of men in black fought both the same...enemy and their fellow Gallians with less supplies and morale.Story: 9/10Valkyria Chronicles 3: Unrecorded Chronicles made me in love more with Valkyria Chronicles series since it uncover the darker side of the Gallian Army and the war itself. I always love dark side of stories and this one really interesting.Art: 8/10I can\'t actually rate the art used in this series. I think it\'s just a decent one but it\'s enough and it met my expectation.Sound: 8/10Voice actors used in this series execute their job well, although i found some voice line that i feel unnessecary to be put in the scene. The rest of it isn\'t that bad. In fact, i love the trio protagonists\' voices.Character: 10/10I just gonna put this bluntly. I don\'t search for waifus and husbus here (and yeah i think it\'s pointless to rate it 10/10 if i just search them) and i kinda curses anyone that watches animes and stuffs only to find them. What you will found in Valkyria Chronicles 3: Unrecorded Chronicles is a wide variant characters with personalities you wouldn\'t expect to found in a ""special ops squad"". To be honest, i\'m in love with the male protagonist\'s personality. Fine delivered character but you will have difficulties understanding him and the other members of the squad if you haven\'t played the game.Enjoyment: 10/10I\'m a guy that enjoys animes and wanted to understand why does people went to war. Valkyria Chronicles might gave me the answer but Valkyria Chronicles 3: Unrecorded Chronicles added some spices on it, making me enjoying it more.Overall: 10/10I do enjoy this very much. Note that i already finished played Valkyria Chronicles 3: Unrecorded Chronicles at PSP so i really understands how the story is trying to tell the viewers.Last thing, i do recommend you to play the game which available on PSP first.

Shikabane Hime: Kuro,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5034/Shikabane_Hime__Kuro,"['I\'m not sure why they decided to make Kuro into a second season, rather than just episodes 14-25 of Aka. Then again, who am I to doubt the genius of those who decided to make a story about sexy, gun-wielding, zombie chicks. For those who haven\'t watched Aka, go watch it. Those who have will find that not much has changed. There is a lot more ecchi/fanservice, because we obviously didn\'t get enough of our necrophilia fixation in season one. Don\'t get me wrong, I appreciate ecchi humour just as much as the next guy, but I can\'t help but feel they\'re sending the wrong...kind of message to younger audiences.Story: 6I think my score is rather generous for a script I could have written in 7th grade. I mean I\'m just at a loss because of how simple and illogical the story is. Certain characters gain sudden god-like powers that are often unexplained, and then defeat the villains. Oori and friends also discover a ""shocking\' conspiracy that puts even Area 51 to shame. I know its unfair to ask logic from a show based on the living dead, but we deserve better.Art: 7Was this show broadcasted in HD? Honestly, I couldn\'t tell. The animation was average at best, so those who have been spoiled by high-end animations will find it irritating. However, I thought the fights were fairly well drawn. It could be just my imagination, but I thought the animation was slightly improved from Aka.Sound: 9This is my favourite part of Kuro; the entire reason I decided to stick with this show. The OP and ED really gets you in the mood for watching undead babes open a jar of ass-kick on zombies (no sarcasm here). The sound of Makina\'s double uzis is just music to my ears, even during the 500th time they play it.Character: 7While its good to have dynamic characters and lots of conflict between them, its not so good when they act in such illogical ways that you can\'t help but give your screen the finger. It also makes little sense to give a huge amount of depth to certain supporting characters, but almost none to some of the more important ones. They wasted too much time in Aka in developing the characters, and its come back to bite em in the crotch this time around.Enjoyment: 8I\'ll try my best to keep my Yamagami Itsuki fantasies to myself, but I do feel the need to point out Makina\'s wardrobe malfunction. It is painfully obvious in the OP that she is not wearing any underwear, I mean how much more work would it take to draw in some clothing down there?Despite its shortcomings I feel that many of you will enjoy Kuro, as I have.

This was my case with the Shikabane Hime seriesStory 7.6I was a little disappointed that the real ""plot"" and ""story"" started a bit late. However I love how the helped with the building up drama for the climax of season 1 and the start of the second season. Now what I found interesting and a little disappointing too is that they changed quite a lot of things from the original source. This was very noticeable from the beginning of the season 1 and...the start of season  2 . If you\'ve finished the manga (or what\'s available raw and translated) before you watched the anime, then you will be able to tell the differences immediately because it\'s  ""in your face"" type changes. Season 2 was pretty much just a continuation of the events going on after Keisei\'s death. Now what I didn\'t like obviously, again, was the changes. In addition to that, the events right at the beginning of Keisei\'s death became very predictable and not just because I finished the manga but because  I\'ve seen a lot of similar titles, I knew what was going to happen naturally. Ouri, which didn\'t surprise me, made a  contract with Makina to save her. The true villains appear with and form their evil and somewhat convoluted plot.  New characters  are finally introduced and everyone needs to get stronger and work together to save the day. So it was sort of like, after season 1 I just put two and two together which totally took away a lot of the joy for me. The good thing is, even though it was predictable I still had an amazing time watching it. Seeing the truth and backstories behind both Makina and Ouri really helped enhance my attitude. After seeing what happened to Makina in the past, I was like ""Awww girl, you better whoop the seven stars asses and get your long deserved revenge."" Ouri\'s story was pretty upsetting but also interesting because I think, as far as main characters go in Shikabane, his backstory wasn\'t really... ""deep"" Lastly, and the biggest thing which kept me from giving the story a full 8 was the ending... now I  don\'t want to spoil it, I can\'t spoil it, but just these following words will help you understand, God damn it Gainax.  Overall, story 7.6/10 really interesting title  to look into.Art & animation 7.0Pretty decent animation and artwork for the shows time. I wasn\'t too keen on most of the ""special effects"" and the overall quality the animators used during Shikabane battles. They felt a bit bland and unexciting. In addition to that I felt like the battles were very ""repetitive."" For example, I really wanted to get super excited when I see Shikabane get REKT by Makina (or other Shikabane hime but for now I\'ll focus on Makina. ) However a majority of her fights were Makina getting rekt by a shikabane, using hacks to get unlimited ammo and shoot her ineffective bullets at the shikabane.  Finally, the ""I\'m a main character I can\'t die"" comes in to play and she kills the shikabane. So the art and the animation, I felt wasn\'t the best, especially considering the time of the shows release. Overall, I didn\'t care too much for it.Sound 6.5sound wasn\'t any thing special. The background music was pretty bland, I didn\'t have a favorite song other than the opening. I wasn\'t too impressed with the voice actors. After finishing the second season, I decided to check and see what other roles the characters voice actors played in and was surprised to find that for the most part, they are inexperienced. Shikabane Hime was either first big role. When I first heard Hasome doing the voice of Ouri I was like ""man did they just find some random person out on the streets."" Makina on the other hand, because she had a ""serious"" personality, Nana spoke in a  monotone-ish voice for her and I actually didn\'t like it too much. Like she does have the potential to train her voice more and land even better roles however, for Shikabane, I just wasn\'t feeling it. Overall I wasn\'t too impressed with the soundtrack.Characters 7.5I didn\'t care too much for many of the characters both new and re-introduced for season 2. I think Ouri was too generic of a main character to impress me. Typical weak high school student who gets involved in something he shouldn\'t be involved in. Doesn\'t experience any real growth until like the middle of the series, he was just awful. I personally think that Makina would have been great solo. I think she\'s one of the best and severely underrated strong female main characters in anime. Then again, there are literally like hundred-thousands to millions, of strong female leads who go unrecognized. Moving on, a good majority the side characters are forgettable, like Ouri\'s high-school mates. I felt like they were around just so Ouri had some interactions, so he didn\'t seem like the lonely type.  I mean, to contradict what I said just a little, even though they don\'t play such a big role, they do help both Makina & Ouri with character growth towards the final episodes. Overall I wasn\'t to impressed with the cast of bland characters. The backstories were nice but didn\'t make up for my overall feeling towards them. My overall feeling for  the characters is that they were ""okay."" There were lots of interesting characters to be found in Shikabane and I think that\'s more than enough.Enjoyment/Overall 7.0Needless to say, the reoccurring sense of enjoyment I had watching was off and on. But for the most part it was on and stayed on until fights felt repetitive or something tragic would happen. Overall, I believe Shikabane is pretty good, it\'s not the best when it comes to characters but the story is without a doubt one of the best and most redeeming thing that delivers in the entire series. I enjoyed my time watching it. 8.1/10 the start of season  2 . If you\'ve finished the manga (or what\'s available raw and translated) before you watched the anime, then you will be able to tell the differences immediately because it\'s  ""in your face"" type changes. Season 2 was pretty much just a continuation of the events going on after Keisei\'s death. Now what I didn\'t like obviously, again, was the changes. In addition to that, the events right at the beginning of Keisei\'s death became very predictable and not just because I finished the manga but because  I\'ve seen a lot of similar titles, I knew what was going to happen naturally. Ouri, which didn\'t surprise me, made a  contract with Makina to save her. The true villains appear with and form their evil and somewhat convoluted plot.  New characters  are finally introduced and everyone needs to get stronger and work together to save the day. So it was sort of like, after season 1 I just put two and two together which totally took away a lot of the joy for me.

The difference between an attachment to the world, which is what drives the Corpses, and the more fundamental concept of one's underlying Nature, was good. The constant reminder that the Shikabane Himes are not human beings was a good source of conflict in all the priests' relationships with the himes.  Tthe plot never did much with these themes though.  Other than one twist at the end, the story was predictable and pretty much a standard monster-fighting show.ArtThe main characters were well designed, the action was pretty good, and it managed to be creepy fairly often. Nothing...amazing and I know I've heard plenty of complaints regarding the inconsistent quality, but it took nothing away from the show.SoundGreat soundtrack.  One of the best I've encountered in a while.  A must have for anyone who like sad instrumental stuff.CharacterThe only decent character was the Betrayer Priest, who was a terrific noble villain with the best backstory in the show.  Oori was weak and whiny, even in his one climatic ordeal.  The little strength he displays at the end had no build up.  Makina was annoying; she was just a violent angry chick who did whatever the hell she wanted without consequences.  Hokuto was an extremely 1 dimensional villain--powerful and insane.

The art is great, the animation is pretty awesome, and the story is well thought-out and structured.The thing I love best, BEST, BEEEEEEEEST about this is:Being a female, the fanservice can get extremely tiring in anime sometimes. Shikabane Hime is one of the few anime I\'ve ever seen where the female characters kick so much ass and do it without all of the annoying fanservice. I haven\'t seen a single panty shot and the angled views that usually show the ""goods"" aren\'t excessive. Most of the angled shots are for the action scenes, and purely that. The only full-on fanservice...I\'ve seen in this anime has been the catgirl (whom I consider to be a joke) or entirely in the endings. (The closing theme song endings)I love the characters. Makina especially. She has this... manly factor that radiates off of her which is rare in female anime characters. Her eyebrows are slightly thick and she\'s completely serious about her battles. She punches the shit out of things with a gruff voice, and isn\'t there to be sexy or feminine. She\'s there to do her job. That\'s what I love best about this.Now, there is a factor that stops this from becoming one of my all-time favorites. A huge problem. The -biggest- problem, and the problem that destroys the entire second season (or the whole show) in its entirety.Like Soul Eater, yup... that dreaded ending.I\'ve heard lots of things about the ending, from it being a DVD special (which actually goes back to the first season, Aka) and hopes of there possibly being another season.If Kuro ended the way it did and there is a 3rd season, or maybe even a last episode, I will be completely fine and satisfied with it.Otherwise? It ends completely abruptly, with many plot holes left open, so much that there -has- to be a third season to explain it all! My problem with this is, it\'s been over a year already and there has been no hints whatsoever of a third season.I hear the manga is still going, and I have to check that out, but until then, my overall rating for this anime is a 9 -- disregarding the ending and pretending it had a real one, or a 2 with the ending finishing it off as a series.

The relationship between Makina and Ouri is fantastic and it always keep you guessing about what will happen next to those two.There was an obvious change in artwork, looking drastically different from Aka.

Makina is put under observation by her handlers, the Kougan Sect, while Ouri is forced to train into becoming a monk. While this is going on, the Seven Stars begin to reveal their plan to annihilate their enemies. -summaryCorpse Princess: Kuro features the last 12 episodes, and in addition to still focusing on action, the anime makes an attempt in telling more of a story. It follows the usual format by revealing more character background and...introducing major plot twist. Even though it kind of felt like a ""seen that before"", the surprises and revelations really did come out of left field, and these elements set the anime on pace towards being better than what it should have been. Unfortunately, these ideas were wasted and Corpse Princess comes off as just another average anime title that really doesn\'t rank as a must see.The action scenes are still entertaining though, and for action fans that\'s indeed a plus. There are plenty of shoot outs and good hand to hand exchanges that actually have a point, and aren\'t really tacked on when the motives are made clear. Visually, it\'s as good as the last chapter with some good action choreography on certain occasions. It\'s still cool to watch Makina in mid-flight action dodging scores of projectiles to move in closer on her enemies. The animation moves at a nice pace and there aren\'t many short cuts taken. The character designs are well done showing off some of the more endowed females. Although the production values are strong, it takes a small dip later on, but this can hardly be noticed and it doesn\'t hurt the show from where I see it. The only area on the style department I would say is still lacking would be in the overall music score. The opening and ending theme(especially) are pretty catchy, however, there\'s absolutely nothing in the BGM that stood out to me. It didn\'t exactly give off a bland feel for the action or drama-filled segments, but it didn\'t enhance them enough either.The plot follows Makina along with the contracted monks and other Shikibane Hime confronting the Seven Stars, and trying to put an end to that small faction of very powerful Shikibane. Although many of the Seven Stars come off as stock bad guys initially, they are developed enough to understand their personal drives, and it\'s this diversity between some of them that makes the anime a little better than what it should have been. They actually felt more interesting than the heroes for me, especially since they were so serious and meant business. The characters receive quite a bit more attention in this second half, and the series manages to utilize its themes pretty well, which are love, obsession, and revenge, by showing the destructive path these emotions can lead to.There are various plot twist that take place which builds up the story, along with certain questions pondered on the way, and these elements add a great deal to the suspense; but the series has issues in the writing with some of these questions either not being answered, or not answered to the point where one can be satisfied. I can imagine the action crowd not even caring much about that portion or just completely missing it. The same can\'t be said about those who prefer their stories to be wire tight, and if this isn\'t slightly damaging enough, the ending really brings things down and leaves major questions in the air. The series ends with a heavily unfinished feel, some folks may try to find some high artistic value in all this, but in the end it just comes off as lazy and nothing more. Corpse Princess is an action title completely at its core, and this is something that should have never been forgotten.Corpse Princess is a decent title and nothing more. It\'s not something I would recommend as essential viewing at all. There are slight issues with tonal consistency for those who are bothered by it, fortunately, it appeared that the writers realized this would lead to disaster so it\'s calmed down rather quickly. Overall, it meshes action, drama, and comedy rather well with a heavy emphasis on the first two.

There\'s not really a difference in time, it just continues like if it were the same series.  My review will contain spoilers - the first part of this review is basically full of my emotions, whereas the second part is a bit more objective - hope you enjoy.This is one of the best watches I\'ve had in a LONG time. Action (GOOD action), DEATHS (YES), Horror, Drama, this shit is straight up awesome and really, the ""unfinished ending"" does not really bother, since the anime has everything pretty much covered...up, except for the victor of that last fight, which the author of this masterpiece deemed not important for the story to stay epic! Of course, had the ending been complete, I wouldn\'t mind saying it\'s clearly a 10 for masterpiece, but I still think it\'s a magical series.Really though, I am maybe biased, but AMAZING soundtrack, exemplary loyalty to angela for the opening and endings - anime series that stay attached to the same artist for their songs really get to me, since when I download angela\'s songs, I immediately recall all of the powerful memories and emotions I got from this anime series-, good fight scenes, amazing original seiyuus (Makina, Itsuki, and even Ouri, they have that particular accent I really liked - changes from your usual anime voice actors) and it\'s not your typical ""nobody dies even when confronted to apparently life-threatening situations"" anime.To be honest with you guys, my only disappointment in this series is that I would have loved seeing Touma, Kanechika Umehara\'s second (or first) Shikabane Hime (she\'s not even in the character section of the anime... and Umehara has no description).Alright, so now I\'ll try being more precise in my review :Story :This anime starts off and until Kuro, the main character, Kagami Ouri, is pretty much only an observer. He is involved very early with Shikabane (Corpse(s)) and Shikabane Hime (Corpse Princess(es)), due to his ability to subconsciously (or guided by the cat) sense Corpses. Shikabane Hime are supposedly required to slain 108 Corpses in order to ascend to Paradise, according to the Kongou organization, which consists of Contractor Priests and their Shikabane Hime, which they have contracted with. The Contracted Priests feed their Shikabane Hime their Run energy through a bond called En.As for Kagami Ouri, despite being a bit useless in Aka, he starts becoming more important, after the death of his Brother, Tagami Keisei, and we learn that the Kongou is not necessarily a good organization. Something shady is going on, and many clues are given out to the audience through Akasha, the Betrayer Priest, who presumably killed his own Shikabane Hime, Hibiki. Also, Sadahiro and his Shikabane Hime, Akira Touka are acting separately from the Kongou and are even allowed to kill humans. In Kuro, the main goal is to fight off the Shichisei, the organization that forcefully turned Homura Makina into a Corpse Princess, and later on we discover the true identity of the Kongou organization.Art :The art is not necessarily the most impressive. However, I can\'t say that fight scenes are lacking; movements are fast, fluid, clear (not in darkness and barely visible), and we sense both emotion and messages the images are trying to send us. Although many people say this anime contains fan service, I\'m obliged to say it\'s not the case. The most you\'ll have of fan service is one situation where Yamagami Itsuki is binded by her past high school friend that died and had become a Corpse and during the ending animations (yeah, those are intense and on purpose, but hey, what\'s wrong with that? C:). Aside from that, the parts of sideways butt flesh is especially present on Makina, but it\'s not like we consider naked panty-less butts to be fan service (as we often see on male anime characters), especially not from the angles presented in Shikabane Hime : Kuro or Aka (only from the sides, and mostly less than half of the butt - check the opening and that\'s pretty much the most you\'ll get). Instead, I did not really focus on those scenes, and I saw mostly Makina\'s intensely strong character.Sound :Hah, here it is. This anime has one of the most amazing hype type of opening and endings, angela is really a great motivation bringer to this series; heck, she doesn\'t even act in it and yet her presence is felt throughout it all - her voice is simply amazing, the emotions she gives off are perfectly in sync, hard to ask for more. The soundtrack is also very good, I\'ve got nothing to add here.Character :All characters in this series become important, and all are very original and bring on their own colors. I only disliked Kagami Ouri\'s performance in Shikabane Hime : Aka, but in Kuro it\'s a whole different story, he mans up and gets it going for him again (with a bit of shounen traits), but I still found it was well orchestrated. As for Makina, how can one not like this kick-ass undead zombie-type of woman; she\'s strong, she\'s motivated, she\'s cute, she\'s coldblooded, she\'s athletic, her voice is AMAZING, and her resolution is unmatched. I think girls will like this character, because she\'s different from other female leads in anime, she isn\'t that old invulnerable shy girl that relies on the male lead, she\'s the one in charge and she won\'t let anyone get into her way.As for the side characters, they\'re all pretty great, but I want to talk about the school characters. Nosume Kasuga was intense, she got me so attached to her, Hina, the little girl from the orphanage, Mizuki Inuhiko, the tomboy type of girl from the school; I really wasn\'t expecting such minor characters to have such a positive impact on the development of this story, and each and every character is very different from one another; it\'s a rare series that will make you actually remember otherwise unnecessary characters because of how original they are.I also mentioned this earlier, but this is one of the key points I loved in this series; people DIE. Yes, people you might not expect to die actually do, even if it happens and you might have doubts they actually died, they most likely did. If you haven\'t caught up on who I\'m talking about yet, I\'m talking about Ruo Minai and her Contracted Priest. How epic. Had this been your regular shounen, Minai would have lived, being contracted by Kagami Ouri, but this was NOT the case. Making people die in anime series makes the series so much more realistic, powerful, emotional. It\'s sadistic to say it this way, but it\'s true. Cheers to authors that have the guts to erase characters with so much attachment potential.Enjoyment :Do I really need to write something here?Anyways, I could add a lot more text, but I decided I\'d stop here. Shikabane Hime is a truly colorful series, and I truly hope more of these come out in the future. For people wanting to watch a serie with similar, maybe even better hype for some, try Ga-Rei : Zero.That is all, thank you for reading. Hope I changed your opinion on this anime! up, except for the victor of that last fight, which the author of this masterpiece deemed not important for the story to stay epic! Of course, had the ending been complete, I wouldn\'t mind saying it\'s clearly a 10 for masterpiece, but I still think it\'s a magical series.Really though, I am maybe biased, but AMAZING soundtrack, exemplary loyalty to angela for the opening and endings - anime series that stay attached to the same artist for their songs really get to me, since when I download angela\'s songs, I immediately recall all of the powerful memories and emotions I got from this anime series-, good fight scenes, amazing original seiyuus (Makina, Itsuki, and even Ouri, they have that particular accent I really liked - changes from your usual anime voice actors) and it\'s not your typical ""nobody dies even when confronted to apparently life-threatening situations"" anime.To be honest with you guys, my only disappointment in this series is that I would have loved seeing Touma, Kanechika Umehara\'s second (or first) Shikabane Hime (she\'s not even in the character section of the anime... and Umehara has no description).Alright, so now I\'ll try being more precise in my review :Story :This anime starts off and until Kuro, the main character, Kagami Ouri, is pretty much only an observer. He is involved very early with Shikabane (Corpse(s)) and Shikabane Hime (Corpse Princess(es)), due to his ability to subconsciously (or guided by the cat) sense Corpses. Shikabane Hime are supposedly required to slain 108 Corpses in order to ascend to Paradise, according to the Kongou organization, which consists of Contractor Priests and their Shikabane Hime, which they have contracted with. The Contracted Priests feed their Shikabane Hime their Run energy through a bond called En.As for Kagami Ouri, despite being a bit useless in Aka, he starts becoming more important, after the death of his Brother, Tagami Keisei, and we learn that the Kongou is not necessarily a good organization. Something shady is going on, and many clues are given out to the audience through Akasha, the Betrayer Priest, who presumably killed his own Shikabane Hime, Hibiki. Also, Sadahiro and his Shikabane Hime, Akira Touka are acting separately from the Kongou and are even allowed to kill humans. In Kuro, the main goal is to fight off the Shichisei, the organization that forcefully turned Homura Makina into a Corpse Princess, and later on we discover the true identity of the Kongou organization.Art :The art is not necessarily the most impressive. However, I can\'t say that fight scenes are lacking; movements are fast, fluid, clear (not in darkness and barely visible), and we sense both emotion and messages the images are trying to send us. Although many people say this anime contains fan service, I\'m obliged to say it\'s not the case. The most you\'ll have of fan service is one situation where Yamagami Itsuki is binded by her past high school friend that died and had become a Corpse and during the ending animations (yeah, those are intense and on purpose, but hey, what\'s wrong with that? C:). Aside from that, the parts of sideways butt flesh is especially present on Makina, but it\'s not like we consider naked panty-less butts to be fan service (as we often see on male anime characters), especially not from the angles presented in Shikabane Hime : Kuro or Aka (only from the sides, and mostly less than half of the butt - check the opening and that\'s pretty much the most you\'ll get). Instead, I did not really focus on those scenes, and I saw mostly Makina\'s intensely strong character.Sound :Hah, here it is. This anime has one of the most amazing hype type of opening and endings, angela is really a great motivation bringer to this series; heck, she doesn\'t even act in it and yet her presence is felt throughout it all - her voice is simply amazing, the emotions she gives off are perfectly in sync, hard to ask for more. The soundtrack is also very good, I\'ve got nothing to add here.Character :All characters in this series become important, and all are very original and bring on their own colors. I only disliked Kagami Ouri\'s performance in Shikabane Hime : Aka, but in Kuro it\'s a whole different story, he mans up and gets it going for him again (with a bit of shounen traits), but I still found it was well orchestrated. As for Makina, how can one not like this kick-ass undead zombie-type of woman; she\'s strong, she\'s motivated, she\'s cute, she\'s coldblooded, she\'s athletic, her voice is AMAZING, and her resolution is unmatched.

Hope I changed your opinion on this anime!', ""[THIS REVIEW IS WITH REGARDS TO BOTH SEASONS.]Story: 6/10The story was nowhere near great. But overall, it had its own scale of potential. A killing lassie owning a dual uzi-machine guns set to find revenge on her death is such a cool starting idea. Shikabane Hime series definitely got the right mindset on how to start with a bang. But as the story gets more developed, it went blurry and hard to appreciate. For sure, the series had its own good moments but honestly, that prove to be fatal as Shikabane Hime only had a handful of them limiting the storytelling into a mediocre one.Sound/Art:...6-7/10The art was classy and crafted really well. With a good art fitting the dark premise of the story, it certainly earned good points for the series. The included animation also wasn't short of great and as far as the fights are concerned, it was nevertheless entertaining and interesting. Although, I cannot say it's the entirety since there are key fights that doesn't even make sense or just too short to appreciate.The sound wasn't a hit to me. The series had insert songs that is just not alluring but gets in the way instead of just using a good bgm. Repetitive use of the theme songs as inserts prove not up to my liking therefore earning a lower score than the other aspects.Characters: 5/10There's nothing more annoying than using a spineless and helpless wuss as a main protagonist. Concerning the shounen tag, the main boy protagonist definitely lacks the spark from start to finish. For sure, he was more developed episode by episode but let's be directly honest, wasn't there a need to make him that un-cool for the entire 13 episodes? Helpless, weakling, easy-to-beat... he was just way too unappealing for the part of the main character. Directly opposite is his counterpart, the main heroine. Their contrast was way too messed up. Their feelings were also un-synchronized and were totally forced to blend in the final latter episodes. In short, their personalities was forcibly mixed resulting into a hard-to-appreciate combo.As we go to discuss their anti-hero opposites and supporting characters, it was my biggest disappointment that apart from a good background, their dialogues or their actions prove to be not fitting to the time they build up their characters. There's an awful lot of bad decisions that made the series so much mediocre ruining the chance to shine instead.Enjoyment/Overall: 5I'll be darn straight. The series was a big killer of enthusiasm.I had much expectations on this title before watching. 5 years ago, I was able to get a complete copy of this series but ended up scraping it on my oldest HDD and completely forgotten to see the show I'm itching to watch before. For a synopsis with so much potential, I was nothing short of shocked as to why it just ended with that anti-climatic formula. The dark story, the good potential, the unattractive characters plus their dialogues. All of it didn't piqued a good amount of my interest. The mixing of all the factors were really the downfall of the said series. In short, Shikabane Hime failed to capitalized on its good start and ended up as one of the biggest disappointments in my entire seen roster. My sentiments, if only they had made the main protagonist more upbeat and more independent, it would've turned for the better. 6-7/10The art was classy and crafted really well.

Great story with my emotions involved and a must watch series. The only problem I found was the ending... if you have watched the entire series you will understand that the ending of episode 12 in Shikabane Hime: kuro/ episode 25 of the full storyline was just wrong. the to be continued sign made me so happy but to find out there was no more episodes broke me. aside from that it was a great show and I really enjoyed it. ', 'Too be honest, I was expecting so much from this season as the previous season was not really interesting but I guess, I was expecting too much and I ended up disappointed!I strongly believed that the story was made so out of proportion. Too much tragedy and too much drama which was not justify until it finishes. Most of the time I was irritated by lots of things like the story, characters, dialogues, and most importantly the ending which is very important whether a story is good or bad. Every scene had too much tragedy and drama almost like Elfren Lied. It was no longer...healthy for the subconscious mind. Most of the characters did stupid things almost all time that’s why they always end up killed or beaten up. To add it up, they would always say such too cheesy or too mushy lines. It looked like they were trying so hard to be cool or heroic which didn’t work for them. And as if it wasn’t enough! The ending wasn’t justifiable at all. It doesn’t give you a closure at all. The villains revealed something and it turned out he was really the victim. That was too much of a CLICHÉ. Just because it turned out that the villains were just mere victims, that didn’t justify their actions. It even ended with the lead female and main antagonist just clashing their fists while the female lead says over dramatic lines.I only finished this for the sole reason of finishing something that I started but not that I was anticipating the ending at all. healthy for the subconscious mind.

Selection Project,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44275/Selection_Project,"['Selection project: Can I copy your homework? I promise I’ll change itIdoly pride: Ok, but seriously make sure you change it.In all seriousness, Selection project and idoly pride have a lot in common. It’s pretty apparent that DG were really influenced by Idoly Pride’s story and wanted to put their own twist on that. Right down to the heart transplant, dead sister that was an idol plot-line. While the story was basically copy and pasted, I still really liked Selection Project and actually think it to be the best idol show this year, yes, including Superstar!.What made me feel that way? Well simply put,...I loved Idoly Pride. Since this was basically Idoly Pride season 2, I loved it. The girls all have really cool backstories and were given their time to shine, as well as some great music. Some of the songs from the project are among the best of the year for sure. The animation during performances is really solid and with it being Doga Kobo, the art in general is great. Even though some of the same plot-points from IP were rehashed, I still loved and cared for the girls which is integral to any idol project.Selection Project may not be completely original, but it’s a must watch for any fan of the idol genre. Loveable characters, emotional story, great performances, what’s not to love?SelePro gets 10 microphones out of 10. I loved Idoly Pride. Since this was basically Idoly Pride season 2, I loved it.

Obviously, if you\'re thinking that this show tries to be innovative somewhat (which I\'d assume that you\'ve never watched the former before), then I\'m sorry to say that you\'ve clearly been bamboozled...right until the final stretch, that is.I mean, let\'s get the facts out of the gate: 2 different projects of entirely the same premise by 2 entirely different entities: Idoly Pride by CyberAgent and Selection Project by Kadokawa, both beginning at the same time in December 2019. The former is just as what you\'d expect of the typical American Idol, The X Factor shows, and the latter trying to separate itself by adding the ""reality show"" factor that\'s similar to most of the K-Pop idol-based reality shows. The only deciding factor is that which project got the anime adaptation first to stand out, and unfortunately for Selection Project, Idoly Pride beat it to the punch by a full half-year ahead early this year in the Winter season. Even if there weren\'t any crossover staff between both shows, I\'d bet that someone in the production team must\'ve watched Idoly Pride (or any other idol shows for that matter if it didn\'t exist), thought of it, and just basically and literally asked ""Can I borrow your homework?"", only to then proceed to copy-paste the answer to yet another work that is only starting to be established.Let\'s do the checklist shall we?- Girl who has a heart transplant problem? Check.- Girl whom got her heart from someone famous idol who died in an unfortunate accident, only to then get jealous because the one that got saved exhibit the exact same qualities as the former? Check.- Girl whom has a rival that can\'t shake the fact that she ""stole"" her deceased sister\'s unique traits? Check.- Girls whom of their performances exhibit the same ""world-class"" 3DCG idol production? Check.- Girls whom backstories and drama are just more or about the same when you trace back to certain characters? Check.- Girls whom are being ""programmed"" by the own idol program just for satiable drama? Check.- Girls individually or group-set have great songs under their belt? Check.So yes, with that many outliers, you can\'t discount, disguise and defend yourself of the fact that you\'re watching Idoly Pride 2.0, with even worse cheap and overblown melodrama that can go exuberantly ham, until the certain plot twist that truly makes Selection Project stand out on its own (but is still like copying from other idol shows for inspiration like Wake Up, Girls! or even more closer, 22/7). But then again, who am I kidding that why would a show in the first place mindlessly just be the ""dog that ate my homework"", because this is a chance for shows like these to be different from expectations set from all levels. And for Selection Project, it was one hell of a predictable set-up that was just basically a guessing game of whether are we right or wrong about many plotholes being questioned and answered from start to finish. Simply unoriginal.The central 9 girls which form the eventual idol group 9-tie, it\'s just hard to believe that as much as the girls are all split up into their individual groups in order to get some character drama out of them and then combine them altogether, you have to ironically swallow the fact that Suzune Miyama and Rena Hananoi got major screentime because of the whole Idoly Pride MC heart transplant surgery plot melodrama. In that sense, the former does the drama so much better, and the latter just copied the concept but didn\'t know what to do with the execution, and drag the hell out of it they did. I\'d almost forgot the fact that Selection Project, like Idoly Pride, the main focus is to weed out the best girl to win the competition, but it seems that along the way, reconciliation and teamwork became the main focus than rather actually trying to find The One girl that would top the list and make a restitution to conclude it with a sound mind. To that effect, I kinda like the twist of the final stretch, but that twist also comes with a price of a self-inflicting deep knife stab onto oneself. Sumipanda a.k.a Jun-chan as the MC host does feel like a character whom is there to see the progression of the show and follow up all the drama in a somewhat degrading way, even when deep down he has been through all of this before to sympathy.Selection Project is Doga Kobo\'s 2nd mixed-media production since Spring 2015\'s Mikagura Gakuen Kumikyoku a.k.a Mikagura School Suite, and I think it should be very obvious that requesting the studio to rehash the same genre\'s production where they did decently isn\'t really gonna cut the mark. All we know is that Doga Kobo specializes in CGDCT-focused manga adaptations, and occasionally is given projects to adapt different mediums, though you can definitely put two and two together to see the same stark differences of the reception. While it\'s nice to see the studio actually doing something different for once, it just comes off as unfitting, especially when outsourced 3DCG studios are called in to do the actual idol segments (which are the standard). Also, if you take a look at the character designs, didn\'t they almost look like a certain Chizuru, Mami, Ruka or Sumi? If you manage to spot the similar designs, then congrats and give yourself a pat on your back, because Kanna Hirayama is back from Kanojo, Okarishimasu a.k.a Rent-A-Girfriend, and Selection Project is her 2nd project doing the same character design work. Splendid replica work though.Any idol show will have its music on full blast, and for Selection Project, I\'d thought that the songs from the entire 9-tie to the various split groups of RenaSuzu, Splasoda and GAPsCAPs were good, but don\'t really stand out from the pack. Maybe more so for the OP and ED with ""Glorious Days"" and ""Only one yell"", most especially with the ED of having each and every girl sing the song verses solo before the overall chorus to give their spotlight, I like touches like these. Japan has more than enough companies producing and debuting more idol solo and/or groups, and Kadokawa only jumping onto this bandwagon right now is just too late with established series like Love Live!, Bushiroad\'s various franchises and many more to count. At least Idoly Pride was able to make itself stand out with its premise that was supported by the incredible songs.When it all comes down to it, Selection Project at its peak, was just trying to be yet another case of Idoly Pride, all while still figuring out what it wants to be, and that in itself might have already spelled out the doom of the entire series as a whole. All I can say is that if it weren\'t for Idoly Pride, Selection Project could\'ve amassed the same lengths of success as the predecessor that came before it. But as it stands, it\'s a blatant copy-paste project of a total rip-off that does the same thing but worse in every regard.Why go through a Selection Project when you can invest in idols where they have Idoly Pride? Heh, nailed it!

Even if there weren\'t any crossover staff between both shows, I\'d bet that someone in the production team must\'ve watched Idoly Pride (or any other idol shows for that matter if it didn\'t exist), thought of it, and just basically and literally asked ""Can I borrow your homework?"", only to then proceed to copy-paste the answer to yet another work that is only starting to be established.Let\'s do the checklist shall we?- Girl who has a heart transplant problem? Check.- Girl whom got her heart from someone famous idol who died in an unfortunate accident, only to then get jealous because the one that got saved exhibit the exact same qualities as the former? Check.- Girl whom has a rival that can\'t shake the fact that she ""stole"" her deceased sister\'s unique traits? Check.- Girls whom of their performances exhibit the same ""world-class"" 3DCG idol production? Check.- Girls whom backstories and drama are just more or about the same when you trace back to certain characters? Check.- Girls whom are being ""programmed"" by the own idol program just for satiable drama? Check.- Girls individually or group-set have great songs under their belt? Check.So yes, with that many outliers, you can\'t discount, disguise and defend yourself of the fact that you\'re watching Idoly Pride 2.0, with even worse cheap and overblown melodrama that can go exuberantly ham, until the certain plot twist that truly makes Selection Project stand out on its own (but is still like copying from other idol shows for inspiration like Wake Up, Girls! or even more closer, 22/7). But then again, who am I kidding that why would a show in the first place mindlessly just be the ""dog that ate my homework"", because this is a chance for shows like these to be different from expectations set from all levels. And for Selection Project, it was one hell of a predictable set-up that was just basically a guessing game of whether are we right or wrong about many plotholes being questioned and answered from start to finish. Simply unoriginal.The central 9 girls which form the eventual idol group 9-tie, it\'s just hard to believe that as much as the girls are all split up into their individual groups in order to get some character drama out of them and then combine them altogether, you have to ironically swallow the fact that Suzune Miyama and Rena Hananoi got major screentime because of the whole Idoly Pride MC heart transplant surgery plot melodrama. In that sense, the former does the drama so much better, and the latter just copied the concept but didn\'t know what to do with the execution, and drag the hell out of it they did. I\'d almost forgot the fact that Selection Project, like Idoly Pride, the main focus is to weed out the best girl to win the competition, but it seems that along the way, reconciliation and teamwork became the main focus than rather actually trying to find The One girl that would top the list and make a restitution to conclude it with a sound mind. To that effect, I kinda like the twist of the final stretch, but that twist also comes with a price of a self-inflicting deep knife stab onto oneself. Sumipanda a.k.a Jun-chan as the MC host does feel like a character whom is there to see the progression of the show and follow up all the drama in a somewhat degrading way, even when deep down he has been through all of this before to sympathy.Selection Project is Doga Kobo\'s 2nd mixed-media production since Spring 2015\'s Mikagura Gakuen Kumikyoku a.k.a Mikagura School Suite, and I think it should be very obvious that requesting the studio to rehash the same genre\'s production where they did decently isn\'t really gonna cut the mark. All we know is that Doga Kobo specializes in CGDCT-focused manga adaptations, and occasionally is given projects to adapt different mediums, though you can definitely put two and two together to see the same stark differences of the reception. While it\'s nice to see the studio actually doing something different for once, it just comes off as unfitting, especially when outsourced 3DCG studios are called in to do the actual idol segments (which are the standard). Also, if you take a look at the character designs, didn\'t they almost look like a certain Chizuru, Mami, Ruka or Sumi? If you manage to spot the similar designs, then congrats and give yourself a pat on your back, because Kanna Hirayama is back from Kanojo, Okarishimasu a.k.a Rent-A-Girfriend, and Selection Project is her 2nd project doing the same character design work. Splendid replica work though.Any idol show will have its music on full blast, and for Selection Project, I\'d thought that the songs from the entire 9-tie to the various split groups of RenaSuzu, Splasoda and GAPsCAPs were good, but don\'t really stand out from the pack. Maybe more so for the OP and ED with ""Glorious Days"" and ""Only one yell"", most especially with the ED of having each and every girl sing the song verses solo before the overall chorus to give their spotlight, I like touches like these. Japan has more than enough companies producing and debuting more idol solo and/or groups, and Kadokawa only jumping onto this bandwagon right now is just too late with established series like Love Live!, Bushiroad\'s various franchises and many more to count. At least Idoly Pride was able to make itself stand out with its premise that was supported by the incredible songs.When it all comes down to it, Selection Project at its peak, was just trying to be yet another case of Idoly Pride, all while still figuring out what it wants to be, and that in itself might have already spelled out the doom of the entire series as a whole. All I can say is that if it weren\'t for Idoly Pride, Selection Project could\'ve amassed the same lengths of success as the predecessor that came before it. But as it stands, it\'s a blatant copy-paste project of a total rip-off that does the same thing but worse in every regard.Why go through a Selection Project when you can invest in idols where they have Idoly Pride? Heh, nailed it!', 'Selection project. Out of all the seasonals I never expected this one to be my favorite. Comparing this to more known shows including the love live franchise, what really caught my eye is how good the production quality for this anime is. After the series ended I can firmly say that I am keeping my 10 and here’s why,Firstly, I would like to put out that I find it great when idol MCs show/vent out their frustrations because in reality life isn\'t always great. Having an MC that isn\'t always happy can present more humanity towards the anime. I absolutely loved the first few episodes,...it\'s clear how they identified what the ""challenges"" the MC would have to face as the plot progresses, and opening the anime showing the vulnerable side of the MCs life, well you\'d just want to cheer for her more. Character dynamic isn\'t that uncommon when it comes to these types of anime, there is always a ""rival"" or a ""best friend"". Well in this one, although Suzu and Rena may have the ""rival"" aspects, it can just be seen as 2 people who aren\'t particularly friends but both look up to someone dear to them, namely amasawa akari, and it\'s great how they addressed that connection later on.Story- 10It has the classic rags to riches kind of story where the mc starts out as a singer/dancer aspiring to be an idol. What stood out to me is the fact that our mc was hospitalized in her childhood due to a chronic illness, overcoming such illness would be considered the plot of the anime however as we move on later into the episode at the qualifiers where we can say that ""tragedy strikes"" I can really see a connection with Shibuya kanon (Love live superstar MC) as they have similar events that occur. The first few episodes were amazing to open the anime as we got to know our MC, her story, and what inspires her to become an idol. I really liked the competition foundation that they laid out in the beginning and I believe this helped further deepen the connections between the “9”.(Spoilers)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is also worth mentioning that the issue faced in the later episodes where you have to vote 2 people out poses a psychological dilemma to the young group. How they handled their issue was shocking but it was reasonable considering the previous events that originated from Suzu’s reveal before “Naked Blue”. Now just because it’s the most reasonable choice for the group, it doesn’t change the fact that it is a wasted opportunity. We can see this from characters from the previous audition appearing before the first street live. Even if karin ono (one of the eliminated contestants) had some negative thoughts against 9-tie for their decision, the previous contestants still gave their support regardless. I also liked how the CEO and sumipan still acted as the guardian angels of 9-tie even after they left the competition. These interactions and connections just show how impactful 9-tie was on their short time onstage.Near the end of the anime my theories were confirmed, however I was still shocked by the brilliant execution on Suzu’s inner struggles. The surprise appearance of akari amasawa was honestly shocking, I saw this type of interaction in other anime (siesta is dead the anime as an example) as well, but what was so great about this was that it was short and meaningful. We didn’t see akari carrying Suzu throughout the whole anime, we didn’t see Suzu always asking for help either. This just helped us remember that Suzu was able to do this with her own strength and even in the end when she was unconscious in the hospital, we could see that Akari merely gave her a push to wake up.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Art- 10Personally, one of the best CGI I have ever seen for the Idol genre, the quality is superb and I really think this should set the standard for the future idol anime.Sound- 10B.B cover by Suzu.Rena was honestly what got me hooked into this the most, symbolisms aren’t that uncommon in songs especially with choreography. But in this particular song we could see moments where Rena looked up to Suzu, we can see that the lyrics accomplish the struggle of being catchy and inspiring at the same time and I loved it, it was  a great touch for the overall song and I got goosebumps all the way. I believe the songs really captured aspects of the characters who sung them as the episodes they were molded around made you get to know the idols a bit more and I found this really great especially since the songs are very memorable.I would also like to highlight the effort they put in to include more variations of “only on yell” throughout the anime. Overall the ost is amazing, the music is able to set the mood as well and I could sit here and listen to them the whole day.Character- 9It would seem at the begginning that we would have the generic go-getter idol mc type of character, but as we journeyed through the anime, we were able to uncover what was within this mask that she kept hidden to herself. But even before this we were able to see her character development in the earlier episodes and I loved how they depicted her story to the audience. It was great how they made it so you could sympathize and relate to her story in the beginning about having someone we look up to and one day hoping to be in the same ""stage"" as them. We could also notice generic types among the other idols but their chemistry and how there is a whole episode devoted to the development of each ""sub-group"" is really what made me like them more.I also find it amazing on how the dynamics for each subgroup was determined because we could say that even when there were clashes in personality, almost all of the characters had their redeeming moment and I loved it.Enjoyment- 10Could probably rewatch it again and again and again without getting bored. Really love the characters, story and the songs as well.Overall- 10I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the idol genre, truly a hidden gem. it\'s clear how they identified what the ""challenges"" the MC would have to face as the plot progresses, and opening the anime showing the vulnerable side of the MCs life, well you\'d just want to cheer for her more.

It has a lot of plot holes that can be extremely confusing in the series. This plot of the series does not really tell its own story but rather a mix of Idoly Pride(75%), Lovelive!(10%) and Zombieland Saga(15%). In my opinion, Selection Project is the worst TV Show that I have ever seen.However, not all parts are considered bad at all. In Zombieland Saga Rip Off Part, they did really well, such as an interesting idea like ""Idol that start from zero and be growing""For MusicI don\'t like almost song in this series, especially the OP theme...song. It doesn\'t create an Idol op vibe. They also reuse multiple songs at the end. In my opinion, Idol series shouldn\'t reuse their song strongly because the main selling point of the series are their songs and it doesn\'t look like they have put in the enough effort to create new songs. On the bright side, it has a few song that I like, B.B. and Only One yell.

In the real world, they have to face realities of haters and criticism.Another reason is that the TV competition show had all the competitors pass, so to be fair, they gave a choice that competitors have to vote and kick out 2 competitors.

Taking the idea of holding contests through different regions of Japan. Holding a nation wide singing contest, in order to get the most voted one, and move on to the next round and so on. Making it look like a mix of their own X Factor, or American idol. Quite the spin.We start through Suzune Miyama, a poor sick girl, who's want to sing, mainly came from watching, and listening to said legendary idol Akari Amasawa. Taking it as her inspiration, and...part of her drive to sing. A dream and motivation can really push people beyond themselves. In this case, with how it's presented, it's put it to a point, where you want to root for her, and ope that she achieves such a dream.The characters of course, are a huge part of this show. The large cast can seem a bit overwhelming at first, but that slowly goes down to look a bit more normal, and allows the watcher to follow a certain number, rather than trying to get to like a dozen faces. Along with that these faces each have their own backgrounds, and personality. You pretty much will have a girl that might end up being your favorite, and as the episodes go on, we'll get to know them more and more. Making for a much more interesting set of cast.

It's in the realm of something akin to American idol or Xfactor or well it would be if it decided to continue in an interesting direction. Unfortunately the show does not do this as because these girls develop a sisterly bond with each other whilst knowing each other for almost no amount of time. Not to mention the ENTIRE point is they compete against each other in this cutthroat industry. In episode 10 they give us hope with a plot twist where the girls refuse to...vote anyone off and they leave to go alone. This idea goes nowhere because by episode 12 they're back in selection project gaming the system. The characters are nothing special each girl has their one unique trait and they only talk about those things and they have no depth. e.g. the food girl is always eating/talking about food. None of the emotional moments are really that impactful because some of the problems are just outrageous overreactions or so obvious that you just want them to get to the point so you can move on. The main issue is that it gave the viewer expectations that it would/could be something different to general idol shows but then completely ignored its most interesting prospect. Finally the last episode in particular felt insulting as the main girl has to be rushed to hospital before the group perform live. As the viewer we know she will return because that's how these things work in stories. But when a girl who had a heart transplant has to be rushed to hospital and has some kind issue relating to her heart that lead to her being in hospital in the first place suddenly wakes up, eats a strawberry sweet and then rushes back to the stage and is able to perform back to back songs like nothing even happened and no doctors clearance was the final straw for me it's such an unfathomable situation that if I wasn't so insulted that I would respect them playing it off as if nothing happened.

(Also, English isn't my first language so there might be errors, please mind them!)The plot is a lot like Idoly Pride, if not exactly the same, but I won't go into the details of it, you'll just have to watch both of them and find the similarities!The art is actually pretty good, the 3D feels fluid and it fits the animation, not too stiff and not out of place.The characters are all likable and have interesting backstories. They all have unique character designs, like Shiori with...her cat-like features.The sound and music is really good, the songs are nice and I have them saved on Spotify already (plus the MV's are nice too).Overall, this show is decent and enjoyable, the only nitpick I have here is that they almost entirely ripped off Idoly Pride. But, if you haven't watched Idoly Pride yet, you'll probably enjoy this more than me. her cat-like features.The sound and music is really good, the songs are nice and I have them saved on Spotify already (plus the MV's are nice too).Overall, this show is decent and enjoyable, the only nitpick I have here is that they almost entirely ripped off Idoly Pride.

If you\'re here for the anime and story? Go watch Idoly Pride. Selection Project stole the plot and made it worse lol. If you\'re here for the music, just listen to the OP and ED on youtube.I\'m going to be pretty critical of the show, but everything is my honest opinion.Disappointment is all I can say. The show had so much potential, and not only did it not make use of it, it trampled all over it and threw it in the trash. Before I blast you with all the negatives, I\'ll...start with a few positives.+ Great character design.+ Great outfit design+ Great synergy between the characters+ Above average CGI+ Decent animation for the most partOkay now that I\'ve told you the good parts about the show, let\'s dig in.When you look for an idol show, what do most people expect? Usually it\'s 2 main things. Cute girls - which they got that down atleast - and good music + dance.Now let me tell you how absolutely disappointed I am at the quality of the music in this show. Absolute hot garbage. To understand this let me explain without spoiling the show. There are 9 girls in this group, and within this group they are split into 3 subgroups. The problem isn\'t with the main group. The 9 girls together are actually really cute, have good chemistry, and the songs+dance are awesome. The problem is when you split these 9 girls into subgroups. These subgroups try too hard to be \'unique\' and \'quirky\' with their songs and choreography, the themes each of these groups have are either cringey, cheesy, or just doesn\'t work with the characters/talents within it. I know it\'s a marketing strategy to create subgroups within groups to make it easier for new fans to consume, but just dividing these girls up and giving them lackluster production isn\'t the play. Not to mention the mixing/production quality for the songs each subgroup respectively has are absolutely terrible.TLDR; Here is my theory: To put it nicely. Selection Project has like 2 production teams. 1 team is a professional team dedicated to the whole group, they produce good quality songs and choreographs. The other team that produces the subgroup\'s products is a robot smashing a keyboard over and over again until something \'ok\' comes out of the speakers. (The OP and the ED slaps though, but that\'s because it\'s not from the subgroups)Edit: Did some more digging, the subgroups actually have a few decent songs, it\'s just not the ones in the anime.-Okay but that wasn\'t even the worst part of the anime. The story was what made this show unwatchable. The best way I can describe the story in this anime is \'haha b*tch you got scammed\'. The show presents itself with a pretty unique take on the competitive aspect of the idol industry. Obviously it\'s not the first show to do this sort of \'tournament arc but for idols\' styled story, but the way it sets up the show allows for a lot of *potential* character development and interactions. But even after around episode 6, the show had done almost absolutely nothing to make use of this potential. Which, to be honest, is okay, it just became a typical idol show. But what happens after is not only blatant theft, but they stole another show\'s plot, and made it worse. Not only did they make a \'plot twist\' that was completely unoriginal, it was so cheesy and cringey, as well as predictable that I think I stood up from my chair multiple times to go wash my eyes and ears out.TLDR: Started off good for about 6 episodes, then: plagiarism, unoriginal, cheesy, cringey, predictable plot ensues.(If you\'re curious about the show they ripped off of, its called ""Idoly Pride"". It\'s not god tier, but it\'s much better than this show, so go watch that instead of this)-I\'ll end it on a positive note atleast. The characters. The characters are the saving grace of this show. Th girls\' aesthetics and story are both well designed and cute. Voice acting and singing are decent, and they each have their own appeals.But let me shout out one particular character from this show. And that is SumiPanda. The legend made the most cringey parts of this show bearable, and although this isn\'t a comedy show, the guy\'s humor is awesome. Great voice acting, great character, and awesome personality. Whoever put this character in the show was obviously making him a joke character, but who knew he would become the main protagonist?!?!? (He\'s not but I like to think he is)-After watching this show I think I\'ll just follow the girls\' voice actors on twitter and youtube, and try to erase my memory of this show\'s plot. It wasn\'t the girls\' fault, it was the production of the anime and music that sucked. Mako best girl!!!! start with a few positives.+ Great character design.+ Great outfit design+ Great synergy between the characters+ Above average CGI+ Decent animation for the most partOkay now that I\'ve told you the good parts about the show, let\'s dig in.When you look for an idol show, what do most people expect? Usually it\'s 2 main things. Cute girls - which they got that down atleast - and good music + dance.Now let me tell you how absolutely disappointed I am at the quality of the music in this show. Absolute hot garbage. To understand this let me explain without spoiling the show. There are 9 girls in this group, and within this group they are split into 3 subgroups. The problem isn\'t with the main group. The 9 girls together are actually really cute, have good chemistry, and the songs+dance are awesome. The problem is when you split these 9 girls into subgroups. These subgroups try too hard to be \'unique\' and \'quirky\' with their songs and choreography, the themes each of these groups have are either cringey, cheesy, or just doesn\'t work with the characters/talents within it. I know it\'s a marketing strategy to create subgroups within groups to make it easier for new fans to consume, but just dividing these girls up and giving them lackluster production isn\'t the play. Not to mention the mixing/production quality for the songs each subgroup respectively has are absolutely terrible.TLDR; Here is my theory: To put it nicely. Selection Project has like 2 production teams. 1 team is a professional team dedicated to the whole group, they produce good quality songs and choreographs. The other team that produces the subgroup\'s products is a robot smashing a keyboard over and over again until something \'ok\' comes out of the speakers. (The OP and the ED slaps though, but that\'s because it\'s not from the subgroups)Edit: Did some more digging, the subgroups actually have a few decent songs, it\'s just not the ones in the anime.-Okay but that wasn\'t even the worst part of the anime. The story was what made this show unwatchable. The best way I can describe the story in this anime is \'haha b*tch you got scammed\'.

Mako best girl!!!!', ""The content is too same with Idoly Pride (from Winter 2021 line-up) with a really bit of unnecessarily modifications and even Selection Project haven't made a proper SWOT analysis on Idoly Pride so they are still lacking much things from Idoly Pride and even can't properly make more differences from Idoly Pride, so whatever that high quality of the animations from Doga Kobo, whatever the great job from voice actresses here, it's still disappointed because it's disrespecting Idoly Pride's creators and production companies, and also disrespecting the real purposes of Idoly Pride's production although if then Selection Project's production's real purposes has same thing with...Idoly Pride's.Although, I can respect only the episode 4 and partly episode 5, the only original thing from Selection Project.6/10 Idoly Pride's.Although, I can respect only the episode 4 and partly episode 5, the only original thing from Selection Project.6/10"", ""I never been big on idol anime but decided to give this one a try... needless to say it is a experience that I will forget :). The show is pretty much about rip off ____ Got Talent and all that.   (SPOILER WARNING AHEAD)For me it started out fine, I was enjoying myself some what... but then they just never had anyone voted off and pulled a FRIENDSHIP IS POWER cliché. I never hated this cliché so much until this show, even after watching my little pony AND not to mention ALL of Fairy Tail. Then after they had no one voted off...they disqualified everyone and made it a point to say they are trying to grow as a idol group (without any help from big company's like the one that runs the competition). Then about a episode or two of working on their own they just get to GO BACK AND FINISH?!?!Now for the other point, I have no problem with characters idolizing dead idols... BUT it kinda gets weird near the end, but to explain why I first need to explain the 2 main characters back story. Our 1st main character is Suzuna who had a bad heart condition when she was young, she would watch this one idol Akari Amazawa (she was quite a fan). One day she got a heart from a organ donor, and got to leave the hospital.The 2nd main character is Rena, who is Akari Amazawa's younger sister trying to follow in the foot steps of her dead sister. Her sister became a organ donor. Now that you know that it will be easy to put the 2 together... Suzuna's heart belongs to her childhood idol. She figured this out along with RenaAt some point near the end of the series Suzuna passes out do to overworking herself, so she gets taken to the hospital and ain't waking up. Rena is also there cause she is concerned for her friend. After a bit the show shows the dream Suzuna is having, where she is being asked stuff by Akari. Also during this conversation our main character looks like their younger self after the heart transplant. Near the end of the conversation Akari says she will always be with our main character well having her hands over the scar from the transplant. If that ain't weird enough she wakes up and says she talked to Akari and that she said she would always be with her right in front of the relative of Akari who is already established to be quite sensitive about her sister due to her sister not spending much time with her after her success.On another note I think Rena might see too much of her sister in Suzuna after figuring out her deceased older sister's heart is in her. Even to the point that right before their last performance she looks at her and see's (and also hears) her sisters voice saying what Suzuna is saying... they disqualified everyone and made it a point to say they are trying to grow as a idol group (without any help from big company's like the one that runs the competition).

Ok, I like the moe/yuri moment there, what’s new? Just the same usuals as seen in different anime’s that You or I watch. I won’t go hate on this anime because they are really on the same level as BanG Dream or Zombieland Saga, but not K-ON.You can watch those animes I mentioned, because they might interest you the most than this. It’s fine if you want to give this a try because this doesn’t bother me anyways but to yourself nonetheless.Not a bad anime, its just that same concept with different storyline and...characters with different personalties. characters with different personalties.', 'I have been following Selection Project since it aired but prior to that, have watched some various idol anime including some iM@S anime including the 2011 OG anime and Cinderella Girls, Love Live(Finished Nijigasaki S1 and Superstar) and Idoly Pride.Now for the review itself after wrapping up yesterday on Christmas Eve, I have been holding up on this for weeks where there were discussions and memes about this being compared to Idoly Pride because of how many similar plot points and the whole plot itself to each other.So I started on episode 1 where I got introduced to a legendary idol named Amasawa...Akari and as a Hayamin fan(seen some of her works and heard some of her songs), I want to pay attention to her character but the problem is she only got like around 2 minutes of screentime on that episode then her character is already dead on a car crash similar to Nagase Mana from Idoly Pride. I never have such a feeling like this on an idol anime before why I felt vibes from another idol anime and this is just the beginning.Later on, 9-Tie(atleast not officially at the early episodes) was introduced where we get introduced to this reality show similar to Big Brother and some other reality shows in idol format where okay this is a bit different. One of the main girls is Miyama Suzune, who is a frail and sickly girl who almost got kicked out of the show but the winner talked to her and decided to withdraw from the competition. The third episode is where things started to get vicious with the Idoly Pride comparisons as we get introduced more to a girl named Rena who guess what, happened to be the sister of the dead idol much like Kotono being the sister of Mana in IP.So the girls were split into units which okay lets see what they have to offer where SplashSoda and GapsCaps are fine but we will get to other problems later on the review.Halfway through the anime, the drama started to get really serious with the swimsuit performance where Suzune doesn\'t want to see her chest scar which Rena saw and covered up for her. This is where people including myself have a feeling that she got a heart transplant from someone and nailed it on episode 8 with a big plot reveal. ""Ah shit, here we go again."" is my reaction to that scene and even made a meme about it. This is one of the points that escalated the comparisons to Idoly Pride like seriously, why you have to pull out an Idoly Pride plot on who Suzune got an heart transplant from Akari of all people like why go that route instead of another donor that has nothing to do with Akari or a different organ. This gets really worse to the point that I feel like I\'m watching a pirated copy of Idoly Pride much like the bootlegs you see around the street markets. I find this really difficult to take the anime seriously because of too much similarities with Idoly Pride and this is absolutely terrible.Episode 10 and 11 was their chance to redeem itself and breakaway from the Idoly Pride copy label with the girls trying to make name for themselves after an incident in the reality show that disqualified all of them thus the official formation of the group 9-Tie. Unfortunately, this was reversed on episode 12 where we went back to the heart issue drama BS again on Suzune but this time Rena took care of her and the reveal of the staff\'s true nature including Jun and the Dorm Mother.Now regarding Akari, she get some appearance like on Rena\'s dream and later Suzune\'s when she was fighting for her life but I have to question how she become a legendary idol and to be frank, this a huge plot hole where it\'s not good enough to say ""Amasawa Akari is a legendary idol"" after the car crash when we barely know anything about her like what did she achieve as an idol instead of just some story telling from Rena or Dorm Mother especially to Suzune. Its basically impossible at this point to avoid thinking about Mana when it comes to Akari much like Sakura and Kotono to Suzune and Rena which is atrocious writing.Regarding the other 7 girls, sure they have their own quirks and stuff but they are stuck to their shticks and gimmicks especially Nodoka who mostly put into scenes that have anything to do with food while getting overshadowed by SuzuRena. Speaking of those two, obviously they are so similar to Sakura and Kotono.On the final episode on the anime, I got lots of ""uhh"" moments and I was like ""what the hell happened to this anime!?"" with lots of nonsense going on with Akari talking to Suzune and gives her a hug in the dream then she wakes up and be like ""Hurrah! lets go to the stage where everyone\'s waiting"" which doesn\'t make any sense like what kind of incompetent doctor would clear Suzune that fast unless you sneak her out of the hospital or something? Just after the last performance of other 9-Tie members, Suzune and Rena appeared out of nowhere just like something out of WWE with the hurt wrestler getting back to the fight. 9-Tie so far got half of the votes but how the hell they get the rest of the required votes is way beyond me.Guess what\'s the final song for the series? A new song? I wish but nope! Its the OP of the entire anime like seriously why they couldn\'t make a new song to make the ending special and of course we still get the same ending credits with the same song Only One Yell that\'s been played since Day 1.You have the characters that have potential to be unique even Akari only to be overshadowed by Sakura and Kotono 2.0 a.k.a Suzune and Rena and this is really terrible because the other girls didn\'t have enough room to develop their own characters instead of this whole SuzuRena drama the entire time. I\'m going to bring down the hammer on this and I have to give this score. I wish the lessons for other idol anime would be learned from this mistake considering how hard it is to stand out for the genre especially if you are not iM@S or Love Live, even those two giants have to learn the lessons too and I\'m looking at you Million Live anime and I have hopes to not commit the same mistakes from Selection Project.

Superstar! this summer has really backfired on my enjoyment of Selection Project. That’s not to say that Selection Project is a bad idol anime, far from it in fact. It’s nicely animated, the CG and music are good and the characters range from very likeable to… kinda there, but overall it’s just very… okay.If you’ve seen any sort of singing competition like Pop Idol or X-factor then you already know what sort of general premise you’re getting into. Wannabe idols all over Japan compete to take part in the idol TV competition Selection Project to become the next...top idol. We follow Suzune a former bedridden child who wants nothing more than to sing enter the competition and, thats basically the summary.Unfortunately if you’re someone with at least ten working brain cells then you’ll be able to guess the big plot reveal the show teases in episode one because it’s really obvious. Not that I really minded all that much. It’s not a tense, drama packed soap opera or anything, but it was still very on the nose. That said, Selection Project not being that tense soap opera might be to the shows biggest disadvantage. It is a competition and though the characters to bicker at times it never really feels like the conflicts matter and they’re resolved too quickly or the story actively bends to make sure on one of the girls is left behind which doesn’t help for long term investment. I get that it’s going for light-hearted, feel good girl power, but the show feels stuck between these two ideas thanks to the nature of singing competitions.I liked most of the characters. They all stick to their cliches very closely to try and differ from each other (there are 9 of them and one of them literally looks like a cat) but I never really felt attached to any of them as characters… expect Mako Tomo… she can step on me… anyway.One thing I did notice in one episode was that the show (I think) unintentionally shines a light on the idol industries sexualization of young women and the weird, somewhat creepy persona’s they’re taught to forge in order to appeal to certain audiences. I just thought that was interesting.Selection Project is not the best moe/idol anime out there, but I watched the whole thing and enjoyed it. It’s very chill if thats what you’re looking for, the characters though they don’t really stand out are entertaining and there are some good tunes in there to boot. It has it’s problems and it’s story probably won’t “wow” you, but you might have a good time with this one.6/10 It’s Okay *thumbs up* top idol.

For starters, throw away the notion that this is an idol show upfront – this is really a reality slice-of-life show wearing the clothing of an idol show. When it comes to its plot, SelePro focuses more on the interactions between the characters and how the show binds them together as performers within and without the stage –\xa0a rare look into the hostile world of idols and performers (in real life, that is). The characters themselves are...too cookie-cutter (even the trend of a genki lead and a tsundere co-lead wearing red and blue respectively is used here), but I don\'t mind it.Definitely my strongest appeal to this show is how it integrates a shallow-yet-understandable story with amazing visuals (props to Doga Kobo for teaching everyone how 3D animations in anime should be used), nice music (the ED song ""Only One Yell"" is a wonderful earworm, and so are the insert songs especially ""Butterfly Bright""), an assortment of plain yet interesting characters (the ""interesting"" part here is them working as a group), and a decision to be more realistic than ideal in presenting the ""idol"" genre here. Originally I thought taht like many seasonal favorites of mine, I\'ll forget this show anyway, but this show already got into my system now that I have fully embraced the SelePro life. Hiromi-senpai, Nagi-chan, and Uta-sensei Best Girls!In summary, ""Selection Project"" uses the least ingredients for maximum enjoyment: when the ""Idoly Pride"" story is combined with the ""drama"" of ""Big Brother"" and the game mechanics of ""Wonder Egg Priority"" with a cadre of characters that remind me more of my other girl-led SoL favorite ""Is The Order A Rabbit?"".Still for now though, I\'d let SelePro to be the only idol show that I\'ve watched and I am watching.But yes, I might end up watching Idoly Pride as well because of the pesky comparisons made.Welp I mentioned it again, the AiPura similarity… yabai! too cookie-cutter (even the trend of a genki lead and a tsundere co-lead wearing red and blue respectively is used here), but I don\'t mind it.Definitely my strongest appeal to this show is how it integrates a shallow-yet-understandable story with amazing visuals (props to Doga Kobo for teaching everyone how 3D animations in anime should be used), nice music (the ED song ""Only One Yell"" is a wonderful earworm, and so are the insert songs especially ""Butterfly Bright""), an assortment of plain yet interesting characters (the ""interesting"" part here is them working as a group), and a decision to be more realistic than ideal in presenting the ""idol"" genre here.

The art, like everything else, isn\'t as good as the show it\'s copying and that\'s really the only bit I can potentially compliment. I skip through the rest and spoil the ending and some songs so I wouldn\'t have to suffer through a repeat of Idoly Pride, which I didn\'t adore to begin with, and it doesn\'t do anything unique enough there either to redeem itself despite the very slight variation.This show is stupid for the sake of drama quite often. My favorite example is how there\'s an...entire episode about the protagonist being self conscious involving her chest on the beach, a problem only resolved by a custom made swimsuit, only to later reveal that SIX of the girls actually wear swimsuits that visibly hide their chests and would have resolved the problem entirely. But no, we need to make fake drama and emotional stakes, so custom swimsuit at the last second because they claim nothing else was available. The writers either didn\'t bother pointing out the obvious problem to the artists, or thought the audience would be too stupid to notice.This show lacks every hint of the heart and mystery Idoly Pride had. The originality of the ghost and the cute relationship with the manager are gone entirely, replaced by an obnoxious alcoholic narrator/host in a creepy mascot suit. The characters are worse, shallow regurgitations of the same tropes and what few new elements they add are forgettable or detrimental to the show, making it feel even more shallow and copy-paste than it already is. The shallow ""twist"" at the end is a 15 year old fakeout no one with a single brain cell would fall for, with an otherwise generic conclusion. Idoly Pride wasn\'t my favorite idol show of the year, but it was decent, whereas this one felt like an aggravating waste of time.

The story is just your traditional idol story, with some bad drama added in. The last episode was a copy and paste from the third. Very lazy overall and I expected much better than that. Additionally, the songs are worst as well. Personally, for me the songs are worst than every other Idol show I watched...so far. Overall, save your time and just watch Idoly Pride, it is much better. so far. Overall, save your time and just watch Idoly Pride, it is much better.', ""7/10 - StoryThe plot seemed very bland and fast at the same time in the first few episodes. But around episode 10 I started to give it a little more interest. Part of the reason it's not a perfect score is because at some points you can just tell what's going to happen next no matter how hard the anime is trying to reel you in and put you at the edge of your seat. In other words, it's predictable. Yet I find that that's what I found charming about this anime, it doesn't give me anxiety of sorts and just wants me to enjoy...good ole anime lessons without much heartache.10/10 - ArtThe art is good and consistent, animation was pretty smooth. It's your average idol anime animation so I don't really have complaints. Although, if 3d isn't your cup of tea (then why are you watching idol animes /jk) then you would have to endure through the performances (imo it's not bad, great even).6/10 - CharactersCharacters, characters. Each have their own traits but sometimes it all feels plain and not that thought over. Like that one girl (i forgot her name) who's very athletic, I get that she comes from an athletic family but they didn't need to rub it in our faces every time her parents came into the shot. Small things like that are what threw me off a little, and maybe it's just me who feels that way. I would just like to note that the character development of the girls did not come off as smooth though it can be set aside because it doesn't cause any problems in the plot.10/10 - SoundThe sounds were perfect! The songs got me, my favorite being 'Only One Yell' obviously. The voice actors did a good job with this one. Nothing else to say.8/10 - Overall EnjoymentI liked the anime despite it not landing any critical hits in my top lists. It's very enjoyable and light-hearted. If you want an anime that is sprinkled with lots of positivity, this one could be a good pick.

It teaches you to not give up on your dreams. All the characters looks special and their own even though they arent even the main characters yet their still made really nicely! Im talking about the first two episodes of the girls trying to be make in the idol audiotions finals :) They dont even look like side characters!and for the rest episodes i\'d say its okay.Characters:A lot of stereotype characters but they\'re designs are...nice.a 6/10Music:Songs are pretty nice and the dances that they perform are game cgi so its good!

The sound quality was great, and the production so far is extremely high quality and consistent. Solid 8/10.

Shinpi no Sekai El-Hazard,https://myanimelist.net/anime/117/Shinpi_no_Sekai_El-Hazard,"[""The Magnificent World of El-Hazard, truly a classic for the ages!  And I mean that, too.  In comparison to more 'modern' shows, it's my opinion that El-Hazard still measures up to this day, and whether you've loved anime since the days of Astroboy (though I'm not sure how much other anime there was in the 60's, heh), or you've just recently started into the hobby, I'd still strongly recommend the first series of El-Hazard.  Be ready for some high-fantasy with a few Final-Fantasy-esque technological advancements.  If you're the mecha only type or just aren't a big fan of such things, I'd...still recommend you give this one a shot, as it tends to suprise with a little something for everybody--great laughs, sweet romance, courtly intrigue, lots of action, and a tearful ending.El-Hazard has all the hallmarks of an excellent series.  The story is deep and engrossing, and told well despite the short length.  You won't feel as though you've been gypped out of closure due to the lack of episodes.  At the same time, nothing is really 'glossed-over'--though the plot is involved, most everything is well explained.The characters are memorable and dynamic.  While it's true that most of them have their stereotypes, the series manages to take a little time, sometimes if only a scene or two, to paint most of them in another light--just to let you know there's more to them.  There are two disctinct camps of villains as well, each with their own agenda.  If you like dashing, cunning baddies with a web of secrecy, El-Hazard has that.  if you prefer your enemies maniacal, biosterous, sometimes silly, and slightly insane, El-Hazard has you covered.  The same goes for the protagonists.  El-Hazard has your 'knight in shining armor' types; your well-meaning perverts; your innocent, 'didn't ask to be here' types; and even your 'You're such a $&amp;(*$@, why do you have to be a good guy?' types.The artwork won't disappoint.  It's probably not the best you've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst.  What's most important is that it's an enduring enough style that it's hard to see it as 'dated'.  The sound is exceptional too.  The background music really helps to get you into the 'feel' of the world you're experiencing, and the opening score is powerful and memorable.  The ending themes are enjoyable, too.  'Boys Be Free' ('Back in Love' in English) is performed by Alielle, is catchy, fun, and bemusedly suggestive, while 'Little Flower' (which takes over as the ending theme after a few episodes) is mellow and somber, in keeping with how it wants to make you feel by that point in the storyline.One of the most impressive qualities of El-Hazard in my opinion is the exceptional ability of the English dub actors.  Yes, we all have our own opinions, but I personally don't care for dubs, and I can count on one hand the anime I've ever seen that I could stand in anything other than the original Japanese.  This is one of them.  The dub actors get the inflection right and deliver some great one-liners that probably aren't what the original characters were saying, but are close enough to make the experience that much better for the non-Japanese speaker.I'll also give El-Hazard an impressive rewatch value.  This is the show I tend to use to get curious newcomers to anime started, and it never gets old after many re-watches.To be fair since this is a review, if I were to knock anything about El-Hazard, I would have to go with some of the faster animation sequences.  The art is great, sure, but whenever there's a scene where lots of people are moving really quickly all at once (IE, a fight, a bunch of people running, or some acrobatics), they tend to shift about rather strangely, making it look as though some corners were cut on the drawing board.  Que sera.All in all, El-Hazard isn't long and it's worth your time to add it in to your anime watching experience.  Maybe you'll even enjoy it enough to catch some of the other series, though keep in mind that 'The Wanderers of El-Hazard' is a TV version (so it's the original story told differently).  'El-Hazard 2: The Magnificent World' is the sequel, if that's what you're looking for.So what are you waiting for!?

Starting from background art to characters, everything is well-defined and has its place in the story.The story itself may look meh, but, it really isn't. It is a well thought story. The characters may get sloppy from time to time, but they are well defined and fluid. The plot itself is great and it has its share of everything. Its catchy and it stays catchy. Its funny. Its dumb. Its wonderful. Its original.The music and the sound is impressive. "", ""Watched it on anime marathon at AXN back in 2002. Started watching, and could not move from in front of my TV until it reached the end. Art, sound quality is not as good as today's anime, but storyline is amazing and its enjoyable. The entire story is linked and it is revealed at the last episode. If someone thinks it is made of misplaced events, then I should say he did not understand it properly. Its very precise, never gets boring, and best part is it has a nice flow that will keep you attached. I've rewatched it so many times, never felt boring. "", ""El Hazard is an anime franchise from the mid 90s. It was written by Tsukimura Ryoe with production by AIC. You may remember them from their work on OreImo, Solty Rei, Blue Gender, Sasameki Koto and several others I've reviewed. The first entry in the El Hazard franchise was Magnificent World, a seven episode OVA which gained enough popularity to spawn two tv anime series, and more OVAs. So, was this OVA actually good enough to warrant that? Let's take a look at El Hazard The Magnificent World and find out.Story:We begin our story with high school politics. Because don't all great fantasy tales begin...with high school politics? Any way, student council President, Jinnai Katsuhiko is accused of using underhanded tactics, like promising clubs more funding, to attain his position. Around here, we'd just call that a campaign promise. The chief witness against him is Mizuhara Makoto. Rather than, say, call Makoto a liar, Jinnai develops the brilliant strategy of taking him hostage so that he can't testify. Surely, nothing could go wrong with that plan. Just when Makoto finds himself cornered, everything freezes. Makoto tries to rouse Jinnai, with no success and makes his way to the recently discovered ruins in the school's basement. A silver-haired beauty emerges, seemingly recognises Makoto and uses a magic technique to send him, as well as everyone else on the school premises that night, to the world of El Hazard. Once there, Makoto and his friends become entangled in a conflict raging betwixt an alliance of humans and the bugrom. A conflict which some third party seems to be manipulating.Let's look at the flaws of the narrative first. The big one has to do with the powers that our major characters develop as a consequence of crossing dimensions. For most of them, their introduction comes as a matter of plot convenience, showing up exactly when they're needed. In the case of the teacher, the rules establishing the strength of his power are added to near the end of the series, right when the characters are in a corner. Honestly, the series could have benefited from adding some hints to Makoto's power earlier and fleshing out the rules for Fujisawa's before the climax. Although I will credit it for having both Makoto's and Nanami's abilities revealed, though at strangely convenient times, before their major climactic uses.On the positive side, the narrative is really compelling with some strong sources of tension. The idea of modern day people being sent to a fantasy world was nothing new when this came out, but the world is well enough developed and different enough to keep it interesting. Actually, I really like the way that technology and magic get blended in this world. The plot elements are brought together really well for the climax and the story has a solid progression. I also like that the antagonistic groups are given actual motivation behind what they're doing. The comedic elements generally work quite well, albeit being distracting at times, such as when the great Demon Goddess has to be powered by the turning of a crank as though she were a wind up soldier, during a largely dramatic moment.Characters:This is one of those series where there are a lot of strong, compelling side characters but the protagonist, Makoto, is completely bland. This kid is pretty much the quintessential pure, in over his head and well intentioned, type of protagonist. Princess Fatora only gets a few lines of dialogue but she still manages to be more interesting than this bloke. That being said, there are quite a few compelling side characters. The priestesses, Nanami, Alielle, Ifurita, Fujisawa even Jinnai has some compelling characteristics.As I mentioned, I like the antagonists in this. I like that Jinnai actually seems to care about the bugrom, even naming several of them, and that his alliance with them is shown as mutually beneficial instead of one of them using the other. The phantom tribe's motivation, once revealed, is actually really strong. Then we have Ifurita and her really good arc. I also do love Alielle and how completely shameless she is when it comes to pursuing other women. She's a delight. I also do appreciate that the women she pursues react differently to her attention based on their personalities. Shayla Shayla gets annoyed. Nanami finds it odd that she's pursuing both of them but also seems completely not bothered by it.Now, let's talk about the romance element. This one is a bit mixed. The dynamic with Ifurita and Makoto actually works really well, in spite of him being blander than soggy cardboard. It makes a lot of sense for her character and actually has some really strong scenes. In contrast, the dynamic with Miz & Fujisawa seems really forced. They meet and she instantly starts planning their wedding while he just kind of goes along with it because... Bandora sacrifices the souls of children. Seriously, Fellows, if someone starts offhandedly talking about marrying you when you've known them for all of an hour, scarper. The love triangle they establish with Shayla Shayla and Nanami both being interested in Makoto is just pointless and takes time away from better things they could be doing. I have no idea why they even bothered with it.Art:The visuals in this are actually really impressive. Even by modern standards they hold up really well. The background details are strong. The El Hazard technology is really superb looking. The character designs are nicely unique, mostly. Interestingly enough, the bugrom are more varied and intimidating than the roaches from Terraformars.That being said, there are some things that could have been better. There are a few visual effects that get recycled and the series does delve into fan-service for no real reason a couple of times. Although, to its credit, it is largely subdued about that. I've certainly seen much worse. It's also a bit strange that Diva looks so humanoid and none of the other bugrom do. I'm sure it has nothing to do with AIC wanting to make her attractive.Sound:This series did get some strong actors. Amano Yuri does really well. Sakurai Tomo, Soumi Yoko, Natsuki Rio & Kozakura Etsuko all do really well. Ootomo Ryuuzaburou gives a really interesting performance as Galus. The biggest issue is that there are some exaggerated lines, particularly from Okiayu Ryotaro. Iwanaga Tetsuya's performance is a bit bland but so is his character. So, fair enough. The music is quite good. Nagaoka Seikou knows how to score a fantasy piece to have scale.Ho-yay:The big source of les-yay in this is Fatora's lover, and generally flirtatious Alielle. I swear, she flirts or gets really touchy with half the ladies in this cast. Shayla Shayla and Nanami get the bulk of it, but Afura gets a bit of love too.Final Thoughts:So, when all is said and done, how well does Magnificent World hold up? Well, the story is interesting and it has mostly strong characters. The art is really good. The acting and music are both strong. So, I'd say it holds up fairly well. However, it does have its issues. The fan-service scenes, the boringness of the main protagonist, the abilities that first manifest at times of dramatic convenience. It's by no means a great OVA. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. It's a solid series. If you're interested in fantasy works, consider giving it a go.

It is also one of the first anime in the now exceedingly popular isekai genre. For the uninitiated the term isekai refers to a sub-genre of fantasy anime in which the protagonist or protagonists are originally from present day Earth, but get pulled into another world that is generally better than ours. It is one of the premier escapist fantasies that dominate today's anime landscape and as such they tend to put a spotlight on all the ways the new world is better than ours and don't focus too...much on the main character, leaving him a blank canvas onto which the viewer can project.And with that opening paragraph I've explained El Hazard The Magnificent World pretty well. The anime doesn't break any new ground today because of how very basic it is for an isekai. Now it wouldn't be quite fair to be hard on the anime because of this, after all, back when it was new the market wasn't flooded with all sorts of other anime, manga and light novels like it. So keeping in mind the time period in which it was released does the anime hold up today, and is it still worth watching? Well, the archivist in me says yes because this anime has undoubtedly influenced many that came after, but that is not a satisfying answer since many might not care about remembering the past. Here's the long answer:To start off, the plot of El Hazard is, as mentioned before, extremely basic. A group of students and a teacher get sent into another world called El-Hazard by a sexy anime lady that looks a bit like Griffith from Berserk. There our protagonists get mixed up in a fight between the friendly alliance and the menacing human sized bugs called the Bugrom. To help them in their fight every one of the earthlings gets some sort of superpower.Immediately I noticed that the anime was intent on flip-flopping between almost stone-faced seriousness into goofy comedy. This mix can be made to work if done right, but El Hazard sadly does not do it right at all. Each time a comedy segment interrupts a more serious bit and vice-versa you get some whiplash from the sudden and sometimes downright weird change in tone. Luckily the middle part of the anime is mostly comedy-centered so there's not a lot of flip-flopping there. There is, however, a certain charm to this inneptitude to properly keep the tone, it's mostly a harmless blunder that makes it feel distinctly like a 90s OVA that was made on a budget. Speaking of feeling like a 90s anime, the studio behind El Hazard is the same studio behind Tenchi Muyo Ryououki and it definitely feels like it. Besides the fake harem that builds up around the main character, the character designs are extremely reminiscent of Tenchi Muyo.Now, why did I say fake harem? Because, you see, this anime not only predates isekai but it also predates most harem shows and the tropes that formed around them in the early 2000s. The girls around our main character Makoto are not all interested in him they're there because of happenstance and don't all instantly want a piece of him.I suppose this is as good a time as any to talk about the characters in our story for a bit. As mentioned above you have the main character Makoto who is your average slightly wimpy high school kid that we're supposed to project ourselves onto. A problem with the characters in this show, I feel, is that they don't show any form of progression as the show goes on. And it is most evident perhaps with Makoto who despite all he's been through in the end is basically the same.Along with Makoto a few of his classmates and a teacher were transported into El Hazard. His school crush Nanami and his teacher Fujisawa are ever present in his adventures through El Hazard, but despite them being useful in the plot they don't feel like real characters. Their superpowers are always used as a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card. They feel more like caricatures that exist to either serve the plot or more often than not deliver some comedic moment. Even the main villain of the series, Makoto's self-declared rival from high school, Jinnai feels like he's just a few evil laughs away from growing a moustache for the sole purpose of twirling it while pulling off some relatively well thought out plan only to be foiled by the heroes again and again.Though to give credit where credit is due, the anime does manage to humanise the Bugrom through the various interactions Jinnai has with them. Towards the end of the series you may even remember some of their names, even though they looks mostly the same, and you get a small sense that each one of them is an individual. Whether this surprising humanisation of what would be in most other anime just a faceless and nameless monster army was fully intentional or not, I don't know but I do know that I enjoyed it.I've mentioned above that the party winds up in the titular world El Hazard and I think that the world the anime builds is it's strong suit. Through gorgeous background art and beautifully designed environments El Hazard is made out to be a sort-of paradise world that, unlike many more generic looking isekai world, I genuinely would like to visit. Everything in the world has this middle-eastern vibe while also incorporating copious amounts of green into the designs. Most of the buildings in the world seem to be built by man with a lot of aid from nature. From fountains and indoor ponds that add beautiful splashes of blue in buildings made mostly from yellow and cream colours in conjunction with vibrant greens, to the bright blue sky and the enourmous plants and vines that some outdoor areas have the world looks stunning all around. Then there's places like the Bugrom HQ which has a distinctly insect-like precise design that could only be achieved through by a race with perfect cooperation. Here you don't see anything natural inside or outside the buildings, everything being replaced by precise angles, hexagonal designs and dark colours. It's a great contrast to the 'good' side of the world and an equal delight to witness. I think that the main reason anyone would want to watch the show is because of the world that is being built. Oh and if what I've said so far has not impressed you, El Hazard is no slouch when it comes to exciting fauna either because this world has LIVING ARMOUR CATS. Yes you heard me, the world has cats which can become living armour for someone. And they also talk. LIVING ARMOUR CATS. I still can't get over it, if you haven't noticed.I can't quite give the same praise to the story of El Hazard The Magnificent World as I did to the world. As mentioned before, the story is quite tone deaf and doesn't know when to jest and when to be serious. Furthermore, there are some slight pacing issues here and there, which I think would be mostly due to the seven episode format since they needed to cram as much in there as possible, nevermind the fact that both the first and final episodes are double length. The characters occasionally go from location to location based on very loose reasoning just to move the plot forward. There also is never any sense of danger towards any of the main cast, all throught the story you know that none of them are going to come to any serious harm. The plot armour here is quite obvious and the anime makes no effort to hide it. But maybe I can give it some slack considering the genre and the fact that the entire anime is basically a power fantasy and as a power fantasy the anime is decent.There is a small romantic subplot in the latter part of the anime, but it doesn't really mean much in the end. It affects nothing and the 'winner' is spoiled by the very beginning of the anime anyway. The only reason I could think of why it's even there is because having multiple girls fighting over you is one of the things that every high school boy dreams of. Oh and there's also an even less inefectual lesbian romance subplot in the anime that goes nowhere at all and just brings into the anime a character which many might find irritating based on voice alone, to speak nothing of personality.All in all, I somewhat liked El Hazard. I didn't have the greatest expectations going in and came out relatively pleased. The anime didn't ever really bore me, but neither did it do anything too grand.So back to my original question: 'Does the anime still hold up today and is it worth watching?'When compared to some of the isekai anime that are released today it seems very basic, but it has something that those anime don't: a certain charm and a feeling that it was made for more than to just be another isekai anime that will hopefully sell. Maybe I am giving the studio too much credit, but I do feel like they liked working on this project and tried making it the best it could be. Now, that 'best' isn't really all that fascinating but that isn't such a big issue. I would say you should watch this anime if you're in the mood for a different kind of fantasy world, or just want to go back in time to one of the original isekai that started it all or if you like Tenchi Muyo Ryououki then you'll probably like this too. I personally enjoyed my short time with El Hazard and am glad I gave it a chance and I'm looking forward to eventually taking a look at the sequel OVA. much on the main character, leaving him a blank canvas onto which the viewer can project.And with that opening paragraph I've explained El Hazard The Magnificent World pretty well.

With high stakes and effective plotting this OVA grabs you and doesn't let go until the heartwarming epilogue leaves you smiling."", 'El Hazard is an isekai that goes against some of the standard tropes of the genre. Isekai\'s are obviously stories based off of existing within another world, but generally, the genre is all about escapism. Sword Art Online, Inuyasha, 12 Kingdoms are inherently stories of people moving into a new world because their skills aren\'t appreciated or wanted in the current world, or their abilities ""level-up"" to fit the new world. Either way, you generally have a self insert main character who struggles in the real world, ""escapes"" and is wanted by the society they are now living in.El Hazard already goes against the...grain of other Isekai by not being a story about someone escaping. Makoto is happy, successful, and well appreciated by society, and when he introduced to the world, his only use is being a political puppet because he looks like the Princess. He is forced to crossdress to look like the princess, and take part in political ceremonies that require none of the skills he developed in the previous world.On the other hand, our villain Katsuhiko, struggles in the real world. He has an obsessive rivalry with Makoto, who despite working harder than, and putting more effort into Japanese high school activites, can never seem to get past his rival. Whether it be academics, sports, or the various other competitions one faces in school, Katsuhiko can never beat his rival. This character, more aligns with the typical isekai character, he\'s struggling in this world (mostly due to his own douchey attitudes) and is transported to another world where he instantly recognized with power, and instantly given an army. Katushiko being one of the antagonists of this world shows how El Hazard goes against it\'s Isekai brethren and might be valued less by people looking for purely self inserting.The background art in this series is amazing, the character animation is classic 90\'s OVA, incredibly fluid animation with big fight scenes are littered throughout each episode.When I went into the series I was worried that it wouldn\'t have a good ending, or even have an ending at all, it wouldnt be the first time a 90s OVA series ended suddenly. El Hazard manages to have an ending that is paced well, and isn\'t sudden, and manages to do that in 7 episodes.

Its strongest point is its gorgeous girls. Makoto, the male lead, is unusually brave and capable--much more so than the Ordinary High School Boy (TM) we so frequently see in anime. His friend Nanami is also a refreshingly strong character. Some of the battles, especially Shayla-Shayla versus Ifurita in Episode 4, are amazing to watch. This show has one of the most satisfying endings in all of anime. The English dub is quite good and is my preferred way to watch this. The humor is appreciated but provokes only smiles,...not laughing out loud. The animation is beginning to look dated. not laughing out loud.

I wonder if the writer thought it sounded cool in Japanese. Either way, don't take this one too seriously. It doesn't take itself too seriously.StoryOur crew gets transported to the new world. There's a conflict between humans and the bug group. Most of the crew ends up with the humans but the annoying guy get matched up with the bugs and fits right in.The sides are fighting to control the Eye of God, a sort of WMD. Our...good guys gear up, meet the three goddesses, and do their hero's journey. Our baddies are a little menacing but mostly goofy.The story is very average but the series is short enough to not drag.CharactersI had a good time with this bunch.The MC guy/girl-in-disguise is a dud. It's one of the things I dislike in anime in general: that the main guy has absolutely nothing going on. And for some reason (viewer self-insert) all the women can't get enough of him. For the love of anime, just give the guy an attribute or two. And make him not a complete pushover. That said, the crossdressing is a good gimmick and I almost always find it funny. This is one of those cases.Then there is my man Fujisawa-sensei. What a dude! He is a teacher by profession and true to his duty, he is there to protect the children. He drinks, smokes, and, most importantly, he's man enough for the ladies. There is a scene in ep 3 where he impresses the water priestess that is just gold. He springs into action, calls out his kick, lands in the hero's pose, deepens his voice, and asks the damsel if she is alright. She was never in danger but calls him her savior and falls in love. Oh yeah, she's desperate for a husband too. The guy is an easy-going drunk and all-around good dude.Nanami is the plucky girl who got the short end of the stick during the world change, but worked her way out of poverty, and started her own business. She's cute, fiesty, and plays a corner of the love triangle.Arielle is the flaming lesbian loli. What exactly is she licking? She is a loyal friend who is never above taking the opportunity to cop a feel on one of the ladies. She's annoying but this is a goofball isekai romp so it's all good.Jinnai is the power-hungry, goofball, bad guy. I think of him as Dwight from the Office if he got transported to the fantasy world and was actually somewhat competent. He's got the Kefka-esque evil laugh. It's goofy and menacing at the same time.And of course, there are the three priestesses, the WMD-waifu, and the princesses.It's a pretty good cast. The characters have unique personalities that mesh together and create enjoyable and funny situations.There was a scene where Shayla went to drink with Fujisawa-sensei to figure out the relation between Makoto and Nanami. I love it when two unrelated characters befriend each other.SoundsThe music is pretty good. I liked the opening theme. It was grand and had the exotic Arabian Nights feel to it. Very fitting and cool stuff. The ending theme was a catchy, bubblegum pop tune. Warning: there is fan service in the ED.The BGM fit the desert vibe for the most part. I liked it. The battle music was jazzy. Decent but nothing great.The voices fit and were pro level. I don't understand much Japanese but the emotions and delivery were good.ArtI like the character designs. The MC is a basic dud. Fujisawa sensei looks like an old dude who doesn't give a shit. Nanami is cute. I like her hairband, short sleeve button-up, tank top, shorts combo. Jinnai has the asshole combover and his school uniform/suit. Arielle is cute. And the priestesses look their part. Miz's costume is hot.The art looks very decent for the 90s. The colors are supposed to be bright but they don't pop like the modern colors do. It still looks decent. The action is animated well enough. The transformation/attacks are repeated several times. It didn't detract from the experience for me. There were some points where the animation quality fell off. I liked the Arabian themed architecture and art. The backgrounds were nothing special but still nice.Enjoyment & OverallEl Hazard was probably my first isekai and one of the earliest animes I watched. It was fun, dramatic, and a huge departure from the media I was exposed to at that time. This was one of the animes that blew my teenage boy mind.I watched it again recently and I still like it.

Rokka no Yuusha,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28497/Rokka_no_Yuusha,"['The quickest way to pique my curiosity is with the ‘mystery’ tag. It often has me dusting off the magnifying glass and getting set to put my perception to the test. Rokka no Yuusha stepped up to the plate this season and its plot summary had me interested: A show where six heroes try to fight off a great demon but seven show up for the job instead. One character gets picked on early as the infiltrator and it’s up to him to prove his innocence. Rokka no Yuusha didn’t end up testing my intelligence though. Instead, it decided to insult it.If there’s one...big tip you could give to anyone writing a classic ‘whodunnit’ tale then do this: Give everyone a solid reason to be confirmed suspicious. If you start to abandon characters then the strength in your writing falls by the wayside. This lack of equal screen time and development made it incredibly easy to rule certain characters out as the ‘extra’. The show feels like it is written to cater for an action show, not a mystery one. The focus is on set pieces and not a study into its characters. That’s the fatal flaw. In a show that clearly tells us early on that it’s going to be show about catching the villain in disguise, it abandons even trying to be an interesting and challenging mystery. With paper-thin characters, convenient solutions, characters that scream fanservice over depth and a bizarre ending, Rokka no Yuusha will not be a show that hangs around in the memory bank for the right reasons.I can understand those who enjoyed the anime because there’s some action, suspense and some passable characters to get you by. If you’re after an anime with some solid action, but nothing ground breaking, then this may satisfy you. I, however, felt betrayed by the show not living up to its potential and betraying the mystery path it started to construct in its opening half. A harsh sentiment? I maintain the show dug its own hole deeper with every single episode.The story is focused around Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed ‘strongest man in the world’. He is one of the six chosen heroes to defeat the demon god. When seven people arrive at the meeting location Adlet quickly becomes the prime suspect in the hunt for the ‘extra’ person. We watch as he tries to clear his name. Adlet himself isn’t a memorable protagonist but he does have his moments. The way he tries to rally others to his cause is at least believable for the most part. His relationship with one character in particular is easily the most interesting part of the story, a relationship challenged by the other party’s motives and their background. It’s such a pity that this sort of development couldn’t be spared for all six other members of the group and actually go some distance towards making the mystery more engaging. It’s true that a 12 episode limit plays its part in limiting that but that’s no excuse whatsoever for not at least making an effort to improve in that area. There are some hilariously silly conveniences towards the back end of the show as well that don’t do any favours towards correcting the aforementioned writing flaws around the cast. For every logical deduction made towards finding the culprit another ridiculous one strikes back. Often the show misleads you into thinking it’s making progress when it’s really just creating vapid excuses for the characters to come into conflict with one another.Given my sentiments at the start of this review, I’d be going into spoiler territory if I were to discuss the impact of the rest of the cast. What I can say is that it’s an eclectic bunch of characters who each bring a different ability and personality to the table. Some feel like they’re playing an active role in the story while others just feel like they’re there to make up the numbers. Some character dynamics exist but there aren’t enough connections established between the cast early on to keep me interested in the big reveal that lays ahead. As previously mentioned, you can feel that certain characters being named the seventh would be too underwhelming. Too much of the cast fit this bill.Animation is a rollercoaster in the quality department. The show looks average as a whole but the early episodes certainly look the part. In fact, the first episode probably set the bar too high, especially with one scene which looks excellent. The variety in environments from the early episodes get lost as the show goes on and that’s a real shame. The story lends itself to this fact but a lot could still have been done to breathe a bit more life into the areas where the bulk of the series takes place. A lot of the CG also is jarring when placed next to the traditional animation (what a surprise).Rokka no Yuusha treads this bizarre line between being an action and a mystery show and fails at succeeding in either genre. Tension in fights doesn’t exist because the show doesn’t give me a chance to empathise with or understand the majority of the cast. It makes the show very difficult to recommend. If you’re after a satisfying mystery, forget it. If you’re after some action, perhaps. Me? I put the magnifying glass away early on. big tip you could give to anyone writing a classic ‘whodunnit’ tale then do this: Give everyone a solid reason to be confirmed suspicious. If you start to abandon characters then the strength in your writing falls by the wayside. This lack of equal screen time and development made it incredibly easy to rule certain characters out as the ‘extra’. The show feels like it is written to cater for an action show, not a mystery one. The focus is on set pieces and not a study into its characters. That’s the fatal flaw. In a show that clearly tells us early on that it’s going to be show about catching the villain in disguise, it abandons even trying to be an interesting and challenging mystery. With paper-thin characters, convenient solutions, characters that scream fanservice over depth and a bizarre ending, Rokka no Yuusha will not be a show that hangs around in the memory bank for the right reasons.I can understand those who enjoyed the anime because there’s some action, suspense and some passable characters to get you by. If you’re after an anime with some solid action, but nothing ground breaking, then this may satisfy you. I, however, felt betrayed by the show not living up to its potential and betraying the mystery path it started to construct in its opening half. A harsh sentiment? I maintain the show dug its own hole deeper with every single episode.The story is focused around Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed ‘strongest man in the world’. He is one of the six chosen heroes to defeat the demon god. When seven people arrive at the meeting location Adlet quickly becomes the prime suspect in the hunt for the ‘extra’ person. We watch as he tries to clear his name. Adlet himself isn’t a memorable protagonist but he does have his moments. The way he tries to rally others to his cause is at least believable for the most part. His relationship with one character in particular is easily the most interesting part of the story, a relationship challenged by the other party’s motives and their background. It’s such a pity that this sort of development couldn’t be spared for all six other members of the group and actually go some distance towards making the mystery more engaging. It’s true that a 12 episode limit plays its part in limiting that but that’s no excuse whatsoever for not at least making an effort to improve in that area. There are some hilariously silly conveniences towards the back end of the show as well that don’t do any favours towards correcting the aforementioned writing flaws around the cast. For every logical deduction made towards finding the culprit another ridiculous one strikes back. Often the show misleads you into thinking it’s making progress when it’s really just creating vapid excuses for the characters to come into conflict with one another.Given my sentiments at the start of this review, I’d be going into spoiler territory if I were to discuss the impact of the rest of the cast.

I should also note that this review is solely written from my anime-only watcher perspective, as I did not read the original material.Story:Rokka no Yuusha unfortunately does not give the best first impression regarding it\'s actual story line and genre for people that are looking for a series to start. It gives off the impression of it being your average demon-fighting fantasy anime, and it\'s understandable to think of it as such at first glance.But that\'s not...really the case. Or well, it\'s not really the case for the part that was adapted in this anime. The series is actually a niche mystery fantasy focused series that focuses into the vast Mesoamerican fantasy world and to find the potential impostor among them. As the synopsis for this anime points out.At first, the anime may give the impression of being stale, or boring. But the suspense in it between the main characters is something that is not easily found in your average anime. The settings of the series may not be the most original out there, but it is without doubt executed phenomenallyArt:The anime production is done by Studio Passione. As far as I am aware I consider this to be it\'s first major production. The anime has gorgeous colours and background visuals, especially at it\'s first episodes. Some of the background visuals could easily be considered to be put as wallpaper considering its exotic beauty.Unfortunately due to it\'s lack of success and it being the studio\'s first true production, the quality of the animation and art drops midway during the series where it\'s quite evident that the animation feels sketchy or/and has a lot of cutscenes. The facial expressions proportions are sometimes off too. I wouldn\'t call it completely bad, I find it acceptable and in the important scenes it thankfully delivers great quality.The biggest gripe about the visuals regarding the series is definitely the CGI.   It is not very pleasing and they look awkward, thankfully the CGI usage is minimal halfway through the series except for select few moments.All in all the art shines at the beginning, then decreases to being acceptable. I don\'t think a series should be completely judged upon it\'s production issues in certain episodes.Please note that art in itself is a subjective matter, whether someone thinks X looks good, Y could see it as negative, so all of this is simply my opinion regarding the matter, it is not an objective fact. the only thing that can be considered as ""fact"" is that it have gotten inconsistent.Sound:I find the sound in the anime to be fitting to the theme that it presents. The first opening gives you the feeling of it being a fantasy show, not necessarily the best sound out there, but it conveys what the show is about at that time. While the second opening tries to fit into more of the dark atmosphere of the show at that point in the series. I don\'t have a solid opinion regarding the ending but I did definitely like the two other endings that are character-centric. It\'s a nice touch musically, especially that the characters themselves sing it.The soundtrack is eerie at times, I never once thought that it wasn\'t fit. The music is done exactly where it should be done. It compliments the atmosphere that the show is trying to display. It\'s rare to find such a nigh-perfect placement sound for certain scenes, but Rokka No Yuusha implements that effectively.Even if the sound is not outstanding if it\'s viewed on it\'s own, it\'s done in a fashion like it\'s an exclusive musical piece for the specific scene that is happening. And that is something that I personally respect from composers that pay respect to the art that they\'re working on.The voice-acting cast does well for the the type of personality they\'re working on and there is no monotone voices, and the sound-effects are definitely well fit.Character:This field is definitely where the series shines best at. Despite the fact that the show is only 12 episodes long. The cast has a very distinctive personalities and roles that are easily recognizable. They\'re also for the most part all incredibly likable to the audience. Their developments in such a short period is amazing, and it\'s very evident as to how the characters changed from their first appearance.This includes the main character. The main character is not your average lead hero. He tries to reach to the best conclusions in the most logical way, and he\'s humane. May be naive at times, but he looks past his naivete if the situation asks for it. The same falls for the rest of the cast.It is not surprising that this category is the show\'s best field. Because the plot revolves around the cast, and how they act depending on the situation that is presented to them. All of the cast have their own motives and desires and are explored thoroughly. The designs are rather attractive as well, but aesthetics are completely subjective as pointed out previously.Enjoyment:Rokka no Yuusha is an incredibly enjoyable anime. It\'s clever. It never feels repetitive. Every episode has it\'s own new content for the watcher to explore through and think about the mystery surrounding it. It\'s very great at displaying suspense between every episode end for the watcher to watch the next. It\'s definitely a series that is worth watching in one-go.If you like tension (edge of the seat feel) and character-centric fantasy show this is definitely the type of show that I\'d recommend to watch. Unfortunately, this series suffers from the point that it will most likely remain incomplete (anime-wise)Thanks for reading my review and any feedback is appreciated on my profile, as this is my very first review. really the case.

Unfortunately, this series suffers from the point that it will most likely remain incomplete (anime-wise)Thanks for reading my review and any feedback is appreciated on my profile, as this is my very first review.', 'I’d describe Rokka no Yuusha (Braves of the Six Flowers), a fantasy show that’s more than just about swords fighting or saving the world. Well initially, it sets up it like so with its background story. Apparently, it’s revealed that a Demon God existed a long time ago whom annihilated humanity. And now, its return is imminent. Six heroes (or otherwise, known as braves) are chosen by the Goddess of Fate to apparently fight the Demon God. The catch is that there is a fake hero as the story introduces a “7th brave”. Main male protagonist Adelt learns the hard way of what exactly it...means when suspicion falls upon himself.Based on the light novels written by Ishio Yamagata, the series takes on an interesting approach at fantasy and adventure. Rather than the group traveling together to fight against enemies and reach the final boss, there’s inner fighting between the heroes themselves. The cause of this is because of the existence of a 7th hero whom the others label as a traitor or double agent. So in essence, the show follows more into a mystery genre as the story progresses. We meet Adelt, the self-proclaimed “strongest man in the world” in the beginning. Perhaps the cleverest of the heroes and we find out about his past based on his background story. His role in the series becomes prominent because others begins to suspect him as the fake hero.As a show with such a colorful cast of characters, we are also introduced to the other heroes. All of them possesses their own unique traits, personalities, and abilities. These include Nashetanya (princess of Piena and Saint of Blades), Fremy Speeddraw (Saint of Gunpowder), Goldolf Auora (Nashetanya’s loyal follower), Chamo Rosso (the Saint of Swamps), Hans Humpty (the mysterious assassin), and Mora Chester (the Saint of Mountains). The show quickly establishes the fact that none of them can be trusted. Unfortunately for Adelt, he becomes a prime target after several implied facts labels him as “the fake hero.” It sets up a good amount of storytelling as the series immediately shifts into a fantasy/adventure/mystery hybrid. What I also find interesting is how we learn more about the characters including their reasons for being there along with the various hypothesis that focuses on the mystery aspects of the show. Initially, some people might misjudge Rokka no Yuusha and think it’s a typical fantasy story with plain swords fighting. But when it comes to the mystery elements, it’s where each episode begins thrilling enough to anticipate what may happen next. The episodes connects each other in clever ways because of the theories and implied facts. The mystery aspect gets more and more complicated as fingers are being pointed at each other among the seven braves.The characters themselves are also fairly interesting by individual standards. Fremy Speedraw is the lone wolf with a cold heart and dark past. Labeled by others as a brave killer, she is also a prime suspect in the beginning until Hans begins tearing Adelt’s story apart. One of the most intriguing part of the series is her relationship development with Adelt. It’s hard to say exactly their nature as Adelt trusts her but she doesn’t in return on most parts. As they spend more time together though, some of this begins to change as Fremy wishes to learn more about him. Hans also becomes a character that will catch the audience’s attention. Not only does he seem to be the most mysterious but he is also very intelligent with his deductive thinking. The way he analyzes Adelt shows his wits as a critical thinker. This seems to contrast with characters such as Chamo and Goldov who seems to be only there for their own personal reasons. Chamo doesn’t even seem to care much about who the fake brave because of her childish and perhaps borderline insane personality. Goldov just seems to be there because of his undying loyalty for Nashetanya. Speaking of which, Nashetanya herself is also shrouded by mystery regarding her true alliances and personality. It seems that her personality actually changes depending on who she interacts with. Throughout the series, it’s hard to not also label her as a suspect of the fake seventh brave. Finally, there’s the level headed thinker, Mora. Becomes of her calm personality and age, she is seen in regards as the leader of the braves. Although as time goes on, she displays more of desperation to kill the fake hero. What to say about all these characters? They all seem so different but their common goal is the same: to get rid of the mole and kill the Demon God. The catch is that the show focuses a lot more on discovering the fake hero rather than their collective journey. As a show that present itself this way, it can be a hit or miss for certain fans. Personally, it’s something that I welcome with its refreshing concepts. It inspires theories from the viewers and let ourselves think who may be the fake hero. Additionally, the show does a fairly well job at establishing its world fiction and background history. What may be disappointing is the pacing as the show only adapts the first volume as a 1-cour series. In other words, certain parts of the original story is omitted while we don’t learn a whole lot about our main characters (example: Chamo, Goldov, Mora). Furthermore, the relationship dynamics seems to focus more on Adelt and Fremy than any other character in terms of depth. The others only seems to be there for their own reasons such as Goldov’s loyalty to Nashetanya or Chamo’s respect for Mora. It’s a bit of letdown for anyone who is more curious about the other heroes as their characterization isn’t as strong as Adelt or Fremy.Passione is a fairly new studio as they’ve only recently worked on Rail Wars, a show that is easily forgettable. Taking that aside, I would say that the artwork aspects of Rokka no Yuusha exceeds expectations. The world fiction is fascinated illustrated with the resourceful mountainous regions. There’s also inspirations that are drawn from the Azetc-like architectures and gorgeous views of the dense forests. Temples are also decorated with high class fantasy characteristics and Kyouma (the monsters that are spawned by the Demon God) heightens the legitimacy of their world’s danger. Furthermore, the character designs of the main characters are all very distinctive with their combat gear, fighting style, and even animal motifs. The action of the show is also very well performed with good amount of cinematic body movements and clever camera angle timings. There’s little fan service although some of the CGI designs of the Kyouma can be distracting at times. But all in all, it’s a fairly well produced show that is hard to forget when its art department is mentioned.Soundtrack is also strong enough to keep up with the rest of the series. The OP theme song has two parts – the first half gives off a general impression of the show while the second half is more symbolic of the main characters. Some of the ED theme songs are also performed by the characters’ VA themselves, something that I found quite unique. Speaking of which, the character voice mannerisms all are noticeable whether it’s Hans’ cat-like dialects, Fremy’s cold voice tone, or Mora’s commanding presence. The show also does well with its OST particularly when the mystery aspects kicks in with its more eerie coordination. Some of the underwhelming performances will probably be Chamo as her childishness can be borderline annoying or Goldov’s single minded role. Adelt is really also a character that people will find to like or hate just by his personality matched by his voice. But despite that, the soundtrack and voice performances still show of what Rokka no Yuusha is capable of. And that’s definitely not something so easily accomplished in a show like this especially with it being so talky and filled with dialogues.What can be said about Rokka no Yuusha in the end? It’s a fantasy series but not one you will expect to be like from the beginning. Yes, there is still action and magic like the most of the typical stuff fans are used to these days. But unlike others, Rokka no Yuusha adapts with its premise that will hook the viewers into getting into the show more and more. Rather than just watching, it’s also anticipating what the audience will think who the fake hero is as the story progresses. With a good degree of high class fantasy setting and colorful characters, it’s also hard to also ignore those aspects of the show. No, it’s not Dangan Ronpa or Btooom that becomes more of a survival game. Instead, Rokka no Yuusha stands out on its own as not just a fictional fantasy/detective story but also a creative engine with all sorts of matching gears. means when suspicion falls upon himself.Based on the light novels written by Ishio Yamagata, the series takes on an interesting approach at fantasy and adventure.

He proclaim himself as the Strongest Man in the World. Well it seems too odd but awesome.In the mid of episode 5-7, the main character is seems to be treated as a traitor or known as the fake seventh. The graphics and the characters personality showed up and so incredible.I put this anime to 10 means OUTSTANDING. Well  because it has an originally. Nothing can compare to that thing. I hope that the case who is the seventh will  be revealed. "", 'If I told you guys that Rokka no Yuusha was a mystery show and you took a look at this anime at first glance without any background information whatsoever, you’d probably wonder if I was off my pills again. Well maybe I am, but the point is that yes, despite the fact that the setting, characters, and overall driving force are as standard fantasy as they come, Rokka no Yuusha’s plot belongs to the whodunnit side of the genre with plenty of suspects and a lot of circular logic to be had. Which doesn’t exactly change the fact that I’m still watching standard fantasy adapted...by a studio whose last anime was freaking Rail Wars, an anime with so much false advertising attached to it that Burger King advertisements look truthful by comparison. But I do like mysteries, so this standard fantasy was worth taking a look at at the very least. See if this mixing of genres turns out an exciting combination or a generic kitchen sink.Twelve episodes later and all I can summon for this show is a resounding “mrgh”, which is pretty much a combination of “meh” and “urgh” if you didn’t quite get that. A more common word to describe my judgement would be “mediocre”, which isn’t the worst thing to happen when it comes to the “LN adaptation” field, but you’re reading the wrong guy if you think I’m going to excuse a “better than usual” product from a medium whose very form of entertainment runs on poor working conditions and sex crime. Because there was potential for true greatness here with just a little more polish could have made a good mystery anime or even a good character study. Instead, Rokka no Yuusha is pretty much a bad anime made pretentious from its inability to execute its unique ideas properly.So the show takes place in some fantasy land where six chosen heroes called Braves must vanquish a great evil called the Demon God, and said Braves are chosen by crests marked on their body from the Goddess of Fate due to their unique abilities. Our focus character is Adlet Myer, a guy who proclaims to be the strongest man in the world and resolves to prove said boast by invading tournaments and wooing ladies whom are more likely to kill him than they are to listen to his big mouth. After said shonen behavior combined with his skillful fighting gets him marked as a chosen hero, he teams up with a bunny girl princess - and I know some people have been praising the Mesopotamian symbolism that was added in by the anime staff, but it’s hard to take anything knee-deep in religious culture seriously when one your characters looks like she’s wearing an extra costume from a Tales game. It’d be like if Haibane Renmei made Reki wear a jockstrap and a beanie the entire runtime.Anyways, he teams up with said princess and meets up with other Braves along the way before they all gather at a temple, only to realize there are seven of them. Naturally, one of them has to be an imposter working undercover in order to sabotage their mission, and when Adlet is suspected due to some circumstantial evidence against his favor, he must avoid the fighting prowess of his comrades whilst figuring out which one of them is trying to set him up. The fact that it takes four episodes to even get to the mystery plotline is one big point against the show’s favor, but whilst things start getting exciting afterwards, the show peters out of energy fast. Whilst I applaud the team’s decision to just adapt a single volume into twelve episodes because they realized that it can only go downhill from there, by the time the finale rolled around, I had long since stopped caring who the imposter actually was because this team doesn’t seem to understand how to make a mystery interesting.The big elephant in the room is the production. I’m not going to mince words: it is freaking crap, with tons of bad CG and awful cinematography. Even with the studio’s clear lack of money and resources compared to the big wigs, it probably wasn’t in their best interest to hire a director who’s pretty much made a career out of nothing but borderline porn and a LN adaptation that most people consider to be a classic but I consider to be rubbish. There’s this one scene at the end of the fourth episode where the camera tries to build tension by rotating around the room for over a minute Sonic 2006-style to the point that it gave me nausea whilst simultaneously making me want to punch the person who approved that shot in the face. And it also doesn’t help there is quite a bit of fighting in this show, where the few scenes of decent choreography are let down by the lack of in-between animation during moves compounded with horrendously out-of-place CG monsters and magic make them incredibly unexciting to watch. Sometimes, the director shoots the action so close to the camera that I can’t even tell who’s aiming at who or whether someone got hit or not. This is far from the budget issues that plague Ushio and Tora. This is just incompetence that makes Gangsta look like John Wick.But no amount of production issues can make me overlook how padded everything is. Once the mystery actually starts, too much of the runtime is spent on the actual deductions and getting from Point A to Point B rather than making said transitions meaty so I\'d care about them. Very few of the characters are actually interesting because aside from Adlet and an eye-patched girl named Flamie, we barely get to know them apart from the fact that they come from some fucked-up places and have their own ideologies on how to kill, namely in how fast and cruel they want to do it. There\'s a little bit of the ""clashing of philosophical conflicts regarding different ways of life"" that made the author\'s last work, The Book of Bantorra, fun to watch, but it is very neutered here because it mostly manifests in lame action and circular logic that is repeated endlessly doesn\'t go anywhere rather than something actually challenging. I can\'t even remember what that knight who protects the princess actually does, let alone his name.The development given to the more characterized of the bunch isn\'t so hot either, because it\'s mostly just flashbacks regarding racism or idealism that are incredibly hackneyed in execution before resulting in a token romance that is as believable as the scientific study that humans only use 10% of their brain in daily life. And to make it more frustrating, said token romance ends up as nothing more than an ""I hate you. Well I love you"" affair, which is pretty much the third-world country of romance all on its own. However it wasn\'t the worst thing in the world, so I gave it a pass. And despite the story having no rewatch value whatsoever because there\'s not much there beyond the actual deductions along with there being no point in watching a mystery again if you know the mystery, I was willing to give the show a ""well it wasn\'t that bad"" recommendation to people who have lower standards than I do. But then those last few minutes occurred and they ruined everything. Going to be mild spoilers here, but I can\'t exactly conclude the review without mentioning this, so if you haven\'t watched this show and take offense to learning anything beyond what\'s written on the synopsis, I\'d advise you to stop reading right now. Also, those who can\'t handle my hate speeches should probably stay way too.If you spend the entire runtime having your characters overcome a challenge, only to rehash that challenge for your sequel-hook ending without so much as a break in-between, all goodwill suddenly disappears when you realize that the authors weren\'t taking the subject material as seriously as the audience was. It\'s a cheap method of baiting your audience whilst ensuring that they have nothing to look forward to but the same old shit should they ever make more of it (and I very much doubt they will), and it didn\'t help that it just put further stakes into the token romance that it quite frankly didn\'t need. Nothing is more designed to aggravate the mind than substance-less stories with cliffhangers, especially ones that have had absolutely no foreshadowing whatsoever or so little foreshadowing that it doesn\'t matter either way. And seriously, a freaking cow uniform? You\'re jealous of a girl in a cow uniform? And cow uniforms are considered suitable fighting clothes in this universe? At least the bunny suit looked mobile, let alone like appealing eye-candy. by a studio whose last anime was freaking Rail Wars, an anime with so much false advertising attached to it that Burger King advertisements look truthful by comparison. But I do like mysteries, so this standard fantasy was worth taking a look at at the very least. See if this mixing of genres turns out an exciting combination or a generic kitchen sink.Twelve episodes later and all I can summon for this show is a resounding “mrgh”, which is pretty much a combination of “meh” and “urgh” if you didn’t quite get that. A more common word to describe my judgement would be “mediocre”, which isn’t the worst thing to happen when it comes to the “LN adaptation” field, but you’re reading the wrong guy if you think I’m going to excuse a “better than usual” product from a medium whose very form of entertainment runs on poor working conditions and sex crime. Because there was potential for true greatness here with just a little more polish could have made a good mystery anime or even a good character study.

The way the conflict was handled was straight out childish and badly thought out. All the theories being supported by baseless speculation and sircumstance, turning what could have been a more psycological mystery into a basic witchhunt.Also you can not have a story where one out of 7 people is a traitor, and also have me care about them. By me knowing that one is a traitor I can't trust what anyone is saying. You never know...if someone is lying or not, or if they have an ulterior motive. This resulted in me feeling uninvested and bored during what was supposed to be emotional scenes.The last thing I want to bring up is just how pointless it all was. Wasn't this about defeating the Demon Lord or something? The whole anime felt like a sidequest that took up way to much time. Adding to the fact that the ending was incredibly unsatisfying, not only is the story unfinished, but they actually had the balls to pull the same plot twist a second time, right at the last second, meaning that we're almost back where we started. if someone is lying or not, or if they have an ulterior motive.

So why did I give it a 9/10, instead of the 6/10 it ""surely deserves""? That\'s because the author decided to add a twist to it: instead of six heroes, he added a seventh. In that case, one among the seven would forcefully be a traitor.The details added to each episode are all meaningful to the end of this series, which explains the slow pace. The slow build-up paid off big time by the series\' end. It will keep making you think until the very...end.Art: 8/10Just like my previous reviews, I won\'t bother with the art, since it\'s a very subjective category. However, I should note that the animation is on par with the standards, without CGI, and that the characters look quite different from one to another. I love the old Meso-american-styled clothing and environment though, it\'s pretty fresh and new. Aside from all of that, the camera angles were absolutely splendid.Sound: 8/10Just like Art, I won\'t bother, because these two are the most subjective themes ever, though I\'ll say that the main character\'s voice actor did a good job at handling the ""cocky"" and confident personality of Adlet Mayer. Fremy\'s voice actress made a very great portrayal of her character and sounded extremely realistic.Character: 9/10The character section is really the one thing that sets Rokka no Yuusha apart from a ""regular"" anime. Though Adlet looks like a typical shounen character on the first scenes, I\'ll assure you that he really isn\'t, following the gathering of heroes, with the tension building up around him. Also, Adlet, as a main character of a supernatural/fantasy anime, surprisingly does not harbour any magic nor superhuman characteristics, despite the magic-imbued/superhuman comrades. In this aspect, he represents the audience and is a character which all of us viewers are able to relate to. The other heroes do well in their own areas, complementing each others and Adlet himself as a character.Enjoyment: 10/10As I said, I love the old Meso-American civilizations-inspired environment, as it gives off that exotic look to soothe my tired eyes, usually staring at schools, classrooms, cities or wastelands when watching anime. And as I previously mentioned, I love the characters and their respective quirks, along with the tension built around them.Overall: 10/10Despite even being a completely truthful adaptation of the original light novel, Rokka\'s current rating on MAL (7.83/10) is pretty disgustingly low as of today, 20/09/2015Both Rokka\'s and Mahouka\'s anime adaptations ROUGHLY HAVE THE SAME RATING (7.83 vs 7.80)WTFMAL, ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT WHAT SEPARATES A SHIT-TIER ANIME TO A GOD-TIER ONE IS BUT A MEASLY 0.03/10?!Notice/Credentials: I read the novel version, so my knowledge on the franchise is rather extensive. end.Art: 8/10Just like my previous reviews, I won\'t bother with the art, since it\'s a very subjective category.

So let\'s break this into individual segments:- Story: Great - Not much more to say if you had to give it one word. Great suits Rokka no Yuusha\'s story as it is in...no way original but the way they presented was glorious, and you kind of forgot how ""straight forward"" the story was in the middle all the tension this anime left you with for each episode after the middle segment. All in all the ""uncertainty between peoples when there\'s one more than it should be"" can seem flat-line, but not when executed like it has been done here. And then ONTOP of this - what that became the whole plot summary for this season, we still got the full story-line behind and in front us of regarding the original objective of the Braves.The story for Rokka no Yuusha get\'s a 8/10.- Art: Lovely, with all the different types of anime these days - breaking them apart eventually becomes difficult for certain people (Looking away from those who has gone over the edge to make a own special style) and in no way was the art of Rokka no Yuusha MINDBLOWING, but it was not this boring, dimmed down, bad colored type either. The art was just fine and lived up to the atmosphere that the anime gave us, remaining colorful and beautiful while at the same time having this grey stone strike here and there to remind us of the situation our heroes here are trapped within. A work of perfection presented in a decent manner.Art style: 7/10.- Sound: Oh the sounds, the music and the general layer of what they put in the background of this anime was part of what made it so great - Making sure that they properly match the music with the scenery (Which sounds weird to point out but they amount of animes I\'ve seen f*** that up is mindblowing) and everything in the background during the slow and silent segments, it all created this passive atmosphere that followed me all the way from the first episode to the last, and it did a great job in doing so.Sound: 7/10.- Characters: How I loved them all, or well - Most of them. The crew of Rokka no Yuusha was put together in a great manner, it is not each day I see a team of seven people in this style of situation - that either goes along or fight\'s to death and still manages to maintain their individual characteristic foundation. Rokka no Yuusha delivered more than plenty in terms of characters, making them unique in such individual ways while still not going over the edge while doing so - and at the same time give some of them development traits that in no way damaged the show itself. I was taken away by all seven of them and that for a damn good reason.Character(s): 9/10.Enjoyment and the overall: If it has not been clear until now - I have absolutely loved this show. So much that it pains me to the bone knowing that the season is already over and that we don\'t ALREADY have a season two confirmed (As of this entry) scares me. A great anime with some of the better characters I have seen - not only in the year of 2015\'s anime round up but overall across the different anime\'s I have had the joy of watching, great art and beautiful music - Rokka no Yuusha is a work of greatness that everyone should see and I absolutely recommend anyone reading this to give this anime a go if you already haven\'t.Enjoyment: 9/10.That\'s it for my review, fingers crossed for a season two - thank you so much for reading and have a great time watching anime:Total score roundup: 8/10. no way original but the way they presented was glorious, and you kind of forgot how ""straight forward"" the story was in the middle all the tension this anime left you with for each episode after the middle segment.

After all, whether you like it or not, this world revolves around first impressions. After reading the brief synopsis for the show and taking in the promotional art, I personally thought that this show would be the standard kind of fantasy adventure where a group of friends band together and use the power of their bonds to overcome evil. The first two or so episodes would have you believing that this was the case too. However, after digging through that first layer of information, Rokka no Yuusha reaches a point where it can develop what it wants and what...it wants to develop are the relationships between each individual brave.For all intents and purposes each of the braves that were selected by the goddess to kill the demon king are more or less strangers (with a couple of exceptions). Because of this unfamiliarity between one another once the big reveal that a seventh brave has been planted within their group is made known no one really knows who to trust. Adlet, our main character, has been traveling with Princess Nashetanya since the beginning but how much does he actually know about her. Maura is the leader of all the saints but who is to say she does not have her own agenda. This feeling of uncertainty permeates the latter two thirds of the show and creates a great sense of tension that feels natural and keeps the watcher engaged.Initial suspicions on who the fake brave is falls on Adlet and, without a convincing means of proving his innocence, he escapes into the forest. From this point the show’s pace becomes noticeably slower. While the first three episodes had our heroes all making a long trek to rendezvous at a certain meeting spot the rest of the show takes place within a barrier that cannot be escaped until the seventh is identified. In one regard this kills all of the forward momentum that has been building up and anyone who came to this show with the idea of a grand adventure may be deterred. On the other hand this slower pace is what makes it feel like there is a lot at stake and what lets the writing shine.Being a mystery show the writer needs to keep the final reveal a topic of discussion. Subtlety is key. After all, there is no fun in a mystery when the culprit is obvious. Rokka no Yuusha plays around with this by dropping facts that may seem rather arbitrary in the grand scheme of the story only to make you recall that fact when it plays a role in solving the mystery. This attention to detail and care is impressive. Very little was ever done in the show that did not have some bit of importance to the story, no matter how small it may seem.To sum things up Rokka no Yuusha surprised me. I was surprised by the sudden change of adventure to mystery. I was surprised by how thought out this show was given the outward look of a typical shounen. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show. The pacing of the show is a bit spotty and there are a handful of nitpicks I have that I will not go into detail about but I never felt that these factors ever took away from the experience. it wants to develop are the relationships between each individual brave.For all intents and purposes each of the braves that were selected by the goddess to kill the demon king are more or less strangers (with a couple of exceptions).

This is one of those anime.When I look for anime to watch, I usually look over the covers, and if I like the art or premise, then I move on to read the summary. The cover art for this anime suggests that it is a fantasy action one, with a group of heroes fighting a demon lord. Just a normal fighting anime. However, the actual story was far more complex, and though that made me...love the anime even more, some people may have found this disappointing.The reason for this anime having a somewhat low rating is, I believe, because all the mystery lovers don\'t watch this anime while the action lovers do. And neither get what they want. Especially the latter, who saw this anime for some cool fights, and got a mystery and few fighting scenes.Another confusing aspect was that the first 2 episodes gave off a ""going to fight the demon lord"" vibe. It got mystery fans uninterested and the action fans excited. It is such a shame, because the story is so good and the characters are interesting, but that aspect was only briefly shown in those episodes.So in the end, what I want to say is, all you mystery lovers, go watch this anime. For those of you who like epic action scenes, this anime may not be for you. love the anime even more, some people may have found this disappointing.The reason for this anime having a somewhat low rating is, I believe, because all the mystery lovers don\'t watch this anime while the action lovers do.

For those of you who like epic action scenes, this anime may not be for you.', ""(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)[Synopsis]: A thousand years ago the demon god appeared and began to take over the continent however was stopped by the legendary Saint of the Single Flower. After driving the demon god into a deep slumber she foretold that it would awaken again one day and that six heroes bearing her power would rise to defeat it and once again drive it into dormancy. Cycles of these Braves appeared to face the demon god every several hundred years after the Saint's disappearance and were all successful and now the demon god will soon rise again and so...too must six new heroes. Adlet Mayer (Saito, Soma), the self-professed strongest man in the world, is chosen to become one of these heroes. After congregating with the other Braves it is discovered that they number as seven rather than six and the task of discerning the impostor sets them all at odds as each member grows more suspicious of the other and the demon gods awakening approaches.[Characters]:The cast of Rokka no Yuusha is fairly small as the story is heavily focuses upon Adlet and the six other Braves however this allows for the show to investigate each of the characters to a great extent in the absence of a larger number of characters. Adlet is certainly the character most worth talking about as he stands out distinctly even amongst the other Braves. On the surface is resembles a somewhat typical adventure fantasy protagonist - he is incredibly strong-willed, sincere, and quite ordinary in ability-set in comparison to his fellow Braves. That being said, he is highly perceptive and intelligent in how he fights and problem-solves - both traits lend themselves incredibly well to the story which at a basic level is a mystery. His fighting style is unique and his utilization of traps, crude sciences, and the environment sets him apart from most other characters, especially so from the other Braves most of whom wield powerful magics such as the conjuration and manipulation of swords, gunpowder.Refreshingly, Adlet is by no means the only intelligent character within the Braves and each member has a strong sense of agency within the plot with perhaps the exception of Goldof. Despite the characters being perceptive and rational, each of them continuously arrive at different opinions concerning the seventh Brave and impostor and what makes them so compelling is that each of their conclusions are legitimized and well-founded. While their character designs are a bit outlandish at first glance they fit well within the aesthetic of the world and I found that I got used to them quite quickly. Rokka no Yuusha is one of the few shows that I can say kept me on my toes as far as which character I put my faith in and trusted as the dynamic of the group and the personality of each character all meshed differently as the plot developed and new information came to light.The show takes the time to get to know each character and their reasoning both stays consistent with the characterization presented while also evolving as they do throughout the story which added a strong feeling of consistency to the show's underlying logic. The show is hardly all cold-logic and there are plenty are plenty of emotional characters like Fremy who keep the show engaging in that regard as well. I also can't underplay the uniqueness of each of the Braves in relation to each other as, beyond what they believe, they each come from vastly different walks of life, have distinct mannerisms and speech patterns, and interact with each other in different ways.These traits and differences exhibited by each character account for my reasoning that their presence is definitely a strong-point of the show and its focus on character drama and interaction is well founded.[Art/Animation]:The art and animation was at first a pretty significant concern for me when the show started out however by the end I was quite happy with how it improved and ultimately handled itself. The initial 3 or 4 episodes suffer a bit from poor character designs and mediocre CG work on the part of the Fiends however after that point the show picks up consistency-wise a great deal - the character designs are far better represented and their animations as well as the movement of the camera become a great deal more smooth and dynamic as opposed to what was initially presented. Baring the first few episodes, the show is strong aesthetically in this area and though it falters at times I would say that animation shouldn't be a concern going in.One thing that immediately caught my eye that I found interesting all throughout the series was the world and setting established which felt highly influenced by Aztec structures and buildings. It was an aesthetic I had not seen before in anime and Rokka no Yuusha did a great job bringing it to life. The influence present in the setting can also be found in the character designs which accounts for some of their flamboyant appearances however this too I found to be quite interesting and fun after a turn. The vibrant designs of the other Braves further set Adlet apart who's design is more typical and muted both alienating him on an aesthetic and often a cognitive level while also adding a unique flavor and style to the show that I can't claim to have seen elsewhere.The show doesn't boast terribly great CG and the Fiends are both bizarre in appearance and execution however luckily we don't see them all that often after the central drama of the story begins and their later appearances in the show are handled slightly better. That being said the poor use of CG was one of my initial concerns with the show but luckily Rokka no Yuusha improved dramatically as time went on and while I would not list the visuals necessarily as a strength of the show, I would say so of the unique designs and aesthetic.[Story]:As I mentioned earlier, the first 3 or so episodes of the show came up a bit short and the actual premise of the story doesn't arrive until the 4th episode however I wouldn't say that it's plot was terrible beforehand. Rokka no Yuusha doddled a bit before arriving at its premise however once getting to that point it changed dramatically and what I first hard dismissed as a vanilla, demon-killing, action show turned into a mystery-centric, battle of both logic and physical prowess as the Braves clashed with one another. The early episodes also differ noticeably in terms of pacing and the show slows down a great deal for a few episodes midway as it unpacks the logic and implications of the Braves' dilemma however I found this to be far more engaging than what was present prior and the methodical pacing in the mid and latter parts of the show was highly enjoyable. The show does an amazing job juggling suspicion from what character to the next and I, as a viewer, found the way in which Rokka no Yuusha approached the mystery genre to be highly compelling in its presentation of developments and perceived facts.Perhaps the strongest point of the story outside of the plot itself was its ability to first evolve into something far more cerebral than what was first laid out but also its ability to maintain the action and adventure feel established early on while evolving immensely elsewhere was impressive. Perhaps even more impressively - it never felt like the latter action was happening for action's-sake but rather it occurred quite naturally within the context of the situation and the intelligence exhibited by the characters and plot felt present within the action sequences as well through their strategic progression and execution.The story is quite slow in how it unfolds as it is almost entirely focused upon its premise of there being seven Braves and one impostor and so it may disappoint those who were more interested in the premise in its entirety and its conflict with the demon god and the role of the six heroes. Hopefully the show receives a future installment however the point at which it ends gives a full and pleasurable conclusion to the events at hand, resolving both the mystery and conflict while remaining open.[Music]:The music was good all throughout and the soundtrack had a handful of  memorable songs. The area where I felt Rokka no Yuusha succeed the most in a musical sense was in how its songs were diverse to the point that they lent themselves well to the heroic, action adventure setting present in the premise of the story while also presenting an apt selection of music to support the show's mystery themes and the many high-tension moments therein. The music matched the tone of the show well in each of it's endeavors and intricacies and was certainly one of the points of success attributing to the show's overall enjoyability.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:Rokka no Yuusha surprised me, plain and simple. What initially felt like one of the seasonal action shows where stereotypical heroes run around and combat monsters rendered in poor CG rapidly became something extremely engaging and special. It has its fair share of problems such as its lackluster animation and art early on and occasional quality drops throughout however these negative elements pale in comparison to the areas in which the show triumphed.Rating: 8I gave Rokka no Yuusha an 8 because of its compelling and self-involved cast of characters, its unique aesthetic and combat feel, and the intelligent nature with which it explored its own evolving plot in dynamic and rational ways. The missteps in the art and animation department hinder it from scoring any higher for me and some of the character interactions were not as convincing and well-conceived as others however  the end-product of these things was nothing less than enjoyable.[Recommendations]:Anyone who finds themselves classically interested in show's that come off as well-figured, logical, or rational would like the manner in which Rokka no Yuusha plays out as the characters provide compelling reasons for why they think what they do and act accordingly. For the same reason I would recommend it to any purveyor of the mystery genre as it presents an engaging plot in this regard and the manner in which the show allows you to postulate yourself rather than keeping the viewer purposefully in the dark was a strong point of the show. The show has good action and should attract those interested in the more tactical side of combat however those interested in this category will have to find enjoyment in the rest of the show as the fighting intermittently takes a backseat as the show unfolds. To those who look into the show, I do highly suggest reaching at least episodes 4 or 5 before deciding to drop as that is where the show is most transformative. too must six new heroes.

The synopsis makes it seem like yet another generic fantasy anime about a group of chosen heroes trying to save the world from some evil Demon God, but in reality the story itself is totally different. In fact, Rokka no Yuusha is primarily a detective-style mystery anime about a group of people with a traitor in their midst where they have to use logical reasoning and deduction in order to try to figure out who it is.In short, the story is about six ""Braves"" who are chosen by the Goddess of...Fate. They\'re given supernatural powers and tasked with defeating the Demon God who threatens the lands. So they all set out on a journey to do so, but when they finally meet each other, they suddenly find themselves trapped inside a magical barrier... and notice that there are seven people in the room. It is impossible for there to be seven Braves instead of six, and thus they quickly deduce that one of them is a fake and a traitor. But who is it, and how do you prove it? Well, in a nutshell that is more or less what this anime is about.Initially, the mystery is not much more than a closed room problem, but the scale quickly ramps up and over time there is more and more information revealed about the Braves themselves, the supernatural aspects of the world, certain scientific elements and more. This means that all the clues to the problem are not actually presented in the very beginning, but are rather expanded upon as the show progresses. Because of this, you\'re left with very little chance to try and solve the problem yourself as a viewer after the mystery is presented, and instead the anime just reveals the solution to you step by step over time. Of course this is nothing more than a different style of writing so there\'s nothing wrong with doing that per se, but personally I vastly prefer to be given more ability to think for myself when I\'m watching a detective mystery, so I was a little bit disappointed by this.Another thing that must be talked about is the pacing. Rokka no Yuusha is an extraordinarily rare case of a light novel adaptation which has an entire season covering just *one* volume of the source material. That\'s right, 12 episodes for 1 volume. That\'s about 3-4 times slower pacing than what you\'d normally see. This comes with a couple consequences: the good news is that it\'s extremely detailed and never feels rushed whatsoever, and the bad news is that a lot of time is wasted on matters that feel rather pointless and irrelevant. For example there is a very forced romance subplot going on throughout the anime which really doesn\'t feel like it adds anything worthwhile to the story at all. There\'s also the simple truth that the plot doesn\'t really progress very much with every new episode due to how slow-paced it is. I didn\'t get the chance to do so myself, but I reckon Rokka no Yuusha ought to be a lot more suited for marathoning than watching weekly.Unsurprisingly, the main character cast consists of the seven (supposed) Braves, including our protagonist Adlet Mayer: the self-proclaimed ""strongest man in the world"". Personally I don\'t really like him very much because he\'s extremely arrogant and constantly has to remind the audience of just how strong he is every five minutes, and it gets annoying pretty fast. The other characters aren\'t given too much backstory or depth simply because they have to remain ""mysterious"" so that they all will seem more or less evenly suspicious. And that\'s fine and all in theory, but it also renders them rather uninteresting and one-dimensional (at least as far as the viewers ever get to know that is). The most likeable one to me would be the human/kyouma hybrid Fremy, but even she can pretty much be summarized in a few sentences. So Rokka no Yuusha\'s character cast is fairly uninspiring as a whole, but on the other hand they\'re all more or less treated as plot devices for the sake of the mystery rather than actual people anyway so I guess that\'s somewhat understandable.The animation is not very flashy, but it does its job and fits the tone of the series very well overall. However it\'s pretty obvious that this is a fairly low-budget anime, as the character designs are oftentimes rendered in very low detail whenever they are in the background of a scene, and the CGI doesn\'t always look as good as you\'d like. But for the most part at least I think it looks fine. The OP and ED themes (it actually has multiple ones) are again nothing spectacular by themselves, but they fit very well with the overall atmosphere of the story.As a whole, Rokka no Yuusha is an anime which is not afraid to break norms, and presents a type of story which is not only unexpected but also a rarity to see in anime. However it also feels a bit like an ambitious experiment that never quite manages to reach up to its own potential. But even though I don\'t think the anime turned out quite as good as it theoretically could have, it\'s still a lot better than most, and originality is always a plus in and of itself.One final thing that must be taken into consideration though is that for anime-only viewers, Rokka no Yuusha might not turn out to be an entirely satisfactory experience. Like I said before, the anime only covers the very first volume of the light novels and nothing more, so for anyone who doesn\'t like to read books, you really don\'t get to see very much of the overall story at all. The initial premise was for the Braves to go out and fight some evil Demon God after all, right? Well that never happens, not even remotely close. Also as far as I\'ve seen, the light novel sales boost from the anime has been rather underwhelming to say the least so I wouldn\'t put my hopes up for a second season ever being adapted either. However if you try to forget about the story of the world itself and instead focus solely on the detective game, then you can still consider it to be a somewhat conclusive ending. Despite that though, the final seconds leave you with a giant teaser for upcoming arcs, so you might have some trouble turning a blind eye to that part. Fate.

Before I get into the review I would like to say that the criticism that this show isn't what it was advertised as is true. This anime does not belong in the mystery genre but more the action genre.Story: 8/10Considering the way the anime was set up a story that was anything more than decent wasn't really needed as the story basically only needed to...assemble the relevant characters in a certain area and then trap them with the idea that there is a traitor among them. I was pleasantly surprised when the story not only fulfilled this part of the story admirably but also added little parts of world history that were not needed but really created depth. The tales of ancient hero's who walked their path before them and the whole saints concept really created a much more interesting story than I had imagined and I really hope there is more anime set in this world. This said the story is of course not perfect and at times is a bit cliche. My main issue with the story is that instead of having some clever ending to the mystery of the traitor it just sort of involved magic whenever it needed to explain something difficult.Art: 9/10The bar was set high on the first episode with brilliant art, smooth animation and scenes that were an absolute pleasure to watch. This quality wasn't maintained at a constant throughout the anime but the whole thing was none the less a very beautiful anime.Sound: 7/10Not much stood out here. The music was good, the characters well voiced and the sound effects appropriate. None of it was overly memorable however.Character: 10/10I love good characters and thats what we get here. I found that the characters were refreshingly unique and didn't stray into the anime tropes. There were no harems, the females don't all fall for the main protagonist for no reason, relationships actually do develop instead of remaining stagnant etc.I enjoyed seeing the developing relationships between close characters and watching new friendships get formed. I liked the quirky and original personality's of the characters that set them apart and made each one unique.Most of all I loved the main character who wasn't some overpowered bad ass (despite his claims that he was the strongest man in the world) or some weakling who let others fight for him but a intelligent character who fought using every trick in the book. He never fought fair but used his array of tools and trickery to win the day (or at least try to win it anyway). The main character had the usual issue of being seemingly morally perfect but besides that I found no issues with the characters.Enjoyment: 10/10While this anime never lived up to its claim of mystery it did instead contain some of the most enjoyable anime fights I have ever seen. The hero's didn't always win and they didn't recover just from some moral bullshit. Not only was the action exciting but the entire anime was enjoyable to watch due to its great art and interesting story. Really I cant think of a single moment I didn't enjoy.Overall: 10/10This is without a doubt one of my favorite anime ever and as such you should remember that my review comes with just a little bit of bias. Nevertheless I will argue with anyone who puts this anime below a 7. assemble the relevant characters in a certain area and then trap them with the idea that there is a traitor among them.

Really I cant think of a single moment I didn't enjoy.Overall: 10/10This is without a doubt one of my favorite anime ever and as such you should remember that my review comes with just a little bit of bias. Nevertheless I will argue with anyone who puts this anime below a 7."", 'Into the Bullshit Fantasy Rabbit Hole: A Rokka: Braves of the SIx Flowers ReviewMysteries often work well in the form of a new mystery every episode or just one throughout the course of a feature length film. They are a lot harder to pull off when they’re stretched throughout entire seasons. For me to really look back at mystery and remember it fondly, it needs to keep me entertained and have an extravagant or well thought out conclusion. Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers did not have that. Instead, it had a litany of problems in terms of explanation and execution, plus a motley crue...of characters that left my interest fading in and out.Rokka kinda falls down the bullshit fantasy rabbit hole when it comes to explaining what the fuck is going on. Adlet tries to determine one of the numerous ways that the seventh brave used to trap them in the barrier. Most of the explanations are based around fantasy laws and most of those are quickly shot down by more magical rules. When your reasoning is created from made up things, instead of science and logic, then the conclusion is going to severely lack impact. “Why was there fog? Oh, because of the fog shrines. But wait! Fog shrines can’t overlap sun shrines, so that doesn’t work!” I’m para-phrasing, but you see what I mean.Not only are these explanations total nonsense, they’re also a big waste of time! SO much time is wasted from boring exposition that there’s little left to actually enjoy. There are little fight scenes here and there, but they mostly don’t last longer than a couple minutes, which totally sucks because they have the strongest warriors on the planet (or wherever they live) and that would’ve made for some awesome brawls! But I shouldn’t judge something based on what I think it should be, but rather by what it is.Moving onto the characters, um…what can I say? They’re underwhelming. They lack personality. And they’re all kinda stupid. Adlet’s stupid because he claims to be the strongest man in the world, then nearly gets killed over and over and over, without beating anyone in the process. Fremy’s hot and has cool gun powers and a fucked up eye, but she’s also a copy-and-paste revenge character. She doesn’t think past her weird plan for revenge, and, well, that’s it. Nothing new to bring to that archetype. Hans is something, and so is Chamot. Don’t really have much else to say about them. Mora turns out to be really stupid and a big, dumb liar that jumps to conclusions. Nashetania’s also attractive, and Goldof is her volunteer bitch slave.So, uh, that’s that. A really bland and poorly constructed mystery that takes too long to get to the conclusion. An unsatisfactory conclusion, made possible by a lousy cast and nonsensical explanations.Oh, and as far as the music and animation go? Meh. The animation was okay and the OPs and EDs were not memorable in the least. At least, they didn’t make me want to go to YouTube and listen to them on their own. But that;s just my opinion. of characters that left my interest fading in and out.Rokka kinda falls down the bullshit fantasy rabbit hole when it comes to explaining what the fuck is going on.

Spoilers ahead!)In the house I grew up in, we were always scarce for snacks. Chips, cakes, and cookies were difficult to come by, not because my parents and siblings were allergic or did not like such temptations. No, it was the opposite. Since we all loved them, they barely lasted more than a couple of days after purchasing. One of the delectable treats we usually bought were what are named “Grasshoppers.” Keebler – the cookie company that uses tiny elf labor – are the makers, and contrary to their name, they are delicious. They are tiny, about...the size of an Oreo, taking up roughly the same diameter as a circle formed when you put the tip of your forefinger onto the tip of your thumb. Their outsides are slightly ridged so that, should you put two together, you could make your own cogged contraption. Most important of all, they have the perfect balance of chocolate and mint, their insides filled not with grasshoppers but with a fudge-filled wafer. Girl Scout Thin Mints are dirt compared to the mighty Grasshopper.I loved these cookies growing up (I still do), and being the slightly selfish teenager that I was, I would make it my mission to sneak them up to my room during the night to have them all to myself. Sometimes I would confiscate the entire package and hide the remainder that I did not eat in one sitting under my bed, to be consumed at a later date.This would come back to bite me because, one day, the Grasshoppers had gone missing and, my family knowing of my theft-like tendencies, immediately accused me. I had not touched this round of cookies, but it was all I could do to persuade them. I tried pinning it on my father, a famous late-night snack-eater. My mother “smelt it and therefore dealt it,” my sister was prone to sneaking food throughout the day, and my brother actually avoided them but we all knew that was the perfect cover-up. By the end of our meal I was still the prime suspect, the cookie culprit never discovered. I remembered this small snapshot of my life after watching Rokka no Yuusha, an anime centering on a potentially false accusation. But instead of about cookies it was about people and instead of a dull dinner it was instead a thrilling ride from start to finish.STORYRokka no Yuusha, at its core, is not a plot-driven anime. An overarching and overdone tale of “good guys go to defeat the big bad guy” exists and is the underlying motive for the whole group, but the immediacy of achieving it is not present. The anime is not even character-driven. Due to the large size of the cast, little time is available to delve into the past of the people at play. Rokka no Yuusha understands this, therefore placing emphasis on the inverse of plot and characters. That is, the show focuses on everything else, the unknown elements and the mystery of the situation.To be clear, a narrative and a set of people are around, but that is not what the anime is technically trying to target. One of the first signs of this seemingly misplaced focus is the dialogue. Rokka no Yuusha is heavy on the speaking, with characters entering monologues, longwinded explanations, and personal epithets. Considering that the majority of the events happen over the course of a day or two, conversations sometimes last hours, the cast exchanging ideas, anecdotes, and theories instead of worrying about the looming threat before them.Despite the massive amount of talking that goes on, nothing is ever “said,” no important information is ever gained. Little is learned about the world, characters’ lives are rarely expounded on, and often times the words themselves are incorrect. The dialogue, coincidentally, is fog, cloaking the truth and veiling the answer to the mystery with lies and deceit.But it is not all exposition. Truth be told, anime (indeed most narratives) are not keen on having solely dialogue. It can be done but it requires careful planning and the correct context. Thus, shows opt for a rising and falling of action, with Rokka no Yuusha being no different. It breaks up the potential monotony of continuous talking with action-heavy scenes. A brawl against puked up amoebas here, a chase through the foliage there. Action of this magnitude deviates from the norm, drama and tension replacing comfortability and familiarity.However the fights, like the dialogue, do not contain a singular purpose. Their main goal is to once again cloak what should be made clear, heightening the mystery in an indirect manner. When a battle starts, the characters, and by extension the audience, are forced to keep the conundrum on the wayside, subsequently stopping the secrets from surfacing. This red light continues for the duration of the skirmish, at which point the green light is turned back on and everyone – the characters and the audience – are permitted to think about the solution. It is an artificial device in the sense that a fight can, and most often does, breakout at convenient moments, but it ultimately feels natural due to the gravity of the problem, the weight of the decisions made, and the force of the actions taken.The combination of leveled dialogue and tense action is a roller coaster, the audience riding a sinusoidal wave, the crest a flurry of swords and the trough a detailing of magical wooden stakes. The cycle varies; battles, like their discussion counterpart, ranging in length from a quick knife throw to a prolonged feud. Sometimes the wave stands, with sentences becoming spears to insult or insinuate another and vice versa. But what happens during the middle section from high to low or low to high? Those transitional sections are as important as the exposition and battles, with “transition” the operative word: a transition in character focus. In other words, the anime mixes up the cast, providing appropriate screen-time for the people involved.It is important to understand the allocation of screen-time varies and is not uniform, with the frequency of appearance different for each person. Visualizing a spectrum, Adlet, the star, occupies the top and Goldof, with nothing to his name but a crush, occupies the bottom, with everyone else in-between. Seemingly tangential, the screen-time of the characters finds relevancy precisely because it differs from person to person. Had everyone acquired similar time onscreen, such an aspect could be discounted, however since everyone had dissimilar time onscreen, it becomes yet another factor that needs to be taken into consideration when investigating the mystery.Is it Hans, who was absent in the beginning but had a large presence in the middle of the season? Is it Flamie, who would switch in and out with the other Braves? Or is it really Adlet, whose massive amount compared to everyone else was meant to impose a false sense of security? Arguably it had to end up this way – the size of the cast demands that some characters will inevitably gain more screen-time than others. But Rokka no Yuusha uses this inevitable detriment to its advantage, propagating the mystery that much further.The mystery is evidently and thoroughly supported – it is a motif that finds strength in nearly all aspects of the anime. But the thematic presence is equally as important, with the themes emerging from the mysteriousness of it all. A simple view would be that an action should not be undertaken until all possible angles are taken into consideration. The viewer sees firsthand how assumptions lead to infighting and incorrect conclusions when Adlet is blamed for everything unfairly before all outlets are explored, meaning that the mystery showcases a perfect example of what not to do in a similar situation. A better view builds off the previous: people are sometimes wrong.People make mistakes, people are not infallible. Doubly so if the issue at hand is inherently mysterious. It is common for people to think critically about a problem, and even after considering every angle, he or she might still be wrong. Flamie, Hans, and Maura succumb to this reality when they admit their erroneous attacks. Interestingly, Adlet, the self-proclaimed “strongest man in the world,” encounters this notion as well, where his conjectures often led to dead ends. Granted this situation is direr than normal, with individual mistakes potentially ending in the loss of life, meaning it does not directly correlate to the real world. However it is still a nice guide for this type of thinking since it demonstrates why these mistakes happen and what these mistakes create.The best view, though, is Rokka no Yuusha’s forte: the inverse. That is, people are sometimes right. It is surprisingly difficult to place trust in another person, believing what he or she has to say without reservation. Such difficulty arises from the inability to get inside the head of another person – an angle from another’s perspective is impossible – and from the inability to accept being wrong – people hate making mistakes. Together it means having less faith in others.But sometimes that leap of faith has to be taken, gambling on the fact that the mysterious cloud that surrounds people is not always malicious. Adlet’s actions demonstrate this kind of willingness to find the good in others, with him aiding his comrades, falling in love, and protecting those close to him. The others do the same: Flamie starts to trust, Hans makes a friend, and Maura acts motherly. They all place themselves in danger by doing so, but the reward of tighter relationships and stronger answers proves taking that chance is no mystery whatsoever.While Rokka no Yuusha purposefully avoids the meat of its narrative and its characters in favor of everything else around it, the mystery it manifests and the themes it touts contain more than enough sustenance all their own.ANIMATIONThe art for Rokka no Yuusha is does not change much. To be fair, it has a nice amount of variety in the beginning of the season, where Adlet visits the Aztec-esque town and where he travels the countryside with Nashetania, visiting plains, sunsets, and mountains. It is when the real journey starts that the locations and subsequently the backgrounds start to stagnate. In essence, there are two areas: the ritual tower and the rest of the jungle. Again, to be fair, there is no way around this considering the dilemma. But this is not just passable plot-wise but also thematically relevant. The tower is a hub, a metaphorical “safe haven” amidst the chaos around them. Its stark blue interior also contrasts heavily with the green of the jungle, giving it a larger feeling of safety. The fog is a concealer, hiding actions, persons, and areas, increasing the overall mysteriousness. And the jungle achieves this effect as well. A jungle blends together, with one spot pretty much the same as any other. It can start to get confusing, disorienting those trapped within it; the perfect place for a mystery. That is to say, the art, like the story, uses inversion – one or two locations are not boring but purposeful – to increase the total amount of mystery. In short, the anime continues to use its own predefined limitations to its advantage.Sadly not every limit can be overcome. One of the show’s biggest grievances is the CG it employs. Simply put, it is awful. The Fiends – the natural enemy of the humans – are ugly, in both design and depiction. The former done purposefully to make them the ravenous beasts that they are and the latter done accidentally because otherwise it would make little sense. They stand out horribly in the world, their movements are choppy, and they look blocky rather than menacing. Flamie’s bullet magic and Nashetania’s swords use CG as well, however those instances are tolerable. For the Fiends, they are a blight, in the positive and the negative sense.All positive are the character designs. In fact, the character designs are arguably the anime’s strongest facet. On the surface level, they are imaginative – a flurry of colors, a myriad of outfits, and a stampede of accessories donning each person accordingly. Going deeper reveals how the characters’ designs follow the mystery motif. It might be something simple like Hans’ hair covering his eyes. It might be something more complex like Chamot’s androgynous and childlike persona. Or it might be something esoteric like Nashetania’s mirroring set of colors, the white signifying purity and goodness and the red signifying evil and hate. At the deepest level, their designs correspond with their personalities and development throughout the season. Flamie wears a flower on her cap, symbolizing the growth and flowering she undergoes whereas Goldof’s helmet represents his hardheadedness, his loyalty, and his delusions. They are an amazing example of what thoughtful character designs are capable of.Actual animation is unfortunately not amazing, instead a wishy-washy offering. At times, the action can pick up, with characters running, jumping, and falling throughout their battles. Choreography of the fights is standard, relying more on flashy maneuvers than direct impacts. Interestingly, Adlet’s fighting style allows the anime to avoidanimating, with his use of smokes and screens to evade and bamboozle his enemies. It is a clever trick, both literally and figuratively. Mostly, though, the show tends to lean on minimum animation due to the huge amount of dialogue that is exchanged and thus is subpar in this specific category.CHARACTERSTo reiterate, Rokka no Yuusha is technically not character-driven but that does not stop the anime from continuing its upward spiral.A correlation between the screen-time per cast member and the extent to which they are expounded can be established, with Adlet once again receiving the most attention and Goldof receiving the least. Even so, Adlet’s history is not wholly elaborated; the audience is shown his home village and small snippets of his training, but it is not enough to say that the viewer knows Adlet as a person. In other words, since little is known about Adlet – the star of the show and the one at the top of the spectrum – logic dictates that even less is known about everyone else. This is true: Flamie is a half-human, half-fiend with mommy-issues, Nashetania is a princess, Hans is a catlike thief, Maura is the Saint of Mountains, Chamot is practically Maura’s child, and Goldof listens to nobody but Nashetania. Hyperboles, but almost nothing else is given about the characters.It is hard to say whether or not Rokka no Yuusha deters from showing much about its characters because it has to or because it wants to. The former is enticing since it is a natural byproduct of the structure of the cast. Its size, its diversity, and its need to center on Adlet would make it seem obvious that the majority of the characters would earn little focus. The latter, however, is not that farfetched due to the anime’s distinct pattern of refraining from detailing key information about the characters. Flamie’s origins and her mother are never shown despite her talking about them and being a large influence on her. The anime chose not to depict Hans, Maura, and Chamot’s trek to the tower, instead focusing on Adlet and his route, and in the process reducing explanations on the previous three. Goldof is no different, whose outing before meeting up with Nashetania is only described in words. Nashetania as well, her only non-Brave dealings occurring as a personal aside with Adlet very early on and minute conversations at a campsite. The pattern is an inversion – instead of the cast not having much about them because it was impossible to include it was done purposefully.The legitimacy of this pattern is concerning, but not when it aligns with each of the other topics. The story uses inversion and the art uses inversion, so it is feasible to assume that the characters would use inversion as well. More profound is, like the story and the art, the inversion is another means to increase its mystery motif. A character is mysterious when his or her past is unknown, and since almost everyone’s past is, the mysteriousness ramps up further.Mystery persists in the characters, so thematically something is going on with them. The cast is saying something without really saying it. That message: “do not judge a book by its cover.” Just because someone looks a certain way, acts a certain way, or comes from a certain background does not immediately make that person a stranger or a weirdo. Of course, this may be the case – Flamie fits this description to a degree, as does Hans. But it is like the story’s theme on people sometimes being right; sometimes, that person is not who they are perceived as being. The half-fiend is more human than anyone in the group. The sarcastic assassin is incredibly friendly. The small child is undeniably powerful. The leader-like lady is arrogant and stubborn. The guard dog is devoted yet extremely narrow-minded. The sexy, harmless royalty is the mastermind controlling the strings. The scrawny, slow, and smiling scientist is “the strongest man in the world.” The whole cast exemplifies the idea that a precursory glance of a person is not enough. It is unfair to judge someone based on their outer, public qualities when their inner, private ones reveal infinitely more about who that person happens to be.That is to say, the biggest mystery in Rokka no Yuusha are the characters themselves.SOUNDThe main opening theme continues the mystery, with the start of the track an ominous set of tones. It morphs into hard guitar and hard note shifts to increase the foreboding sense. All the while the vocalist is working overtime alongside the drummer. The piece ends how it started, with a trailing tone that is simultaneously chilling and creepy. As for the main ending theme, it oozes regret at the start with the singer’s slow singing. However the piece gradually picks up in tempo and spirits, finishing happy where it began sad. Its visuals reveal the meaning: it is a piece symbolizing Adlet’s life. The track itself is strong but seemingly has no place among the mystery it touts.That is, until the other OPs and EDs that Rokka no Yuusha incorporates into the mix are investigated. “Cry for the Truth” is adventurous, “Dance in the Fake” is, like Adlet, Nashetania’s piece and almost horror-sounding (relevant as more is discovered), and “Nameless Heart” is, like Adlet and Nashetania, Flamie’s piece and filled with longing and melancholy. These tracks as well fail to follow the mystery motif, instead aiming for separate emotions altogether. Remarkably, like the story, the art, and the characters, this is a type of inversion once more – not focusing on mystery actually gains more of it. To put it differently, switching between different OPs and EDs, each with various feelings and vibes, causes disarray, leading to convolution and therefore more mystery. Inversion is a technique the anime used throughout its other elements, so it being here as well is simply intelligent.The remainder of the soundtrack is heavy on the violin, multiple different arrangements unified with other instruments to achieve the right effect of drama or tenseness. The byproduct per usual is an increase in mystery. Pianos and harps fill the rest of the gaps to accentuate the more depressing and more uplifting moments, offsetting the mysteriousness and thus accentuating it, too. So while many of the pieces lack strength or memorability, some at least find themselves fitting within the themes of the show.Finally, voice acting sees above average performances across the board. Soma Saito as Adlet does well, giving Adlet a young yet mature voice that fits his mantras and passions well. Aoi Yuuki as Flamie hits the bullseye with her quiet voice, one filled with misunderstanding and pain, a perfect match for the broken woman. And Kenichi Suzumura as Hans nails the “Nyaa!” each time Hans opened his mouth, crafting Hans into the playful guy that he is. Together, the voice actors and actresses fit their respective roles nicely, thereby improving the overall execution of the anime.ENJOYMENTRemember those Grasshopper cookies? It turned out that there was no culprit, there was nobody to blame. The cookies were mistakenly misplaced in a cupboard, hidden away to prevent me from finding them in the first place. The cookie culprit did not exist to begin with. But those twenty or so minutes, where me, my parents, and my siblings were flinging accusations and fighting arguments felt real. It was an interrogation of familial proportions, with each of us throwing one another under the bus to escape scrutiny.That is what this anime does so well, capturing the whodunit atmosphere nearly perfectly. It got me involved, shouting at my screen “Yea, screw him!” or “Do not believe her lies!” because I cared about certain characters, believing in them and their words just as I believed in myself and my convictions with those cookies. I was double-guessing, crafting theories, and collecting evidence, all in an attempt to out the seventh Brave, as a sort of redemption for how I failed those many years ago.And it was fun. I tensed up when Maura was ganging up on Adlet with everyone else, I was pumping my fist when Flamie opened herself up gradually, and I was smiling right along with Adlet each and every time he called himself the “strongest man in the world.” I audibly laughed when Adlet kicked Nashetania square in the face, because I knew that that bunny bimbo had it coming to her. Watching Flamie blush because she was having trouble processing her own feelings was wonderful to see as well. But my favorite part was Adlet’s tiny speech near the end, because it is true: no other man but he could have done the impossible. Each episode had these small moments of triumph and turmoil that made the mystery not just something the cast was experiencing but I and the rest of the anime community were experiencing, too.With Braves, Fiends, and Saints, Rokka no Yuusha leaves its mark. An interesting story, an intriguing bunch of characters, and an immersing set of sounds lay the groundwork for the show, but it is its ability to reach out and grab the audience, making them a part of the tale, that makes the anime as powerful as it is. And like a Grasshopper cookie, it is definitely worth a bite or two.SUMMARYStory: Great, exposition, intermittent action, and uneven character screen-time add up to a high amount of mystery, with its theme on trusting others growing from said mysteryAnimation: Good, purposeful art makes more mystery, subpar CG, fantastic character designs, and below average to average actual animationCharacters: Good, while the cast is expounded on minimally, this increases the mystery levels once more while also providing a nice theme of “do not judge a book by its cover”Sound: Good, a helping of good OPs and EDs that continue to increase the mystery motif, with an okay OST, and above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, the whodunit atmosphere, the smaller scenes, and the ability to rope the audience in make it not just an anime but an entire experienceFinal Score: 8/10 the size of an Oreo, taking up roughly the same diameter as a circle formed when you put the tip of your forefinger onto the tip of your thumb. Their outsides are slightly ridged so that, should you put two together, you could make your own cogged contraption. Most important of all, they have the perfect balance of chocolate and mint, their insides filled not with grasshoppers but with a fudge-filled wafer. Girl Scout Thin Mints are dirt compared to the mighty Grasshopper.I loved these cookies growing up (I still do), and being the slightly selfish teenager that I was, I would make it my mission to sneak them up to my room during the night to have them all to myself. Sometimes I would confiscate the entire package and hide the remainder that I did not eat in one sitting under my bed, to be consumed at a later date.This would come back to bite me because, one day, the Grasshoppers had gone missing and, my family knowing of my theft-like tendencies, immediately accused me. I had not touched this round of cookies, but it was all I could do to persuade them. I tried pinning it on my father, a famous late-night snack-eater. My mother “smelt it and therefore dealt it,” my sister was prone to sneaking food throughout the day, and my brother actually avoided them but we all knew that was the perfect cover-up. By the end of our meal I was still the prime suspect, the cookie culprit never discovered. I remembered this small snapshot of my life after watching Rokka no Yuusha, an anime centering on a potentially false accusation. But instead of about cookies it was about people and instead of a dull dinner it was instead a thrilling ride from start to finish.STORYRokka no Yuusha, at its core, is not a plot-driven anime. An overarching and overdone tale of “good guys go to defeat the big bad guy” exists and is the underlying motive for the whole group, but the immediacy of achieving it is not present. The anime is not even character-driven. Due to the large size of the cast, little time is available to delve into the past of the people at play. Rokka no Yuusha understands this, therefore placing emphasis on the inverse of plot and characters. That is, the show focuses on everything else, the unknown elements and the mystery of the situation.To be clear, a narrative and a set of people are around, but that is not what the anime is technically trying to target. One of the first signs of this seemingly misplaced focus is the dialogue. Rokka no Yuusha is heavy on the speaking, with characters entering monologues, longwinded explanations, and personal epithets. Considering that the majority of the events happen over the course of a day or two, conversations sometimes last hours, the cast exchanging ideas, anecdotes, and theories instead of worrying about the looming threat before them.Despite the massive amount of talking that goes on, nothing is ever “said,” no important information is ever gained. Little is learned about the world, characters’ lives are rarely expounded on, and often times the words themselves are incorrect. The dialogue, coincidentally, is fog, cloaking the truth and veiling the answer to the mystery with lies and deceit.But it is not all exposition. Truth be told, anime (indeed most narratives) are not keen on having solely dialogue. It can be done but it requires careful planning and the correct context. Thus, shows opt for a rising and falling of action, with Rokka no Yuusha being no different. It breaks up the potential monotony of continuous talking with action-heavy scenes. A brawl against puked up amoebas here, a chase through the foliage there. Action of this magnitude deviates from the norm, drama and tension replacing comfortability and familiarity.However the fights, like the dialogue, do not contain a singular purpose. Their main goal is to once again cloak what should be made clear, heightening the mystery in an indirect manner. When a battle starts, the characters, and by extension the audience, are forced to keep the conundrum on the wayside, subsequently stopping the secrets from surfacing. This red light continues for the duration of the skirmish, at which point the green light is turned back on and everyone – the characters and the audience – are permitted to think about the solution. It is an artificial device in the sense that a fight can, and most often does, breakout at convenient moments, but it ultimately feels natural due to the gravity of the problem, the weight of the decisions made, and the force of the actions taken.The combination of leveled dialogue and tense action is a roller coaster, the audience riding a sinusoidal wave, the crest a flurry of swords and the trough a detailing of magical wooden stakes. The cycle varies; battles, like their discussion counterpart, ranging in length from a quick knife throw to a prolonged feud. Sometimes the wave stands, with sentences becoming spears to insult or insinuate another and vice versa. But what happens during the middle section from high to low or low to high? Those transitional sections are as important as the exposition and battles, with “transition” the operative word: a transition in character focus. In other words, the anime mixes up the cast, providing appropriate screen-time for the people involved.It is important to understand the allocation of screen-time varies and is not uniform, with the frequency of appearance different for each person. Visualizing a spectrum, Adlet, the star, occupies the top and Goldof, with nothing to his name but a crush, occupies the bottom, with everyone else in-between. Seemingly tangential, the screen-time of the characters finds relevancy precisely because it differs from person to person. Had everyone acquired similar time onscreen, such an aspect could be discounted, however since everyone had dissimilar time onscreen, it becomes yet another factor that needs to be taken into consideration when investigating the mystery.Is it Hans, who was absent in the beginning but had a large presence in the middle of the season? Is it Flamie, who would switch in and out with the other Braves? Or is it really Adlet, whose massive amount compared to everyone else was meant to impose a false sense of security? Arguably it had to end up this way – the size of the cast demands that some characters will inevitably gain more screen-time than others. But Rokka no Yuusha uses this inevitable detriment to its advantage, propagating the mystery that much further.The mystery is evidently and thoroughly supported – it is a motif that finds strength in nearly all aspects of the anime. But the thematic presence is equally as important, with the themes emerging from the mysteriousness of it all. A simple view would be that an action should not be undertaken until all possible angles are taken into consideration. The viewer sees firsthand how assumptions lead to infighting and incorrect conclusions when Adlet is blamed for everything unfairly before all outlets are explored, meaning that the mystery showcases a perfect example of what not to do in a similar situation. A better view builds off the previous: people are sometimes wrong.People make mistakes, people are not infallible. Doubly so if the issue at hand is inherently mysterious. It is common for people to think critically about a problem, and even after considering every angle, he or she might still be wrong. Flamie, Hans, and Maura succumb to this reality when they admit their erroneous attacks. Interestingly, Adlet, the self-proclaimed “strongest man in the world,” encounters this notion as well, where his conjectures often led to dead ends. Granted this situation is direr than normal, with individual mistakes potentially ending in the loss of life, meaning it does not directly correlate to the real world. However it is still a nice guide for this type of thinking since it demonstrates why these mistakes happen and what these mistakes create.The best view, though, is Rokka no Yuusha’s forte: the inverse. That is, people are sometimes right. It is surprisingly difficult to place trust in another person, believing what he or she has to say without reservation. Such difficulty arises from the inability to get inside the head of another person – an angle from another’s perspective is impossible – and from the inability to accept being wrong – people hate making mistakes. Together it means having less faith in others.But sometimes that leap of faith has to be taken, gambling on the fact that the mysterious cloud that surrounds people is not always malicious. Adlet’s actions demonstrate this kind of willingness to find the good in others, with him aiding his comrades, falling in love, and protecting those close to him. The others do the same: Flamie starts to trust, Hans makes a friend, and Maura acts motherly. They all place themselves in danger by doing so, but the reward of tighter relationships and stronger answers proves taking that chance is no mystery whatsoever.While Rokka no Yuusha purposefully avoids the meat of its narrative and its characters in favor of everything else around it, the mystery it manifests and the themes it touts contain more than enough sustenance all their own.ANIMATIONThe art for Rokka no Yuusha is does not change much. To be fair, it has a nice amount of variety in the beginning of the season, where Adlet visits the Aztec-esque town and where he travels the countryside with Nashetania, visiting plains, sunsets, and mountains. It is when the real journey starts that the locations and subsequently the backgrounds start to stagnate. In essence, there are two areas: the ritual tower and the rest of the jungle. Again, to be fair, there is no way around this considering the dilemma. But this is not just passable plot-wise but also thematically relevant. The tower is a hub, a metaphorical “safe haven” amidst the chaos around them. Its stark blue interior also contrasts heavily with the green of the jungle, giving it a larger feeling of safety. The fog is a concealer, hiding actions, persons, and areas, increasing the overall mysteriousness. And the jungle achieves this effect as well. A jungle blends together, with one spot pretty much the same as any other. It can start to get confusing, disorienting those trapped within it; the perfect place for a mystery. That is to say, the art, like the story, uses inversion – one or two locations are not boring but purposeful – to increase the total amount of mystery. In short, the anime continues to use its own predefined limitations to its advantage.Sadly not every limit can be overcome. One of the show’s biggest grievances is the CG it employs. Simply put, it is awful. The Fiends – the natural enemy of the humans – are ugly, in both design and depiction. The former done purposefully to make them the ravenous beasts that they are and the latter done accidentally because otherwise it would make little sense. They stand out horribly in the world, their movements are choppy, and they look blocky rather than menacing. Flamie’s bullet magic and Nashetania’s swords use CG as well, however those instances are tolerable. For the Fiends, they are a blight, in the positive and the negative sense.All positive are the character designs. In fact, the character designs are arguably the anime’s strongest facet. On the surface level, they are imaginative – a flurry of colors, a myriad of outfits, and a stampede of accessories donning each person accordingly. Going deeper reveals how the characters’ designs follow the mystery motif. It might be something simple like Hans’ hair covering his eyes. It might be something more complex like Chamot’s androgynous and childlike persona. Or it might be something esoteric like Nashetania’s mirroring set of colors, the white signifying purity and goodness and the red signifying evil and hate. At the deepest level, their designs correspond with their personalities and development throughout the season. Flamie wears a flower on her cap, symbolizing the growth and flowering she undergoes whereas Goldof’s helmet represents his hardheadedness, his loyalty, and his delusions. They are an amazing example of what thoughtful character designs are capable of.Actual animation is unfortunately not amazing, instead a wishy-washy offering. At times, the action can pick up, with characters running, jumping, and falling throughout their battles. Choreography of the fights is standard, relying more on flashy maneuvers than direct impacts. Interestingly, Adlet’s fighting style allows the anime to avoidanimating, with his use of smokes and screens to evade and bamboozle his enemies. It is a clever trick, both literally and figuratively. Mostly, though, the show tends to lean on minimum animation due to the huge amount of dialogue that is exchanged and thus is subpar in this specific category.CHARACTERSTo reiterate, Rokka no Yuusha is technically not character-driven but that does not stop the anime from continuing its upward spiral.A correlation between the screen-time per cast member and the extent to which they are expounded can be established, with Adlet once again receiving the most attention and Goldof receiving the least. Even so, Adlet’s history is not wholly elaborated; the audience is shown his home village and small snippets of his training, but it is not enough to say that the viewer knows Adlet as a person. In other words, since little is known about Adlet – the star of the show and the one at the top of the spectrum – logic dictates that even less is known about everyone else. This is true: Flamie is a half-human, half-fiend with mommy-issues, Nashetania is a princess, Hans is a catlike thief, Maura is the Saint of Mountains, Chamot is practically Maura’s child, and Goldof listens to nobody but Nashetania. Hyperboles, but almost nothing else is given about the characters.It is hard to say whether or not Rokka no Yuusha deters from showing much about its characters because it has to or because it wants to. The former is enticing since it is a natural byproduct of the structure of the cast. Its size, its diversity, and its need to center on Adlet would make it seem obvious that the majority of the characters would earn little focus. The latter, however, is not that farfetched due to the anime’s distinct pattern of refraining from detailing key information about the characters. Flamie’s origins and her mother are never shown despite her talking about them and being a large influence on her. The anime chose not to depict Hans, Maura, and Chamot’s trek to the tower, instead focusing on Adlet and his route, and in the process reducing explanations on the previous three. Goldof is no different, whose outing before meeting up with Nashetania is only described in words. Nashetania as well, her only non-Brave dealings occurring as a personal aside with Adlet very early on and minute conversations at a campsite. The pattern is an inversion – instead of the cast not having much about them because it was impossible to include it was done purposefully.The legitimacy of this pattern is concerning, but not when it aligns with each of the other topics. The story uses inversion and the art uses inversion, so it is feasible to assume that the characters would use inversion as well. More profound is, like the story and the art, the inversion is another means to increase its mystery motif. A character is mysterious when his or her past is unknown, and since almost everyone’s past is, the mysteriousness ramps up further.Mystery persists in the characters, so thematically something is going on with them. The cast is saying something without really saying it. That message: “do not judge a book by its cover.” Just because someone looks a certain way, acts a certain way, or comes from a certain background does not immediately make that person a stranger or a weirdo. Of course, this may be the case – Flamie fits this description to a degree, as does Hans. But it is like the story’s theme on people sometimes being right; sometimes, that person is not who they are perceived as being. The half-fiend is more human than anyone in the group. The sarcastic assassin is incredibly friendly. The small child is undeniably powerful. The leader-like lady is arrogant and stubborn. The guard dog is devoted yet extremely narrow-minded. The sexy, harmless royalty is the mastermind controlling the strings. The scrawny, slow, and smiling scientist is “the strongest man in the world.” The whole cast exemplifies the idea that a precursory glance of a person is not enough. It is unfair to judge someone based on their outer, public qualities when their inner, private ones reveal infinitely more about who that person happens to be.That is to say, the biggest mystery in Rokka no Yuusha are the characters themselves.SOUNDThe main opening theme continues the mystery, with the start of the track an ominous set of tones. It morphs into hard guitar and hard note shifts to increase the foreboding sense. All the while the vocalist is working overtime alongside the drummer. The piece ends how it started, with a trailing tone that is simultaneously chilling and creepy. As for the main ending theme, it oozes regret at the start with the singer’s slow singing. However the piece gradually picks up in tempo and spirits, finishing happy where it began sad. Its visuals reveal the meaning: it is a piece symbolizing Adlet’s life. The track itself is strong but seemingly has no place among the mystery it touts.That is, until the other OPs and EDs that Rokka no Yuusha incorporates into the mix are investigated. “Cry for the Truth” is adventurous, “Dance in the Fake” is, like Adlet, Nashetania’s piece and almost horror-sounding (relevant as more is discovered), and “Nameless Heart” is, like Adlet and Nashetania, Flamie’s piece and filled with longing and melancholy. These tracks as well fail to follow the mystery motif, instead aiming for separate emotions altogether. Remarkably, like the story, the art, and the characters, this is a type of inversion once more – not focusing on mystery actually gains more of it. To put it differently, switching between different OPs and EDs, each with various feelings and vibes, causes disarray, leading to convolution and therefore more mystery. Inversion is a technique the anime used throughout its other elements, so it being here as well is simply intelligent.The remainder of the soundtrack is heavy on the violin, multiple different arrangements unified with other instruments to achieve the right effect of drama or tenseness. The byproduct per usual is an increase in mystery. Pianos and harps fill the rest of the gaps to accentuate the more depressing and more uplifting moments, offsetting the mysteriousness and thus accentuating it, too. So while many of the pieces lack strength or memorability, some at least find themselves fitting within the themes of the show.Finally, voice acting sees above average performances across the board. Soma Saito as Adlet does well, giving Adlet a young yet mature voice that fits his mantras and passions well. Aoi Yuuki as Flamie hits the bullseye with her quiet voice, one filled with misunderstanding and pain, a perfect match for the broken woman. And Kenichi Suzumura as Hans nails the “Nyaa!” each time Hans opened his mouth, crafting Hans into the playful guy that he is. Together, the voice actors and actresses fit their respective roles nicely, thereby improving the overall execution of the anime.ENJOYMENTRemember those Grasshopper cookies? It turned out that there was no culprit, there was nobody to blame. The cookies were mistakenly misplaced in a cupboard, hidden away to prevent me from finding them in the first place. The cookie culprit did not exist to begin with. But those twenty or so minutes, where me, my parents, and my siblings were flinging accusations and fighting arguments felt real. It was an interrogation of familial proportions, with each of us throwing one another under the bus to escape scrutiny.That is what this anime does so well, capturing the whodunit atmosphere nearly perfectly. It got me involved, shouting at my screen “Yea, screw him!” or “Do not believe her lies!” because I cared about certain characters, believing in them and their words just as I believed in myself and my convictions with those cookies. I was double-guessing, crafting theories, and collecting evidence, all in an attempt to out the seventh Brave, as a sort of redemption for how I failed those many years ago.And it was fun. I tensed up when Maura was ganging up on Adlet with everyone else, I was pumping my fist when Flamie opened herself up gradually, and I was smiling right along with Adlet each and every time he called himself the “strongest man in the world.” I audibly laughed when Adlet kicked Nashetania square in the face, because I knew that that bunny bimbo had it coming to her. Watching Flamie blush because she was having trouble processing her own feelings was wonderful to see as well. But my favorite part was Adlet’s tiny speech near the end, because it is true: no other man but he could have done the impossible. Each episode had these small moments of triumph and turmoil that made the mystery not just something the cast was experiencing but I and the rest of the anime community were experiencing, too.With Braves, Fiends, and Saints, Rokka no Yuusha leaves its mark. An interesting story, an intriguing bunch of characters, and an immersing set of sounds lay the groundwork for the show, but it is its ability to reach out and grab the audience, making them a part of the tale, that makes the anime as powerful as it is. And like a Grasshopper cookie, it is definitely worth a bite or two.SUMMARYStory: Great, exposition, intermittent action, and uneven character screen-time add up to a high amount of mystery, with its theme on trusting others growing from said mysteryAnimation: Good, purposeful art makes more mystery, subpar CG, fantastic character designs, and below average to average actual animationCharacters: Good, while the cast is expounded on minimally, this increases the mystery levels once more while also providing a nice theme of “do not judge a book by its cover”Sound: Good, a helping of good OPs and EDs that continue to increase the mystery motif, with an okay OST, and above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, the whodunit atmosphere, the smaller scenes, and the ability to rope the audience in make it not just an anime but an entire experienceFinal Score: 8/10', 'Rokka no Yuusha was quite a enjoyable anime to watch each episode kept me on edge. There are a lot of twist and turns that go on through out the story that will send you in circles. The characters are also interesting they help to keep the story exciting, the action scenes are well done you will see a lot o f tactics which is what I like to see instead of the usual mindless charge at your enemy kind of thing. I strongly recommend this anime to anybody whether you are casual anime watcher or a hardcore one. ', ""Rokka ni Yuusha-This is one of the anime that gets my attention in 2015.This story is more to adventure type which I usually doesn't watch it.Okay, the story is about six heroes who is chosen to fight evil which is the world's Demon Lord.They have to gather all together before they can fight the Demon Lord.The story gets better when they gathered at the place and found that there are seven heroes instead of six.It gets really complicated when everyone started to accused each other that one of them are the fake.So in my opinion, this series needs a 2nd season because there is...lots of misteries to solve and I think their journey is quite long before they could  fight the Demon Lord.Overall 9/10.The character are made nicely and the story is full of misteries that will caught viewer's curiosity.And also forget, the heroes have quite awesome abilities as well.So watch it right now, if my review is not good, I'm sorry because this is only my opinion. lots of misteries to solve and I think their journey is quite long before they could  fight the Demon Lord.Overall 9/10.The character are made nicely and the story is full of misteries that will caught viewer's curiosity.And also forget, the heroes have quite awesome abilities as well.So watch it right now, if my review is not good, I'm sorry because this is only my opinion."", ""Rokka no Yuusha is an anime based on a series of light novels by Yamagata Ishio. The light novels are still going too. There's also an ongoing manga based on the novels. So, in 2015 there was an anime version from Passione, a studio that also did Rail Wars & Haitai Nanafa, which I haven't seen, and nothing else. They haven't exactly been the most prolific of studios, but maybe that doesn't mean much. They haven't exactly been around for that long. And their few projects could be really good. So, let this serve as my introduction to them as I delve into Rokka no...Yuusha.Story:We open with our main protagonist, Adlet, interrupting an exhibition match while declaring himself “the strongest man.” Get used to that line, it gets repeated a lot. Turns out that Adlet really wants to be one of the Braves, six chosen warriors who are destined to fight the demon king. His little stunt lands him in a dungeon and, after spending a long time within, he has a strange dream and wakes up with the Brave's Crest on his hand. He shouts out that he's been chosen and gets rescued by Princess Nashetania, who has a Brave's crest on her upper chest, just below the neck. Which I'm sure is not a design choice to excuse her exposing her cleavage. The two run off to meet with the other Braves.The biggest fault with the series is that it starts out slow, looking very much like a typical fantasy story. When the series is a third of the way through they introduce a locked room mystery surrounding a seventh Brave where Adlet and his companions are trapped and have to find out who among them is an enemy. At that point, it actually does get interesting. The ending also does drop the ball a bit by promising that the continuation will regurgitate a major plot point from this series. Which could easily become repetitive unless Yamagata is very careful.In all fairness to the slow start, it is kind of necessary in this case. The series enhances its mystery by setting up the viewer's expectations for a very typical type of story, including having characters who look pretty readily suspicious, only to subvert those expectations as the series heads towards its climax. I will give the series credit, it is done in quite the clever way. I'll also give it credit for being excellent at foreshadowing. There are several events that appear to be just part of the world building or ordinary character moments that are actually important when the climax comes around and the series is good about treating them the same way they do the world building and regular character moments. Which results in a climax that's not telegraphed but has a good amount building up to it. I also will give the ending credit. It does stop at a good point with the promise of more challenges but with a huge one out of the way. It also does craft a sense of paranoia quite well with the seven characters being trapped together, not knowing which one is their enemy.Characters:Like the narrative, the characters are initially set up to look very typical but, as the series progresses, they start demonstrating facets that go beyond the archetypes that you'd associate with them on that basis. At least, most of them do. There are some who are a bit under-developed. Which isn't particularly surprising, given that there are seven major characters in this and twelve episodes. If there's a follow up series, maybe those characters will get more to them. And I will give the series credit that even the more under-developed characters get something that advances them above the usual archetype. Even if it isn't much. About the biggest issue is that the main romance feels a bit forced. Maybe the story develops it better in the stuff that takes place after this, but it starts really abruptly.Art:Take a wild guess at what my major issue with the art in this is. If you're familiar with my reviews, you can probably guess it easily since it's probably the complaint I have about art most frequently. Yes, this series has a bit of an issue with fan-service, giving several characters ridiculous outfits. Whether its Fremy's tiny strip of cloth covering her breasts while her stomach is fully exposed, Nashetania's fetishy bunny girl thing or Goldov's muscular stomach being shown in much the same way as Fremy's outfit, including a tiny strip of cloth covering his chest. So, at least its equal opportunity fan-service. On the positive side, the backgrounds in this are very well detailed. The monster design is superb. These things just look really cool. The action sequences are also nicely done, with smooth, quick action that can be really intense.Sound:The acting in this is well done. Saito Soma, Yuuki Aoi, Hikasa Yoko & Suzumura Kenihi all give strong performances and there aren't any weak ones. The music is good. It was done by Oshima Michiru, who also worked on the music for Fullmetal Alchemist.Ho-yay:There really isn't any.Final Thoughts:So, that's Rokka no Yuusha. As a whole, I really liked it. The subversive aspects work well. There are some strong characters. Ridiculous outfit design aside, the artwork is strong. It has really good acting and music. There are some things that could have been done better, but nothing too substantial. I'm actually really interested in the possibility of a sequel, just because a lot of the establishing stuff is out of the way and it could dedicate more time to fleshing out those aspects. That being said, my rating for this one is a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin. Until then, take care.

Lets do it!-Ok! Now remove all the demons!-Yeee... Wait what?Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE it, but it just didn\'t feel right not to start the review this way.Adlet Mayer is the ""strongest man in the world!"" as he-self proclaims 55 times (counted), and along with five other heroes he must defeat the evil demon lord that rises every 300 years or so. My bad, I meant with the other six heroes. No, no wait... I meant seven... EIGHT? What the hell?!Well, basically what gives the false first impression of a classical fantasy anime focused on...heroes fighting demons, quickly (ep 3+) turns into a detective game. Instead of 6 heroes gathering, 7(+) have appeared, and one of them is a fake working for the demons, that has trapped everyone, including him/herself, in a mist barrier. If the fake dies the barrier will disappear and the heroes set free to continue their journey. Aaaaaand barely 10 minutes after they discover this the heroes start blaming each other and looking for excuses to kill.Excellent animation (some people complained but honestly I don\'t get it, I loved it from start to end), amazing voice acting, a very intimidating story that keeps you guessing until the very end (and actually after the end) and extremely good character development are bound to leave you craving for more.FROM THIS POINT ON SPOILERS:Pros:-The protagonist\'s fighting style is what you would actually expect from an episodic villain in shounens, kudos engineering.-First time ever in anime history when the rogue/assassin character KICKS ASS.-The typical anime female overenthusiastic female lead material gets the shaft and instead the protagonist goes for the emotionless loli route. Kudos.-Flemie\'s voice acting when she cracks down in the final episodes. Oscar-worthy, will at the very least make your eyes moisten.-Everyone, EVERYONE is well written.-Excellent animation.-The hate is real for Nachetanya.Kons:-I could really do without Flemie turning slightly tsundere in the end.-The f@cking cow in the final episode. Epitome of bad character design.-The bromance between Adlet and Hans was fun but in the end it started turning a bit gay.-Quite a few wasted comedy moments here and there (for example when Adlet wakes up to find Maura above him instead of Flemie).-So the main problem was that noone clicked the right texture in the point&click section of searching the temple? Come on! That\'s just disappointing.Now that I think about it all my Kons are from the final episode... Heh.Overall: Definitely worth your time! heroes fighting demons, quickly (ep 3+) turns into a detective game.

Heh.Overall: Definitely worth your time!', ""The genre of mystery in anime seems to be a source that is untapped and scarcely utilized. Unfortunately, it seems to be for a good reason. Making a mystery that is well-written requires a lot of forethought, consideration of plot holes, and a compelling set of characters, hence why writing for the genre is difficult. In anime especially, which is undeniably conformist to its own tropes and studio-distinct styles, mystery is an element that has yet to be articulated in a graceful, intelligent manner all the way through. Rokka no Yuusha makes attempts at crafting a good 'who done it?' series, but ultimately fails at...creating anything of substance.What begins as an adventure story that is about to embark slowly comes to a close as a dull, slow-paced guessing game to pinpoint who among the seven heroes is the traitorous fake. The biggest problem that Rokka no Yuusha has, in regards to this development, is that there is barely any real mystery behind it. It is not well-crafted nor is it thought-provoking. The issue doesn't lie with the idea, but rather with the way that the idea was conceptualized and presented. Although most of the series is supposed to be some sort of mystery, you can easily narrow down your choices of who the traitor is whilst being only halfway through the series. The build up of the mystery simply never reaches a high enough peak for the reveal to create any impact upon the final reveal. When the mystery concludes it is expectantly very lackluster. To top everything off, the ending cliffhanger is eye-roll inducing and outright distasteful. I barely could sit through these twelve episodes, and I sure as hell would not sit through another twelve that follows the same ludicrous scenario.The characters of Rokka no Yuusha are very plain, which adds to the reason of why the series can't sell itself as a decent mystery series. Every character is distinct, but also very stale. The only character that I could even come close to liking was Adlet. Adlet, when keeping his delusional strongest man in the world spiel to himself, is somewhat of a refreshing character in the sense that he's not especially overpowered just for being the main protagonist. As a jack of all trades, Adlet uses knowledge, tools, and tricks to cover his lack of gifted ability. Compared to the other braves, whose powers all seem to come right out of their asses, he's at least interesting. The rest of the characters lack development and feel extremely shallow. Most of the interaction(s) between the braves feel hammy and very silly overall. For a 'who done it' series, which is dependent on its characters, Rokka no Yuusha only manages to gather a mundane bunch.Passione, a new studio with only a couple other works behind its name, unfortunately does not provide any stellar results in the visual department to help offset the series' lacking content. I am typically not a fan of 3D animation being mixed with 2D; it usually looks terrible, in my opinion. Nashetania's blades looking like plastic toys, the sluggish looking/moving demons, and Maura's power being a bunch of flying yellow squares are disappointing to look at, to say the least. There are also many instances where characters look very poorly drawn.The audio pieces of the series don't stand out to me personally, though the ED was fairly decent. Nothing in the actual soundtrack particularly caught my attention.Rokka no Yuusha aligns itself perfectly with mediocrity, leaving more to be desired but not finding any means to satisfy it. The anime isn't bad enough to actually be labeled as bad, but not nearly good enough to be classified as anywhere above average. creating anything of substance.What begins as an adventure story that is about to embark slowly comes to a close as a dull, slow-paced guessing game to pinpoint who among the seven heroes is the traitorous fake.

Blame him!', ""This review is more personal than critical on the artistic value and such, because that was how it affected me the most.From the moment I got started with Rokka no Yuusha, I surprised myself by burning through the episodes in less than 24 hours. Why, was because for a long time, I had become emotionally sterile to stories depicted in anime and movies alike. The most reaction any episode would elicit from me would be an occasional chuckle or cringing at how cheesy the events were. I stopped caring about most of the characters and just wanted a truck to plow through some of...them.That was not the case with RnY. For once, I actually gave a damn about what happened to the characters. Finally, I could watch the development of relationships between characters without shielding my eyes from the screen to avoid seeing all the oozing mushiness. Now, I don't hate mushiness. It appeals to my imagination that others make it where I failed. However, it should only be injected into story after the characters have gone through much hardship and difficulty to get where they wanted to.After finishing the 12 episodes, I searched for the continuation (6 novels and counting) and read the remaining story up to where the author has left it. I must say, I've never felt that much for personalities in a story in a long while. It was the same feeling I had when I used to write stories and think about the challenges I would put my characters through and the joy of overcoming each harrowing event. It reminded me of that feeling, and being reminded, I will pick up the pen again, even though the people who used to compliment my work are no longer close by. Because I will always want to feel that again, when your heart wants to melt and your senses overflow with happiness that you feel for the characters.It saddened me that the animated series didn't sell very well, and I promise to purchase an original copy if I catch it on sale. Lastly, I apologize if this is a most improper format for a review.*I got an original DVD :D them.That was not the case with RnY.

Well that is just me being stupid. Anyways, this is a review and I am reviewing Rokka no Yuusha. I won\'t keep you waiting so I\'ll get on with the reviewStory:The story was well told and how the mystery of the anime kept you wondering who did this and who did that was very fun. This review on a mystery anime might be a bit biased due to the fact I\'ve only watched a few mystery animes or have seen animes with a...mystery arc. In Rokka no Yuusha though, it kept me wondering, questioning and suspecting many characters. What does take away from the mystery element is the fact that the protagonist was already innocent since we the audience can hear his thoughts, but it didn\'t take away much of the mystery elements so I was still fine with it. So with the story as it is, I pretty much liked the pace and way the anime was going. Even the ending had a twist due to the one character being the least suspected when I was watching.Score: 10/10Art:The art was good, but it didn\'t blow me away as many other anime did. Though the movements and animation were fluent, it only based around one setting about 2/3rds of the series so it didn\'t take as much background work and detailing on the background wasn\'t that great. Still, it didn\'t put me to the point where I drop the series due to the terrible animation. Still it was good at best.Score: 7/10Sound:What I like about the sound was the sound effects of the anime. It fit through what was supposed to make sounds and it sounded great. The soundtrack were also good as it fit most parts of scenes very well. What I liked the most was the two openings. These openings were amazing as I always watched and listened to it every episode.Score: 9/10Characters:Honestly, this is the strongest aspect of the anime as it leaves you to see who is innocent and who is to be suspected to be the culprit. Having only 7 characters 2/3rds of the time, it lets you question and wonder who is the culprit of the so called ""crime"". It did have some twists and surprises. it definitely surprised me in the end and how they interacted with each other was fantastic also. All the characters are driven to survive and prove they are innocent as their life is on the line if they are to be suspected the most.Score: 10/10Enjoyment:I enjoyed the heck out of Rokka no Yuusha. It is one of the few anime where it misled me to believe someone was the culprit when others were to blame also. It kept me on the edge of my seat as I tried to figure out who was the culprit before the reveal happened. It also kept me going with the series as it made me run through all the episodes in one night.It was very enjoyable and I am hoping I will see a season 2 of this anime, because I want more of this anime.Score: 10/10Overall:I liked this anime a lot and I enjoyed every episode of it. I honestly think this truly deserves a sequel as there are 5 light novel volumes it can adapt.This anime made me thirst for more and led me to read the light novels. I recommend anyone to give this anime a try. It may not be the greatest anime you\'ve seen out there, but it is worth a try.Score: 10/10 mystery arc.

I'm writing this assuming that you have either read the plot or watched the anime.Story: 9The story about a bunch of heroes coming together to kill the evil king is one of the oldest, most cliche you can find, and it gets repetitive to some people. However, Rokka no Yuusha was different. If you're starting it halfheartedly just by reading the plot, then please do so. I did the same. Read the plot, decided the story was good enough and watched. But it pulled me into a complete different scene. I was very impressed at how the writer of...this managed to play with the mind of everyone, characters and viewers/readers alike. Absolutely astonishing.Art: 9The art was amazing. I've seen like it before, yet it's unique in its own way. They also did a great job in mimicking the light novel, which is always a good thing, since if you know a bit about LN, then you know they usually always look similar in the anime adaptions. The fight scenes were well done, although a little weird at times but still does a good job at delivering what we want.Sounds: 9I was so impressed!

Overcome with despair, the only hope left for the world is for the goddess to choose her six heroes, and send them on their great quest to vanquish this evil. But what will they do when a possible seventh and fake hero is hidden among them? As our hero becomes the prime target of suspicion, he is tasked with proving his innocence, or otherwise facing the consequences of death.When starting this show I didn't look at the genre labels, and therefor was expecting your...usual cookie cutter show where the heroes fight off the evil demon lord to save the kingdom. A story that has since become way overdone in both anime and especially in manga. But boy was I pleasantly surprised.=== Beware: Venture no further if you fear the beast known as SPOILERS===______________________________________________________________________________(Quick Plot Synopsis)Kicking us off, we are introduced to the main character Adlet Mayer, self proclaimed strongest man in the world, who is set on becoming one of the six heroes. In fact he is so confident in his abilities that he interrupts a holy fight taking place in front of the goddess, managing to get himself thrown in jail as a result. It is in there that he unknowingly becomes acquaintances with the princess of the kingdom Nashetania, another future hero. Adlet is forsaken to rot in a hole for the rest of his life as punishment for his actions, however this life sentence is interrupted only weeks after its implementation by the incoming invasion of demons, followed by his nomination as one of the six heroes.It is at this point that both he and Nashetania leave to meet up with the other four heroes. Along the way to the meet up point they find a village under attack, after evacuating the village, Adlet returns to the village to investigate for the supposedly left behind person. There he meets Flamie, another one of the six heroes, but also a notorious villain known for having slain countless hero candidates. However unbeknownst to him, he decides to follow her instead of returning to Nashetania. Meanwhile on Nashetania's end, she meets up with Goldof (previously her protector since their youth) and the two team up. Both groups come across a temple where at they are taught a ritual to help them in their quest to defeat the demon lord, a spell that will close off the kingdom from the demon world, but once it is activated, cannot be escaped from.Eventually both groups come into contact and Flamie is met with the attacks of both Nashetania and Goldof, however confident that Flamie is no enemy, Adlet protects her and manages to persuade the both of them that she is not dangerous. It is around this point (episode 4) where the mystery genre really picks up, and we are introduced to the concept of a seventh and possible fake hero among the group.______________________________________________________________________________Characters: 8Character Development: 7The cast was another case in which an anime presented me with unique and fun characters. All of them came from different backgrounds and because of this provided some form of differing opinion from the others; the princess (who seemingly knows very little about the outside world), the unknown man Adlet (comes from a background of sadness and tribulation), Goldof (servant/ protector, only duty in life is to protect the girl whom he also loves Nashetania), famous assassin Hans (has no remorse and is very perceptive), ...Each character with their own unique background means that they might prefer certain characters over others. The best example of this is when they are first faced with choosing who the culprit (ie. the fake hero) is, their person of choice is Flamie, seeing as how she is indeed part demon and would therefore have a reason to attack them. But after Adlet proves her innocent, all eyes turn to him. His history is unknown, he was the one at the scene of the crime when it happened, and has no way of convicting anyone else. What I believe might have made for another interesting plot twist was if he truly was the seventh/fake, and we watched the story unfold from the perspective of the villain. However that is not the case, and instead we watch as Adlet is tasked with proving his innocence somehow, all the while trying to avoid being killed.In terms of character development I was kind of confused as to how to rate it. Truly there wasn't much in terms of character development save for the relation between Adlet and Flamie. I mean there is also how Hans has a change of heart, kind of, but also doesn't. While he does accept Adlet as innocent, he doesn't do so out of the kindness of his heart. Instead it is due to the fact that enough evidence has been demonstrated to clear his name. The only other case would have to be all of the characters reaction to (SPOILER) Nashetania revealing herself as the culprit. This revelation is a juicy bit that could lead to some serious character development in a future season, Goldof broken and unable to believe eventually overcoming his disbelief to further an important cause, and other such situations.Plot: 9Pacing: 8I absolutely loved the story, people who say it doesn't work, and that there are too many plot holes never seem to provide me with these supposed plot holes that exist everywhere. I mean yeah sure the magic as a concept probably has problems, but that has nothing to do with the plot of the mystery, which is the meat of this story. When we are first told that one among the characters is the villain, we instantly rule out the characters who we have grown attached to: Goldof, Adlet, Flamie, and Nashetania. This trick makes us automatically assume that the actual guilty party (Nashetania) is innocent, making the reveal at the end so much more interesting. For the longest time, it was to my belief that Mora was the seventh, however it is also in my belief that the writers intended this as well. She is drawn up as someone who is authoritative, and once she has set her mind on the target, doesn't let up. From her point of view the only possible choice is Adlet, but from our point of view, we see someone trying to push the blame onto the character with the least possible chance. This in turn makes us dislike her character, making us more inclined to see her as the enemy.When the show finally reveals the culprit, you might be thinking to yourself I had my doubts about her, as I did myself, or you might be thinking that it makes no sense at all. Luckily it does an excellent job explaining how she is the culprit, and why everything makes sense. The only real problem that I have with the ending is her motivations, while I hope that there is a more deeply seeded reason behind her actions, the simple response of: it’s what I felt like doing, angered me.The show did a very good job with the pacing however I only have one, but still very big, problem. It took too long to get where the meat of the story was, for the first four episodes I was convinced that this was an action fantasy only, no mystery had been introduced until episode four. It is my belief that this is too long of a period (especially in a show that is only 12 episodes long) to spend building up the story and world. The show spent a third of its episodes on world building, episodes which could have been spent fleshing out the investigation, or adding more elements of mystery, and it’s for that reason that I was disappointed with how the show was structured.Art: 8Music: 8The art style in my opinion suited the show to a T, not only did it have a light elegance to it which corresponded well with the scenes full of dialogue, but also fit well with the action sequences that are to be expected of an action adventure. My only complaint was with the CG monsters. I for one am not a fan of CG and find that it is a way for lazy artists to get out of extra work. This is especially true seeing as how they are the only objects in the show given 3D models, making them jarring to look at.The music was nice, that’s about it, nothing spectacular, however I will make note of the fact that that for a short show they did have multiple openings and endings, something that pleases me very much (reminded me of the monogatari series), and made me raise the lowered grade.Enjoyment: 9I adored this show, not only did it surprise me with how well done it was, but it also provided me with a fun and interesting days watch. That’s right, while I usually don’t binge watch unless it’s a really good show, I couldn’t stop watching this. I can only imagine how agonizing it was to wait a whole week for a new episode. I enjoyed this so thoroughly it was the first time in a long time that I considered giving a show a 10 in terms of enjoyment. This was by far my favorite show of the summer season, with Himouto Umaru-chan trailing right behind it. If you have yet to watch this show definitely get on it as it will not disappoint you, and even if you don’t find it as intellectually stimulating as you would have hopped, I guarantee that you will still enjoy it.______________________________________________________________________Final Verdict: 82/100Hope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, let me know if you have any questions, comments, or want to make suggestions to help me improve my writing. Thank you very much and I hope you have a nice day. usual cookie cutter show where the heroes fight off the evil demon lord to save the kingdom. A story that has since become way overdone in both anime and especially in manga. But boy was I pleasantly surprised.=== Beware: Venture no further if you fear the beast known as SPOILERS===______________________________________________________________________________(Quick Plot Synopsis)Kicking us off, we are introduced to the main character Adlet Mayer, self proclaimed strongest man in the world, who is set on becoming one of the six heroes. In fact he is so confident in his abilities that he interrupts a holy fight taking place in front of the goddess, managing to get himself thrown in jail as a result. It is in there that he unknowingly becomes acquaintances with the princess of the kingdom Nashetania, another future hero. Adlet is forsaken to rot in a hole for the rest of his life as punishment for his actions, however this life sentence is interrupted only weeks after its implementation by the incoming invasion of demons, followed by his nomination as one of the six heroes.It is at this point that both he and Nashetania leave to meet up with the other four heroes. Along the way to the meet up point they find a village under attack, after evacuating the village, Adlet returns to the village to investigate for the supposedly left behind person. There he meets Flamie, another one of the six heroes, but also a notorious villain known for having slain countless hero candidates. However unbeknownst to him, he decides to follow her instead of returning to Nashetania. Meanwhile on Nashetania's end, she meets up with Goldof (previously her protector since their youth) and the two team up. Both groups come across a temple where at they are taught a ritual to help them in their quest to defeat the demon lord, a spell that will close off the kingdom from the demon world, but once it is activated, cannot be escaped from.Eventually both groups come into contact and Flamie is met with the attacks of both Nashetania and Goldof, however confident that Flamie is no enemy, Adlet protects her and manages to persuade the both of them that she is not dangerous. It is around this point (episode 4) where the mystery genre really picks up, and we are introduced to the concept of a seventh and possible fake hero among the group.______________________________________________________________________________Characters: 8Character Development: 7The cast was another case in which an anime presented me with unique and fun characters. All of them came from different backgrounds and because of this provided some form of differing opinion from the others; the princess (who seemingly knows very little about the outside world), the unknown man Adlet (comes from a background of sadness and tribulation), Goldof (servant/ protector, only duty in life is to protect the girl whom he also loves Nashetania), famous assassin Hans (has no remorse and is very perceptive), ...Each character with their own unique background means that they might prefer certain characters over others. The best example of this is when they are first faced with choosing who the culprit (ie. the fake hero) is, their person of choice is Flamie, seeing as how she is indeed part demon and would therefore have a reason to attack them. But after Adlet proves her innocent, all eyes turn to him. His history is unknown, he was the one at the scene of the crime when it happened, and has no way of convicting anyone else. What I believe might have made for another interesting plot twist was if he truly was the seventh/fake, and we watched the story unfold from the perspective of the villain. However that is not the case, and instead we watch as Adlet is tasked with proving his innocence somehow, all the while trying to avoid being killed.In terms of character development I was kind of confused as to how to rate it. Truly there wasn't much in terms of character development save for the relation between Adlet and Flamie. I mean there is also how Hans has a change of heart, kind of, but also doesn't. While he does accept Adlet as innocent, he doesn't do so out of the kindness of his heart. Instead it is due to the fact that enough evidence has been demonstrated to clear his name. The only other case would have to be all of the characters reaction to (SPOILER) Nashetania revealing herself as the culprit. This revelation is a juicy bit that could lead to some serious character development in a future season, Goldof broken and unable to believe eventually overcoming his disbelief to further an important cause, and other such situations.Plot: 9Pacing: 8I absolutely loved the story, people who say it doesn't work, and that there are too many plot holes never seem to provide me with these supposed plot holes that exist everywhere. I mean yeah sure the magic as a concept probably has problems, but that has nothing to do with the plot of the mystery, which is the meat of this story. When we are first told that one among the characters is the villain, we instantly rule out the characters who we have grown attached to: Goldof, Adlet, Flamie, and Nashetania. This trick makes us automatically assume that the actual guilty party (Nashetania) is innocent, making the reveal at the end so much more interesting.

I would highly recommend this anime if you were looking for mystery, A misunderstanding between the entire team, A brave man who soloed his own team and saved his life then reviled the Truth! With amazing backstory of course!This anime was full of surprise like the meeting which held in the Fog temple was the most intriguing part!  This entire meeting also reminded me of Among us 🤣 people voting for who is the most sus one & they thought it\'s Adlet! But he still didn\'t...give up and tried to redeem his name! And I really respect Adlet he truly is ""The Strongest man""! When he was declared as the victim he fought all of them alone of course he got his backup from Fermy, Hans but still I have to respect him for his bravery for standing up to them! If you watch the anime you will get what I mean!After watching the entire anime I understand now and I also understand what Adlet brave power is It\'s wisdom & Guidance! Each an everyone of them have something magic or physical strength but Adlet has nothing but pure skills which he learned from his master! Now I might be wrong here!The reason I gave it 10 rating is because of the amazing writing the writer really played with us! My brain was blown away by the amazing plot twist! The writer really put a lot of effort into it! At first not gona lie I was thinking it was Hans then Fermy and of course mora but then Adlet proved me wrong! It\'s also been a long long time since I watched such a beautiful anime, The sheer joy of excitement & of course these Goosebumps just made my day!And it also come to my attention that this anime was released on 2015 why isn\'t the anime continuing? This anime has potential why aren\'t they making season 2? It\'s 2023 now! I don\'t know even if there is going to be a season 2, I really want to see them discover & revile the mystery and of course defeat the Demon Lord! But it is what it is I guess! It will be really sad if there won\'t be any more season! give up and tried to redeem his name! And I really respect Adlet he truly is ""The Strongest man""!

It will be really sad if there won\'t be any more season!', 'Let’s make an anime where we get 7 heroes to gather up and defeat the demon god. Wait doesn’t that sound very generic to begin with. No one of them is a traitor, there is only supposed to be 6, so it’s actually a mystery on finding out who the 7th is. (The Video Review is up on my Channel, but here is the written)Story - 8/10The story of Rokka starts off pretty basic. As we get our hero Adlet Mayer has been chosen as one of six heroes to participate in a quest to defeat the Demon God. Now initially when you think trying...to defeat a Demon God, another generic villain name, you wouldn’t expect much of this anime. However by the end of episode 4, it is revealed  7 heroes have been picked, whereas it’s supposed to be 6. So one of the heroes is actually a fake and traitor. And so begins the mystery thriller on to find who the seventh brave is.The story initially starts off slow and uninteresting, because it’s just a generic quest for the first 4 episodes. After that, the story gets interesting and focuses on the theme of truth and lies. As the plot progresses we are given more hints on who are the seventh is. Because of the way it’s structured we don’t find out till the very end, so the mystery gets really dragged until the end. I can’t help but feel they the seventh very obvious, so to me if felt, like waiting for them to reveal my answer, and I was correct. However the ending, not to spoil anything felt like a dick move to the viewers. As they try to introduce a new characters, and let’s leave it at that.Characters - 7/10Because there are seven amin characters, I’m going to go through this quickly. Our main protagonist is Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed strongest man in the world. Well maybe the strongest man, but the most cunning. He is the main target of all the heroes to be the fake, as they all suspect that it’s him. So he is out to prove he’s innocence while solving the mystery of who is the real fake. Over the course of the series, I wouldn’t say he really develops, as he just pretty much plays a role in everyone’s development, but he himself doesn’t really develop. He job is to keep the story moving forward.The other six braves are Nashetania, a Princess of Piena and Adlet’s first friend and ally. Fremmy Speeddraw a mysterious sniper, known to actually kill potential breaves. Godolf Auroa one of the knights of the Piena Kingdom and childhood friend of Nashetania. Chamo Rossa, the youngest of the heroes and considered the strongest out of all the heroes. Mora Chester, a mature woman known being the leader of the saints of the temple. And lastly there is Hans Humpty an assassin, with cat like features.The characters with the most development is Nashetania and Fremy, as their past is shown more and their feelings are explored on when, they are out to kill Adlet. Hans gets some development as well, as he starts becoming more reliable and not such a mystery character. Only Mora and Chamo feel like they don’t developed at all, because their views don’t really change as the story progress. What I do like what the writers with the character is that, all them have a reason for being the seventh. So it does make the mystery a bit harder, but some characters are played out in a very obvious way that it shows whether they are the fake or non-fake.Animation and Sound - 8/10, 5/10The art style is pretty standard, when comparing to most anime, you won’t find anything to unique. But I like how there is a lot different unique character designs, which is really nice to see. And the show starts off with bright colours, but soon fades the colour palette to fit with the mystery theme. There is the one thing obvious with the animation, is the overuse of CGI. The CGI really looks out of place in the anime, and some of the monster designs don’t feel like they’re part of the world. Normally CGI are used for monsters, however Rokka also uses it for background and stationary objects, which really is kind of distracting from the characters. The animation is probably at its best when there is fight scene, and the action scenes in this anime is pretty good, if you can ignore the CGI in it, which looks out of placed. The fact that every character has a unique way of fighting, there is quite a diverse animation for the action scenes.The soundtrack is quite forgettable, there is no track in there, that is worth listening to on its own. The soundtrack is made up of a string orchestra, and they don’t play anything that really adds to the scenes, and is only there to fill in the silence. Because there is a lot of talking used to build up to the finale. The same cannot be said for the Opening Songs, as they really get you hyped for the upcoming show, with the sudden change in vocal style and pace. The Endings, although it’s nice they give a classic old touch, they aren’t really special and the animation for it, is kind of boring to see.Enjoyment - 6/10The enjoyment factor of this anime, really depends on how quick you’re able to solve the mystery. If you’re flustered, you might actually enjoy this anime a lot. For me personally since, I felt it was predictable, I felt it was drag to the reveal, since I kind of figured it out early. Not to mention the story doesn’t get interesting until the end of episode 4. However I like the action scenes as we got to see a lot of unique fights because of the unique variety of characters. And I would say there is some enjoyable moments in the build up to the end. But at the same time, I felt the end cheated me, even though I guessed right.Verdict - 7/10So for the story of Rokka, I give it a 8. The story may start out slow and the end feels like a dick move. I really liked the change to a mystery on who the fake brave is, as it takes us on a rollercoaster ride and giving us subtle hints on who the fake is.For the animation and sound, I give it a 8 and 5. The animation and art style is good, using the bright colours to signify it’s an adventure then transitions to a much more faded palette which fitted the mystery. The character designs are unique and reflects on the action as they all have a unique style of fighting so it’s nice to get some variety. I just wished they pulled back with some of CGI, because they used it a lot. The soundtrack is really forgettable, as nothing really is good or special in the soundtrack. However the Opening Song is really great, and gets you ready for the upcoming episode.For the characters I give them a 7. I like how they are unique and all have a pretty good reason for being the fake, making the mystery harder. I like the development for Nashetania, Fremy and Hans, the others not so much. And Adlet adds to a more unique protagonist, rather than being strong, he is just smart and likeable. However I would say his development is very minimal.For my own personal enjoyment. I give it a 6, because I kind of solved the mystery pretty quick and felt it was predictable, so to me it just felt like it dragged towards my answer. The action scenes are fun to watch, but the CGI can be distracting. Not to mention the ending may left me satisfied, because I was right, but it also left me bitter.So for the overall score of Rokka no Yuusha, after rounding it up, I give it a 7/10. I recommend this anime to people who are looking for some good action, as there is quite a number of unique fights, but also to those who love mysteries, it might be a bit predictable, depending on who you are. to defeat a Demon God, another generic villain name, you wouldn’t expect much of this anime.

Victory Baxter of the chill grill with another review my final one to be exact i\'m going to start enjoying instead of watching to just write reviews. This series has a light novel with about 6 volumes the anime goes through the first volume id suggest picking it up if you enjoyed the anime i will be picking it up myself if i can find it.Story- In the early part of the...anime the story is basically presented as gathering the 6 braves to fight the demon God very bland but then as the story goes in the main objective is to find out who is the 7th brave is aka the fake brave among the 6 there was one fake one and it turns into some Sherlock Holmes mystery stuff which at first i didn\'t care to see it but it was really hard deciding who the fake could have been because of the way the characters were portrayed but anyways fast forward and all it became really interesting hearing the dialogue and the back story of the characters which became the heart and soul of the series remove the fight scenes and you are still left with a really good story. I enjoyed this anime so much the story very well done i could have done without the many many cliffhangers but overall it has to be a 10/10 in my books.Art- It looked different which i liked not your generic looking shounen granted this isn\'t a shounen but still it looked different i liked the art style and the character designs for Flamie, Adlet and Hans they looked pretty cool as for the rest they looked good as well. It wasn\'t all perfect though there are some derps you\'ll see such in the final episode  like 2-3 minutes in you\'ll see derps many series have derps so its not a major issue.Sound- The music has to be best if not the 2nd best thing about this entire anime the opening is f*cking amazing they didn\'t need to change the 1st opening but they did but it was still really good the ending is good the ost is great as well the overall soundtrack is definitely hard hitting for action scenes the opening music scene and you get the ominous mysterious music when someone is being named a suspect for being a brave.Characters- One word ""amazing"" There are characters that you just love and of course some you hate but overall the characterization of the main characters just give you the feeling of ""everything is so good"".Enjoyment -  10/10 Due to the great soundtrack, outstanding story with many plot twists and characters as well as the animation in the fight scenes i will excuse the shit known as cgi that was in the series although very little still there but overall i found this series as being a jem in the entire season.Overall - 9/10 anime the story is basically presented as gathering the 6 braves to fight the demon God very bland but then as the story goes in the main objective is to find out who is the 7th brave is aka the fake brave among the 6 there was one fake one and it turns into some Sherlock Holmes mystery stuff which at first i didn\'t care to see it but it was really hard deciding who the fake could have been because of the way the characters were portrayed but anyways fast forward and all it became really interesting hearing the dialogue and the back story of the characters which became the heart and soul of the series remove the fight scenes and you are still left with a really good story.

However, when 7 people show up, all claiming to be part of the ""Six Braves"", everyone realizes that someone among them is a fake, AKA the ""Seventh Brave"".Story (7/10):The story is original, I\'ll give it that. It was different than lots of other things I\'ve seen, but similarly enough that it wasn\'t absurdly unrealistic. The one thing however, is that no one ever actually gets to their real goal.The anime shows in the first few episodes that everyone is clearly guided to...defeat the Demon God, but they all hit a detour when they get trapped inside the barrier. As the show goes on, it takes the entire first season (hoping there\'ll be a second) to get out of the barrier and reveal the Seventh.My only real problem with the story, is that they get too off topic from it. I originally thought it would be a story about trying to defeat the Demon God, but instead I got surprised with a completely new story.Additionally, the anime can go really slow. Even though it\'s only 12 episodes, the creators could\'ve spent less time in the beginning doing pointless things and spent more time showing hints towards the Seventh.Art (9/10):No complaints about the art, I think it is phenomenal. All the characters have their own distinctive physical looks, which I really enjoyed.The backgrounds are amazing too, although a lot of it goes to waste as you spent from episode 4 and on staring at scenery of fog and trees.Sound (8/10):The sound was great. The background music was all perfectly in place and added a lot of suspense.The OP\'s were good. The first one was mediocre, but the second one exceeded so far beyond my expectations.Chracter (7/10):My main problems would probably be the characters. None of the characters except Flamie and Adlet got any time dedicated to their past. The creators spent too much time showing Flamie\'s trust issues and Adlet\'s cockiness that no one else got any screen time.That being said, the pasts that they showed made me dislike Flamie even more than I first did. She was a stubborn, emotionless person, but it felt like it was so over exaggerated that it got to the point where it was unrealistic.Enjoyment (9/10):As far as my enjoyment goes, I really had a great time watching this anime. It made me want to know what happen and develop having theories of my own.Overall (8/10):Honestly, this anime was amazing. It is beyond words, especially if you love mysteries. This anime had me suspecting almost everyone at some point, even the main protagonist.My only regret is: now I have to wait for the second season defeat the Demon God, but they all hit a detour when they get trapped inside the barrier.

I never expected myself to watch this, but here I am; and this anime definitely exceeded my expectations.  Rokka no Yuusha is not the anime of the year, but it is a solid summer show that will make your brain think a lot more than a regular fantasy action anime for sure.Pros:-Extremely likable characters: Upon first inspection, the protagonist, Adlet, seems very generic.  He looks like someone who would protect everyone and would try hard to accomplish his goals.  He does...fit under this label, but I felt a difference in his character.  His arsenal and fighting style is unique and not needlessly overpowered.  His importance makes sense from his well-rounded upbringing, which includes science, making him pretty smart.  I also thought Hans was a great character.  His fighting style of knives appeals to me and he has a great deal of charisma built into him.  The final notable character is Flamie, who has an interesting backstory.-Awesome mystery: I did not expect the mystery aspect to be done so well.  I found myself struggling to figure out the suspect.  There was a decent amount of depth put into the puzzle and new factors were continuously being brought in.-Good plot twists and story overall: Plot twists made me gasp and hit my table a few times because they are very unexpected.  In my experience, I felt that the mystery would just end, but it was constantly being changed in new ways.-Great sound: There is a healthy dose of orchestral music and it made me smile and appreciate the scenes more.  Both of the OPs are extraordinary and the EDs are solid as well.Cons:-Inconsistent art: Some parts have a drastic change in art quality, that are very noticeable.  It bothered me because I was used to a decent level for most of the anime and there are random sprinkles of badly drawn scenes.-Lackluster action scenes:  I thought that some action scenes were decent, but there were times where I felt like this swing could have looked better or that dodge could have looked crisper, etc.  Certain camera angles or points of view seemed bizarre.-Troll ending: The ending felt forced and unnecessary.  I felt huge facepalm urges because my watching of the anime almost felt like a waste.Overall: 8.3/10A great mystery anime in a different type of setting. fit under this label, but I felt a difference in his character.

As I went into the series blind, I assumed it was another ""band together to fight the baddies"" type of show. Luckily, as I kept watching, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the story, music and characters. As someone who is a fan of mystery, it was quite entertaining trying to piece together all the subtle hints along the way until the mystery is revealed in the finale.The music was a great match for the suspense and action scenes, and was reminiscent of the scores from older...Hollywood movies with lots of great violin pieces. It encapsulated the tension and atmosphere of the show perfectly.Even with only 12 episodes, most of the main characters were individually interesting, or at least intriguing. It definitely leaves you with a desire to know more about them and their history. I particularly liked that Adlet, the main character, was not like the stereotypical overpowered, zero calorie, boring protagonists we see almost every season.While I quite liked the overall character designs and the vague Mayan influences, the animation has a lot of room for improvement. Poorly drawn scenes become more and more apparent as the series progresses. However, I frankly believe that the story and music were able to compensate for the art most of the time.Overall, Rokka no Yuusha was a very enjoyable and clever show with good pacing. The build up to the finale leaves everyone on the edge for the revelation of the imposter. It is definitely worth a rewatch to catch any clues you missed from your first viewing.

If I was judging this as a mystery anime, then it would get a 1, which is pretty disappointing because  I really liked the idea of this anime. If this was a mystery anime, then they wouldn\'t have spent 3 episodes shoving the same backstory down our throats and waiting til the 4th episode to reveal the mystery. And then they wouldn\'t have spent 70% of the time after fighting instead of solving the mystery.Story: 7Honestly the story isn\'t bad. I liked the premise...of it, but it was poorly executed. The first few episodes did nothing but shoved the backstory down our throats repeatedly, and after that basically came to a standstill where nothing happened but searching for clues.Art: 6The art isn\'t anything special, but it would have gotten a 7 if they didn\'t try to be so fancy with the camera. It felt like they did a lot of the camera animation just to prove that they could. For example, in the scene when the ""braves"" all gather for the first time, they are all in a circle and the camera in the center spinning around. That would make sense if everyone was talking, but only 2 people had anything to say, and it was rather nauseating to watch. But other than the camera work, the art was alright.Sound: 6The sound wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t all that memorable either. But I\'m not much of an audiophile so I\'ll leave this part short.Character: 5There are seven total main character for this show for a 12 episode anime. You\'re only introduced to 4 before the 4th episode, which would be fine if there was any character development at all. There wasn\'t however, so I ended up not caring about any of them. After all the characters are introduced there is some character development, but only for the only interesting character in the show.Enjoyment: 3I didn\'t enjoy this anime much. I guessed the answer to the mystery on the 2nd episode, and tried to pick up clues for the rest of the anime implicating that character as the 7th ""brave"", but unfortunately there was only 1 clue that led to solving the mystery, and it was shown at the very end. So the anime was more frustrating to watch than it was enjoyable.Overall: 3If you spend any time at all thinking about who might be the 7 ""brave"" based on the fact that this is an anime and meant to entertain, then it\'s really easy to guess who the 7 ""brave"" is. The reveal was also disappointing, as there was nothing leading up to it and there was only 1 clue that was revealed at the end.But as I said, this is not a mystery anime, so I judged it as an action anime.

Great...color scheme as well.Sound: 10/10Some of the tracks were just perfect. One of the battle themes, in fact, is stuck in my head even now. And the OP music style changed to match the mood, which was a great touch.Character: 10/10The character development is great. Being a mystery, the rapid changes, theories, backstories and facts all mix together, leading to a race of thought: well, this guy has this backstory, which might suggest this; but this other chap is unknown in this regard, so maybe he might be the one... And so on. The intrigue only serves to drive character development forward rapidly in an excellent manner.Enjoyment: 10/10I've always loved mysteries blended with action. This fits the bill.

In the first episode, it comes off as a adventure fantasy story about a very self-centered man by the name of Adley Mayer, but the anime actually turns out to be an unexpected and well done drama mystery more than anything else. Coming in, I expected a mediocre action anime that would end up being as bad as I thought it would be but instead I found it to be a fresh work that I hadn't enjoyed as much as anything else in a while. The story...ends up being very interesting and engaging and the only flaw with it that I can remember is that it hinted at another season when there has yet to be any official word at one, but here's hoping.There's a couple of CGI bits which look much worse than had they been drawn, although I suppose there might not have been a budget for it, but the CGI that was used was very out of place in my opinion. Most of the hand drawn works and the backgrounds felt good, I don't recall any quality tier animation either.I had no issues with the sound, I liked the score that it had but it wasn't anything too outstanding. Opening had a cool as fuck song, though.Characters were solid, I don't think any of them had any major issues, although I didn't like what they did with Fremy much. The characters all had interesting backgrounds (those that had them, that is) and designs and overall I feel like they did a good job with them.As I said, I really enjoyed myself with this little gem.

Based on enjoyment alone I\'m giving this show a higher rating than I usually do.The largest flaw I can see after completing Rokka is its completely convoluted attempt at a mystery. It gives you no chance to figure out ""whodunnit"" on your own and uses magic to explain how events came to pass. (even more annoying magic that you do not already know about)The second complementary flaw is how while Rokka no Yuusha is primarily a action show it spends its whole time centered around its convoluted mystery.Now I see these two major flaws and...several minor ones however I can honestly say I don\'t care. I went into Rokka with no expectations and was entertained on every episode. I feel the best way to enjoy rokka is to not have any preconceptions and to not spend your time trying to figure out a impossible mystery. several minor ones however I can honestly say I don\'t care.

The actual plot begins to take effect when 7 braves become caught in an enemy trap. As there cannot be more than 6 braves, this obviously becomes a problem. The anime's plot focuses on the aspect of mystery and suspense. Who is the 7th brave? How will our main protagonist resolve his conflicts regarding the seventh...brave?

In fact, when compared to many other animation styles that are showcased during Rokka no Yuusha's season, it looks underwhelming in comparison. Despite this, it still does its job and performs without harming the anime.Sound: 8The music for Rokka no Yuusha is certainly no slouch. The soundtrack for Rokka no Yuusha adds a lot to the intense fight scenes that the anime likes to present. It also does a nice job creating suspense and mystery, two things that the anime constantly highlights.Characters: 9While the characters are not wholeheartedly generic, they are by no means interesting. Except Adlet Mayer. Adlet Mayer's character makes up almost all of the character development in Rokka no Yuusha. In doing so, he becomes something highly understandable. He becomes someone who is viewed as intelligent. Most of all, he becomes someone who changes throughout the series. This change is very entertaining to watch and can get you really invested into Rokka no Yuusha.Enjoyment: 9I Enjoyed Rokka no Yuusha a lot. Its ability to create suspense was highlighted a lot throughout the series, making it really interesting to watch. The character that is Adlet Mayer is very unique and kept me very interested and excited to keep watching.Overall: BThe mean of the scores add up to 8.3. That is in fact a B. There are a few reasons why I decided that Rokka no Yuusha deserved the B it received. This has a lot to do with the execution of the anime. The anime's purpose was not to be a thrilling war anime filled with amazing magic and powers. The purpose was to create suspense, to be mysterious, and to keep the audience on their seats.

I know for a fact that there are a lot of skeptical mindsets when it comes to LN adaptations due to the fact that a lot of studios nowadays tends to fail to properly adapt certain aspects of said novels in terms of either missed dialogue or even the skipping or rushing of scenes all togetherRokka no Yuusha surprisingly does none of that....Not only has it refrained from skipping or rushing material but it actually takes out the time to adapt every bit of dialogue whether it be internal monlogues or conversations between characters. Moreover, there is such a great attention to detail as well as information about the world, characters besides the main ones, abilities as well as background informationBut that's not even the most surprising part....This entire season has literally revolved around something that doesn't even directly focus on the overarching plot of the story.....Usually in series such as what I just lightly mentioned doesn't even happen until much later on in the story yet alone having an entire season/volume be based around it and the great part is that its handled so freaking well!!!!! Everything from the suspense and intensity of the dialogue, straight up to the inevitable conflicts amongst the characters whether it being verbal or physical is just done to perfection.....There is another important aspect in regards to this but I will touch on that in a later segmentAll in all, albeit the story being generic on paper, how it's handled is anything but amazing.....You would think that everything would be straightforward but boy is that the biggest and most false assumption that anyone can even implyArt/Animation - 7/10This is easily the weakest part of and tbh the only major flaw that I see from this anime.....The evidence is everywhere and as such I shouldn't need to even pry on this matter however, there are some things here that are worth notingThe character designs are all very well thought out considering that this series takes place in what seems to be like a period of early civilizations and as such the characters all look like they belong in this time period....Lastly, even though the art tends to look bad for the most part, the animation however is still pretty decent and does a good job portraying the action bits of the series. The fiends all look pretty menacing and has that creepy factor going for them as well which is also goodSound - 8/10As with the character designs the OST fits particularly well with the theme and tone of the story primarily both of the OP's which might I add, all sound beautiful. The voice acting is also pretty good and they each seem to fit their respective characters very well (Primarily Adlet, Fremy and Hans)Characters - 9/10In regards to the other segment that I mentioned earlier, I wanted to save it for this particular section considering that this is the icing on the cake. Like with the story, the charters themselves are the standard archtypes/generic but that's only on paperIn short, this story is VERY character centric and as such, there is a lot of focus on every character with some getting more focus than others for obvious reasons as you dive further into the story....Another thing is that their personalities are all very diverse primarily because of their respective backgrounds for example our MC Adlet, Fremy and Nashetania.....There isn't much development for some of these characters, but they are written in such a way that they don't really need much of it at allWhat makes thsee characters shine even more is the twists that they all bring about and as such, it is quite evident that everyone isn't exactly like what they are being portrayed as (On purpose might I add considering future events both in this season and beyond) and that is lovely because it adds to the suspense and intensity week after week and what makes it even better is that the characters themselves are aware of this very same thing hence why they the way they do towards each other as well as showing the dynamics between them all....Another thing that I love is that plot armor isn't much of a factor here and nobody is truly invincible or that overpowered so the fear of shit hitting the fan is pretty highEnjoyment - 10/10For all of the reasons above....I am a sucker for this kind of story and to not only see every aspect being handled so well but have insane plot twists combined with the great character interactions and the characters themselves being very interesting in general all wrapped up in a very thrilling, mysterious and suspenseful plot is just wonderful....Also each character is impressive battle wise in their own unique and creative ways which is a huge plus for me considering that they all had to earn their strengthI want to give this series a 10/10 but taking my inner fanboy away, this is the most well deserved 9/10 that I've given to a seasonal anime in a long time falls under.

Reason, because I love fantasy in general, even outside of anime. So I went into Rokka no Yuusha expecting generic fantasy. As soon as the first fight scene occurred I could already tell that this was going to be interesting.And then the mystery kicked in. There are only six people chosen, but for some reason there are seven people there. And the show (unless you are cynical like me or you happen to spot the flaws in what a certain character says) does a really good job at keeping you guessing of who the traitor could be. I\'ll...be honest, at first I thought that they might through in the sort of ""but this time there the MC was chosen as a last minute surprise"" but it was actually a fake in their midst. And this is where it gets interesting.If there is one type of show that I like almost as much as a fantasy, it\'s a thriller/mystery. Stuff like Stiens;Gate, where you know there is something wrong, but you don\'t know why... Then Stiens;Gate you actually figure it out and it just gets all the more gripping from there... But this is a review about Rokka no Yuusha, I shouldn\'t gush about Stiens;Gate... But you see the connection?So... I can\'t really say much else about the story that I loved without spoilers, so... Maybe I\'ll do something elsewhere about it...Now the art style is what first intrigued me with this show, before even the fight scene. It\'s unique, unlike this animation studios... anime that shall not be named. I found it had this childish vibrancy that not only made the world look fantastical, but also made the setting that much more eerie. Also, props to being a show that does CGI fairly well (looking at you Bakamatsu Rock).Sound. Okay... so not sure what to say about this. The background music I didn\'t pay much attention to, and maybe I\'ll go listen to the OST at some point, but the OPs were great and the EDs weren\'t half bad either. There was no music during the episodes though that really caught my attention... But Cry for the Truth and Black Swallowtail... freaking beautiful OPs.Now, the characters are what really make this show great. There is the MC, the man who has Naruto\'s enthusiasm and the fighting skills to back it up. He isn\'t 2D either which is great, his backstory is interesting and you can\'t hate him... except when he says ""Strongest Man in the World,"" for the 50th time... Then pretty much every character except two have something off about them. One is an assassin (sadly, if you know anything about mysteries it\'s never the one who seems the most guilty, although nothing against Hans, he\'s is great), the little kid with weird powers that are disgusting hte first time and a... unique personality, the silent one who is quick to judge, then the other two. I don\'t really know how to describe Maura and Nashetania... They were the most interesting.Also, the cliffhanger right at the end. I won\'t say anything, but they do it so well that I want more but it didn\'t feel like a throwaway ending to hook us because it\'s unfinished (you know, like an EA game). I really don\'t care about this new problem they introduced at the end, I just wanna see more of these characters, AND THEY DIDN\'T PULL SOMETHING REALLY STUPID AND LOCK THEMSELVES BACK IN, WHICH WAS GREAT!!!Overall, I loved this anime. I\'m biased towards Fantasy and that sort of thriller/mystery vibe that it had. That\'s why my final rating for this anime is a Fifa/10, since it was rigged from the start (u mad soccer fans?)But legit, I give it a 9/10, because I thought it was a great anime with a rather unique concept (well, Deltora Quest lol). be honest, at first I thought that they might through in the sort of ""but this time there the MC was chosen as a last minute surprise"" but it was actually a fake in their midst.

While we all have seen the generic premise of heroes going up against a revived demon lord before, this is mere set-up for greater things as it hooks you with its mystery and intrigue. When a traitor is revealed to be among our heroes, the show proceeds to prove itself to be one of the better examples of its genre in recent memory.In terms of presentation the show is far from perfect. An area where the show needs to improve would...be the directing. Since the cast is trapped in one location for a majority of the show, it relies on info-dumps that could have been improved with flashbacks, symbolism, or creative cinematography. We’re treated to animation and designs that are cool in some parts and head-scratching in others. The setting draws heavily from Aztec civilization, a fresh and exciting new sight. The fiends that threaten the world on the other hand are horrible examples of CGI-monsters that simply don’t look like they belong. Thankfully the fiends are far from the focus, leaving us with a cast of unique looking characters.The soundtrack adds to the atmosphere of rising tension and doubt, something it accomplishes fairly well with both bombastic and chilling orchestras. During calmer moments the music steps into the background, allowing the world and characters to breathe, something most fans of fantasy and world-building will appreciate.Utilizing its mystery, the show has good reason to delve into each character, establishing just a bit about everyone since they need to prove themselves to be one of the heroes. Some limitations come into play since the anime only adapts the first volume of the source-material, meaning that only two characters get significant development, though it also plants clear seeds in other characters for the future. On several occasions the story takes the characters in unexpected and warmly welcome directions that go against tropes of anime, making them all the more interesting to follow.If theory-crafting is ever warranted, it would be in a mystery-show, and Rokka manages to engage its audience to the maximum with great use of tension and build-up. A show that takes its time to examine the mystery and give its audience the time to get immersed and spot clues gets a big plus in my book. Despite this, the final reveal and end might leave one with mixed emotions depending on the viewer.Overall, Rokka no Yuusha is a good starting adventure to an epic journey with room for improvement.  With characters and writing that already shows great potential it is hard to not want more. Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and twist-filled adventures. be the directing.

With characters and writing that already shows great potential it is hard to not want more. Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and twist-filled adventures.', 'Rokka no Yuusha is an anime that stood out to me from all of the other 2015 Summer anime. Most of the anime this season were either Echii, Action, or Harem, and some a combination. Rokka no Yuusha, though brought a genre that I personally enjoy quite a lot; Mystery/Suspense. The first few episodes would lead you believe that the show is a typical show about defeating a main villain with the help of your comrades, but you will soon realize that the purpose of this show, or at least this season is to solve a mystery.Other than the Mystery genre, Rokka no Yuusha also...incorporates good action scenes, romance scenes and even psychological scenes (somewhat). Though usually, adding too much stuff into one anime, doesn\'t turn out well, but in the case of Rokka no Yuusha, the anime eventually did decide on what genre was going to be its main theme, with the other attributes added in there for a better production overall.I will review this anime in four categories; Story, Characters, Production and Enjoyment. And I should probably mention that there are anime spoilers in this review.So... Let\'s get started.Story: 8/10At first the story of this show seemed to be about defeating the Demon King (oh God, that name), but it soon turned into who is the seventh brave. Though I assume that the real story is still to defeat the Demon King, but this season decided to leave that out, to create some hype of potential upcoming seasons. And I am completely OK with that. Finding out who the seventh Brave was, was the biggest reason I would watch this anime first on the days it would air.Rokka no Yuusha for me was just the right length for the type of story that it was. And for the fact that it only focused in one conflict after the first few episodes. Suspense was built each episode, and it was possible to make predictions for each member of the seven to be the fake. There wasn\'t an obvious answer until the later episode, which even then wan\'t even close to being certain.Each of the 7 were likable character (with the exception of Chamot), and the final reveal would be shocking no matter who ended up being the fake.The mystery component of this anime was its best. It was a witty way of going about things, and it worked really well, something I really enjoyed to watch every week.Other than that there were other components that were included in this anime. There was romance between Adlet and Fremy, which I found to be likable and developed just enough, for the length of this anime. There were some amazing character interactions, but I will save that for the characters section of this review.Characters: 10/10Something has to be exceptionally good for me to give it a 10/10. There were some vivid characters in this show and each of them were interesting in their own sense. Each of them brought an interesting component to the story, and I have no complaints in how they were handled. The ones that needed a backstory got a backstory, and the ones that were fine without one, stayed without one. A good example of anime that gave each of their characters a backstory is Akame ga Kill, in which none of the backstories were memorable, nor were they stories, just events, and the length is to blame for that. The only way to have each character have an interesting and memorable backstory is to have a long running anime, like One Piece.I am not going to write about each of the 7 major characters individually, because it is mostly all going to be positive critique. Instead, I will keep this short and talk about three character individually; The Biggest Idiot in The World, Half-Demon Inuyasha, and Yandere Princess.First the lead, Adlet. Some might think that Adlet is a generic hero from every other Shonen anime. But, I see Adlet as nothing more than a normal person, that is just talented and likes to boast about it to boost his confidence, very relatable for me. He calls himself ""The Strongest Man in The World"", because not only is he physically fit, but he is talented in all forms of combat.Adlet has trained hard to get where he got. He wasn\'t born talented like a lot of heroes are in Action anime, nor does he have hidden potential that he can unlock when the going gets tough. He also isn\'t dense and is outgoing about his feelings, (someone actually confessed in anime? Blasphemy). All this makes Adlet someone you want to cheer for, someone a lot of people can relate to and in essence a good likable character.And the love of his life, is Fremy. The half fiend born to a Fiend mother and a human father. What I like about Fremy is that she isn\'t a goody two shoes. She wants to achieve her ambitions and normal morality isn\'t going to get in her way, or so she would like us to think. She does have a soft side, which is always nice to see in characters like these. In the end through the influence of Adlet, Fremy does end up becoming a lot more softer, which is pretty much what you would call \'character development\'.Fremy\'s backstory was hardly explored in this season of anime, but everyone knows that it will be shown at some point in the future. As for me, I would be completely happy if it wasn\'t shown at all, only hinted at. This will let the viewers imagine their own perfect backstory for Fremy, which I think always works better for characters like her. One good example would be Gintoki from the anime Gintana, where his backstory is hardly explored, but everyone expects it to be legendary.Now for the last character that I want to talk in depth about is Nachetania. Yeah, she\'s a bitch. But that makes her so incredibly interesting to watch. She was my bet for the 7th brave since the time she destroyed those tablets, but seeing her deceive those guys, like some smartass, and then go Yandere on Adlet\'s ass, was one of the best moments this anime season.Nachetania was sort of a likable character in the beginning of the show, but then she was the 7th brave, and you realize that you wont see her on the good side again, mixed feelings really. And you know that because of all these opinions on Nachetania, she is a well written character.I would also like to mention her behavior as a princess. From a typical anime, you would expect Nachetania to be either super spoiled or super kind, but Nachetania was just super confused. She wanted good but didn\'t know what was bad. And her morals got a bit messed up, which again, made her interesting to watch.The rest of the main character of this show are also very interesting likable characters, but it is going to take too long to talk about all of them. One statement I would like to say is that they were all explored just as much as they needed to be. No one was given too much boring attention and no one was given too little.Oh and there was that other cow girl, The Saint of Blood or something. She didn\'t exist.Production: 7/10There were lots of scenes in Rokka no Yuusha that were animated beautifully. They were smooth and HD, but there were a lot of scenes that were not. There was lots of inconsistency too, characters would loose their face structure every now and then.There were no soundtracks that stood out in particular. They were actually below average in truth, but the anime worked fine without them. As for the Openings and Ending. Endings were ok, I didn\'t watch them after the first time because they didn\'t really catch my attention, but the first opening was amazing, and the second was very much not.The art style in Rokka no Yuusha was one of my favorite things about the anime. The character designs were all beautiful with the exception of Cow Girl that came in the end. This made the anime that much more worth it.Enjoyment: 9/10The mystery from the anime was the biggest form of enjoyment when watching this show every week. But there were lots of other things, that I have already mentioned; Character Design, Characters, Action and Animation.The show is very fun to watch. You are always left predicting who the seventh brave is by the end of each episode, while enjoying the events that transpire within the episode. Surprisingly the action in this anime, and the powers of each characters are also amazing. The powers are extremely unique, and the combat scenes are very fluid.It really is an anime everyone should watch. It isn\'t hard to understand but is smart at the same time. It has amazing characters, and a great mystery component. A must watch, for lovers of all genres.Final Scores:Story: 8/10Characters: 10/10Production: 7/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 8.5/10 incorporates good action scenes, romance scenes and even psychological scenes (somewhat). Though usually, adding too much stuff into one anime, doesn\'t turn out well, but in the case of Rokka no Yuusha, the anime eventually did decide on what genre was going to be its main theme, with the other attributes added in there for a better production overall.I will review this anime in four categories; Story, Characters, Production and Enjoyment. And I should probably mention that there are anime spoilers in this review.So... Let\'s get started.Story: 8/10At first the story of this show seemed to be about defeating the Demon King (oh God, that name), but it soon turned into who is the seventh brave. Though I assume that the real story is still to defeat the Demon King, but this season decided to leave that out, to create some hype of potential upcoming seasons. And I am completely OK with that. Finding out who the seventh Brave was, was the biggest reason I would watch this anime first on the days it would air.Rokka no Yuusha for me was just the right length for the type of story that it was. And for the fact that it only focused in one conflict after the first few episodes. Suspense was built each episode, and it was possible to make predictions for each member of the seven to be the fake. There wasn\'t an obvious answer until the later episode, which even then wan\'t even close to being certain.Each of the 7 were likable character (with the exception of Chamot), and the final reveal would be shocking no matter who ended up being the fake.The mystery component of this anime was its best. It was a witty way of going about things, and it worked really well, something I really enjoyed to watch every week.Other than that there were other components that were included in this anime. There was romance between Adlet and Fremy, which I found to be likable and developed just enough, for the length of this anime. There were some amazing character interactions, but I will save that for the characters section of this review.Characters: 10/10Something has to be exceptionally good for me to give it a 10/10. There were some vivid characters in this show and each of them were interesting in their own sense. Each of them brought an interesting component to the story, and I have no complaints in how they were handled. The ones that needed a backstory got a backstory, and the ones that were fine without one, stayed without one. A good example of anime that gave each of their characters a backstory is Akame ga Kill, in which none of the backstories were memorable, nor were they stories, just events, and the length is to blame for that. The only way to have each character have an interesting and memorable backstory is to have a long running anime, like One Piece.I am not going to write about each of the 7 major characters individually, because it is mostly all going to be positive critique. Instead, I will keep this short and talk about three character individually; The Biggest Idiot in The World, Half-Demon Inuyasha, and Yandere Princess.First the lead, Adlet. Some might think that Adlet is a generic hero from every other Shonen anime. But, I see Adlet as nothing more than a normal person, that is just talented and likes to boast about it to boost his confidence, very relatable for me. He calls himself ""The Strongest Man in The World"", because not only is he physically fit, but he is talented in all forms of combat.Adlet has trained hard to get where he got. He wasn\'t born talented like a lot of heroes are in Action anime, nor does he have hidden potential that he can unlock when the going gets tough. He also isn\'t dense and is outgoing about his feelings, (someone actually confessed in anime? Blasphemy). All this makes Adlet someone you want to cheer for, someone a lot of people can relate to and in essence a good likable character.And the love of his life, is Fremy. The half fiend born to a Fiend mother and a human father. What I like about Fremy is that she isn\'t a goody two shoes. She wants to achieve her ambitions and normal morality isn\'t going to get in her way, or so she would like us to think. She does have a soft side, which is always nice to see in characters like these. In the end through the influence of Adlet, Fremy does end up becoming a lot more softer, which is pretty much what you would call \'character development\'.Fremy\'s backstory was hardly explored in this season of anime, but everyone knows that it will be shown at some point in the future. As for me, I would be completely happy if it wasn\'t shown at all, only hinted at. This will let the viewers imagine their own perfect backstory for Fremy, which I think always works better for characters like her.

This review is going to attempt to be fair, but as you can tell from me giving this a 5, i didn\'t truly enjoy it.Well let\'s startIn the begging we have a hero who wants to be a part of the 6 heroes that will destroy the demon lord. I feel like i have seen this before. Anyways, these heroes all need to travel to the demon lords domain and defeat him! Except, not. As in the description these heroes get stuck at a temple. Except there is 7, so by good...assumption one of them is the fake. This is where I started to not enjoy myself.Story:3/10The background for this show and the history of the charters are well thought out. As they explain their history you can nod in contempt and approve. The problem is.... the rest of the story. There is almost 0 plot development TO THE MAIN Premise of this show. As you can assume, we find out who the 7th brave is. How ever during that journey the world stops. I mean literally stops. They get so caught up with finding out who the 7th is, that the whole demon lord idea is tossed out the window until the last episode where they FINALLY get to continue their journey. No more Fiends, no more anything. They are just there for 8 episodes figuring out whodunit.It turned from stopping the demon lord to a game of finding who stabbed whats his face with a knife in the kitchen. This story could be written many different ways, how ever the way it was written left me thinking ""When are they going to progress into killing the demon lord?""Art:6/10The artwork started off in the first episode as something eye catching. Looking at the stars thinking ""wow, some of them are twinkling and growing"" or ""The detail to the movements of the people in the cell listening to the story is a nice touch"" but as we went deeper.... the artwork started to fade. It remained acceptable throughout the series but, nothing like the first couple of episodes. There are moments when the artwork kicks back it but it just is not as constant.Sound:7/10The sounds where nice. Nothing too noteworthy however. They tend to use the same unchanging sounds for some effects, while others change infrequently.  Overall, nothing amazing, but it wasn\'t poor either.Character:6/10Oh... man.""I\'m the strongest man in the world!"" - if i had a nickle for every god damn time.... *flips table*Anyways. This catch phrase isn\'t just used at good moments by the main character, it\'s said almost ever. damn. episode. Minor pet peeve but lets continueI am going to break this down into 2 things.1)Character personalities:Most of these personalities are very cut and dry with no real depth.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have the strong silent type with a bad history.Speeddraw, Fremy.Something bad happened in her history which drove her to need to kill the demon lord. You find out what it is later.Overall 7/10Some flashbacks into her past would have been nice.

Starting off the series with him facing two extremely strong opponents AT THE SAME TIME we start to assume ""Man, this guy is a badass"". Too bad the rest of the series he spends his time looking like he is at the end of his rope, the burst of energy is lost in the rest of the series as he basically turns helpless.Overall 6/10Normal protagonist style character. protect the girls, protect everyone, I\'m going to be the best.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have the only interesting character (In my opinion) who talks like a cat and i couldn\'t peg his personality at all.Humpty, HansThis, this guy i loved. Spontaneous, random, interesting movements and quirks. His character blossoms in the series as your opinion about him changes almost every other episode. He helps our protagonist, he hurts him, he supports him, he attacks him, this guy is all over the place. however as the series goes on, you get to understand on connect more with him.Overall 7.9/10Not a normal character and very charismatic and memorable.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have the princess who doesn\'t know any better.Piena Augustra, Nashetania LoeiGreen behind the ears to fighting this girl willingly RUNS OFF with adlet to go fight but gets nervous before fighting ever happens.With all the screen time she gets in the first 3 episodes it\'s not a surprise she disappears in the rest of the episodes. Quite honestly i feel like she had the potential to be a fantastic character, but it was wasted.I cannot go into detail without spoilers, so i wont.overall 6.5/10Decent background, okay supporting roll. Nothing will strike you as memorable except for her BDSM style of clothing. What? Not like i am complaining about it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have the murder happy loli.Not much about this characters past is given. main supporting rollOverall Na/10Hard to rank a standard supporting roll, she does her job as a character fine and you wont forget about her attacks or powers. i can tell you that much.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have the manipulative Captain type.basically the mis-understood antagonist of the series.  You will spend most of your time wondering why she isn\'t dead yet, from your hate for her.No real history of her past. Mainly a supporting roll, really want\'s to kill the lead character.Overall 6.1/10Slightly above average as she managed to piss me off with her actions. Which means something about the character was done well. Power is hugely demonstrated once but then never reaches those feats ever. The first time was just for the shock and awe factor. Sad...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And we have the loyal guard.this guy ... barely gets any screen time at all, and seems to have an interesting past with the princess.That was never touched upon.

When there is, I become so pumped that I would wait until it's available on some sites!Anyways, the story was outstanding! Typically not what most of people would like.

You have been warned.Rokka no Yuusha. For starters, the Crunchyroll tags for this are misleading. It\'s tagged as ""action, fantasy, adventure,"" and while it does contain all of those things, that\'s hardly the genre of this first season (and I hope it doesn\'t get more than one season). This is essentially a mystery \'whodunnit\' anime in a fantasy setting with some action-adventure elements/scenes.What\'s the setup? In the land of Rokka no Yuusha, there exists a demon that lives on an...island. This demon cannot be killed, only contained, sealed, and put to sleep (at least, according to the backstory given). Every 300-400 years the demon re-awakens and begins an invasion of human lands, and at this time, the ""goddess of fate"" of this land selects 6 people to protect the land and re-seal the demon.Our protagonist is Adlet, self-proclaimed strongest man alive, who is chosen to be one of these 6 Brave fighters, which, coincidentally, is his dream/goal. After some basic setup story, we arrive at the designated point where the 6 adventurers are supposed to meet... only to find that a total of seven people bear the mark that shows them to be selected by the goddess. Moreover, it appears that someone, presumably the fake seventh Brave, has engaged a trap to keep all of them confined in the forest surrounding the temple that was to be the rendezvous point. Due to some unfortunate circumstantial evidence (that does appear highly suspicious from an outsider\'s perspective, admittedly), Adlet is suspected. In order to prove his innocence, disengage the trap, and get the 6 Braves out, he must determine who the fake seventh Brave is and how exactly they fooled everyone.A good setup, right? Done well, this setup has the potential to lead to Game of Throne-esque intrigue levels, with everyone suspecting everyone else and no one able to trust one another. Perhaps it\'s for this reason that Crunchyroll lists Fate/Zero as a related anime. In any case, I thought it sounded interesting and gave it a shot.The first few episodes were a bit slow, admittedly, but that\'s not the issue, as after all, we need to meet the cast and start suspecting everyone. Admittedly, it would\'ve been nice if there weren\'t a literal roll call scene, but the setup for it was both natural and believable, so I\'ll give it a pass.My problems with this show are twofold - the buildup and the ending.The buildup of the mystery is, in my opinion, done well overall. Unfortunately, it does mess up a few key things. For starters, the cast contains a character who is blatantly ""the shifty, suspicious one."" This almost immediately exonerates that person from being the culprit, as it would be too obvious. Moreover, nothing he does ever makes us suspicious of him other than his profession and his... sparse background information, shall we say. Secondly, for some reason, the show thinks itself clever by using camera angles and such to ""hint"" or ""foreshadow"" the true culprit. Unfortunately, to anyone who\'s actually aware of such cheap tricks, that just ruins the tension. Why would you focus on that otherwise perfectly normal (at least within context) moment if it didn\'t carry some kind of weight? It would\'ve been fine had you at least somewhat explained it away, but you didn\'t even do that with a throwaway line of dialogue. You focused on an otherwise inconspicuous moment for no apparent reason, either at the time or post de facto, which just screams ""plot twist."" This is further reinforced by how much they focus on the character who is implicated by that particular shot and their suspicious actions. And I apologize for being so frustratingly vague, but if I were to say or change anything there, I\'m certain it would be too easy to give away the ending. In addition to that, there were some characters with completely insufficient screen time and characterization to ever be the culprit. They could be eliminated by the time you get to the last quarter of the show, simply because to make them the villain would rob all impact from the twist. However, literally, were it not for these three things, the second more than the others, the buildup would\'ve been perfect. Indeed, even as is, I was doubting that conclusion I had drawn from that second flaw right up until the last episode - ""Perhaps it really was just a meaningless shot they focused on for no reason? Bad art direction is a thing, I suppose..."" - but then my prediction was correct. /sigh.Next, the ending. Even ignoring the Shyamalan-esque ""what a twist!"" nature of the ending, it was not an easy one to swallow. This ties somewhat into the above criticism of the buildup, but despite the predictable nature of the identity of the culprit, the manner in which they\'re revealed felt more like a deus ex machina. Here is some sudden new information, not available literally until this episode, that all but spells out who the culprit is! Aren\'t we smart. No hinting at even the potential existence of this information, it just pops up out of nowhere to close up the plot. And then, to add further insult to injury, not only does the story end without a resolution to THE DEMON KING WHO HAS JUST AWOKEN, which at least would be somewhat forgivable considering it\'s an adaptation (even if literally every single anime seems to do this ""read the manga/LN"" ending with no confirmed follow up seasons), but they also end it in such a fashion as to make the entire mystery of this season... utterly worthless. My reaction to the ending of that last episode was ""OH GODDAMMIT."" As a firm believer that an ending makes or breaks a show, this one definitely broke it for me.Final conclusions? It was definitely entertaining. It might be worth a single watch. However, if you\'re any avid watcher of mysteries, this one isn\'t going to be any mystery to you, and there is little to no rewatch value here. island.

Perhaps it\'s for this reason that Crunchyroll lists Fate/Zero as a related anime. In any case, I thought it sounded interesting and gave it a shot.The first few episodes were a bit slow, admittedly, but that\'s not the issue, as after all, we need to meet the cast and start suspecting everyone. Admittedly, it would\'ve been nice if there weren\'t a literal roll call scene, but the setup for it was both natural and believable, so I\'ll give it a pass.My problems with this show are twofold - the buildup and the ending.The buildup of the mystery is, in my opinion, done well overall. Unfortunately, it does mess up a few key things. For starters, the cast contains a character who is blatantly ""the shifty, suspicious one."" This almost immediately exonerates that person from being the culprit, as it would be too obvious. Moreover, nothing he does ever makes us suspicious of him other than his profession and his... sparse background information, shall we say. Secondly, for some reason, the show thinks itself clever by using camera angles and such to ""hint"" or ""foreshadow"" the true culprit. Unfortunately, to anyone who\'s actually aware of such cheap tricks, that just ruins the tension. Why would you focus on that otherwise perfectly normal (at least within context) moment if it didn\'t carry some kind of weight? It would\'ve been fine had you at least somewhat explained it away, but you didn\'t even do that with a throwaway line of dialogue. You focused on an otherwise inconspicuous moment for no apparent reason, either at the time or post de facto, which just screams ""plot twist."" This is further reinforced by how much they focus on the character who is implicated by that particular shot and their suspicious actions. And I apologize for being so frustratingly vague, but if I were to say or change anything there, I\'m certain it would be too easy to give away the ending. In addition to that, there were some characters with completely insufficient screen time and characterization to ever be the culprit. They could be eliminated by the time you get to the last quarter of the show, simply because to make them the villain would rob all impact from the twist. However, literally, were it not for these three things, the second more than the others, the buildup would\'ve been perfect. Indeed, even as is, I was doubting that conclusion I had drawn from that second flaw right up until the last episode - ""Perhaps it really was just a meaningless shot they focused on for no reason? Bad art direction is a thing, I suppose..."" - but then my prediction was correct. /sigh.Next, the ending. Even ignoring the Shyamalan-esque ""what a twist!"" nature of the ending, it was not an easy one to swallow. This ties somewhat into the above criticism of the buildup, but despite the predictable nature of the identity of the culprit, the manner in which they\'re revealed felt more like a deus ex machina. Here is some sudden new information, not available literally until this episode, that all but spells out who the culprit is! Aren\'t we smart. No hinting at even the potential existence of this information, it just pops up out of nowhere to close up the plot. And then, to add further insult to injury, not only does the story end without a resolution to THE DEMON KING WHO HAS JUST AWOKEN, which at least would be somewhat forgivable considering it\'s an adaptation (even if literally every single anime seems to do this ""read the manga/LN"" ending with no confirmed follow up seasons), but they also end it in such a fashion as to make the entire mystery of this season... utterly worthless. My reaction to the ending of that last episode was ""OH GODDAMMIT."" As a firm believer that an ending makes or breaks a show, this one definitely broke it for me.Final conclusions? It was definitely entertaining. It might be worth a single watch. However, if you\'re any avid watcher of mysteries, this one isn\'t going to be any mystery to you, and there is little to no rewatch value here.', 'THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON MY PURE OPINION.

It\'s not a familiar title; I\'ve never heard of it until I saw one of the characters (Fremy/Flamie) on Google Images. Originally a light novel series, this anime adaption is outstanding art-wise, and does follow rather closely to the first novel thus far for the first season. However, even for only 12 full episodes and adapting the first novel, be prepared for a lack of... action, per se. In other words, you\'ll be left feeling like nothing happened by the end of the season, and hopefully, the anime will continue to...future seasons according to the novels.I\'ve read a blog post translated into English basically summarizing each light novel in long paragraphs, so I basically spoiled myself silly before watching the anime. The anime itself is quite clear and well-executed, and reminds me a bit of SAO, Danganronpa, and the like.

The reason for this is because there are apparently supposed to be six of them chosen to defeat an enemy force, but seven meet. You\'d think that the problem would be solved within an episode or two, maybe three at most, but it drags on for 12 episodes. Unfortunately, that causes the feeling that nothing is happening, when there are things that are happening, like the characters showing their powers by battling against each other and such. The quality too slips midway, and that\'s such a shame to me because I enjoyed the first episodes. The OP and ED are also not memorable, as they\'ve really easily slipped past my mind. Lastly, the characters may look pretty, but most of them serve as plot devices, either moving forward the story or holding it back. It\'s very tiring.P R O SDespite the lack in plot, which I\'ve explained the reason in the ""premise,"" the anime still incorporates a shroud of mystery and requires some brain power to piece things together without making many things seem obvious.

The only problem with it is how dragged it feels, really. If the creators decided to fit 2 light novels in 12 episodes, however, I know that that\'d be difficult.

I am most definitely a sucker for these kind of shows that play around with the ""group of destined heroes"" concept. Of course, you might not know what if you watched the show and, say, cut it off after 3 episodes.The start of Rokka no Yuusha is somewhat deceptive and is more the kind of start you would expect...from your standard light novel fantasy adventure: A braggart hero interrupting a flashy tournament, a cute and naive princess contrasted with a dark and brooding cool haired girl and, someone pretty obviously set up to be a rival. These episodes aren\'t bad, but they aren\'t especially notable when you\'re starting out, they are the kind of episodes that are actually a lot better to rewatch than to first watch, as they contain a surprising amount of foreshadowing for the series. In many ways, the series can be said to have truly ""started"" in Episode 4, when the series moves from a fantasy adventure piece into a closed room mystery action piece.From there, it gets fairly interesting. I had heard some complaints before that the mystery was ""too obvious"" but while it isn\'t DEEPEST MYSTERY EVER WHOOOA or anything I thought it was perfectly acceptable. The ultimate suspect is not one I suspected for the most part and the method actually did trip me up from expectations. Given this anime is 12 episodes and only 8 take place in the closed room setting, I found the mystery aspect more than acceptable and actually rather fun. This does bring me to one issue I had: With only 12 episodes and 7 prominent characters, roughly half of which are not introduced until 1/3rd of the series is in the books, some characters pretty clearly fall by the wayside in terms of how much we really get to see of them and their depth or complexity. Adlet and Hans for example get good character examination, while Maura is left rather bare.Nonetheless, this was a rare show where I would say I did not dislike any characters in it, although most did not stand out to me especially strongly either. Hans was probably the best, you get a pretty good sense of who he is and how he works with some multiple facets without even getting to learn much in the way of backstory or anything. And while it isn\'t exactly ""character"" in the same sense, Chamot\'s character was pretty fun and not what I expected in the first place...and the surprise reveal of her power set was actually one of the most memorable parts of the show to me. It is quite a trip.One character interaction I felt was somewhat off was the romance part, specifically involving Adlet and Fremy. On Fremy\'s end it makes sense given her backstory, character and the fact she seems less committed to it, I thought it was less than believable from Adlet\'s end and stuck out like a bit of a sore thumb. I have heard that the Light Novel has some more explanations for it...but I can\'t exactly grade the anime for something outside of it and it stuck out to me. The ending is also something that makes sense, I assume it was the same cliffhanger at the end of that Light Novel volume, but in the context of the anime it felt pretty out of place and was one of the parts of the show I more disliked. It felt somewhat cheap and more like it should be at the start of a season two first episode than the end of this show\'s. And I\'m not sure how much I like the direction it is implying it will go to begin with.The art of this show is pretty hit and miss. Stuff like the fight scene in Episode one and some of the exposition after has some really pretty art but at the same time the CGI in this show is generally fairly bad. I don\'t just mean the monsters, where it seems to be trying to give them an otherworldly quality but fails to do so (compare to the D-Reaper from Digimon Tamers for example despite being a much older show), but another thing they do is these odd panning shots which are painfully and obviously done in CG. They cut down on these with time, but they prominently stood out to me most of the time they happened and not in a good way. Also, the second opening had some slightly jarring parts to me that stood out repeatedly when I watched it. I did for the most part enjoy the character designs a good deal...although I am sad they didn\'t give Fremy a freaking shirt because I would love the outfit a lot more if it did. Sound is mostly positive with some good voice actors, in fact that\'s what bumped the Sound to an 8 here, I thought the show actually had some pretty good voice acting, most obviously from Hans, Fremy and Chamot. It had some good ambvient sound and some pretty good songs as well, overall it was pretty good.So, what\'s the final verdict? Rokka no Yuusha isn\'t a masterpiece, that much is certain, but it is a fairly fun and good show. It explores its premise with a reasonable amount and combines it with solid and memorable if at times a bit lacking characters. It combines this with some fun action, leading to a show with an overall ""Good"" quality that nonetheless does not especially stand out. The very end is a bit lacking, but largely coming off the heels of the mystery\'s wrapping up being done pretty well. If the premise or designs interest you, definitely give it a whirl: It is ultimately pretty enjoyable.

Another typical adventure, destroy the demon god/king yada yada yada...little did I know I would stumble upon....ONE OF THE BEST ANIME OF ALL TIME!!!OF ALL TIME!!!!!!This show has it all. Action. Comedy. Mystery. Adventure. Beautiful waifus. A great and unique plot.First of all, let\'s talk about the plot. As you\'ve read from the summary already, I can\'t add much more without spoiling it. Adlet is chosen as one of the Six Braves- he and his comrades go to a temple to meet up to defeat the Demon God, but it turns out there\'s seven of them, so...they have to decide who the fake seventh Brave is. They suspect it\'s Adlet due to an unfortuante series of events, and the poor fellow has to go on the run all while thinking of a way to clear his accusation while exposing the seventh. The Fugitive meets Among Us, sprinkled with the amazing power of anime! The plot sounds simple, but it\'s the execution that is *CHEFS KISS*. The pacing is absolutely amazing. It will keep you on your toes the entire time. Proof? I finished this anime in a day! I couldn\'t wait to see how the next event unfolds. That is absolutely 100% GOD TIER of how to do a mystery anime. I will say, what may turn off some people and why it has a low rating is because the way the show starts- it kind of lulls the audience into a sense of false adventure and security. Like, wow what a tamed show...but keep at it. By episode 3 or 4, my god it gets so good. The way small information is revealed little by little each episode. How Adlet is able to piece information together. Then of course the grande reveal at the end- once again, CHEFS KISS. 10/10 Plot.Now to the characters. Um let me just say, another 10/10! Adlet is without a shadow of a doubt, ONE OF THE BEST MC OF ALL TIME! Alright, I will admit- when you first meet him he\'s kind of cringe. Like, you can tell he\'s ""different"", but he spouts these shounen catch phrases, right? So you\'re like, wow what a cornball. But once you learn his story, his character, and his motives- he is absolutely amazing. What really makes him a great MC is that aside from his amazing traits is that they actually make him very vulnerable. His self-proclaimed ""strongest man in the world"" is indeed somewhat of a fascade. He\'s by enlarged, physically and magically (actually he has no magic abiltiy at all), the weakest of the Braves. He is average at best, as pointed out by his peers. You see him get stabbled. Punch. Bleed. Some instances, he could\'ve easily been killed. But Adlet uses his ingeniunity. His intelligence. His cunning. His resources. The environment. The man is amazing. Freaking amazing. A+ MC. He\'s in the god tier ranks of Lelouch, Light, and Ayanokouji. Okay, so how about the supporting cast? Most of them are average except for one. Hans is the crazy, but dependable one. Chamo is the annoying stupid OP kid. Goldov is the moronic soldier boy who does whatever he\'s told. Nashetennia is the typical sweet princess who learns about the world. Maura (Mora?) is the overbearing mother-type. Then there\'s Flamie- I won\'t spoil it, but she is incredible. At first you see her and you\'re like, oh wow another cute kuudere- cool. But they actually give her personality way more depth. The way she eventually unlocks her emotions is so well written. She is obviously flawed too, which is what I really love.Okay, I guess next is the animation and music. Animation is great as well. It is an older anime, so compared to todays standard- may not be all that, but I still enjoy it. I will say though, the character designs are absolutely amazing. Each character is unique and stands out. The music is solid. Nothing stands out though, but it does the job. Oh and the VA\'s are top tier as usual!So this review is getting a little too long. Should you watch this anime? YES YES YES YES HELL YES! Watch it, love it, THANK ME LATER. This anime gets the ever elusive 10/10 score. they have to decide who the fake seventh Brave is. They suspect it\'s Adlet due to an unfortuante series of events, and the poor fellow has to go on the run all while thinking of a way to clear his accusation while exposing the seventh. The Fugitive meets Among Us, sprinkled with the amazing power of anime! The plot sounds simple, but it\'s the execution that is *CHEFS KISS*. The pacing is absolutely amazing. It will keep you on your toes the entire time. Proof? I finished this anime in a day! I couldn\'t wait to see how the next event unfolds. That is absolutely 100% GOD TIER of how to do a mystery anime. I will say, what may turn off some people and why it has a low rating is because the way the show starts- it kind of lulls the audience into a sense of false adventure and security. Like, wow what a tamed show...but keep at it. By episode 3 or 4, my god it gets so good. The way small information is revealed little by little each episode. How Adlet is able to piece information together. Then of course the grande reveal at the end- once again, CHEFS KISS. 10/10 Plot.Now to the characters. Um let me just say, another 10/10! Adlet is without a shadow of a doubt, ONE OF THE BEST MC OF ALL TIME! Alright, I will admit- when you first meet him he\'s kind of cringe. Like, you can tell he\'s ""different"", but he spouts these shounen catch phrases, right? So you\'re like, wow what a cornball. But once you learn his story, his character, and his motives- he is absolutely amazing. What really makes him a great MC is that aside from his amazing traits is that they actually make him very vulnerable. His self-proclaimed ""strongest man in the world"" is indeed somewhat of a fascade. He\'s by enlarged, physically and magically (actually he has no magic abiltiy at all), the weakest of the Braves. He is average at best, as pointed out by his peers. You see him get stabbled. Punch. Bleed. Some instances, he could\'ve easily been killed. But Adlet uses his ingeniunity. His intelligence. His cunning. His resources. The environment. The man is amazing. Freaking amazing. A+ MC. He\'s in the god tier ranks of Lelouch, Light, and Ayanokouji. Okay, so how about the supporting cast? Most of them are average except for one. Hans is the crazy, but dependable one. Chamo is the annoying stupid OP kid. Goldov is the moronic soldier boy who does whatever he\'s told. Nashetennia is the typical sweet princess who learns about the world. Maura (Mora?) is the overbearing mother-type. Then there\'s Flamie- I won\'t spoil it, but she is incredible.

It\'s a fantasy that takes on the style of an Among Us game with several heroes who all seemingly want the same thing except one of them is lying. It has more layers than a simple ""Who\'s the bad guy?"" since it\'s also a mystery what the purpose of being the fake/spy/impostor is. What I was expecting was a team to gather and journey out to face the Big Bad, so when the mind games continued and I noticed I was more than halfway through I was impressed that, without the overall...plot really going anywhere, the anime had managed to keep me engaged and entertained with several plausible options of who the fake/spy/impostor was.Touching briefly on the other things, the action was solid, the fighting abilities of each character were unique and cool, and the soundtrack was serviceable. The world itself felt unique compared to other fantasy environments as well. I think the one thing that gave me the feeling the story had jumped the shark and diminished the appeal was in the last episode when things were feeling finally sorted out and then something happened that made things not sorted out. Not gonna say specifically what due to spoilers, it just was disappointing to have the majority of the show dedicated to solving something for it to ultimately result with an... un-resolving? Something like one step forward, two steps back. Yeah.Anyway, the show was engaging and I enjoyed it. plot really going anywhere, the anime had managed to keep me engaged and entertained with several plausible options of who the fake/spy/impostor was.Touching briefly on the other things, the action was solid, the fighting abilities of each character were unique and cool, and the soundtrack was serviceable.

Most people I can see not really enjoying this show but for me it was a pleseant surprise how invested to see where the show was going. In all honesty the story was a tad predictable and I have no problems with that because my overall enjoyment was very high. The action set pieces are beautifully animated and are exciting and fast paced. I cannot wait for season 2. If I had an issue with the show I will admit the characters are hit and miss I really like some characters like Hans, Flamie and Adlet and then there are just...characters I either dispise or are given little to no screen time to get to know them better. Goldov is the best example of a character that did absolutely nothing in this show. He very rarely talks and doesn't do much beyond standing around. It's a wasted potential that I feel they could have done more for him. But all in all with issues to the side I did have fun. I watched it to be entertained with a intersting mystery solving story and it's fun in that regard. I'd say check out Rokka and if you don't like it then probably just drop the series.

The story is based on a group of Braves that must save the world by defeating the demon god. There are supposed to be six braves, but once they gather together we end up with seven. This season deals with finding who the traitor is, in kind of a locked-room mystery.There is plenty of action while the mystery is being solved, which...provides a nice balance to keep us entertained. Also, there is a tiny bit off romance thrown in there and of course some comic relief.One of my favorite things about this show is the art, and this is the reason for the overall score being 9 instead of 8. I love the style they use in the art, and the animation is impeccable too.On top of that, the characters are interesting and provide the story with depth. The quirks and characteristics of each of the players in the mystery make this a special show.Finally, as I was watching this my biggest fear was that once we found out about the solution we were not going to be satisfied with the logic behind it.

But underneath that simple synopsis, a lot of unexpected twists and turns come along the way, and separates this from your typical anime/novel.-Review for both the novel and anime, mild SPOILER ALERT-Story: 8.5/10Rokka no Yuusha is easily now one of my favorite series. The author gives a great and exciting telling of the action, and the unexpected plot twists are very, very good. It leads you to believe something, only to find out that there are a lot of other factors...involved. While there are somewhat mild ass-pulls every now and then, it's mostly because they were hinted very subtly beforehand, making you focus on the happenings in the present.Art and Animation: 8/10The anime's art is awesome. The animation is high quality, and while you can see that they're not extravagant on big action scenes, it's enough to keep you excited. The MesoAmerican-Fantasy setting is very nice as well, and refreshing. While it doesn't draw you into the world that much, it's enough to be a believable world where the characters live in. Although I do understand that the quality drops midway due to budget cuts, but it's still acceptable and delivers during important scenes.Characters: 8.8/10The characters are well written, each of them feels alive with their own wishes and wills. The small, subtle, yet important hints of character relationship developments, the focus on certain characters per arc, and the distinct personalities of the characters, so you may not understand some of the things happening because of the limitations of the first season. I laugh every time because the team is highly dysfunctional. You'd expect them to get along and go with their goal, but no, a lot of conflicts happen along the way, slowly building up the characters.Enjoyment/Overall: 9/10I very much enjoyed Rokka no Yuusha.

This\'ll be my second review so please excuse the mistakes. This will contain spoilers up to episode 12.How I got into Rokka and my initial impressions:I was browsing the animesuggest subreddit, and one guy mentioned Rokka as a show where the main character used all sorts of cheap tricks and gadgets to beat his opponents, and I saw it on Crunchyroll, so I decided to watch it on a whim.I loved it from the first episode. I don\'t mind ""cheesy"" or cliche...storylines, like chosen warriors going to fight a demon, if they\'re done well/differently, and I thought this one was. The opening with Adlet at a tournament was epic - I really liked watching him challenge both fighters and defeating them with relative ease. His confidence was well-founded, and I found his character entertaining. (more on his character later and why he\'s my favorite character at the moment)Story:The idea of a great demon awakening and several warriors being chosen to defeat it is not the most original story in the world. That said, there aren\'t any truly ""original"" plots anymore; everything is derivative of something else nowadays. Rokka takes this formula and deviates very much, changing it more into a mystery than an action series, and I much prefer that.I personally really like the story and think its done better than a lot of other fantasy esque shows I\'ve seen. I appreciated that it wasn\'t simply the ""chosen"" ones by birth. Instead the six braves could only be chosen by showing their strength in front of the goddess statue, ex the tournament in the first episode. To me, that\'s a lot better than other shows where the main hero is born or just randomly finds himself awakening to the power, because it means the heroes have proven their strength and were selected.I enjoyed the epicness of having to go up against a great demon that not even the strongest goddess of a past life could defeat. It gives the show a high stakes feel, especially since losing even one of the six braves would be a huge loss. The demon\'s fiend soldiers are also not just generic monsters. They have the ability to talk, fly, transform, and it makes the battles more interesting than typical shonen/action fare where its just ""hack and slash"".That brings me to another thing I really like about the fighting: I feel that the characters and such fight both smartly and very differently. Adlet is the prime example, as he uses many bombs, swords, needles, and other gadgets and weapons to compensate for his strength. I really like trickster heroes and he\'s probably the best one I\'ve ever seen. (For those who don\'t know, trickster heroes are heroes who fight with cleverness rather than pure strength; they are typically underdogs in their fights) I also really appreciate how he has actively studied the fiends and applies science readily in their battles. Its brilliant and very different from typical action shows. (The closest comparison I can think of is Hunter X Hunter where the battles are more battles of wit). I love Adlet\'s case even more because of how ordinary he is - its explicitly pointed out that he was never gifted or talented; he had to slave away for 8 years to gain the false strength he has now.Other heroes also fight differently which makes it each fight different, yet enjoyable, such as Goldov and his spear/brutality when he attacks. Fremy\'s usage of many bombs and bullets are also interesting, and Hans especially has a very exotic yet cool fighting style (I especially remember the scene where he used his sword like a pogo stick to stab Adlet)One of the biggest draws is also the air of mystery around the series. The presence of a seventh brave was shown in the initial trailer, and the episodes do a good job leading up to it. There is also another mystery down the line of the illusion fog barrier\'s activation, and I really appreciate that this show tries to challenge its watcher to think a bit. Pure action alone would not add this much suspense and tension, and I love watching it, on the edge of my seat.Art:Each of the characters seems to have a different color scheme and everyone is very clearly differentiated. They all seem to have pretty different body types, clothes, armors, weapons, etc, and the character designs show them off very well. The characters are both cool and interesting to look at.I enjoyed the animation very much, and I thought it was pleasing to my eyes throughout the series. It was easy to follow what happened in action sequences, and the towns and such were clear to see as well.The only issue was toward the end, when Passione seemed to run low on their animation budget, and many frames became very choppy. I don\'t mind that much, but it did hurt the experience a bit. I don\'t mind though since they\'re a beginner studio and this is only their second project!Sound:I don\'t have the greatest ears, but I loved the first opening and constantly looped it. The actions and voice actors were all fine too, with no problems. I probably enjoy Adlet\'s VA the most - I can just feel the confidence when he talks. I think the voices and such are very enjoyable and give a good vibe of the characters in general.The series also plays songs at some nice moments, which really helps raise the tension/epicness, and I really enjoyed that.Character:On Adlet: I loved this character so much and his transformation from his youth. I find his back story to be quite touching. We saw him in his peaceful village, where he said he would be happy just picking mushrooms because he\'s good at it. This childhood innocence hit me quite deep inside, as we see him lose his entire village, and he soon becomes a very pitiable, vengeful boy who trains non-stop for 8 years to get his revenge. I really liked this as his line of picking mushrooms was so mundane...I found it ironic how he came from there to where he is now in the show, and I found it a bit sad too.Yet, we also see the kind of man he\'s become. He has a strong sense of camaderie, quickly forgiving those allies who tried to kill him. When he knew the pressure was on him and no one believed him, he didn\'t give up, and he successfully proved the trap of the seventh with his own wit and willpower. I really like the essence of positivity he generates; its what I always wanted in my main heroes: self confidence and a high sense of competence.Adlet also made a great detective, slowly eliminating possibilities by gaining testimonies from everyone. At the same time, he set preparations in case he did fail - for example, his kyoma detection spray, which he used to guarantee Fremy\'s safety.These moments and much more (especially in the Light Novels) made me love his character so much. Some fans may find his ""I\'m the world\'s strongest"" rather irritating, but I appreciated it, as that\'s his coping mechanism. In addition, he doesn\'t say it out of arrogance - he wants to be the world\'s strongest as a mental fortification of sorts so that he can believe in himself even when times are at their worst.On Fremy: I think Fremy is the second most interesting character in the series, as we see her gradually open up to Adlet. None of the other characters are developed or revealed as much, but we do see Fremy transform a bit, from the cold-hearted distrustful woman she was to someone who could trust another, just a little bit more. I found her transformation of trust to also be belivable - she always doubted Adlet, and she didn\'t truly change her mind until Adlet showed he was willing to die for her - and I think that is a strong enough case for her transformation.On the other characters: The other characters are really explored in more depth in the light novels, so I can\'t say as much at the moment. I found most of the characterization to be enjoyable or believable, though I wish Nachetanya\'s mental snaps were a bit less emphasized. As far as the novels, I enjoyed seeing Goldof\'s characterization in volume 3 the most.Enjoyment/Overall:Overall, I haven\'t had many problems with Rokka. Its my favorite this season and its very enjoyable. Its probably the best fantasy/magic one I\'ve seen yet. It doesn\'t rely on lame gags, it has realistic reactions and high stakes, the fights and discussions are clever and are definitely more intellectual than most other shows, and its good at dropping hooks at the end of the episodes to keep the viewer curious what happens next.As for the things I disliked - I wish Adlet hadn\'t confessed to Fremy with an ""I love you"". It just felt sudden. I know their relationship is expanded in the later light novels, but I preferred a translation I read elsewhere, where he just said ""I care about you"", which I find an easier pill to swallow for two people who\'ve known each other less than 3 days. I dislike that in the last episode, they left out a brief discussion on another character (Saint of Words who wouldve been able to instantly detect the fake; in the novels she is mentioned but too far away to come in time). Its not important, but the character is brought up in the second light novel. I also felt Rolonia and the army\'s introduction felt a little rushed and could\'ve been done better. I think overall, episode 12 was a bit disappointing, since 11 was so, so climactic and good. I also wish ep 1 had the scene where Adlet explained why he had to crash the tournament instead of fighting from the getgo (in the novels, its because his weapons werent allowed).As for the tinier things I did dislike - I suppose the pacing can be a bit quick at times, such as the sudden 3 other braves arriving nearly at once or Nachetanya and Adlet suddenly charging out of the country. Some scenes initially with Nachetanya and Adlet alone felt a little strange that they were so close already, but none of these were huge issues and are more just nitpickings.Lastly, for me personally, my favorite painting is The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog, a painting showing a wanderer on a cliff looking out at a large fog beneath and ahead of him. It represents a traveler in the face of adversity and an unknown future, and I found this illusion fog barrier arc to remind me of that a bit - Adlet and the heroes are obscured in this fog, and they do not know what is ahead and around them, nor do they know why this is happening. This tension throughout the show really helped carry it along in my eyes. storylines, like chosen warriors going to fight a demon, if they\'re done well/differently, and I thought this one was. The opening with Adlet at a tournament was epic - I really liked watching him challenge both fighters and defeating them with relative ease. His confidence was well-founded, and I found his character entertaining. (more on his character later and why he\'s my favorite character at the moment)Story:The idea of a great demon awakening and several warriors being chosen to defeat it is not the most original story in the world. That said, there aren\'t any truly ""original"" plots anymore; everything is derivative of something else nowadays. Rokka takes this formula and deviates very much, changing it more into a mystery than an action series, and I much prefer that.I personally really like the story and think its done better than a lot of other fantasy esque shows I\'ve seen. I appreciated that it wasn\'t simply the ""chosen"" ones by birth. Instead the six braves could only be chosen by showing their strength in front of the goddess statue, ex the tournament in the first episode. To me, that\'s a lot better than other shows where the main hero is born or just randomly finds himself awakening to the power, because it means the heroes have proven their strength and were selected.I enjoyed the epicness of having to go up against a great demon that not even the strongest goddess of a past life could defeat. It gives the show a high stakes feel, especially since losing even one of the six braves would be a huge loss. The demon\'s fiend soldiers are also not just generic monsters. They have the ability to talk, fly, transform, and it makes the battles more interesting than typical shonen/action fare where its just ""hack and slash"".That brings me to another thing I really like about the fighting: I feel that the characters and such fight both smartly and very differently. Adlet is the prime example, as he uses many bombs, swords, needles, and other gadgets and weapons to compensate for his strength. I really like trickster heroes and he\'s probably the best one I\'ve ever seen. (For those who don\'t know, trickster heroes are heroes who fight with cleverness rather than pure strength; they are typically underdogs in their fights) I also really appreciate how he has actively studied the fiends and applies science readily in their battles. Its brilliant and very different from typical action shows. (The closest comparison I can think of is Hunter X Hunter where the battles are more battles of wit). I love Adlet\'s case even more because of how ordinary he is - its explicitly pointed out that he was never gifted or talented; he had to slave away for 8 years to gain the false strength he has now.Other heroes also fight differently which makes it each fight different, yet enjoyable, such as Goldov and his spear/brutality when he attacks. Fremy\'s usage of many bombs and bullets are also interesting, and Hans especially has a very exotic yet cool fighting style (I especially remember the scene where he used his sword like a pogo stick to stab Adlet)One of the biggest draws is also the air of mystery around the series. The presence of a seventh brave was shown in the initial trailer, and the episodes do a good job leading up to it. There is also another mystery down the line of the illusion fog barrier\'s activation, and I really appreciate that this show tries to challenge its watcher to think a bit. Pure action alone would not add this much suspense and tension, and I love watching it, on the edge of my seat.Art:Each of the characters seems to have a different color scheme and everyone is very clearly differentiated. They all seem to have pretty different body types, clothes, armors, weapons, etc, and the character designs show them off very well. The characters are both cool and interesting to look at.I enjoyed the animation very much, and I thought it was pleasing to my eyes throughout the series. It was easy to follow what happened in action sequences, and the towns and such were clear to see as well.The only issue was toward the end, when Passione seemed to run low on their animation budget, and many frames became very choppy. I don\'t mind that much, but it did hurt the experience a bit. I don\'t mind though since they\'re a beginner studio and this is only their second project!Sound:I don\'t have the greatest ears, but I loved the first opening and constantly looped it. The actions and voice actors were all fine too, with no problems. I probably enjoy Adlet\'s VA the most - I can just feel the confidence when he talks. I think the voices and such are very enjoyable and give a good vibe of the characters in general.The series also plays songs at some nice moments, which really helps raise the tension/epicness, and I really enjoyed that.Character:On Adlet: I loved this character so much and his transformation from his youth. I find his back story to be quite touching. We saw him in his peaceful village, where he said he would be happy just picking mushrooms because he\'s good at it. This childhood innocence hit me quite deep inside, as we see him lose his entire village, and he soon becomes a very pitiable, vengeful boy who trains non-stop for 8 years to get his revenge. I really liked this as his line of picking mushrooms was so mundane...I found it ironic how he came from there to where he is now in the show, and I found it a bit sad too.Yet, we also see the kind of man he\'s become. He has a strong sense of camaderie, quickly forgiving those allies who tried to kill him. When he knew the pressure was on him and no one believed him, he didn\'t give up, and he successfully proved the trap of the seventh with his own wit and willpower. I really like the essence of positivity he generates; its what I always wanted in my main heroes: self confidence and a high sense of competence.Adlet also made a great detective, slowly eliminating possibilities by gaining testimonies from everyone. At the same time, he set preparations in case he did fail - for example, his kyoma detection spray, which he used to guarantee Fremy\'s safety.These moments and much more (especially in the Light Novels) made me love his character so much. Some fans may find his ""I\'m the world\'s strongest"" rather irritating, but I appreciated it, as that\'s his coping mechanism. In addition, he doesn\'t say it out of arrogance - he wants to be the world\'s strongest as a mental fortification of sorts so that he can believe in himself even when times are at their worst.On Fremy: I think Fremy is the second most interesting character in the series, as we see her gradually open up to Adlet. None of the other characters are developed or revealed as much, but we do see Fremy transform a bit, from the cold-hearted distrustful woman she was to someone who could trust another, just a little bit more. I found her transformation of trust to also be belivable - she always doubted Adlet, and she didn\'t truly change her mind until Adlet showed he was willing to die for her - and I think that is a strong enough case for her transformation.On the other characters: The other characters are really explored in more depth in the light novels, so I can\'t say as much at the moment. I found most of the characterization to be enjoyable or believable, though I wish Nachetanya\'s mental snaps were a bit less emphasized. As far as the novels, I enjoyed seeing Goldof\'s characterization in volume 3 the most.Enjoyment/Overall:Overall, I haven\'t had many problems with Rokka. Its my favorite this season and its very enjoyable. Its probably the best fantasy/magic one I\'ve seen yet. It doesn\'t rely on lame gags, it has realistic reactions and high stakes, the fights and discussions are clever and are definitely more intellectual than most other shows, and its good at dropping hooks at the end of the episodes to keep the viewer curious what happens next.As for the things I disliked - I wish Adlet hadn\'t confessed to Fremy with an ""I love you"". It just felt sudden. I know their relationship is expanded in the later light novels, but I preferred a translation I read elsewhere, where he just said ""I care about you"", which I find an easier pill to swallow for two people who\'ve known each other less than 3 days. I dislike that in the last episode, they left out a brief discussion on another character (Saint of Words who wouldve been able to instantly detect the fake; in the novels she is mentioned but too far away to come in time). Its not important, but the character is brought up in the second light novel. I also felt Rolonia and the army\'s introduction felt a little rushed and could\'ve been done better. I think overall, episode 12 was a bit disappointing, since 11 was so, so climactic and good. I also wish ep 1 had the scene where Adlet explained why he had to crash the tournament instead of fighting from the getgo (in the novels, its because his weapons werent allowed).As for the tinier things I did dislike - I suppose the pacing can be a bit quick at times, such as the sudden 3 other braves arriving nearly at once or Nachetanya and Adlet suddenly charging out of the country. Some scenes initially with Nachetanya and Adlet alone felt a little strange that they were so close already, but none of these were huge issues and are more just nitpickings.Lastly, for me personally, my favorite painting is The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog, a painting showing a wanderer on a cliff looking out at a large fog beneath and ahead of him. It represents a traveler in the face of adversity and an unknown future, and I found this illusion fog barrier arc to remind me of that a bit - Adlet and the heroes are obscured in this fog, and they do not know what is ahead and around them, nor do they know why this is happening. This tension throughout the show really helped carry it along in my eyes.', ""This is a great example of how to surprise your viewers in a way that doesn't ruin their expectations. Rokka no Yuusha was a fun ride from beginning to end and it's got incredible value in rewatching it.For an anime that covered a mere one volume of its manga in the full season, this show manages to just absolutely cram action and events into each episode. There's not a lot of predictability here and I was usually left very curious about where the plot would go next at the end of each episode. You're put on a tight rope from the start and it...never slacks or loses that tension right up to the end. Mystery, suspense and drama abound in a way that leaves you excited instead of worn out.I rated art lower because the cgi monsters and some animation issues were often noticeable enough to distract from what was going on.The characters are unique, don't depend on known archetypes too much, and feel like they have agency and ambition of their own. I know I went through times of disliking and loving most of them which helped them feel fleshed out and genuine. never slacks or loses that tension right up to the end.

To be honest, Adlet was the main reason why I got through those 4 epsiodes. I thought his creative fighting style using weapons, poisons, and no Saint skills at all was pretty legit, so I kept watching it.There's kawaii-usagi-chan, aka the main reason I watched the show in the first place, but realized how cancerous she was. Also, she's  completely not suspicious at all.Then we got swashbuckler pirate, Fremy who no matter how many times I see her, reminds me of Boba Fett.

Seriously, that shiz gets old Maura. I don't care if she's one of the six Braves or not, I want her dead.ANIMATION:If you already didn't guess, you should know that the animation of this show, or rather the art work, is odd and not the best I've seen. Put simply, it could use some work.I'll agree that the backgrounds and scenery were well-done. What I find extremely lacking is the animation that matters the most when telling a story, the characters. Studio Passioné did pretty decent, until they got to the characters. Holy cow, there were scenes where I just wanted to gag when I saw their faces.If also like to take a moment to focus on the computer animation. It's like they're using an animation program from five years ago. Hello? Etotama and Saekano did it decently, so why can't you? Then again, this may just be an issue of money and how this studio lacks the funds to make their CG look bearable.MUSIC:Now the music; THE MUSIC! I'd like to give them props for being creative with the openings and adding a variety, but the music overall was pretty average, and that's me being kind about it. Why? Simply because the ending music was cancerous. Also, the background music during the actual episode, if there was any, was hardly noticeable and didn't stand out at all.PERSONAL ENJOYMENT:Now, everything I've said so far may point to you assuming I didn't like this show, but honestly, I liked it a lot. I may just be salty about it not continuing for more than 12 episodes. The whole mystery genre isn't new, but the way they executed it made the show quite interesting to keep up with for 3 months. Though if I could complain about one thing with the mystery aspect is that they include those final left hooks that we don't see coming because they never mention it at all in previous episodes. Nonetheless, Rokka no Yuusha was a pretty interesting show.Overall, Rokka no Yuusha is an interesting 12 episode mystery anime. However, don't watch this show if you expect a concrete ending: the show ends at a point where a second season is possible, but most likely isn't happening because of the lack of an announcement or the reliable sales of the first season to support a season 2.

Rokka no Yuusha is NOT one of those anime, however even though the show comes to a complete stop and heads in an entirely new direction early on, It went down that new road very successfully. Most anime that have a drastic change don’t really fare well but ROkka no Yuusha just runs with it. Its almost refreshing to see it step away from a traditional fantasy adventure and focus much more heavily on the mystery present throughout the show.Story-8The story is set on a fictional continent...where magic and fantasy are the norm. The continent seems to have many other countries and varied landscapes yet the anime spends most of its time at the edge of it. At the far west end of the continent is the Balca Peninsula or Demon Territory. Our two main protagonists, Adlet and Nachetanya, are tasked to go there and meet up with the other braves to repel the demon threat. According to legend, hundreds of years ago demons would plague the land and the only one with enough power to defeat them was the Saint of the Single Flower. Ever since The Saint had slain the demons only twice have they been resurfaced since. The previous times the Demons were banished by the Rokka No Yuusha, which were prophesized by the Saint of the Single Flower to return and defeat the demons. Apparently they are chosen by proving themselves to the Goddess of Fate, which I am unsure is the same person as the Saint of the Single Flower. Lots of the legend is still left a mystery throughout the show but thats really what the show is all about, mystery. Why is it so damn foggy? Why do the demons keep coming back? Side-boob or Underboob? Does Jet Fuel Melt steel beams?! How many braves ARE there!? Plenty of questions arise and the anime does a good job at answering them, for the most part. The entire mystery of the show if figuring out who the imposter is among the braves. A answer which is not revealed until the very end. The story that starts of as an action adventure quickly turns into a mystery show but don’t worry, there is still plenty of action left in the second half of the show. The pure hysteria between the group has everyone on edge looking for clues as to who doesn’t belong and the entire time the show will have you wondering who the 7th brave is.Characters- 7Big points the character designer for this one. Flamie, Nachetanya, and Adlet all have interesting designs that really make them stick out. Although I’ve go to admit Flamie is one of the stupidest names for a character Ive ever heard. I really used to hate her as a character, Kuuderes just dont float my boat. It is nice that she does get some more of her background revealed so it makes a little more sense that she acts the way she does. She is almost TOO calm and collected if that makes sense. Extra points for her actually having a gun in a fantasy anime. She is by far the most mysterious character out of the group. Next is Adlet. At first he just comes off as another Overpowered fuckboy protagonist always spouting off about being the “Strongest man in the world” which was a little annoying but as the story progresses he became easily the most likeable character aside from those that really liked Flamie. Unlike the others that have some sort unique power or strength, Adlet fights using much more unconventional means like using smoke grenades, throwing needles, a small sword, and some really cool fire braces that don’t make sense to me but are still badass. Then theres Nachetanya, the Princess of the Largest Kingdom, Her bodyguard Goldov thats 16. (yah fuckin right). Hans the token cat character that I thought I would hate but was actually pleasantly surprised from later on. Chamo the true fuckboy… girl… I dont even know. Who decides its a good idea to have all these little kids become gods among men. Its a toddler not a damn MMA fighter. Why these loli characters exist still baffles me. Then theres Mora Chester. And we definiely want more of her chester. Shes the saint of the mountains and I wouldn’t doubt her seeing as shes got twin peaks herself… ok Im done now. All in all the cast isnt that great but Adlet, Flamie, Hans, and even Nachetanya in a sense make the anime very interesting. Since most of them still have quite a lot of mystery to them it is anyone’s guess as to who the imposter is. The reactions and reasoning behind why they think someone is suspect leads to great tension throughout the show.Animation 9  / Sound 8Animation in this show is beautiful and its a shame that the earlier cityscapes and wilderness are not shown very much past the beginning few episodes. As stated before all the characters look great and the show uses its pretty visuals bring the world to life. In the beginning when the story of the Saint of the Single Flower was told in a unique artistic way utilizing what looks to be more like wall paintings rather than the style used i the rest of the anime, which worked great for telling the old legends. The fight scenes are fluid, the colors are vibrant in the beginning and much more gritty towards the middle and end, the atmosphere is very foggy as most of the show takes place in a foggy forest area but what better way to set the atmosphere for a mystery show than that? A lot of the show is fog but there are plenty of scenes where the backgrounds are very eyecatching. As for soundtrack the show has some good OP’s and ED’s that only add tension to the show as well as backing up every fight or chase scene with intense and driving music. Nothing really sticks out from the track per se but it does do a great job at keeping the show tense and mysterious. It doesn’t stick out but it is definitely there, subtly adding more and more mysterious elements to the show.Enjoyment- 8I keep saying it but the theme with this show is tension. Throughout the second half every situation could mean life or death and with anime becoming more bold, it seems that nobody could be safe from death. It feels like this show has just barely scratched the surface of its world and it feels like there is so much more to it than was presented in the anime. Hopefully this show gets another season cause I would love to see how the journey progresses. I was pleasantly surprised by this show coming from a young animation studio and I would say that It is definitely worth checking out.Final Score 8Watch this!

The reactions and reasoning behind why they think someone is suspect leads to great tension throughout the show.Animation 9  / Sound 8Animation in this show is beautiful and its a shame that the earlier cityscapes and wilderness are not shown very much past the beginning few episodes. As stated before all the characters look great and the show uses its pretty visuals bring the world to life. In the beginning when the story of the Saint of the Single Flower was told in a unique artistic way utilizing what looks to be more like wall paintings rather than the style used i the rest of the anime, which worked great for telling the old legends. The fight scenes are fluid, the colors are vibrant in the beginning and much more gritty towards the middle and end, the atmosphere is very foggy as most of the show takes place in a foggy forest area but what better way to set the atmosphere for a mystery show than that? A lot of the show is fog but there are plenty of scenes where the backgrounds are very eyecatching. As for soundtrack the show has some good OP’s and ED’s that only add tension to the show as well as backing up every fight or chase scene with intense and driving music. Nothing really sticks out from the track per se but it does do a great job at keeping the show tense and mysterious. It doesn’t stick out but it is definitely there, subtly adding more and more mysterious elements to the show.Enjoyment- 8I keep saying it but the theme with this show is tension. Throughout the second half every situation could mean life or death and with anime becoming more bold, it seems that nobody could be safe from death. It feels like this show has just barely scratched the surface of its world and it feels like there is so much more to it than was presented in the anime. Hopefully this show gets another season cause I would love to see how the journey progresses. I was pleasantly surprised by this show coming from a young animation studio and I would say that It is definitely worth checking out.Final Score 8Watch this! Possibly the best anime of the season', 'Since I first saw the concept art of this anime I was hooked. I didn\'t even know the story or anything I just knew I loved how it looked and directly added it to my plan to watch list.Now that I completed it in a day(even if I told myself I will take it slow since I have no free time), I can finally review it and share with you my opinion on this one. Full review with pics :http://thewritinghut.net/rokka-no-yuusha-review/Story:I did not expect a 12 episode show to be concerned with such a small plot. Like this story is basically only one tiny portion of...what the world of our six heroes looks like. There are indeed a lot of emotions filled in and a lot of crazy events happen during the span of a month maybe a bit more or less, can\'t really tell to be honest.The plot twist is something one should be impressed by, because this anime just brings a very interesting storyline that you just can\'t predict.Let me cut down to the chase, it\'s the classical ""X Heroes are chosen by a God to defeat the Demon Lord"" but trust me when I say this, you won\'t get bored!Yes it is an overused theme in this genre but then again we like it like that. We like to have some random people group together and save a fictional world.  But the thing is about this that the story is a lot more complex.Indeed it did have the start with an anti-hero good guy character that\'s just too cocky for his own good, and to be frank I have the hots for anti-hero kind personalities so I can\'t help it but like the way this went.Anyway you should expect the unexpected in those 12 crazy episodes.Characters:Adlet ""The World\'s Strongest"" Mayer - The first person we are introduced to. Most people refer to him as the biggest idiot while he claims to be The Strongest Person in the World. A very kind individual with a cunning brain and a neck for causing trouble for everyone. He is the anti-hero type of personality who does things that are not really common for a hero. Really cool guy in my opinion.Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra - Second character we meet, the Princess of some kingdom. Rather a generic character with huge ""personality"" and an unstable one as well. She is new to all of this kind of thing and is a bit scared and stuff like that but she is really powerful. Anyway this character is probably one of the only characters I dislike in this how. Why? Well I would spoil everything if I told you that.Fremy Speeddraw - Best girl of this show. The cold blooded gunman amongst the heroes and the one that is surrounded by darkness. Unemotional and really aggressive, but Adlet somehow still accepts her as a fellow hero.Those 3 are the most important characters in my opinion and not to spoil anything I will not write too much about the other 4 main characters who will show up in this show. The thing is the character design is really interesting, we have those few heroes who are generic at their best but we still can see that something about them is unique and interesting, there is something that just wants you to continue watching Rokka no Yuusha.Yes they are mostly generic characters you find in an RPG character creation but still there are some unique features to those characters that make them seem alive, not real but alive. By alive I mean characters that are actually interesting not just some copy past type of chars.Art:I told you I was hooked to this show just because of the art. There are really amazing scenes and the anime is just pure gold when it comes to the animation and the artwork. But that was to expected from Pony Canyon and  Passione, common they are great!There is really no complain about the animation to be honest, he battle scenes were very interesting and the details were ecstatic.Sound:To be honest I wasn\'t really amazed by the opening or ending songs, but the background music and the characters voices fit so I guess it was ok. Nothing more to say here move on.Personal Enjoyment:""I want a second season right now and if they don\'t bring it out right now I will force them to make it"" is how I feel about this series. Not even going overboard with that description, I just want to know what will happen next, will they defeat the Demon Lord, will someone die, will someone else fall in love with each other?Anyway it\'s just a fantastic show that takes you in a interesting world, but only for a short period of time, yet that short period of time is enough to hook you to it. I would kinda like it to be in Adlets shoes to be honest, he seems to have a interesting life...but well I\'d have to go outside so..yeah not gonna happen (just kidding tho I\'d love to trade places). what the world of our six heroes looks like.

I was in for quite a pleasant surprise though when I watched Rokka No Yussha. Short version, go watch it. It\'s a very good series that I would probably call a hidden gem this season.Story: 8The main story was nothing new. You have a group of heroes selected to take on the Demon King and save the world yada yada yada. The story itself adds nothing original to what most of us have probably already seen in a fantasy...anime or read in any fantasy fiction in one form or another. What makes Rokka shine though is that it actually used it\'s story as a background to introduce what made this show so great, human intrigue or to put it more clearly, suspicions between one another. I admit, I\'m not one that normally enjoys the mystery genre but Rokka was presented in such a way that it made it very interesting to watch the plots and theories fly around all the while keeping it suspenseful with fights going on. I know this really isn\'t the best way to describe the story but to say anymore than this would probably venture into spoiler territory so i\'m going to avoid doing that.Art: 7The art in general feels very distinct in a sense. The way characters were outlined clearly against their background and the background scenery itself seemed very standard for an action anime. Nothing really stood out in the art for me... well maybe except for Fremy but that\'s because she reminded me of Snake from Metal Gear Solid but apart from that, the art of the anime overall felt very standard.Sound: 7The soundtrack in this anime is quite good. It added effect where it was required and overall helped to set the tone of the scene quite well. The OP and the ED were nothing special but I do appreciate what they chose to do with them. Watch to find out more cause I\'m not going to say anything more about this.Characters: 8Now, Rokka probably shines quite well here. The protagonist is first portrayed as one of those generic characters you find in nearly anime of this sort. Brave, kind and believes in his friends. He even brags about being the ""strongest man in the world."" What makes the protagonist in the anime so good though is that when he\'s put in an especially trying situation, he doesn\'t play the whole HERO card but rather becomes a lot more human. I was impressed at how well the character was portrayed and fleshed out throughout the series. The side characters though pretty much act the way they were portrayed from the get-go. I do admit, they was quite a bit of character progression for some of the characters but unfortunately, not all the characters were treated the same though I get a feeling their time would come later.Enjoyment:9When I first started Rokka, I was just randomly browsing myanimelist to see what new anime came out and decided to give this show a try. By the 8th episode, I was hooked real bad and remembered screaming at my computer for more episodes as I had caught up. Now that I\'ve finished it, it leaves quite a bitter sweet taste in my mouth. It\'s a cliff-hangar ending in short. I thought I should\'ve added this in for those of you that do not enjoy such endings. I do admit the anime does take quite a while to get-going but I would suggest for that part anyway, just treat it as another adventure anime and you\'ll be fine.Overall: 8Well Rokka was definitely good don\'t get me wrong. It\'s just that it doesn\'t end and with no announcement for season 2 yet, I find it a bit hard to give this a higher rating that the one above. I do recommend you try this anime though as it\'s quite good in my amateur experience with mystery and I\'ve to understand a bit why people enjoy the genre so much. anime or read in any fantasy fiction in one form or another.

The story is told mostly from the perspective of Adlet Mayer, who proclaims to be the ‘strongest man in the World’. While yes, it is a simple story that follows the path of many fantasy anime (“Yeah let’s all go and kill the demon king!”), it brings to the table new elements which refreshes the classic viewpoint. The characters are rather unique, something that did bothered me is that...they didn’t made enough spotlight for everyone (that’s to be expected of the first season, let’s hope there’s a second season).  Some may say it was a predictable ending but at least that made the plot smoother in my opinion.Art: 9/10It was the first thing that draw me into the anime, it’s stunning from my perspective. The background is something that is easily missed but if you look closely you can see how much effort they placed in it, surely the art is what will make it more memorable for me. I will be honest, I read the book before I even started watching the anime and everything seemed to fit perfectly, from the character’s expression to the scenery.Sound: 8/10Kenichi Suzumura will always make characters I fall in love with, simply that. The anime had two openings an/d 3 endings, which all sound great and fit the theme of the anime perfectly. Overall the voice acting was okay, but what took the price was the atmospheric sounds and music which made it more absorbing to the spectator.Characters: 7/10The development of characters was lacking but that’s only because it was meant to be that way (at least the story doesn’t ends on episode 12). Every character has their traits that make them different and unique, while a lot of things were left unexplained regarding certain character’s personalities. You can definitely see how characters grew in the series, some grow was rather forced and I actually did not like that. The main antagonist is the Majin (“Demon King”), who leads the Kyoumas, but this specific season doesn’t focuses on the Majin at all, even more it is not seen through the anime. I grew fond of all the characters (yes they are all my babies and I love them dearly), but if I had to choose from all I would pick Fremy or Nashetania.Enjoyment: 9/10I personally loved the series, but I will admit it has its weak points. Definitely would recommend it if you like fantasy-adventure animes, it also involves a bit of mystery that will not put you on the edge of your seat but will be amusing to watch develop. I will continue reading the light novel and maybe re-read the books from 1-3. they didn’t made enough spotlight for everyone (that’s to be expected of the first season, let’s hope there’s a second season).

Where the second season will be made next year?Damn it...Short Summary:When the Majin (Great Demon) awakens from the depths of darkness, the deity of fate selects six heroes and gives them the power to save the world. Adlet, a person who claims to be the strongest man in the world is chosen to be one of the six. However as the heroes start to gather one by one, they start to suspect that one of them is an imposter.Sooooooo, where should I start?First of all a very intriguing...plot. Six heroes are chosen to save the world every time the Majin awakens. So far so good.BUT WHAT?There's an imposter among them?Even Better!The story is interesting from just reading the summary. You start to get curious WHO exactly is the imposter and for what reason are they impersonating themselves as a Rokka?However the down part of this series was the ending.It's just simply left all the viewers with a cliffhanger and possible hints of a second season and I HATE those kind of animes.Unless they give the viewers proof of a second season you can never have your hopes TOO high.None the less, I actually enjoyed the animes although it gives away clues of a possible second season as the ending did not feel complete. plot.

Some of of the center-characters get more background and development than others and so it might get you on the right train to solve this mystery early. For me it didn't ruin the show and it was a nice way to spend a weekend.The only thing that really annoyed me was the last 5-10 minutes. I don't know the original light novel and how it ended or continued, but I think the...anime adaption could have been concluded in a much nicer and less obscure way. anime adaption could have been concluded in a much nicer and less obscure way."", ""When I first saw a commercial of Rokka no Yuusha I was grasped immediately, I thought it was going to be similar to lord of the rings and an epic fantasy anime. However when I actually watched it I got something a bit different but I was satisfied nonetheless.Let's start with the facts: Rokka no Yuusha or Rokka: The Braves of the Six flowers, is a summer 2015 anime series based off the light novel of the same name. At face value RNY seems like a basic fantasy story. However one of the main strengths of this show is the effortless blend of...2 genres, in this case fantasy and mystery.What I found great about this anime is the aforementioned seamless blend of genres. I also found it to be a stellar narrative with an engaging plot. The mystery component of this show is handled really well and is very compelling, intriguing, and keeps you guessing. The animation and art is also beautiful with lots of color however I found the use of CGI to be a hit or miss. The music was solid as well with some really great opening themes. The voice acting wasn't anything amazing but was still solid. And on another note I absolutely loved the setting, I haven't seen many anime with as great and intriguing of a setting as RNY and in ways it reminds me of middle earth. The action scenes were also well done and exciting to watch.However I had many significant issues with this show. Ok so one of the biggest problems I had is the lack of episodes, I feel that if RNY had more episodes many issues I am about to mentioned would be resolved. One is the lack of story progression, as we know RNY's most important plot point is discovering the imposter. Well that's fine but why did we have to spend 2 thirds of the freaking season on it. Seriously more episodes would have resolved this but starting at episode 4 there only goal was to find the imposter while blatantly ignoring the main objective of the ENTIRE ANIME, which is defeating the demon king.I found the characters to be a mixed bag, some were interesting and some weren't. Let's take Hans for an example, I think he was an intriguing and funny character that was extremely dynamic. Then we hit the rest of them who are fine but they needed more development which also stems to the aforementioned lack of episodes. And lastly the ending, OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Seriously this ending with lack of better words was complete garbage. I can't really explain why without spoilers bit seriously that was one of those read the manga endings.In that last paragraph it may have sounded like I hated Rokka no Yuusha. But that is far from reality, Rokka no Yuusha is a very good fantasy anime that smartly combines mystery and a compelling mystery at that. The visuals were gorgeous, the setting was fantastic, the voice acting was stellar, and the story was brilliant. I think if it had 26 episodes it would have been perfect.In conclusion despite it not being a completed story you should definitely check RNY out if you like fantasy or mystery and if a second season comes out I will definitely be checking that out. So until that happens try to enjoy RNY for what it is, a solid anime. 2 genres, in this case fantasy and mystery.What I found great about this anime is the aforementioned seamless blend of genres.

I\'d say it was a notable anime for it tested not my intelligence and wits but focused on me clinging on my own deductions and answers. You will notice signs for you to answer the main question (Rather they were too noticeable IMO), but this anime will grind that thought and put your self-confidence on your calculations onto hard-paved ground. Will you let go of your deduction, or will you see the end while still pointing...your precious index finger to the culprit? Dum-dum-duummmm...... Eherm.Story - 6: Aside from the unique Aztec-like setting, the background story felt like a ""Certain"" valkyrie mythology (Yep, forgot the title. I\'m not even sure if it was an animu. Teehee) fused with Mayan/Aztec culture content. The mystery was easy, and yet it was hard to cling on due to confusions, trick scenes, and certain ""Evidence"" only popping out at the end of the series. In that sense, it could go better if the clues were scattered evenly, and they were better explained than just saying ""Oh, we found these things while we were looking."". (I mean, can\'t they at least found it in a more shrouded way? *Shrugs*)Art - 9: The art was probably the only thing great that I can see. The battle scenes were great, but they could have gone even better (Then again, it focused on the mystery so I didn\'t mind it). That said, it wasn\'t bad in any ways too. The flame and knife CG caught my eyes, specifically.Sound - 7: Good enough to go with. They could\'ve added a few more ambience but with the setting and all, I can\'t really complain.Character - 6: All of them are unique, but I know most of us have seen their character personality on other anime characters. Straight-forward, Sly, etc. I don\'t really care about personality repeats due to the number of Anime out there (Well, personality is a limited value integer in the industry), but their personality choices also hints the answer to the crucial question. (If you don\'t get it, go watch Detective Conan or Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo).Enjoyment - 10: I gave it a personal 10 due to me being right in the end (YES!), but that\'s just me. It would really go random based on how a viewer sees the anime. I gave it a 10 due to me being correct on the question and after that spiraling and very confusing dilemmas, the after effect was like ""YEAH! I SAW THAT COMING MA!""-feeling (Wait.... I didn\'t say that IRL m\'kay?!).Overall - 8: Rokka no Yuusha is really a notably decent series. The mystery wasn\'t hard enough for a mystery nut, but the viewpoint with the most impact in this is keeping your self-confidence in your answer solid. The romance was a bonus too, I kinda liked the pairing. your precious index finger to the culprit? Dum-dum-duummmm......

They could\'ve added a few more ambience but with the setting and all, I can\'t really complain.Character - 6: All of them are unique, but I know most of us have seen their character personality on other anime characters. Straight-forward, Sly, etc. I don\'t really care about personality repeats due to the number of Anime out there (Well, personality is a limited value integer in the industry), but their personality choices also hints the answer to the crucial question. (If you don\'t get it, go watch Detective Conan or Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo).Enjoyment - 10: I gave it a personal 10 due to me being right in the end (YES!), but that\'s just me. It would really go random based on how a viewer sees the anime. I gave it a 10 due to me being correct on the question and after that spiraling and very confusing dilemmas, the after effect was like ""YEAH! I SAW THAT COMING MA!""-feeling (Wait.... I didn\'t say that IRL m\'kay?!).Overall - 8: Rokka no Yuusha is really a notably decent series. The mystery wasn\'t hard enough for a mystery nut, but the viewpoint with the most impact in this is keeping your self-confidence in your answer solid. The romance was a bonus too, I kinda liked the pairing.', 'I just finished my last three episodes of Rokka no Yuusha today, after binge-watching 9 episodes straight and going to sleep at 5AM. This anime had piqued my interest even before it was released just from the character designs.This is my first time ever writing a review and I’ve decided to do so because of this very anime.The story’s got good potential, but I felt as if the anime failed in being able to flesh it out completely and rather, it just did one massive – literal – loop with the story. You’d know what I mean if you decide to watch it.Don’t get me...wrong, Rokka no Yuusha – or rather, Braves of the Six Flowers isn’t an entirely bad series. It was quite good, but just to an extent.I honestly loved the character designs; Flamie’s design was the whole reason I wanted to watch it in the first place. Adlet’s hair was a bit too flamboyant for me, but in a way, I guess it matched his character. The other characters were done nicely as well; Goldov was a hunk and you never really get an insight on why Nachetanya decided to dress up like a rabbit or if Hans cat tail was fake or not. The 3D-ish take on the fiends were quite interesting and personally – this is probably just me though – I find the smoothness in their art oddly satisfying. The overall setting of the anime was rather typical of an adventure-action anime, so it was nothing new.In terms of storyline, I’m going to keep saying that it was indeed a wasted potential. I’m just so mad because it could’ve been so much more – but it wasn’t. The whole mystery genre didn’t really work out too well for it either and on top of that, the action genre played its part and yes, I admit that some fighting scenes were rather decent but all in all, there was no climax. I felt like there was fighting in there – especially between the Braves – just for the sake of fighting.Honestly, character development declined as the series went on. Especially for Adlet’s character. He had such a strong appearance in the beginning but its original flare was lost and then regained then lost and then regained and so on… However, a little bit of Adlet’s initial personality which drew me in did eventually make a solid comback towards the end. Nachetanya was poorly developed, in my opinion. Her character was a little all over the place and inconsistent, and that caused me to feel put off about how she was portrayed. She had the potential to be a main-main character – if you know what I mean – beside Adlet, and I believe that was what she was meant to be but then she was cast aside way too early in the story. Goldov was the one character that eventually became transparent towards the end, and it’s a shame because he was a character I really wanted to see come to life a lot more.Overall, Rokka no Yuusha isn’t bad. It just has a few holes here and there and you might become annoyed at how frequently you hear the phrase ‘I’m the strongest man in the world’ but if you’re into some adventure and some spot-the-imposter mystery, I’d say to give it a shot. If a better job was done with developing and tweaking the plot and characters a little, it could’ve truly become a gem. However, as it stands, I’m quite disappointed even after finishing the series and I know this sounds horrible but its left me with an inkling of a ‘maybe this wasted my time’ sort of feeling.

The beginning plot with the Goddess's prophecy is mainstream, but it is mixed with a mystery surprises the audience and I liked it. The story is amazingly made, so the audience will have no idea what is the answer to the mystery but if they watch it to the end. The animation is good, for a combat...anime and the movements are fluids, but it is not extraordinary. The sound is as good as the animation, with good combat sounds, but not enough to be exceptionnal. The characters are a special part, because some of them are really well made and thought, but some are too mainstream and follow some stereotypes, such as Adlet.That's why I gave a 7/10 rate to this series.I recommand this series to people that like adventure anime, but mostly to people that like mystery anime and combat anime. If you are new to anime, you should watch it, it is not very complicated or long to watch. anime and the movements are fluids, but it is not extraordinary.

What set the wheels of mystery in motion is the suspicion and doubt revolving around the fact that there are seven, not six, Braves that showed up at the supposed meeting place for the Heroes of the Six Braves that are chosen to fight the Majin.***(Potential spoilers; not too major.)***The central protagonist, Adlet Mayer, proclaims himself as ""the strongest man in the world.""...To him, the meaning of the title differs from most. He thinks it entails: someone who have power, skill, wisdom, heart, and last not least, luck. Also, that when one faces danger, he/she must be able to laugh at the situation, no matter how dire it might seem and/or become. With all of that in mind, Adlet navigated his way through the tense and ominous situations that he and the other Braves comes across, as a result of all the mystery, suspicion and doubts that surrounds them.Each character have their own features that separates them from each other. For Adlet, something that\'s notable about him would definitely be his fighting style; he usually intentionally uses tricks and unexpected tactics to fight his opponents, so that they are caught off guard. Such fighting style is heavily influenced by what he learned from his master, Atro Spiker. Something else that Adlet inherited from his master would be his views on life and because of that, he\'s rather different from most of the hero type-esque protagonists out there. A piece of advice that he remembers from his master that he still reflects on: ""My master told me...that it was thanks to my best friend and my sister, that I could become strong. I was able to become strong because I still believed in those words. That a man can\'t become strong for revenge\'s sake. He becomes strong because he believes in something. ... I didn\'t get strong for revenge... I\'m not fighting out of hatred. I became strong so that I won\'t lose anything.""***(Potential spoilers section over.)***The voice acting of the voice actors in this series worked well for their respective characters. Fremy\'s cold, quiet, yet somewhat detached-flat sounding voice fits how she comes to view others. Of course, as the story went on, her views changed through the interactions she had, particularly with Adlet and that shows in how she speaks. Chamo\'s childish sounding voice represents how she thinks and acts, despite being one of the strongest known Saints in the land. Mura\'s voice, firm, and mature shows how she presents herself (especially as she\'s the Head of all the Saints), and how she might seem to those around her. The voice for Nashetania is very lady-like, which resembles her being a princess. The voice that Saito Souma, Adlet\'s voice actor, used for Adlet suits his character well: smooth and clear--as it connects to his honesty and willingness to trust others. Hans\'s voice gives me the impression that he\'s laid-back and casual, yet calculated and logical--which he is; whenever I think of his voice, I also think of the sly smile that he usually makes. As for Goldof, his rough and low (and somewhat indifferent) sounding voice sets him apart from all the other characters.This was the series that I looked forward to watching the most from the summer 2015 season, besides from Durarara!! x2: Ten. Its premise caught my attention and made me really curious as to just how the story is going to be like in an animated format--and it certainly did not disappoint.

Each episode brings something new to the table, and it keeps you wondering just what the next part of the story is going to take you.

However, this anime has failed to make good use of all these great elements by giving us a drab and dragging plot-line.The characters also fail to connect (at least with me) until the very end. Only Adlet is the relate-able one in the bunch. The other characters seem to be just patch-ups or buffers to make him seem to have more depth.I expected this show to have a lot of action and intense plot-twists...but it didn't deliver that. They were talking 80% of the time which is weird given that this anime should be heavy on the genre of Action, Fantasy and Adventure and not Slice of Life or even Drama.It's not horrible. At the same time, it isn't great either. but it didn't deliver that.

The synopsis sounded a little promising, though, with six different people wielding unique powers that weren\'t the typical elements. The cover image looked intriguing as well; every character looked like he/she had some sort of secret to unveil. I was expecting an action-packed series revolving around this person who was the seventh saint.I liked the legend of the heroes of the six flowers, when seeing the threat of the demon king approaching their world in reality...was not that terrifying. I\'m not sure if that information is being saved for a second season or something, but all I knew of the demon king from the beginning was that his presence was like a black cloud that pervaded the land and everyone suddenly cowered in fear. Oh, and there were fiends, various grotesque monsters that attacked everyone (some of which could talk), but that seemed to be all.To be honest, while I knew that the series was going to be focused on revealing the identity of the impostor, I was really hoping that I could see them fight the Demon King. Unfortunately, that never comes to happen in these 12 episodes as it is of the utmost importance for them to rid themselves of the seventh before he/she kills them all. In the process of doing that, though, they come up with several theories as to what happened to cause this, and they waste a lot of time speculating on what will happen. What initially seemed like a good idea for a plot at the beginning became annoying.I\'m not a big fan of main characters falling in love with pretty girls right away, but when more history is explained and other characters are introduced to shake things up to strengthen or otherwise break relationships, I\'m happier. This isn\'t the typical love-at-first-sight romance, let me tell you that, but I won\'t mention anything more.The seven characters here are quite a gang of people. Aside from having distinct appearances and outfits, their fighting styles and weapons are very cool. Despite having recently discovered that they had been chosen to become one of the braves, they seem to have a good command of their newly acquired powers. Most of them acquire powers that are very similar to the skills that they already have, so it is merely an addition to their strengths.While there are the six of them to talk about, the main character is Adlet Mayer, and he certainly changes a lot in the span of 12 episodes. My first thought of him was that he was a conceited weakling with the over-the-top catch phrase: ""I am the strongest man in the world!"" He doesn\'t have the largest muscles anyone\'s ever seen, but he\'s stocked with clever tools that allow him to trick others for an instant, paralyze or poison them, etc. He\'s quick on his feet, thinks fast, and has quite long red hair that is slightly unkempt and tied back in a loose ponytail at the bottom of it.Strongest man in the world? Ha! I\'m sure everyone else in the show scoffed at him when he gave himself that title. While he doesn\'t look like he could beat Goldov in an arm wrestling contest, his actions later in the show do change your opinion of him after. He\'s capable of saying foolish things, but also of saying intelligent things. Adlet is a very positive person, and even when the situation looks the most bleak for him, he always has some bit of motivation to think of ways to turn things around. I came to like him better as the series came to a close.As I might have said so before, the animation for fight scenes were not bad. I at no time had trouble following the action, and since the characters had their own ways of dodging and attacking, their movements seemed new all the time and fresh on the scene. I especially liked the animations done for Chamot\'s powers.Art-wise, I was very impressed with the backgrounds of the anime and took several screenshots. The colors of characters\' irises and hair were vibrant, and the braves all had different body structures. It really wasn\'t bad.Some small things I didn\'t like were the fiends\' blood spillage (looked super unrealistic, but I guess it shouldn\'t be so bad since fiends and humans shouldn\'t have similar blood), characters\' faces from faraway (faces were a little funky), and two of the characters wearing chest bands (not protective at all for the rest of the torso!).I can\'t say that the soundtrack stood out to me very much for this anime. Most pieces fit the mood just fine (exhilarating action, imminent dread, revealed secret, etc.), but they weren\'t songs that I\'d remember forever. The opening and endings were also just all right for me. They are poppy and otherwise nice to listen to, but not my favorite things.I don\'t recall watching more than two episodes at once for this anime, so it wasn\'t the most interesting show to me. However, it did pick up in the last few episodes, so I was happy about that. It isn\'t a show I\'d recommend to people who like seeing a lot of progress, as the whole situation of them trying to uncover the seventh might seem like the characters are running around in circles. However, some characters are worth observing in action as they\'ve got great skills to show off.Without a doubt, though, the ending has much to ask for. It leaves room for a continuation of the series in a not-so-original fashion and I\'m not sure if there\'ll be one.

Somehow they decided to adapt it into an anime is beyond me.Story 3/10The story is about six people that were chosen to be the heroes that save the world from the demon king. It\'s ridiculously cliche, why would they write something that like this? But, there\'s a twist. Suddenly the seventh hero appeared outta nowhere, they suspected that one of them to be the fake hero. Apparently, the only way to tell that they were chosen is that...there\'s some kind of tattoo that appeared to indicate they were chosen. All seven of them appeared to have the tattoo, so instead of fighting the demon king or whatever, they decided to find out who\'s the fake one for like 7 episodes. Somehow all of them got trapped and unable to fight the demon king, how ridiculous. They decided to become detectives instead. What put me off is that the goddess magic power is so  easy to be copied that the fake one can easily create false tattoo.Romance in this story is even cheaper than highschool couples.Art 7/10The art is pretty decent and all but the color scheme seemed out of place.Sound 7/10It has some pretty enjoyable OSTs but the sound effects are not really suitable for what happened. The explosion SFX sounds so fake.Character 3/10The main protagonist is so annoying he keeps shouting ""I am the strongest man in the world"" every time he has the chance and he doesn\'t even have the strength to backup that claim. How stupid.The bunny princess is a complete bi--.Fremmy or whatever her name is an emo. Really?Most of the characters are annoying.Enjoyment 1/10Spending like 7 out of 12 episodes with no progression or whatsoever is definitely not gonna give you any enjoyment.Overall 3/10How people consider this to be good is beyond me. It\'s ridiculous. Don\'t waste your time on this anime. there\'s some kind of tattoo that appeared to indicate they were chosen.

It\'s ridiculous. Don\'t waste your time on this anime.', '""What you see is not always what it seems.""I think the statement above is applicable to this show.Rokka no Yuusha felt like the typical adventure-fantasy-magic-action anime, but after a few episodes, it explored a premise which is quite uncommon for those adventure-fantasy-magic-action anime; mystery. A mission to slay the Demon King suddenly got turned into a dangerous guessing game of ""who\'s the traitor?"" In the first place,that\'s what got me interested in this show.Although many reviewers say that the mystery aspect in the show is crappy, I think that it\'s actually quite decent (before the last episode at least). Yeah, maybe I\'m quite dense,...but I wasn\'t able to figure out who the traitor is. As the show progressed, my suspect list changed again and again, but in the end I guessed wrong. I like how the show managed to keep me guessing, trying to figure out the M.O of the culprit. Almost every one of the six (or should I say seven) heroes had a reason to be suspected, like their suspicious behaviour, the sudden close-ups...The ending spoilt the series though. The plot is progressing...then suddenly there\'s this twist. Surprise!!The one who is not what he/she seems is the traitor. It\'s good and bad at the same time. Yeah, it caught me off guard, but it made those earlier explanations seemed pointless. Like, what a waste of time. The revelation of the traitor\'s identity could have been executed better so that it doesn\'t feel so sudden and rushed.Frankly, those anticipating a battle between the heroes and some \'Big Bosses\' typically found in this kind of genre would be utterly disappointed, because more than half of the episodes were dedicated to the ""guessing game"". Action scenes are abundant, but it\'s mainly fights with the fiends and among the heroes. The action scenes make up for it, as battle scenes are fluid and done nicely. It was easy and entertaining to watch. The art is average, but sometimes it can be pretty as well; the sunsets were beautiful. The landscapes were diverse and colourful, but there was not too much detail given to it.The character designs are nice and pretty. I think that Flamie\'s design is very unique, with her white hair and eyes and also her attire. The main character, Adlet is also likeable, if you just look past his annoying \'strongest man in the world\' punchline. He\'s capable and is a genius, and he also got some background development. Only a few characters got background or developed, but the others didn\'t really felt unimportant. The cast is pretty colorful and diverse with all their different personalities. The VA\'s did a great job as they portray their characters excellently. Take Flamie for example, when she was emotionless, her voice sounded emotionless also. When she was sad, she sounded sad. It was befitting.The soundtracks used suit the events well. The OPs and the EDs gave the right vibe for this show, and I personally like the second OP.Despite all its flaws, I had fun guessing. However, I wouldn\'t recommend this show to someone looking for epic action and mind-boggling mystery,though. If you\'ve got some time to kill, this anime would do, take out the magnifying glass, and start analysing. but I wasn\'t able to figure out who the traitor is.

And I mean REALLY good. Not objectively flawless, but tremendously enjoyable and definitely addictive.It starts off as more of an action series, with the main mystery only really being introduced around a third of the way through. Although the series does change tone quite a lot once the mystery is introduced, if you liked the beginning few episodes chances are you’ll like the rest. On the other hand, if you didn’t like the first few episodes, give it a few more – up till about ep 6 - before deciding one way or the other. You...might be surprised.The setting was really unusual, what with the Aztec theme and everything. It gave a unique feel to the show, and was altogether a nice change. There wasn’t much world building that wasn’t directly related to the Braves. I wouldn’t have minded a bit more exposition, but it could easily have just become useless filler, so I’m basically glad they stuck to the parts they did.Whilst the story had some generic elements to it, there were a few twists that gave it more depth – the idea of the recurring 6 braves, the saints, the fiend culture and their relationship with humans. The whole way magic was portrayed in this show was unique and interesting.The characters were probably one of my favourite parts of this anime. The MC, Adlet, was exactly the type of character I can’t stand in most anime. However here I thought he was brilliant. His characteristics were just done right. Appropriate backstory, and only brought in when necessary. His backstory actually added a lot, explained his character, and was quite interesting. it didn’t feel like filler when brought in. He was also a character who was consistent in his personality traits, but mature enough to recognise his faults and overcome them. Above all, he wasn’t a hypocrite. He practiced what he preached, and I think that’s why I liked him so much, despite being fed up of hearing the words ‘strongest man in the world’ which he seemed to use every time he spoke.Fremy was also an excellent character. Her development was lovely to watch, and quite emotional at times too. Her backstory was fascinating, and, like Adlet’s, brought in at exactly the right time. I actually didn’t like her much initially, but by the end of the series she had completely won me over.Most of the other major characters were developed decently. Hans’ character in particular was fascinating, and I looked forward to every time he came on screen. Nachetanya and Mora could have done with a bit more time spent on their backstories, but the only one who really needed some more depth to them was Goldov. He was the only one dimensional brave, and as a result the only one I couldn’t have cared less about throughout the series.The mystery next. Some might call it slow paced, but I think the pacing was perfect. Each part of the mystery is explained in enough depth for the viewer to understand, but without going into every little detail. The anime managed to keep the suspense up throughout – you really are guessing who the 7th is right until the end. And it doesn’t contradict itself either, there are a lot of little hints hidden along the way but you can only put them together one you have enough info to understand what they meant in hindsight. It’s clever. I do think that at one point very near the end there was just a little too much coincidence at play, it was more like the screenwriters said ‘Oh hey! We’re nearly finished, and they haven’t got anywhere near close to solving it yet! Let’s just give the characters an epiphany!’ That part needed to have been drawn out more, although not at the expense of any of the other scenes. The anime really needed more than 12 episodes to get everything in properly.As for the art and animation, they were great. Lots of vibrant colours, which then darkened as the mood became grimmer. The way the op changed throughout the series was a nice touch, and fitting. The character designs were fine, although none of the animal characteristics were explained for anyone besides Hans. (I’m a bit curious about this. Maybe the light novel explains it?) The action scenes were mostly marvellous. Really well animated – well, except for the CGI attacks, some of which quite frankly looked poor. Especially Mora’s. A few CGI scenes didn’t make much difference overall though. The sound was good, no complaints on that front.Minor bugbear: Fremy’s outfit. There didn’t seem to be excessive fanservice in this show or anything, so I’m not taking a point off, but dressing her like that didn’t add anything whatsoever to the show. Whatever. Moving on.The ending was slightly disappointing, it felt somewhat rushed compared to the rest of the series, and I know I for one could have done with more explanation on a couple of the events. Hope there’s a second season, I can't wait to see how the rest of their adventure unfolds.Overall: A great watch. A few parts that felt rushed, but on the whole really enjoyable and entertaining. I’d recommend if you like whodunit mysteries, anime with good action scenes, or adventure series. XD might be surprised.The setting was really unusual, what with the Aztec theme and everything.

And the reason for a 7 will explained later on.So the backstory of this series is a Demon God once threatened mankind and a to combat this, a goddess selected six heroes, called Braves, to basically be her champion and to defeat the Demon God. Now the Demon God is reviving once again so another six Braves are to be selected to defeat it. Sounds trite already? Well don't be fooled, the backstory may be lackluster but the...execution is quite interesting.So our main point of view is from Adelet, a self proclaimed 'strongest man in the world', and it starts off with him basically ruining a martial arts tournament by interrupting it. He gets overwhelmed by the guards and is then thrown in jail. As expected, he's chosen as one of the six Braves along with the princess of the country. They leave/escape together and make their way towards the location where the Braves are supposed to meet. Basically a bunch of other character introductions are made and we're at a more interesting part.When all the Braves meet up, there are seven instead of six, meaning that one of them is an imposter. The seal at the temple that they arrive at also activates and a fog settles in which seals them within the area. Adelet is assumed the imposter because he was the first to arrive then a series of detective work ensues which makes the rest of the episodes very interesting.It concludes with the correct imposter being found out, but on the final episode another character is introduced who is also a 'Brave', thus the mystery continues.The way it concludes leaves a fairly unsatisfying end, the series could have been 24 episodes to give us a better ending, though perhaps the source material does not have enough at the moment (haven't read it). As such, judging by the anime alone, the story is only at a 7.Art: 8I liked the character designs and how each one had their own unique costumes. The male protagonists did not look generic and the females character weren't just oversexualised nonsense that you would find in any hentai. The backgrounds tended to be blurred out to focus on the characters and the CGI was not amazing, but I suppose acceptable.Sound: 9Though personally I wouldn't listen to the OP or ED independently, I think they flowed really well with their corresponding sequences, especially the ED. The ED just had this very good vibe to it that left it memorable.As for the voice acting, I think the characters' voice selections were appropriate. For those who loved Gosick and especially loved Victorique's voice actor, you should have a sense of familiarity when Fremy speaks. I absolutely love the way that Aoi plays out her role as Fremy, as she's able to carry out Fremy's feelings very well.Character: 6This was where I felt it became a bit uninteresting and I will specify each character as best I can.Adelet - He just became really annoying with his constant preachings of 'I am the strongest man in the world' nonsense. His backstory is more of the vengeful type, but he doesn't really develop as the episodes went on.Fremy - Probably my favourite character even if it wasn't voiced by Aoi. It was quite a shock when she revealed herself as half Fiend and half human. her backstory was what lead her to be as cold as she is to other people. But her change from being cold to becoming more open when Adelet declared his love for her was just really well done.Goldov - He's basically a whiteknight for Nashetania and has no other real characteristics.Chamo - Basically a violent loli who obeys Mora (Oba-chan) for non-stated reasons.Mora - It's still very vague as to what she's really like, but it seems that she likes to jump to conclusions because they're easier and just at hand.Hans - Another interesting character that was fleshed out quite a bit. He's an assassin whose fighting style is based on cats (still better than the concept of Ant man), and has a pretty good understanding of people due to his occupation. And despite his occupation he can be quite trusting as shown later on.SPOILER AHEAD!!!!Nachetania - She didn't start off that interesting, just another sheltered princess who wished to explore the world. It doesn't really change throughout most of the episodes, though she does snap at one point. And even when she's revealed as the traitor it just felt a little unsatisfying the way she revealed herself and how very little was explained.Enjoyment: 8The execution of the fight scenes are decent, though by my standards they aren't amazing. The flow of the episodes don't feel rushed nor are they boringly slow. The use of CGI tends to make me dislike the Fiend vs Braves fight scenes but otherwise it's not too bad.Overall: 7So I guess the conclusion was what made the series less appealing than it should have. Adelet was getting really annoying with that whole 'strongest man in the world' slogan execution is quite interesting.So our main point of view is from Adelet, a self proclaimed 'strongest man in the world', and it starts off with him basically ruining a martial arts tournament by interrupting it. He gets overwhelmed by the guards and is then thrown in jail. As expected, he's chosen as one of the six Braves along with the princess of the country.

Towards the middle to end of the series it turns into a mystery anime with lots of plot twist etc, and then they spend the rest of the anime trying to solve it.  But each episode...keeps you hooked and wanting to see more.Art 9/10 The art is very pleasing to look at, all the character designs look unique and the monsters look fierce and intimidating.Sound 8/10 The soundtrack fits well with the anime, the fight scenes are really fun to watch and really sets the mood for epic battles.Character 6/10  I gave the characters such a low rating because there really is no character development besides the main protagonists.  All you get for most of the characters are their names and fighting technique, they give you the backstories of about 2 of the characters but the rest are kind of just there.I really enjoyed watching this anime just to see what happens next since this show really likes their cliffhangers.

The characters all have the same goals, but doubt each other and sometimes even you as the viewer doubt who is trustworthy. It is a nice mind-bending anime, with some interesting characters, and decent enough story but can possibly get kind of stagnant to some as it doesn't really progress. Also cliffhanger.Should you Watch?Try it. It might surprise you. "", ""Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers focuses on a group of six chosen warriors called the Six Braves tasked to slay the leader of the demon race known as the Demon King. However in an unusual series of events, there are seven Braves gathered together and one among the group is an impostor suspected of working on behalf of the demon race. This mystery serves as the major storyline for much of the show's run as the Braves try to determine who among them is the fake. Many of the characters within the series fulfill certain archetypes typical of this storytelling style with our major...leads of focus, Adlet and Fremy, getting major focus as the series focuses on their developing bond and how their current situation tests their trust in one another. While I didn't mind Adlet as our hero of focus as he struggles to clear any suspicion of being the fake chosen warrior, I wasn't too convinced of his budding relationship with Fremy since there's limited development in the relationship due to the greater focus on the mystery of the fake Brave. The rest of the group don't get as much fleshing out since Adlet and Fremy are the main focus of the series.As for the mystery surrounding the fake Brave, much of its focus revolves around Adlet being immediately accused of being the suspect as he tries to clear his name and try assessing events that led to the gathering of the seven Braves, along with any actions from the other Braves that could prove they are really the fake. The series takes its time with Adlet getting in confrontations with each of the Braves to assess their characters and determine if they would have any ulterior motives to being the fake Brave. However, these moments often cause progression in the plot to drag since it felt like there were points where the show's creators were trying to pad out time to fill the anime's twelve episode length. Who is ultimately revealed to be the fake Brave felt too convenient since there were hardly any hints dropped of the mentioned character having their motives. Outside of the series being incomplete after its 12-episode run due to its light novel source material still ongoing as of this review, the series tosses in a plot twist in its final episode that may anger fans due to the issues that came up from the mystery played out with uncovering who the fake Brave was.Visually, Rokka is rather pleasing on the eyes offering nicely drawn scenic shots and detailed character designs, with muscle tone being depicted with a number of the Braves' character designs. While not seen too often due to the show being more focused on its mystery plot, the designs of demons are varied and have a good amount of detail to them in spite of the CG animation used for their rendering sticking out like a sore thumb. Animation is fluid for the most part in the series, with characters moving about at a fluid pace and showing off some intense looking action scenes coming off the varying magical and combative abilities of the characters. Much like the demons, some of these magical abilities are rendered in CG animation such as Nashetania's blades and the swamp animals spewed out of Chamo's stomach.Overall, I'm mostly indifferent to Rokka. While the series attempts to go for something different for its fantasy-adventure genre with its mystery plot, the pacing for it felt dragged out, the majority of the characters don't get much in the way of fleshing out and the revelation of who the fake Brave is was rather lackluster due to the lack of foreshadowing to it. It's a decent time killer for what it offers up, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend rewatching it. leads of focus, Adlet and Fremy, getting major focus as the series focuses on their developing bond and how their current situation tests their trust in one another.

I really liked the premise since the inclusion of “saints”, prophecies and magic were intricately woven into the story. There is no “Rokka no Yuusha” without a fantasy world.Most importantly, it was NOT an isekai when it had potential to be. Automatic pointsI liked the plot, the progression of the mystery, and the character development. The only thing that really bothered me was the random ending, which made...me feel that the lead-up was kind of pointless when the “damning evidence” was so simply obtained.Art 9/10I’m not picky with artstyle on its own, but Rokka definitely has an especially well thoguhout style and art direction. It really embodied “Ancient prophecy” and “mystery” all in one. The character designs were pretty stellar. Very charming and unique. I’m sick of short black/brown haired protagonists. If it’s fantasy, make things fantastical!The use of colour was amazing. The animations for horses were not CGI, which shocked me since that’s standard practice nowadays. The way magic and skilled were animated didn’t strike me as jarring even if it wasn’t animated by hand. The action scenes were well animated. I’m actually shocked I hadn’t heard a peep about this show until I went out searching.Soundtrack 10/10The soundtrack as a whole gave me “Blessed Messiah and the Tower of Ai” vibes, which I’m certain is the only correct soundtrack for a show like this. The voice acting was pretty stellar. The sound effects were average, but I don’t expect much for sound effects.Character 10/10This show is a good example of what happens when you develop a bunch of characters separately and throw them in a room together. The show didn’t explore too many characters’ backstory, likely due to time constraints, but never onces did a character do something I though was out of their character to do (aside from perhaps the imposter, which ought to make sense). Most of the characters have clear-cut goals, and clearly have preferred methods to reach those goals, which I highly appreciate.The main character was in no way OP, nor useless. He had his strengths and his weaknesses, and never did that change in the show. His strengthes were backed up by his past, and his weaknesses developed as a downside to his strengths. He’s strong-willed and determined? Well that makes him stubborn even when he’s wrong. He’s a quick thinker and has great slight of hand? That just makes him less trustworthy to others. This show is reasonable with powers. I liked that.The supporting cast was hit-or-miss in terms of development. Some felt paper-thin, while others could probably have series of their own where they are the MCs. Regardless, everyone had a goal, and everyone had a set behaviour, which is already better than a lot of mainstream anime.Enjoyment 9/10Watched this while working. It was very easy to follow, and didn’t push the boundaries of realism too much. Sometimes I was confused on exactly how smart the MC was.

Good animation and sound, nothing mindblowing but not lacking either.The biggest shortcoming, or a plus, depending on your preferences is the fact that the story talks about 6 heroes destined to take on a powerful Demon god starting a continental war. Which sounds like you're about to get a nice dose of epic fantasy battles.However, the actual story ends up boiling down to said 6 heroes getting together and discovering they are actually 7 in number,...and stuck within a trap to boot.

The characters have a decent amount of depth and you'll definitely go through a rollercoaster of emotions trying to figure out who's the extra.In the end though you can't help but to feel like you're left with blue balls as the anime ends without showing us how the heroes fare against the Demon god in the ultimate battle.This is an anime that could have really used a few 20+ episode seasons to actually cover the entire storyline it promises. and stuck within a trap to boot.

True it wasn\'t that bad, but when you have high expectations, even the slightest bad can change your opinion completely.  This time, a review on a rather new anime, ROKKA NO YUUSHA.Plot and Story LineThis is again one of the stories based on an old legend, with a bit magic and...a couple of heroes. Tough it differs a bit and has it\'s special taste. Now, off to the plot!The story is set in, let\'s say, ancient times. The temples and backgrounds do kinda look like the towns of the Maya or the Incas. I loved the setting for this anime. In such old times, legend were a normal thing. On one of those legends is our anime based on. It\'s been told that when the Demon God awakens from the depths of darkness, the Goddess of Fate will select six heroes and bequeath them with the power to save the world. One of those heroes is also our main protagonist Adlet, that claims to be the strongest man in the world. He is a skillful fighter with a little trick here and there. He has a very unique fighting style but gets locked away after getting into a fight with the strongest warriors of the kingdom. What a will, I would say.While being in custody one night, the time to choose the new generation of the Brave Six came. He was one of the lucky ones to get a blossom tattoo on his hand along with the princess of the kingdom whom he\'s met some time ago. They start they journey together and hit it off with each other right from the beginning. Their first goal is to find the other four Braves and then draw into the battle against the Demon God together.Finally united the Braves realize something very unnatural. There are seven of them. One is a fake. One is the enemy. And they have to figure out who that one is.The anime is interesting in the beginning, but as episodes go on it becomes kinda boring. It does keep you on tenterhooks and you can\'t wait to hear who the ""Seventh"" one is but I found it rather boring. At some time in the anime I even gave up guessing who the fake is. All their theories become stupid, and the ""magic-action-fantasy"" anime becomes just a stupid and boring wannabe Sherlock Holmes. Don\'t think it\'s a spoiler now, but even the final theory about who the fake is, is so dull and it doesn\'t make any sense. It really gave the show the final blow to the self-destruction.There have been some bright moments, and by that, I mean the rare but good action and fight scenes. I was so looking forward to the fight with the Demon God but the whole Sherlock Holmes act, ruined the story that the anime was actually about in the beginning. You get the feeling that the makers wanted to solve the problem about the seventh very quickly, but got lost in doing so, and forgot what they actually wanted to do. Please!Now there is one more segment of the story that kinda brightened it up a little. It\'s the relationship development between Adlet and Fremy. From hatred to love and trough a deep character development. A side story about self-acceptance and finding a place you belong. Now is there something better. True it also got annoying by the time just as every other part of the story.On the whole, the story is good, I can\'t deny. But it got boring in time. It was not as good as I expected and the whole guessing who the fake is part put the main story and the very intriguing legend part into the shadow.Animetion and StyleAh, 2015. What a beautiful year full of awesome animation. Just remember Gangsta and God Eater, then Noragami Aragoto, and don\'t forget Death Parade and Tokyo Ghoul (A). They all share a beautiful and detailed animation and style, and let me now ask you! What on Earth happened to Rokka no Yuusha. The animation is so poor in colors and details. The style is on a 2006 level, and Code Geass is even better than this being from 2006. There are some beautiful views, but they are very rare. And besides, the only interesting character looks are the ones from Fremy and princess Nashetania (and I am really not sure about the second one because it lines with a cliche look). I expected a better job here, but okay...ConclusionOn the whole the anime Rokka no Yuusha is not bad, but it also isn\'t that good. I really expected it to be better especially because of the legend and heroes stuff but I was disappointed in the end. There are some good parts, no denying. So in short now. If you like mystery and anime where there is, let\'s say, a case to be solved Rokka no Yuusha would be an awesome recommendation for you. But if you want a good legend and an adventure don\'t watch this. Instead try Akatsuki no Yona or No Game No Life, that would be way better.Your AnimeGirl a couple of heroes.

This review is spoiler free.Story (10/10)Rokka no Yuusha is a story of how the 6 heroes are told to gather but 7 came, 12 episodes are spent on finding out the identity of the 7th (or maybe like 8 episodes because the first few episodes are prologues). The mystery aspect is really interesting to a lot of people, so most people watched it expecting they might had their share of fun trying to find out who the culprit is. But even for me that rarely read or watch...mytery genres, the mystery genre is a bit stupid. Some things are happening out of nowhere that might've been a huge clue to the mystery.Art (8/10)The art is really great, good character designs, some minor thing that puts me off was how some important effects are made in CG instead of hand-drawn. To make my point clearly, it was the saint of blades' blades, it doesn't look like a blade at all, and more like a weird spiky white thing flying in the air. And speaking of character designs, the heroes design was really well made, except for one person. Well you will know what I mean by watching it.Sound (8/10)Nothing much to say, the soundtrack is good. And the op/ed is quite good too.Character (8/10)The characters had some unique personalities, great backstory too. The only downfall was how it was not covering all 7 heroes enough. Some of the heroes didn't have their backstory explained at all. But for me that is understandable because the story wasn't actually finished.Enjoyment (10/10)I think Rokka no Yuusha is standing perfectly between fantasy-adventure, action, and mystery. I loved the setting of Rokka no Yuusha, about how there are saints and demon god, the mayan setting is also a really unique nuance in anime. The mystery was a bit too easy, and sometimes breaks its own logic, like how a simple premise might destroy the whole assumptions that's been going of how the events happened. But mystery is not the only thing Rokka no Yuusha got, the action scene was really good too, not overly relying on magic or superpowers but still had some of that aspects.Overall (10/10)It might be weird to rate it 10/10 despite how many rants I just made. But I just loved the balanced between the genres: fantasy-adventure, mystery, and action. It might not be the best action there is (yeah I'm looking at you FSN UBW) or the best mytery plot. But it stands inbetween perfectly (just my opinion). And thats why I rated it 10/10. mytery genres, the mystery genre is a bit stupid.

I was pleasantly surprised at how wrong I was because it was actually really good quality, I would say this is really one of the better shows I\'ve watched in a while.Strong points1) The music in this show is really good, it\'s so well done that it was immediately one of the things I noticed the most while watching, and that usually...never happens early on.  All in all every situation and scenario was backed up by some impressive music.2) The main plot of the story actually has some suspense and mystery that keeps you wanting to watch more with each episode, it is very consistent throughout the show and the pacing is really excellent.  It was fresh and entertaining throughout each episode, with a good balance of some light-heartedness mixed in with an overall serious and mature tone carrying out the main script.  No cheap gimmicks or stupid nonsensical scenarios digressing from the progression of events, nothing embarassing or shameful really being presented here (despite some character designs which I\'ll briefly mention later...).3) The anime was executed very well and this is its strongest point.  I have to say I was really impressed by the way critical events were presented.  All of the fight scenes were high quality and were really original and well choreographed.  They were creative and entertaining with some solid animation, which even implemented some CGI!  Even simple stand offs were backed with heavy dialogue because the stakes behind each conversation were suspenseful.  Even the romantic aspects of this show were done very well and it was extremely well implemented and subtle.  It was ""intelligent.""  The conversations that occurred throughout the show really had some substance.  The script writing and mono/dialogues were really excellent at times.  One can definitely tell that the entire 12 episodes was written and carried out meticulously to provide one quality package, even at times highlighting small details shown in previous episodes.4) Some of the characters were actually well done in terms of character development and uniqueness (and some were very generic).  They were all presented well and each one had a clear sense of character & individuality.  Each had a fair amount of evenly distributed screen time as well.-Small note but there is also some small amount of film editing done here at times as well.  It\'s really not that big of a deal, but just thought I\'d like to point that out because I can appreciate those small details.  It just adds to the flavor that there was a certain amount of effort put into this show and gives a sense of atmosphere to anyone curious about the quality of presentation.Weak points1) The premise leading up to the main plot of the story is really really weak.  It\'s a typical, cliche-like background story of heroes fighting evil, but that\'s only used as a setting.  Surprisingly enough, the focus of the entire show is something much more complex, sinister, and surprisingly entertaining, at least for this 12 show period.2) The clothing for Nashatania & Fremy was really distracting, so much so that I have to list this aspect as a weak point.  I would even go as far to say, if all the character designs in this show were a little more appealing, desirable, inspiring, and original in my eyes, this would have been an easy overall 8 instead of a 7 in my book.  That\'s how much it bothered me at times.  It\'s even stranger because really there is literally no blatant fanservice in this show, it\'s just an issue with those two character\'s models.  It\'s weird because the show takes itself and everything which occurs throughout seriously, but because of those two designs in particular it made me feel more detached to what was going on than I actually wanted to be since everything else was done so well!3) Out of all 7 characters, really only a few of them were interesting.  Hopefully there will be a 2nd season which either strengthens some of the weaker character\'s developments, or either introduces new and interesting characters.In the end this is how I felt after watching.  To sum up my feelings, this show has so many strong points but is minorly flawed due to the show\'s poor choices in overall character designs and models.  I really felt there was too strong of a contrast here.  If we\'re talking about just presentation and execution of the show though, there\'s really no shortage of good quality here.  Even though the overall story is really bland and uninspiring, it speaks volumes for the quality in the way the actual show was presented in terms of execution.  One of the better shows out there, which left me wanting more. never happens early on.

A few of the Braves meet up early and set-off on a journey to find the other, and during the journey they fight a few enemies.  Then once they all meet up, there are a total of seven, but they were supposed to be only 6 Braves.  From that point, the whole story goes down hill in my opinion.  It became a whole new anime, because it was solely focused on who the fake was.  All...of the Braves were suspicious, and it turned into a game of _Who Done It?_  There were a few small fights among them, but the story turned boring for my taste.  The only reason why the anime can be consider a mystery is because one of them is fake, but I did not find it mysterious at all.Then there is one of the MC\'s, Adlet Meyer, that claims to be ""Strongest Man in the World,"" but he is the weakest of the whole group.  He is a little bit intelligent, but relies on luck most of the time.Surprisingly, this anime as a high rating. of the Braves were suspicious, and it turned into a game of _Who Done It?_  There were a few small fights among them, but the story turned boring for my taste.

Despite a very promising premise, the execution gets stonewalled and trapped in Mystery Plot that wastes the entire runtime of the season.  Wouldn't recommend wasting your time.The setting is very promising, a kind of Medieval MesoAmerican civilization world.  The Story concept plays out in, what I would call, a Seven Samurai kind of theme.  Where 7, mostly stranger, warriors are called to arms to defend the world from Demons.  Except instead of waiting in a single town to repel bandits, they are going out themselves to face the bandits.And the characters are more or less similar in execution as...well.  A bunch of flawed individuals with variable pasts who all have to overcome past traumas, learn to trust and work together, if they want any chance of succeeding in their quest.However, Only a few episodes into the show, they all get trapped in a Mystery Room kind of set-up.  And it lasts for like 7 episodes.  It's not that this concept is necessarily bad, but it wastes the entire run-time of the season on In-Fighting and Trying to solve a mystery.  But the key draw of any mystery is that information is always revealed or given to the viewers in a way that it never outright reveals the solutions, but gives the viewers a chance to uncover the mystery themselves.This Mystery lacks that entirely.  The solution at the end has essentially no means for anyone to understand it until it's reveled at the end.  Its frustrating to watch from episode 5 onwards, basically.The Promising Nature of an adventure is just stopped; and there is a cliffhanger character introduction at the end that reveals an attempt at a following Season; but they really ruin their chance with how bad they deal with pacing, and how they treat the viewers.The Action, Character Designs, Art-Design, Sound; all more than good enough for a good show.  It fails entirely in story and direction.  There is a lot of CG usage when it comes to myriads of monsters and effects, that's something to just accept with Anime these days, comparable to Overlord in how out of place it feels, but that's easy to look past in my opinion.  What I can't look past is bad character development, and poor story progression and such. well.

If you care to read the summary before reviews, you would know that this anime centers around Adlet Meyer, self proclaimed \'Strongest Man in the World\'. In a universe where an ancient Demon God was sealed away by the Goddess of Fate, Adlet aims to be one of ""the Braves of Six Flowers"" to fight the Demon God and keep the fiends at bay upon his reawakening. However, after meeting up with the other Braves, there turns out to be, not six, but...seven?! One is...a fake! And so the anime tells its story.Story ~7~:I am all for a mystery tale~ Especially if its told in a fantasy setting, what a steal! The anime focuses solely on the question of why there might be seven Braves when there\'s only supposed to be six. It skips needless travel time that doesn\'t help the plot at all. Something I was very grateful for since I despise shows that focus all on the travelling and never get to the plot until the second season *cough*AkatsukinoYona*cough* And so for the first of many episodes, the story remained wonderfully focused on the Braves fighting amongst themselves.However, no story is perfect and this one certainly isn\'t. A development happened between two characters that would have needed more time spent on the travel between destinations. I was very angered that the creator implemented this into the story when there was no previous development leading up to it. These characters interactions were very limited, and what happened between them just didn\'t add up with the scenes the viewer was presented.And when the fake Brave was finally revealed, the same problem arose. How? How was the viewer supposed to guess this from the limited scenes they were in? The fake Brave definitely needed some more background that they did not receive.Art ~8~:This show\'s art is absolutely breathtaking. The character\'s looks and movements are so detailed and fluid. Even the backdrops were given special attention. The CGI in the anime definitely does not distract, so that\'s a good thing. In some scenes, I did question the animators\' background choices, as it looked like characters were stuck in a room with the walls painted at points, but those scenes were few and far between.Sound ~7~:I have never seen an anime with only 12 episodes have so many OPs and EDs. I had trouble keeping track at first. Like ""Wait, did I hear that song before? Am I going crazy?"" No, I wasn\'t going crazy, but while watching the show the songs seem to blend a bit before one recognize they\'re not the same as the previously played song. The songs are plain and not all that interesting. Once you listen to them enough you\'ll know them enough to start singing along to them. (I\'m actually listening to them all in a playlist just so I can remember how they go to write this section. Shhh don\'t tell anyone!) The soundtrack, which I cannot find on YouTube to listen to is nice, and definitely suited for a fantasy story. Which might be why I like the fantasy genre so much anyway. Besides magic. Everyone knows magic is bae. Anyway. Music is good. Woo.Character ~6~:Characters! WOOO BOY. First of all. DEVELOPMENT. Yeah, there\'s hardly any development with the characters. The audience knows just enough of their history to get by, but we don\'t know these characters, really. And that\'s why the many different relationships between them just don\'t make any sense. But I guess this is what the creator wanted as it makes me want to read the manga. Now, that said, it\'s not like there weren\'t good characters. Some had no backstory or development *cough*Goldov*cough* but others, like our main character had plenty. I\'m just glad Adlet wasn\'t a dull main character. Those can be pretty boring to watch.Enjoyment ~9~:Man, it\'s like anime is just a promotion for the creator\'s manga series or something. Yes, I very much enjoyed this anime. I watched it while I was supposed to be spending time with my boyfriend. I downloaded six episodes to watch on a plane ride (and I only got to finish 3 of those six). And then I stay up till God knows what time in the morning to complete the series. Yikes.Overall ~7~:I enjoyed it, but even I can admit it\'s an anime with flaws. MAL\'s 7.4 or whatever rating for it is actually dead on. It\'s a great show that paves the way for the manga. It\'s interesting, and yet frustrating as it doesn\'t live up to the full potential that I want it to have cause I am just God of the animes or something.BASICALLYIf you like fantasy shows, give this a watch. It\'s not bad, by all means. It\'s a show that one shouldn\'t expect more from. It\'s exactly what it says it is. A story about six heroes, and when they find a seventh, it\'s mortal combat! Literally. There\'s hardly any fighting of fiends. Although I guess there\'s enough to satiate the desire to destroy non-human creatures.~Now for more personal opinions no one asked for~Favorite Ship: Hans X Adlet (gotta love that BxB)Favorite Character: Hans (Nyaa!)Favorite Song: ""Secret Sky"" by MICHI (seriously, this had me interested from the start) a fake! And so the anime tells its story.Story ~7~:I am all for a mystery tale~ Especially if its told in a fantasy setting, what a steal!

Even the backdrops were given special attention. The CGI in the anime definitely does not distract, so that\'s a good thing. In some scenes, I did question the animators\' background choices, as it looked like characters were stuck in a room with the walls painted at points, but those scenes were few and far between.Sound ~7~:I have never seen an anime with only 12 episodes have so many OPs and EDs. I had trouble keeping track at first. Like ""Wait, did I hear that song before? Am I going crazy?"" No, I wasn\'t going crazy, but while watching the show the songs seem to blend a bit before one recognize they\'re not the same as the previously played song. The songs are plain and not all that interesting. Once you listen to them enough you\'ll know them enough to start singing along to them. (I\'m actually listening to them all in a playlist just so I can remember how they go to write this section. Shhh don\'t tell anyone!) The soundtrack, which I cannot find on YouTube to listen to is nice, and definitely suited for a fantasy story. Which might be why I like the fantasy genre so much anyway. Besides magic. Everyone knows magic is bae. Anyway. Music is good. Woo.Character ~6~:Characters! WOOO BOY. First of all. DEVELOPMENT. Yeah, there\'s hardly any development with the characters. The audience knows just enough of their history to get by, but we don\'t know these characters, really. And that\'s why the many different relationships between them just don\'t make any sense. But I guess this is what the creator wanted as it makes me want to read the manga. Now, that said, it\'s not like there weren\'t good characters. Some had no backstory or development *cough*Goldov*cough* but others, like our main character had plenty. I\'m just glad Adlet wasn\'t a dull main character. Those can be pretty boring to watch.Enjoyment ~9~:Man, it\'s like anime is just a promotion for the creator\'s manga series or something. Yes, I very much enjoyed this anime. I watched it while I was supposed to be spending time with my boyfriend. I downloaded six episodes to watch on a plane ride (and I only got to finish 3 of those six). And then I stay up till God knows what time in the morning to complete the series. Yikes.Overall ~7~:I enjoyed it, but even I can admit it\'s an anime with flaws. MAL\'s 7.4 or whatever rating for it is actually dead on. It\'s a great show that paves the way for the manga. It\'s interesting, and yet frustrating as it doesn\'t live up to the full potential that I want it to have cause I am just God of the animes or something.BASICALLYIf you like fantasy shows, give this a watch. It\'s not bad, by all means. It\'s a show that one shouldn\'t expect more from. It\'s exactly what it says it is. A story about six heroes, and when they find a seventh, it\'s mortal combat! Literally. There\'s hardly any fighting of fiends. Although I guess there\'s enough to satiate the desire to destroy non-human creatures.~Now for more personal opinions no one asked for~Favorite Ship: Hans X Adlet (gotta love that BxB)Favorite Character: Hans (Nyaa!)Favorite Song: ""Secret Sky"" by MICHI (seriously, this had me interested from the start)', 'Rokka no Yuusha is a bit of an odd anime – it starts like a shounen adventure series, but is actually a locked room mystery. Not only that, it’s set in a fantasy Mesoamerican-inspired rainforest setting. It doesn’t really deliver much on the mystery front, but it was a passable watch nonetheless.Let me start by zeroing in on the mystery aspect. The idea is that seven heroes show up to go and slay the Demon God. The problem is that there are only supposed to be six. Moreover, something happens that turns it into a locked-room mystery where one person definitely appears to have bad...intentions. So far, so good. I thought it was a pretty intriguing twist on the “heroes go to defeat the big bad evil guy” trope.There is a lot of interpersonal drama, accusing, blaming, convincing, fighting and who knows what other interactions between characters, all in an attempt to figure out who the fake hero is. Unfortunately, barely any of these interactions are based on logic, facts or clues. With some mysteries, it’s fun for the viewer to puzzle out what has happened by paying attention. Don’t even try that with Rokka no Yuusha, because there is no way to figure the mystery out. The solution gets pulled out of someone’s ass at the end of the season, and there is no way to have foreseen this. So as a mystery, Rokka no Yuusha fails completely.Now, why do I give this a “mixed feelings” rating rather than a straight-up “not recommended”?For one, some of the characters are entertaining to see in action, be it combat or dialogue. Especially the main character, Adlet, is pretty interesting when he’s not going off on his “I am the strongest man in the world” spiel. He’s not really all that powerful, but uses a lot of gadgets, tricks and the power of science in general to accomplish his goals. This is unconventional in a setting where powerful people tend to be full-fledged warriors or special magic users called Saints.Anyway, character designs are fine for the most part and it was fun enough to see them interact with one another. Especially the bond between Adlet and Fremy was worth seeing develop. At least Fremy is a tsundere character for whom the tsundere aspect actually makes sense. Aside from those two, Hans was quite the character as well.The backgrounds were all drawn very well, but the 3D CGI looked awful.Sound effects were fine, and the soundtrack was well chosen for each scene. I can appreciate it when these choices are done well.Finally, the Mesoamerican-inspired setting was quite novel. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that in an anime. We even got to see alpacas/llamas, and random background characters wore a lot of colorful fabrics. My only gripe with this is that while the background art was good and the setting unusual, most of the series actually takes place in a single area. This is such a missed opportunity. We could have seen so many more beautiful sights if this hadn’t been the case.Unfortunately, the series’ finale is unsatisfying. This season felt like a single arc that sets the stage for so much more and would transition into a completely different second season. But there is no second season. Which is a shame, because the ending leaves many big questions unanswered. Apparently only the first volume of some light novel has been adapted and did poorly enough not to warrant a second season.As badly as the mystery sucked, I still mostly enjoyed my time with Rokka no Yuusha.

This anime is not for you.First of all I\'d like to keep my reviews short so let\'s get to the point with no unnecessary summaries.Rokka no Yuusha is like a lost amnesiac child not knowing where to go, who he is, where did he come from and what to do in the future. It tries to blend fantasy, adventure, action and mystery but ends up mixing a bubbling witch cauldron with contents god...knows what.Again what was this story about? Oh, it\'s about a group of 6 braves + 1 disguised enemy among them and it\'s up to our heroes to find the culprit! Yeah, so much for defeating the evil king, somewhat, somewhere this show became sherlock holmes, but oh, don\'t expect some exciting, brain-wracking mystery to solve here because none of the characters here apparently uses their brain properly. Very dumb mystery solving story that only manages to move on bathing with a bucketful of red herring. Story doesn\'t need more elaboration, 2 points speaks enough.Character designs is medi- okay I guess with a good choice of color palette and blended well with the ambiance and background. Animation is ""rough""--too few key frames-- noticeable inconsistency and quality drops quite often. Good clouds though, if only the camera angled more upwards. And lighting was decent too.BGMs are very very generic and it irritated me up to some point. But at least the ED songs returned some of my sanity, except for 1 song.The characters deserves as much hatred as the story. Besides Fremy, they are all stale while some (princess) took a wild, badly-handled U-turn ending up in a messy accident. Sigh. But hey, at least the supporting cast have their own unique color.If you are a TRUE mystery fan, I pity you. With nothing but red herrings all around the plot, you must have smelled quite bad after 12 episodes. A 5 for making me stay throughout the run.Overall, not recommended whether you are a mystery, fantasy, action or adventure lover.

Well I wouldn't necessarly say Rokka No Yuusha did the genre wrong... They certainly made some rookie mistakes that ruined the series for me... This review will contain no spoilers so if you haven't watched the anime yet don't worry.The mystery genre can be a tricky genre to do right as it generally takes a pretty smart person and some knowledge on the mystery genre to be able...to properly leave hints and clues. You have to scatter random pieces of information and figure out ways to make sure the viewer overlooks it as it's a small detail or random information at the time. Rokka No Yuusha did this pretty well, figuring out how they did it was a little bit hard and entertaining. However the problem lied in figuring out who did it... Just from having a basic knowledge of the genre you can tell who did it. One of the worst things you can do in the mystery genre is not give EVERY single one of your characters a reason to why they could and couldn't have done it. Everybody needs to be under suspicion or it's gonna draw some major attention to the one person who's not. This is where the anime went wrong. They left a certain character to just sit back and act like there was no way they could have done it. They tried to make the character go unseen and forgotten about so much that they made it obvious on who it was. Everything else about this anime was great, the artwork, the characters, the music etc. However that one rookie mistake kind of ruined the plot of the anime for me.I do recommend Rokka No Yuusha though, like I said everything else was perfect, the artwork, the characters even the few fight scenes. This anime may not be the best in the mystery side but it certainly excels in other departments to still make this anime enjoyable and worth watching. to properly leave hints and clues.

Two meet up immediately and off they go on an adventure for a typical adventure story. The plan is to meet with the other 4 right outside demon land. They meet 2 more and turns out one of the heroes used to be a baddie, but everybody is buddy buddy in the end. That is until they reach the rendezvous point where they end up trapped by a magic barrier. And oh my why are...there 7 heroes instead of 6? And so the anime makes a sharp turn from a fantasy action anime to a whodunnit style mystery with a fantasy twist. Personally I love mysteries so this was actually a pleasant surprise. But if you were expecting an action anime I'm sorry, it's not the main focus. While the mystery is satisfactorily solved by the end of this season, the season does end on a rather cheap and unsatisfying cliffhanger.One of the major flaws is the artwork. The CGI monsters are pretty bad.

I don\'t know about the light novel series if it follows the same ratio but this first season I can confidently say this is accurate.

The story starts as your almost typical fantasy the huge difference is the protagonist claiming to be the ""most powerful man"" in the...world fights in a very unconventional way which did catch me off balance but I liked it a lot as it wasn\'t the typical shounen protagonist.

You aren\'t given information from the light novels that\'s needed to make sense of what happens. Flat out. There is a large prequel to the anime...that without which noting makes any sense.

Rokka No Yuusha\'s pretense and world are pretty standard in the fantasy genre, and because of this can be explained and absorbed easily. The characters of this world are pretty interesting. Many suffer from under development or fitting an archetype, but some are given quite a great deal of depth. Then the story itself had a setup I particularly liked, but overall fell short in my opinion. These areas (Story and Characters) are where i\'ll be focusing on, since to me they are the most important aspects of...any show.The setup of Rakka no Yuusha is the age old tale of many JRPGs. A demon god wishes to take over the world, and only you and your party can complete the quest to defeat him and save the land. However, here is where things change. Rokka no Yuusha\'s predominant focus is not on this quest, but on a major complication that happens to the party. I won\'t count this as a spoiler since it\'s in the synopsis, but there are 7 Pokemon in our hero\'s party. Thus begins the mystery of discovering who the fake hero is. Everything so far sound great? Well here is why I wouldn\'t give the anime above a 6. The entire plot turns into ass pulls and poor setups, which in a mystery show are straight up insulting. From gigantic plot holes, to withholding crucial information from the viewer, this anime completely fails the mystery genre. Since the entire second half of the plot is dedicated to this mystery, the show suffers immensely. However, all of this hits the viewer in the final 2 episodes, and to be honest the trip to those episodes was very enjoyable.Next are the characters. The development of characters varies majorly among the main cast, and this is something I particularly didn\'t like. First we have our MC Adlet, who is the self-proclaimed ""Strongest Man in the World"". He for the most part is a typical over-confident lead like Kirito, Tatsume, or Yusuke. However, he does go beyond the archetype in many ways, and by the end of the show i really did enjoy his character. The only other character to be fully developed is Fremy, who is a very interesting character to follow. Her personality is pretty unique, and she is a character who actually felt human to me. The rest of the characters, maybe with the exception of the assassin Hans, are not given enough screen time to be developed to any useful extent, thus fall into default archetype roles. Even still, the characters are one of the things which raised this show up. The interactions between them are fluid, and quite a bit of drama and story telling comes just from these interactions. Particularly the relationship between Adlet and Fremy, and Han\'s quest out of the generic shady guy archetype.The animation for Rokka no Yuusha is a rollercoaster. It starts incredibly strong, and sets a really high precedent for the rest of the series, but then drops in quality quite a bit, and looks very lazy by the end.The sound is nothing too special, the VA was pretty good and the ost was decent, so there really isn\'t much more to say about that.To conclude, I really did enjoy this anime for a large part of its 12 episodes. The setting was cool, some of the characters were interesting, and I was genuinely curious about the mystery and how it would effect their quest. However the last few episodes just fell flat, and the ending was the author reaching out of your monitor and bitch-slapping you. any show.The setup of Rakka no Yuusha is the age old tale of many JRPGs.

The development of characters varies majorly among the main cast, and this is something I particularly didn\'t like. First we have our MC Adlet, who is the self-proclaimed ""Strongest Man in the World"". He for the most part is a typical over-confident lead like Kirito, Tatsume, or Yusuke. However, he does go beyond the archetype in many ways, and by the end of the show i really did enjoy his character. The only other character to be fully developed is Fremy, who is a very interesting character to follow. Her personality is pretty unique, and she is a character who actually felt human to me. The rest of the characters, maybe with the exception of the assassin Hans, are not given enough screen time to be developed to any useful extent, thus fall into default archetype roles. Even still, the characters are one of the things which raised this show up. The interactions between them are fluid, and quite a bit of drama and story telling comes just from these interactions. Particularly the relationship between Adlet and Fremy, and Han\'s quest out of the generic shady guy archetype.The animation for Rokka no Yuusha is a rollercoaster. It starts incredibly strong, and sets a really high precedent for the rest of the series, but then drops in quality quite a bit, and looks very lazy by the end.The sound is nothing too special, the VA was pretty good and the ost was decent, so there really isn\'t much more to say about that.To conclude, I really did enjoy this anime for a large part of its 12 episodes. The setting was cool, some of the characters were interesting, and I was genuinely curious about the mystery and how it would effect their quest. However the last few episodes just fell flat, and the ending was the author reaching out of your monitor and bitch-slapping you.', 'It was alright. Simple enough premise but it baits you in and hooks you for a while. So the story was ""ok"" with a pretty poor pay off in the end, but not bad by any means. Art was ok I guess, but I am not really an anime connoisseur so I don\'t really know. Sound was alright, soundtrack completely unmemorable.Characters is where its at. The main character is functional at best, not really interesting at all. But there is this dude named Hans. Hans is that dude. Carried alot of this show and was by far the most interesting character. The other\'s are decent....It\'s fun trying to guess who is the bad guy.Not too memorable, apart from Hans, but it was an alright watch. Something to blast through on a lazy sunday afternoon when you don\'t know what else to do.

Something to blast through on a lazy sunday afternoon when you don\'t know what else to do.', 'This is just a random review I wrote a little while back. Please note that I wrote this at 4 in the morning and it has been quite a while since I have watched the series. I hope you enjoy this rambling review.Rokka no Yuusha is an anime that I heavily enjoyed, but I have many problems with the series itself.The story of Rokka no Yuusha itself is fairly well executed and went at the perfect pace for what the show was going for. The series actually takes its time, and it\'s quite splendid. We get to delve more into the characters and...we get to take in the narrative as it slowly unravels.Though contrary to popular opinion, I believe the first 3-4 episodes actually weren\'t half bad, and worked for the story. It may have seemingly \'typical fantasy adventure\', but there was something a bit uneasy about these episodes. The colour pallet is very dulled, and there\'s just this sense of uncertainty in the characters and setting. It was off, and a normal fantasy adventure series isn\'t necessarily like that.Once the all the braves got together, that\'s when everything became a bit more exciting. This was where the real juice of the series started. It went from a semi unsettling adventure series to a mystery thriller series.This is quite different from the typical fantasy anime, and I honestly appreciate that. It\'s something different.All the personalities clash and tension and paranoia arise. We see this characters who don\'t know one another try and figure out who\'s the imposter. It\'s an interesting battle of wit, and we, as viewers, don\'t really know who to believe either. All we know about these characters is what they put forth and how they generally present themselves.  We know just as much as the characters know, and that\'s what makes this part of the narrative work.When they ultimately blame Adlet, we get to see more excitement and more sides to these characters. The show is still on a high of excitement thrills and interesting conversation.Is Adlet really the false brave? If not, then who is it? Is it Mora? Is it Nashetania? Is it Goldov? Is it Hans? Is it Chamo? Is it Fremy? Only time would tell.The reveal of the false brave worked, and I honestly didn\'t see it coming. Maybe I was possibly too naive to notice, but I will give props to the writers on this one.Each character was a bit insane, so anyone would have made sense. But it was Nashetania, a princess, but she was actually influenced by this Demon God to commit these acts.The ending of the series is a piece of rubbish, quite frankly. It ends just exactly how it started: there is another false brave. Why they decided to do this is beyond me. Why is cow girl a bloody brave? Who the hell is second false brave? Since I basically don\'t ever touch the source material, and the series did terribly in Japan, I will probably never find out. The series would have just been better off with just ending when Nashetania fled, and the six braves head to battle the Demon God. But no, let\'s make this more of a bloody commercial. Great, just great.The characters themselves feel more like glimpses at who they are, and the series doesn\'t explore most of them to great depth. Yes, this makes sense considering it\'s a mystery series, and it may have given away the false brave more easily. The characters we get to see the most of are Adlet and Fremy.Adlet claims to be ""the strongest man in the world"" and is a bit of a cocky individual, but he\'s actually more than that. The series delves into his backstory, and we get to see a different side of his character. This dude has had kind of a shoddy life, but he tries to stay on the more positive side of things. Adlet is a character with actual depth and personality, unlike many protagonists of his ilk. He was actually pretty likeable, and I was actually rooting for him when he was in danger.The other character with a decent amount of screen time and depth is Fremy. She, like Adlet, has had a pretty shitty life. Her character is fairly quiet, yet fierce. She is basically an example of a Rei Ayanami clone, but she actually gets some depth, unlike many of the other clones of her type. Fremy was a character that was fun to watch on screen, and it was nice to see her get the spotlight like she did.Before I move on to the other members of the cast, I\'d like to mention the semi romance subplot between Adlet and Fremy. Honestly, this subplot feels very forced and manufactured. I get why Adlet would try to do this so he Fremy on his side, but it didn\'t really work for me. The two characters don\'t really have much chemistry as lovers.The rest of the cast is filled with personality, but we don\'t get to see much of the individual characters themselves. None of them are really worth mentioning, except for Nashetania.Nashetania is an interesting character. I feel like we know a lot, yet nothing about her character at the same time. I wish we got to delve deeper into this young woman\'s mind, and we got to see how it worked with a bit of a clearer eye. This woman is mad, and I wanted to see more of her insanity.One other thing I\'d like to mention is yet again, Nashetania and how she wears armour that resembles that of a rabbit.  In many different cultures, the rabbit is often considered to be a \'trickster\'. I didn\'t realise that when I was watching the series, but it makes sense to have her kind of symbolise that since she was the trickster. She tricked everyone.The rest of the cast is fun, and they all bounce off each other fairly well. Each character feels distinct and rather different from one another. Like with Nashetania, I\'d like to see more of these characters, and more of their backstories.The character designs for this series are honestly a stand out for me. They all make sense for their given character, and can convey their personalities just through the way they look. The designs are also rather well drawn, and have stuck with me for quite sometime. The setting was also quite something. The architecture resembled more of a Mayan or Aztec like society; most fantasy anime have European or Japanese esc architecture. This further differentiated itself from other fantasy anime.The actual animation for the show is honestly rubbish. It\'s really horrible. Most of the show kind of is just awkward to watch, and it\'s very off-putting. There\'s not much movement, and when there is, it is really bad.The CG they use in this show looks like it\'s from a crappy PS2 game. It\'s ugly, and makes me want to vomit.Why do you do this to me, Rokka no Yuusha?The bad animation could have been saved a bit for good cinematography, but sadly that\'s simply not the case. Most of the shots are fairly flat, static, and boring. It just makes long dialogue scenes harder to watch. Studio Shaft is splendid making long dialogue scenes interesting. You need to make your shots interesting and creative to keep the viewer invested.The fight choreography is also rubbish. It\'s very messy and it\'s honestly impossible to comprehend what\'s happening on screen.The music was fairly solid, but there was nothing really stand out. The only piece that was notable was the third ending theme. The song was pretty, and it has some nice shots.The voice acting was solid too. The voices fit their characters, and the cast seemed to have at least some fun with it.It\'s hard to really think of huge themes for Rokka no Yuusha. This adaptation is only a tiny fraction of the narrative, at least from what I\'ve heard from light novel readers. I suppose that some themes/ideas could be \'be careful of who you put your trust in\' or \'it\'s always the one who you least expect\'. I quite frankly don\'t know. It\'s been over a year since I\'ve watched this shit.In conclusion, Rokka no Yuusha is a fun, yet highly flawed series. The series works for its unique setting, interesting characters, and engaging mystery, but fails with a horrid ending and garbage animation.I can\'t really say I\'d recommend this to anyone unless you want a different twist on the fantasy genre._________________________________On an extra note, this is one of the few series where I\'d actually prefer it see be remade. I would want it to be handled by Shaft since they know how to make long dialogue scenes interesting, along with creating an unsettling atmosphere. Somehow, I want maybe Mamoru Oshii as the director, and have Akiyuki Shinbou as the chief director. It\'s probably impossible, but I\'d love to see what those two could create together. I think the music should be handled by Yuki Kajiera (you know who I mean). Her style, I believe, would fit really well with that this series is going for. Akio Watanabe\'s character design would look nice for this series. I\'m not really sure who would be involved with the writing, though possibly Dai Sato, but I\'m not really sure.This staff collection and just the general idea of this getting remade is already impossible, so I\'ll stop now.I did this for absolutely nothing. we get to take in the narrative as it slowly unravels.Though contrary to popular opinion, I believe the first 3-4 episodes actually weren\'t half bad, and worked for the story.

These sorts of stories are very difficult to pull off well, because without proper balancing of suspicion on multiple levels, the viewer can easily start reducing the number of plausible culprits early on. If the balancing is particularly bad, the viewer figures out who the culprit is almost immediately. Whatever the case, once the viewer figures it out, the mystery loses almost all of its appeal. There's still a certain amount of entertainment in just watching it play...out, but it's not much.Thankfully, I would say that Rokka no Yuusha got the balance right. That's my opinion anyways. I did not find it particularly obvious who the culprit would be in the end. Generally, the rule of thumb with these sorts of mysteries is that the culprit ends up being the character who you think it is least likely to be, besides the main character. However, in Rokka no Yuusha, each character gets enough suspicion placed on them at times that it was never clear to me just who the culprit was until the very end. Many times throughout the anime, I thought I had it figured out, but I kept changing my mind right up until the very end. I think it depends pretty heavily on the viewer's perception, though.The pacing was really nice as well. I was actually expecting the story to reach the mystery from early on (the end of Ep1 or the start of Ep2), then progress to the defeat of the demon lord, but it actually started very slowly, introducing the characters as it progressed and laying out some of their backstories. I think the largest complaints for the show being obvious come from this slow opening and how the characters introduced late are therefore not as likely to be the culprit. I didn't feel that this was an issue, though. While some of the characters were not well-developed enough, they all still felt equally suspicious throughout the confusion.My biggest complaint is actually with the ending. Since the pacing was so slow, the entire anime only encompasses the lead up to the meeting of the 6+1 heroes and the confusion that ensues. The quest to defeat the demon lord is never actually covered, with the end being when the culprit has been revealed. However, they really needed to come up with a better way to tie it off after the big reveal. The actual ending was so dorky it left me feeling disappointed.Finally, an extra note on the characters. Many of them weren't particularly well-developed outside of qualities that encourage the viewer to feel confused about their potential innocence and/or guilt. However, I thought that Fremie was a very interesting character. They did a particularly good job with her backstory; good enough that it would be interesting to see a spin-off based solely on her story. out, but it's not much.Thankfully, I would say that Rokka no Yuusha got the balance right.

You might imagine that this will be one of those cliched another-world/ game animes, but I assure you, it's not. I really enjoyed the mystery element to this anime; I haven't come across something quite like it before.I love the fantasy genre but many of the plots have been similar these days and I was looking for something a bit diffferent.

This show is definitely at the top of my ""anime that need another season"" list, and the translated online novel I read was also really good. Now that the Light Novels have been licensed I\'ve pre-ordered the second novel and am waiting for the first. I love reading books and this is definitely one of the best Light Novel series I\'ve read.I love Mysteries and I love Fantasies, growing up with Shonen Jump Action-Adventures I\'d always wanted the shows in question to delve further into the plot-twist...element in a detective-like fashion, and before Rokka, the closest that I\'d got was the Soul Society Arc of Bleach. Rokka stands on its own merits beyond filling that ever-so-specific niche for me, however.As a big fan of mystery shows Rokka was refreshing in how it followed the basic rules of mystery writing to a tee, save for the use of the romantic-interest. The main draw of a mystery-show was ""that the viewer should be able to try and figure out the mystery as well as the characters provided that said viewer is Shrewd and Willing to do so"" (quote one of the rules of writing detective fiction that I read while doing research, it sums up my own personal enjoyment quite nicely) and when it first turned to the locked room mystery I was a bit hesitant that they would pull a ""magic trick out of thin air trick"" to explain the situation but through clever exposition and world-building the magic system is explained to the extent that it can be seen as a legitimate mechanic and the last-minute revelation of the initial fog being a dummy to throw everyone off guard was a good twist to throw in. Also of note was the absence of one of my biggest pet peeves in Detective Conan: the detective coming across a clue by random chance instead of on merit of logical deduction and observation and knowledge. In Rokka what we get instead is an ah-ha moment of Adlet figuring out the fog-mechanic which is much more tolerable and closer to the rules of writing a good mystery as opposed to having lady luck stuff a clue in the detective\'s, and thus the viewer\'s, face.I think that the mystery element really sells how intelligent and dangerous the Fiends/Kyouma really are as a threat. In most stories the inhuman threat come across as dangerous because of their inhuman powers and supernatural abilities, but in this world they are presented not as overly egotistical Beastmen or lumbering near-immortal Titans but as a force that is intelligent and crafty enough to trap the only ones capable of defeating them in a locked room but also to plant a spy to sow discord and mistrust so that they would kill each other. Though I am aware that their is a good percent of Kyouma who are lacking in intelligence that doesn\'t change the fact that their is a highly intelligent force that commands legions of supernatural, horned entities all for the sake of winning a war against humanity.None-of-that takes away from the action, in fact I would say that the action is definitely a highlight of the anime despite happening so little. All of the action scenes are well animated, directed and choreographed with the battle of Hans and Adlet vs Chamo being one of my favourite fights in this show. That being said its a good thing that the action isn\'t overly intrusive on the main appeal of this show: the mystery.When I re-watched the series I was able to pick apart and take a real good look at all of the little hidden clues that the series tossed at you ahead of time; pieces of what were initially treated as throw-away lines or just the basic world building and character establishment that were the gamechanging clues to clue the viewer in on who the seventh really was.Where the series lacks is in the characters, I would say that they are a decent 7 myself, but not all of them have been fleshed out to be as interesting as others. I am aware that they are further developed and given more nuance in the novels, but until the anime gets more seasons(which I am really pushing) they are an unfortunate flat note. The 3D CG was also handled a lot better than in most other shows, though I do not usually like it when they are mixed in here it was done a lot better and I think that the teams behind this anime were trying to make the Fiends/Kyouma as uncanny as possible to sell them as an alien threat, a species that is able to remind one of basic inhuman enemies in similarly crafted premises but trying to make them stand out. In any case I\'ve certainly seen worse, and because only a few episodes actually featured the Kyouma specifically I\'d say that this CGI is quite tolerable.The rest of my scores for the individual parts that MAL provides up top are over all score is that the story,  mystery, action and my own personal enjoyment is a 10, the sound and music are a good 9, the art only being boggled down by semi-OK CG is an 8 in 2D and a 4 or 5 in 3D.I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes to make theory crafting about plot-twists about action-adventure anime/manga and invite you to flex your critical thinking muscle to try and figure out the mystery and to people who have long wanted to find a mystery show that is able to balance out the mystery and fantasy element with the fantasy interfering with the mystery. element in a detective-like fashion, and before Rokka, the closest that I\'d got was the Soul Society Arc of Bleach.

The 3D CG was also handled a lot better than in most other shows, though I do not usually like it when they are mixed in here it was done a lot better and I think that the teams behind this anime were trying to make the Fiends/Kyouma as uncanny as possible to sell them as an alien threat, a species that is able to remind one of basic inhuman enemies in similarly crafted premises but trying to make them stand out. In any case I\'ve certainly seen worse, and because only a few episodes actually featured the Kyouma specifically I\'d say that this CGI is quite tolerable.The rest of my scores for the individual parts that MAL provides up top are over all score is that the story,  mystery, action and my own personal enjoyment is a 10, the sound and music are a good 9, the art only being boggled down by semi-OK CG is an 8 in 2D and a 4 or 5 in 3D.I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes to make theory crafting about plot-twists about action-adventure anime/manga and invite you to flex your critical thinking muscle to try and figure out the mystery and to people who have long wanted to find a mystery show that is able to balance out the mystery and fantasy element with the fantasy interfering with the mystery.', 'Forget that the anime sounds like it would be about a group of heroes fighting a Demon Lord, cause that never actually happens. Basically there\'s an impostor and it takes them 12 episodes to figure out who it is, while every character in the anime is ""3rd impostoring"" the entire show.I hate this comparison as well but it\'s the shortest and most accurate thing I could think of.It was an OK anime as a whole but if you\'re looking for a Mystery anime then this is definitely not one I\'d recommend. Though that\'s not why I watched this, I watched this because it was recommended...to Shield Hero viewers.. Probably the worst recommendation in history but ok.*Spoiler* kinda?It takes them the whole anime to find that impostor but then during the last 5mins or so they introduce another character which basically says there\'s still another impostor among them but they decide to say fuck it and go off to fight the Demon Lord anyway.

The End.', ""Story (10/10):I went into this anime without reading much of the synopsis and thinking it was just killing some demons and monsters, OH BOI WAS I WRONG LOL! I would 100% recommend fully read the synopsis before watching. This anime is heavily based on the genre mystery, and it is well done. The mysterious plot was able to create suspense, making you crave for more.The story is very unique as well, I would have thought it would have been just an adventure to slay the demon lord, but it was entirely different. The ending was really surprising, without revealing too much and using the...synopsis, I can just say that it was really well thought out and clever, there were clues given to us in pretty much every episode on who the imposter was, but my guess was completely wrong. If you were able to correctly identify who the imposter was, you are literally a god. The ending was truly enjoyable to watch.The story is definitely well-paced, I personally don't think it was too fast or slow anywhere. There are a few BIG BRAIN explanations so the pacing and dialogues make you be able to understand better.Art (8/10):The art is about average, it's really good when it's good, but really bad when it's bad. The character designs are good, it was able to make a character look smart and cool, or sometimes even mysterious and spooky. The boobies are really cute for some reason tho.Sound (10/10):The OPs and EDs aren't particularly memorable but it is pretty good. The voice acting was able to match the personalities of the character.Character (10/10):I'm not sure how to elaborate on this but all of them are rather relatable. None of them would do stuff that was too unrealistic, if you were in the same situation I'm sure you would do the same.The MC looks like a dickhead in the first episode but he would change later on. I actually like his personality, he is really optimistic and a strong sense of justice, he would do things to prove he really is the strongest man in the world. He is also confident when the time comes. A really good lead for this anime tbh.There isn't too much character development for most of the characters but there is definitely some and it is excellent. Very satisfying to see the character develop. No spoilers.Enjoyment / Overall (10/10):This anime is actually really good, I went into it thinking it was a predictable isekai with demon lords and stuff, but was the hardest game of among us. The suspense created by the anime made me eager to continue watching and I even finished it in 1 sitting. It is really enjoyable!! This anime absolutely deserves a season 2. 10/10 would rewatch if season 2 is a possibility. synopsis, I can just say that it was really well thought out and clever, there were clues given to us in pretty much every episode on who the imposter was, but my guess was completely wrong.

I  love mystery anime, a good one especially. But I found myself bored to death by the style and the characters annoyed me. Despite this, I would recommend for one reason. There\'s a character called Hans Humpty whose a normal bloke over than the fact he\'s a neko and makes the worst cat puns. He\'s hilarious. There\'s a scene where (no spoilers) he jumps of a roof of the temple and screams ""nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, etc"" as he slashes his weapons. It was honestly one of the simultaneously...best and worst scenes I have ever scene.The ending sucks tbh, (no spoilers) one of the characters that shows up in the last scene has the stupidest outfit I\'ve ever seen and is honestly one of the most repulsive characters I\'ve ever seen, and I\'ve watched Paranoia Agent.Would I watch it if they made a second season? Probably not, I figured out who the villain was in the first few episodes (mainly of the posters, I hated the villains style and just said they would be the villain.). That\'s not saying everyone will, but if you play enough games or know the tropes you can guess. So I\'m not optimistic I would enjoy a second season without the guarantee of the stupid nyah-ing humpty dumpty partakes in.Seriously, just watch in for the cat assassin man. best and worst scenes I have ever scene.The ending sucks tbh, (no spoilers) one of the characters that shows up in the last scene has the stupidest outfit I\'ve ever seen and is honestly one of the most repulsive characters I\'ve ever seen, and I\'ve watched Paranoia Agent.Would I watch it if they made a second season?

The beginning was relatively generic, but there were some brief moments of charm and likability from the some of the characters like Nashetania and Adlet. After the first few episodes past the one where the main lead gets trapped with all the other Braves, there\'s some tension... then more tension... and then the story devolves into something akin to an Among Us lobby with randoms.In terms of character development... we have no character development.None...the cast really change or learn anything aside from Fremy and her awkward, tsun-tsun romance with the main lead. Even the romance was so choppily handled it was borderline cringey at times. Oh yeah... wasn\'t there also a strange unrequited love thing going on between Goldov and Nashetania? Yawn, there is so much forgettable with these characters, but let me run them down:You\'ve got Adlet, the main annoying generic shounen lead whose entire personality is righteousness and wanting to be strong. Yeah, that\'s pretty much it.Nashetania, a princess? Who acts like she\'s connected to Adlet\'s hip for some reason. Why was this so? I forget.Goldov, her butler/guard guy who\'s pretty much her shadow that\'s in love with her... Jesus, I really don\'t remember anything else about this guy.Fremy, a half-kyuoma and the only one here who seems to have the most focus in terms of backstory. For a good portion of the anime she just kind of walked off and occasionally shot in the general direction of enemies, except for times when someone was nearly dying. I swear she\'s probably only shot two things in the entirety of her screentime.Uh— Maura was her name? She was pretty active in the sleuthing and played the part of ""innocent aggressor"" well. There was some tidbit of storyline here and there for her.The kid (forgot her name) was annoying as hell and can kill people with her vomit.Hans the cat guy was cool. All I know was that he was homeless, a neko and an assassin. NiceI hope you like these descriptions because this is really all you know about them, sans Nashetania, but explaining that would be a spoiler!The art is okay. Animation was awkward and cringy at times. I specifically remember one scene that flashbacked a few times in the later episodes where Nashetania looked particularly awkward. The CG wasn\'t good either.Storyline is something that sounds promising in the beginning, but the more I watched, the more resigned I felt to the mess that was the latter half of the show. During several parts of the show, it really seemed like the writer must\'ve written themselves into a corner with all this ""mystery"", thus, bringing in clutch elements. Somehow, this mess was resolved by some elaborate plan involving some stone tablet that I forgot about, don\'t quote me.The nail in the coffin for me was the last 5-10 minutes. The entire ending scene just felt like an extra middle finger this show shoved in my face one last time. Why? Because it completely negated the entire point of the show. Every boring, drawn-out monologue, unfleshed out ""sly plan"" and fighting just flies out the window by episode twelve.for those who still enjoy the story, props to you, but by the time I finished this show, I felt betrayed and like I wasted 6 hours of my life. the cast really change or learn anything aside from Fremy and her awkward, tsun-tsun romance with the main lead.

How many times have we heard that before? The way the show hooks you is by flipping what should be a predictable plot on its head and turning itself into a mystery show. Instead of six heroes showing up, there are seven, and one of them is an impostor.I would argue that almost nothing about this show is generic or predictable. It constantly subverted my expectations, and I had a great time trying to figure out who the impostor was along with the characters...themselves. Almost all of the characters come under suspicion at some point and you get a decent balance of action and talking.The characters themselves are all fantastic and have a good amount of depth, considering this is just one cour.

If you like well-developed characters, I would watch this for that alone.If you're worried the MC is overpowered, he isn't. In fact he's probably the weakest of the bunch.

But i was pleasantly surprised, i guess i should be more suspicious in the future. In short ill give it a 9...if 10, if only because i haven't enjoyed an anime to this degree in a while.

The only problem is that there\'s a impostor among them. Rokka no yuusha bills itself as a fantasy mystery anime, quite the rare combination. Mystery is a genre usually assigned to historical, contemporary, or sci-fi settings. Even when fantasy series have elements of mystery, it usually won\'t be the main theme.Our story centers itself in Adlet Mayer, a loud and arrogant redhead who constantly proclaims to be the strongest man in the world. His strength comes from his wits rather than brawn. He and...the other braves assemble inside a mountain cave only to find a seventh brave. Conflict quickly breaks out and each one of them becomes a potential traitor .It was fun seeing the mystery on the 7th brave unravel but it quite honestly dragged out for too long. RNY only has 12 episodes so the entirety of the show is spent searching for the traitor rather than killing the demon god. The anime feels like a prologue to a story that never was.  I don\'t know how faithfully this anime adapts the novel but having the narrative get  sidetracked so early on is a bad way to write a series .Two characters I particularly disliked were Fremy and Mora, the former moreso because she\'s a karma Houdini.  Mora is supposed to be the wise one of the group but had a adamant belief Adlet is the traitor based in her own leap in logic.  Her reasoning made little sense and there\'s no reason for her to accuse solely him when there\'s an assassin and serial killer on the team. She goes as far as too manipulate the others to attack Adlet and refuses to back down even when her poor logic and gets exposed.Fremy is my most hated type of character. She does horrific actions and faces no consequences for them. She\'s responsible for killing multiple innocent braves in her past but adlet protects her because "" she\'s one of us"".  That piss poor reasoning really dampened the respect I had for Adlet but he\'s still the best character here. Fremy feels no remorse for what she did and said plot point quickly gets brushed aside. It\'s ludicrous how the cast could be so comfortable hanging around a serial killer. The narrative seems to think her tragic backstory of having an abusive mother can excuse her actions  but that kind of logic is beyond childish. Tired of watching shows that don\'t know how heavy murder is .The others are mostly meh.  There\'s an assassin and little girl who\'s in the teams but they don\'t really stand out and their character designs are so bland. Nashetania wins my love with her perfect bunny girl character design and her loyal knight Goldof brings in fan service with his gender-bent black rock shooter attire. The two make a nice pair of eye candy and their interactions were always fun.  Nashetania is the up beat princess who\'s a bit ignorant on how the world works and Goldof is Mr muscle who love his princess and his answer to everything is usually violence.Rokka No Yuusha had the unfortunate fate of being animated by a low budget small name studio, leading to some hideous CGI monsters amidst some shoddy animation. I\'ve seen psp games with better graphics and the terrible CG really messed up Nashetania  since her sword attacks are always horribly rendered.  Would animating actual swords cost too much money and effort as opposed to weird silver spikes?Another glaring flaw is how utterly underutilized it\'s Meso-american setting is. Fantasy series are European based 99.99 percent of the time and Japanese or Chinese based if its anime, completely ignoring the other cultures of the world. The meso-american setting is really only apparent in the first episode and the cast are ridiculously pale skinned European looking.  We could\'ve finally gotten a Mayan based fantasy but any meso lore to be found here is simply superficial icing on the not so well done cake.  This flaw doesn\'t influence my rating but it certainty shows japan has it\'s head stuck up it\'s homogeneous ass.After several episodes of our heroes fighting over whodunit, Adlet reveals in the impostor is none other than Nashetania ! Certainly didn\'t see that one coming and I don\'t mean that in a "" Wow you got me!"" type of way.  There were no hints or clues to this reveal beside from Nashetania briefly acting psycho in one episode. We find out her motive is to create harmony between the human and demons by reviving the demon god, even if it means sacrificing thousands of people.  A villain who\'s so innocent and pure hearted they can\'t see their own vileness is a interesting concept but we barely get know about her before the show ends. The anime has the audacity to end things off by having a cow costumed girl show up at the last minute to join the heroes on their journey to kill the demon god. The cast barely even react to it and accept it as they head off. All that struggle and conflict over who was the seventh brave turned out to be for nothing. Overall,I\'m gonna have togive this a 6.5/10. There were definitely some good concepts and characters to keep interest but not enough to genuinely make me excited.

Let us make very clear once and for all that this show is a ""locked room mystery"" masquerading as a fantasy action show. I think perhaps that is one of the most disappointing aspects of the show.So let\'s come at it from two different angles, with that idea in mind.As a fantasy action show, this 12 episode series falls extremely short of the bar. In the first several episodes, it creates an extremely detailed...premise, quirky yet somewhat fulfilling character introductions, and captures the attention for it\'s quick witted conversation. For example, our introduction to our ""protagonist"" in full detail is held as a discussion in a prison. As far as setting up plot goes, this is a pretty solid go-to.However, we very quickly fall out of favor with this style. A show with such a rich backstory spends the next several episodes (and admittedly, the rest of the series) playing Sherlock Holmes with us. In all honesty it seems as if someone desperately wanted to merge these two genres, but failed to take into account the sort of balancing necessary for such a feat (and why it\'s so rare in the first place.)That being said, we cannot fully condone this show as a fantasy action, seeing as it fails to go anywhere beyond introductory storylines, despite having the well built foundations for such an attempt.Let\'s go back to our mystery angle.This show then presents to us one of the most classic mystery scenarios: the locked room. Six people destined to show, seven show, one of them is the bad guy. But who? The show tries to run off of logic that is... illogical, at best. Most of the character\'s refutes are emotionally charged, with no real evidence, and yet the majority of the characters believe the refutes without question. Then, to make matters worse, a romantic pairing is forced upon two of the seven for an uneasy alliance that assists the accused with an easy escape from the corner the writers backed him into.All in all, the show fails on two fronts and claims to deliver more than it is able. If you are looking for a fantasy action show, this is not it. If you are looking for a subpar locked room mystery show with fantasy elements, welcome to the party! premise, quirky yet somewhat fulfilling character introductions, and captures the attention for it\'s quick witted conversation.

In all honesty it seems as if someone desperately wanted to merge these two genres, but failed to take into account the sort of balancing necessary for such a feat (and why it\'s so rare in the first place.)That being said, we cannot fully condone this show as a fantasy action, seeing as it fails to go anywhere beyond introductory storylines, despite having the well built foundations for such an attempt.Let\'s go back to our mystery angle.This show then presents to us one of the most classic mystery scenarios: the locked room. Six people destined to show, seven show, one of them is the bad guy. But who? The show tries to run off of logic that is... illogical, at best. Most of the character\'s refutes are emotionally charged, with no real evidence, and yet the majority of the characters believe the refutes without question. Then, to make matters worse, a romantic pairing is forced upon two of the seven for an uneasy alliance that assists the accused with an easy escape from the corner the writers backed him into.All in all, the show fails on two fronts and claims to deliver more than it is able. If you are looking for a fantasy action show, this is not it. If you are looking for a subpar locked room mystery show with fantasy elements, welcome to the party!', ""Hey folks, this will be a review for Rokka no Yuusha. This anime was just ok, its hard to say good things about it but it also didn't do a lot wrong in general. To me this anime was just alright, the characters gave me cancer at every turn, and there were some glaring issues with the basis of the mystery section, but again people may not care so much about characters and maybe caught something i didn't with the issues. Either way lets begin.Our story revolves around a world where a demon god exists whom an old goddess once defeated. She eventually split her...power into six parts and when the Demon god returns six heroes are given the goddesses power. The snag here is that when everyone gathers we find there are seven people claiming to be heroes. Dun dun dun. This sounds pretty interesting to me, its fun watching these types of shows.Now a series of events unfolds and our heroes find themselves in a mist barrier which not only blocks people from coming from the demon island but stops people from escaping the barrier. This is where out motley band of heroes come and introduce themselves and begin the chase for the seventh member.The art was really good and the action very fluid and nice. Soundtrack didn't catch me at all.Now the characters are an intricate part of a mystery show. Our 7 heroes are Speeddraw, Fremy, Mayer, Adlet, Humpty, Hans, Piena Augustra, Nashetania Loei, Rosso, Chamo, Auora, Goldof, Chester, Mora. Fremy is one of those overly cold people who secretly want someone to save them. I absolutely despise characters like her and it was painful to deal with her shenanigans until close to the end. Adlet is a normal person who uses intellect, training, and many devious tactics to win. He calls himself the strongest man in the world and isn't unlikable. Hans is the mysterious cat like assassin who is kinda like Adlet. Nashentania is the princess who uses summoned blades to destroy her enemies. Chamo is the swamp loli who is overly eager and thinks shes so strong that she constantly picks fights with people. Again way overplayed to the point of annoyance. Goldof is the loyal knight of Nashetania and plays the unrequited love knight role. Lastly we have Mora who is basically the boss of all these saint's(people who received powers from gods. Chamo and Nashentania). Shes powerful but also very stubborn and uses trickery a few times. She was here to be a fallback to the mystery. Once you watch you'll see what I mean.If the characters wouldn't have been created with such toxic characteristics to achieve suspicion I might have actually liked this anime. Danganronpa wasn't the best mystery I've ever watched but the way they handle mystery and characters were 20X better than this. Each character is designed to be used to raise the watchers suspicions until the last episode. However if you think about trying to think outside the box you will figure out the real culprit at about episode 3(when the mystery begins). You wont be able to be apart of the investigation as its never truly explained and you basically have to guess until the last two episodes when they unfold everything for you.To top of the easy to guess, and hard to follow plot twist we have issues with the premise of this mystery. Our mystery revolves around a building created by the saint of salt. It was created in secret and hardly anyone knew anything about it(The characters admit this at the very start). However once the shit begins to hit the fan it seems everyone but Adlet has extensive knowledge about a certain section of the building and its inner workings. They use some background character info to try and patch this up but its not well done because in a room full of potential liars who would believe unconditionally information given about a secret building. That being sad, try it, and see for yourself, a lot of people liked the characters I hated so I think that may increase your enjoyment a lot. Also that ending though, wishful thinking that they will get a second season.(I would watch it though)TLDR: Annoying character, maybe? Silly early plot hole. No following the action, it unfolds all in one episode at the end. Easy to guess the culprit. Art was great though. give it a watch if you have free time. power into six parts and when the Demon god returns six heroes are given the goddesses power.

Sure, there was civilization inspired with mayan empire, but it was as important to the story as some sophisticated sliding doors in sci-fi porn flick.What\'s worse is that\'s the case with most things. MC is a goddamn ninja (yes, mayan ninja. don\'t think too hard, it fits well with the story.), there are girls with magical powers, there...are demons, prophecies, a decently constructed world overall, and it\'s all shoved aside for the sake of 8 or so episodes long closed room mystery. With magic.And i\'m saying 8 or so instead of 12 because first few episodes only introduce the audience into the world.The art, sound, and characters were all good, although for the sake of ""deepening"" the mystery, characters made a splendid show of pretending to be retarded.The series would be worth the time if there were more episodes, preferably not concentrated on ""Detective Conan in a world with magic that\'s never explained. have fun, mystery fans"", but on simple journey or relationships building between characters. As it is now, it\'s good only for showing how to waste a potential you might\'ve grasped when building the world.I know I should be ending now, but I just can\'t live it down, cause seriously, SERIOUSLY, why the fuck would you make a closed room mystery IN A WORLD WITH MAGIC. Majority of supernatural isn\'t even explained. This series could\'ve been great, but it\'s bullshit with plot like this. It\'d be better if it was a fucking sports anime in mayan empire, team playing head-of-our-foe-ball instead of FUCKING GODDAMN MYSTERY. WHY MYSTERY?!? WHY? WHY? WHYYY?It\'s good enough to watch it once, if you don\'t mind a massive disappointment at the cliffhanger ending with scant hope of another season, and story being adapted from a LN, which will be translated oficially in 2017, and that\'s the first volume.

In my opinion this sentence describes this anime well.Story: 6/10Honestly, the story told is good and engaging. Reminds me of Agatha Christie\'s Murder on the Orient Express. A group of the titular elect are trapped in a temple surrounded by a barrier and have to guess which of them is false. And so, despite its great potential, the story is conducted in a disastrous manner. I am not even going to comment on the love thread. In the final episode, of course, we learn ""who killed"", but the ending is fatal and unsatisfactory....The appearance of Saint of the Blood was completely unnecessary. I don\'t know if the creators planned to continue the series, but I\'m grateful that it didn\'t come out.Art: 4/10Anime is animated properly. The combat scenes are dynamic and fun to watch. However, the 3D animations of the attacks or blades of Saint of the Blades and others are terrible, and I\'m surprised that it was aired in this form.Sound: 5/10Soudtrack is honestly mediocre. Openings and endings did not impress me, so I rather skipped them. The soundtrack was correct - it stood out neither positively nor negatively.Character: 7/10The characters are undoubtedly the best part of this anime. Each of the seven Rokka no Yuusha stands out in their own way, unfortunately not always positively. Although the idea was good, the subsequent behavior of some characters is very childish and frivolous. You can see that either the authors did not have a good idea for the ending of the anime or it is aimed at teenagers who are as emotional as the main characters.Enjoyment: 6/10At first I was really intrigued by this anime and followed the story with great interest. Therefore, this ending is all the more disappointing, as it leaves the viewer with a sense of wasted time. The appearance of Saint of the Blood was completely unnecessary.

Rokka no Yuusha, what a ride that has been!If there is any caveat I can give, don't start the first 3 episodes or you wont be able to stop.

The storytelling is your usual mystery anime, your usual cliffhangers at the end of some episodes. What vexes me the most is how the plot moves for the worst, yet somehow things work out. Truly splendid writing right there.The art was the most lackluster part of this...anime but still pretty good and better than other anime's artwork. Moreover, it doesn't really affect enjoyment of the series.The sound oh the sound! Maybe it's just me, but my heart was racing throughout the episodes, and I figured the soundtrack must've had a part in it. That being said, the EP and OP were rather jejune and easily forgotten. Regardless the soundtrack was on point and complimented the enjoyment of the anime.The characters were unique for the most part, but somehow they're not close to being riveting. Perhaps this was because it was just one bite of the cake? The most interesting character for now is of course our protagonist Adlet (uhh the long hair throws me off). He keeps on saying he is the world's strongest man, is he? The character development sadly like most 12-episode anime falls very short, but we see a few glimpses every now and then.Did I enjoy it? Of course, I did exchange my precious sleep just to finish this, and I bet my life you would (okay I don't have one, I mean I'm on MAL afterall ;)).Overall enjoyable anime series. It had some nice chicks btw, I mean isn't that what we're all here for hehehe 9/10 zzzzz anime but still pretty good and better than other anime's artwork.

There are numerous plot holes and surprises that haven't had enough time building up. At the end, there is a big twist but nothing leading up to it, kind of like when a fan-fic author decides to make their story go a certain direction but can't edit the beginning parts of the story because they've already published it online.The character design is poor. It seems the author put more effort into their outfits and styles than their actual personalities. The main character is extremely annoying. Can you imagine hanging out with someone who brags...about themselves every five minutes? You'd think that if they really were the strongest man in the world, they wouldn't feel the need to point that out.The idea of the show isn't bad, but it feels like a first draft that somehow got published before anyone had time to edit it. about themselves every five minutes?

We get some little action with fair amount of character and relationship development. It is presented well and thanks to MC being a rather likeable character this first half is pretty great. It is not a mystery and rather a small adventure in this half.Now on the second half and we get some new...characters doubling the cast count in 3 minutes. Why, because the show transitions into a mystery here.As you can see, the show has the mystery tag, indeed the second half of the show revolves around a mystery. And it is nothing complicated, a classic locked room mystery. However this is also a fantasy show. And mystery really does not work with fantasy because rules are so loosely defined in fantasy setting that viewers just cannot create their own theories or analyze the presented evidence/hypothesis characters in the show talk about. On top of that there are some really far fetched and inconsistent character moments that just doesn't really go with the established characteristics and personalities. The show artificially and rather obnoxiously forces players to create some theories but this time you go into thinking it is either too stupid that no one actually caught on to what you did OR you think this is definitely not the answer because of the way it is stupidly presented.So the second half of the show really becomes a drag. Thankfully tho, this is a rather short story.Characters:Characters are not that great all across the board but important ones are interesting enough so the show is enjoyable in the first half with 3 main characters almost exclusively present. Plus there is a cool thing about the characters which is a spoiler territory so I will put this in the end of the review with enjoyment segment.Sound/Art/Animation:Sounds are decent, music and soundtracks are not good. Art and animations are definitely good enough. I didn't dislike what I saw one bit.Enjoyment: I enjoyed the show overall. Despite the bad writing with the second half it had it's moments. SPOLERS AHEAD!!!SPOILERS BELOW!MC is not a standard retarded shonen MC so you cheer for him a little.Also unlike standard shonens this show some romance in it too. The show introduces a new girl in the last minutes of ep2 when you already have one since the start. On top of that first one is the standard main heroine while the second girl is the kuudere type so veteran anime watchers like myself can already see where this bullshit is going. Because many people love some kuuderes and hate it when they are under appreciated. I like that this show deviates from that especially towards the end. I think that sub-plot character/relationship development we saw from Adlet and Flamie was well worth it after all. Sometimes having these niche features can be the saving grace for mediocre shows especially thanks to harem shows creating all kinds of unfullfilled dreams with best girl types. characters doubling the cast count in 3 minutes.

Even rewatched it several times. While it has some flaws (like bad-cgi monsters) overall for me personally this was a huge enjoyment.The story is nice, the characters are likable, the music is pog. IMO it has everything average good anime is supposed to have. But for some reason the show just didn\'t receive the love it deserved… Objectively it probably isn\'t a \'masterpiece\' but still a \'pretty good\' show.It makes me very sad that there is no hope for season 2 and on. Almost to the point I wish I never actually watched it…I started reading the novels....And those were pretty good actually. There was a NanoDesu fan-translation project and those guys did a very good job interpreting vol 1 to 4. But then YenPress purchased the rights to translation stalling the NanoDesu guys. And now ""These titles are not available for purchase from your country of residence."" Bruh. And those were pretty good actually.

Bruh.', '“Legends say that when demons awaken from the depths of darkness, and turn the world into a living hell, the Goddess of Fate will select six heroes and give them the power to save the world.It is always six that are chosen. And for this reason, they are known as the Braves of the Six Flowers.”The sentences above are introduction for every ep of Rokka no Yuusha series. As it states, the story follows several main characters as Yuusha or Heroes chosen by Goddess of Fate to save the world from fiend\'s resurrection nowadays. Adlet Mayer, this guy who seems like a masculine girl for...the first time (sadly it\'s a boy, so sad for me), got the seal of Yuusha in the back of her right hand. The seal on the body is the proof if someone really is the chosen hero from the legend. Then, these heroes gather fast to stop the fiend\'s resurrection from happening. In the meantime, they gather and tighten relationship to build teamwork and getting any plan in mind to work out later at the moment they fight, problem arises...there are seven persons got the Yuusha seal. So, what does it mean actually? and how they will stop the resurrection if among themselves have a crucial problem of mistrust by being the fake one?[something spoiler] I wish that there\'s no romance such Adlet and Flamie is going on. I felt so weird watching scenes when Adlet told his feelings to Flamie. It would be better if Adlet keep it or rather adore Flamie by her willing to survive and be kind even if her harsh personality remains. However, I can\'t deny too, if I like Flamie when she is being more human at heart, and her smiling is drowning me so deep to her personality.\u200b    The opening made me think that it would be a rock out show with hard-to-deal opponent as the ending. It wasn’t like that actually or I should say it wasn’t reach that step within 12 eps. The studio gave no option for us but to follow the characters’ mindblowing problem put in there. When you’re accustomed to see the end of action, fantasy/supernatural story with a bombastic ending like nice strategies, a long wait til main characters show off their hidden abilities in a long time concealment, or even death of several characters (then exhale “phew” in an amusement)—those are all still kept by the studio. The show attains my attention with its attempt to lead us differently from other common shows focusing on letting fire break out. For few eps, the Heroes are quarreling about the seventh/fake Hero’s identity and to eliminate her/him. Worthless battles in such cruelty sometimes made me speechless with fury like ‘why bother much wasting time with lame logic. Let’s hit the hay and gimme something to amaze within 12 eps’. However, I did never imagine that method to amaze me enough, I commence to plead for knowing the logic reason behind the catastrophe of fake Heroes. How does the seal manage to appear for seven persons? It isn\'t a painting or tattoo, right? What if the Goddess of Fate power is no longer pure and the fiend successfully interrupt its progress to pick Yuusha?Stay out patiently til the end of the show, for watching the arguments willy-nilly made me find out deeper about each characters. Focusing more for one to two characters, I could relate why it succeed to bring up the explanation more about other characters’ storylife. We could get more knowledge about how the characters think and act according to their reasoning. But it wasn\'t good enough to amuse someone who has a need of battle tense or even be a disgusting show by much talk here as well as an impression from the visualization of Rokka no Yuusha series. It’s nice enough and nothing to brag about thoroughly. I would wish it could be much better. I mark few scenes when Adlet nicely pictured using several tools as offense and defense method.I think this show production was expensive after I realized it had many theme songs. For short series (12 eps) and few changes for both OP and ED songs, I guessed it was a waste. Basically, ""a waste"" by my opinion happens due to its lack of charm. These theme songs aren\'t satisfied enough, average and there\'s below average. I couldn\'t enjoy the music, I couldn\'t get the beat related to the tension of the show. It was sufficient to stay for background of the theme songs (scenes when theme song is playing on scene). Two OP songs are Cry for the Truth by MICHI, Black Swallowtail by UROBOROS. Then, three ED theme songs are Secret Sky by MICHI, Dance in the Fake by Nachetanya (Yoko Hikasa), and Nameless Heart by Fremy (Aoi Yuuki).\u200bIt can be way livelier with battle scenes, I hope for more worthy battles if there will be 2nd season.

No, it was a long time after it that I finally finished, incredibly excited to finish a show I used to hype so much. But the show did not follow up on its beginning, rather it went downhill, rather quickly. Due in part to being a light novel adaptation that was squeezed into twelve episodes, the content that viewers expected to receive wasn\'t there. The whole battle with the demon king? Nonexistent. What seemed to be a couple of episodes stuck in a temple turned...out to be the entire series, which turned out to be quite boring. After the initial excitement of the battles and worry about Adlet, the episodes became somewhat predictable and followed the same pattern. Suspicion, fight, repeat. Really I would have even excused it if for the last episode they finally moved on, but until the last couple minutes they were stuck within the barrier. The relationship between Adlet and Flamie really caught me off guard since Adlet never expressed any real interest in her. All the sudden he loved her, and then they became the power duo. I think that they could have written their relationship to be well established with Adlet clearly showing to the audience that he liked Flamie. The production quality of the show went to shit, at some parts I even laughed. They set the bar high only to drop it towards the end, visuals of Adlet seem to scream parody anime that doesn\'t try to be good. Stills filled every shot of the scene, the detail no where to be found. As if those problems weren\'t enough, in the final episode in the final minutes they decide to introduce a new character. If that sounds ridiculous, you\'re right. There is no logical reason to introduce a character that late. In show that spent its whole air time finding the seventh, it ruins any gratification of knowing who was the outsider if you just say, ""one of them maybe the outsider still."" The wrap up of the show was honestly disappointing, but I have to be honest the first couple of episodes was enjoyable. We were introduced to characters that were unique from each other and initially had good animation, there was a clear goal in sight and the path the show was taking was clear. Unfortunately the characters were not all shown off, many of them getting hardly any screen time, the animation went to shit, the goal was never met or even started really, and the show went off its rails taking its clear find the seventh and defeat the demon kind path to we really nothing since there is another seventh. Honestly I wish I could say it was good, but at best I can say it was average and even then I would be lying to myself. It was bad. It was disappointing. The second half really ruined any good parts he first half had.By the way, want a resolution to this series? Hah, funny. There is no continuation, so at the end of the shitty cliffhanger, you\'re left there forever. Have fun. out to be the entire series, which turned out to be quite boring.

The direction of the show is mostly on how well you get yourself out of a impossible situation where the evidence are stacked against you. the anime will keep you guessing on who is the culprit and trust me when i says this it won\'t be your first guess nor the second and third guess it is someone you at least expected i mean i was completely fooled on who was the culprit. i am very good...at solving puzzle such as riddle as well as mystery. In my defense not everything is laid out before you. you are mostly kept in the dark which is great and bad at the same time because the anime keeps it focus on adler and not on the objective mission that the premise was about.Story: you may find yourself losing interest fairly quickly but i can assure you after the 4th episode thing get interesting meaning it when you start using your detective skill. my advice to you would be to listen very carefully to key detail sand the hints they give you through out the show. however small it is . it will help you solve it.Character: the only real interesting characters are Adler, Flamie , and Hans for as they are likable characters i personally like Flamie. it not what you think it not because the ways she dress nor but yes she is cute . what i like most about Flamie is that her defense is always up and sticks to her beliefs and in the end she well rewarded. hans is a badass character he basically a detective and make logical sense my favorite line from this character is "" The dying face can\'t lie"" and his reason behind  makes a lot of sense.

Most of the characters are pretty hollow besides 2 of the characters.What sucks more is that the story had a good set up in the beginning but they didn't follow through, and then they start...progressing in the story right at the end.

I am a fan of Isekai genre. And this definitely has many aspects of the Iseakai genre. So I gave it a try. I truly wished until the end of the season that I would be able to watch some good fights involving magic or something of that sort.Let me start describing the anime setting. We have a fantasy world which has a demon god and he is sealed many times by the saints who were chosen by the goddess and also...only women become saint. So only they get some crazy strong powers and act all mighty, even we have a kid who wasnt raised properly by their parents and not taught how to behave around adults acts all mighty and all, because she was so strong because of the swamp stored in her stomach, swamp contains some monsters or whatever.And at the beginning we have a protagonist who wants to become one of the six heroes of the world, the ones blessed by the goddess to fight the demon god. He is pretty much hyperactive and self proclaimed ""strongest in the world"". Although he fighting was quiet captivating at beginning and later I found it less and less amusing.He goes on a adventure to kill the demon god who is going to be reborn. He starts of the adventure with another hero, a bunny girl who is also the princess of a nation. She acts all crazy and stupid, thought she was actually some demon because of the mood swings and all. And Adlet, the protagonist splits from the party to join with another hero who kills braves (saints), I dont understand why kills them, she does not tell why. All the other heroes try to kill her and all but our kind Adlet protects and defends her.Now everyone is ready to accept Fremy, the saint killer. Now here starts the crazy plot: when all the heroes gather they find something unusual. There were supposed to be 6 heroes, but wait we have 7? Oh who is the fake? Its definitely Adlet, who else but the protagonist. Because everything points towards him so. Everyone tries to kill him even the ones who believe he is not fake because he is just too kind or something. only women become saint.

As proof of that a sigil appears on their bodies. On their way to their enemy land they get trapped in a very elaborate barrier. As a bonus, it would appear there are seven people with the hero crest. One of them is an impostor and possibly someone who wants to stop them in their quest.Yeah. Nothing truly original so let’s just meet the coterie:Adlet Mayer...- a self proclaimed “strongest man on earth”. He’s the most generic character You could think of. He’s honest, knowledgeable, gullible and acts before thinking. He has a lot of knowledge about fighting fiends but is a terrible judge of character. Despite cosplaying as a hero his morality is questionable, especially when it comes to Fremy. In combat he uses a lot of different tools and tricks to get an edge and defeat his opponents. I think that’s the only redeemable quality of his. That he’s not about some supernatural bs but actually uses tools, deceit and strategy.  Granted most of those strategies work only because of plot armour thicker than a neutron star, so don’t get Your hopes up.He has a tragic backstory that’s so generic and boring I couldn't care less about it.Nashetania - the most annoying character of the bunch. She’s the “saint of blades” which means she can create and control blades of different types. She’s also a princess of a country and yet everyone is ok with her leaving on a life threatening quest. I quess princesses can be bought in bulk in this land.Every Time she’s on screen (apart from the first part of the first episode) I want to turn the show off. She’s childish, loud, needy and not exactly emotionally stable. Normalu that could be an awesome starting point to an awesome character but that would actually require a competent writer.Goldov - a 16 year old warrior with two faces. A stoic one he uses on a daily basis and a jealous one that shows only when it comes to Nashetania. He’s just there to take up space. He brings nothing to the table and could be easily erased and nothing would change.Fremy Speeddraw - A petite, young sniper, I mean “The saint of gunpowder” because of the skill to create, You guessed it, gunpowder. She’s withdrawn, antisocial and distrustful to anything that’s not a dog. To be fair he’s the main focus of one of my biggest gripes with writing, but I’ll get to that. Out of everyone she’s someone who actually has something that could be called a character arc. Not a very good or original one but I’ll take what I can get at this point. She uses a rifle she loads with cartridges created partially by her power. It seems that she still needs the bullet itself. She uses her eye covered by an eyepatch to aim the gun. It looks pretty dumb but I lost hope for logic in this anime in episode one.She has a tragic backstory, because of course she does, that’s anime 101 to give it to the edgy emo kid. The problem is that the story wants me to care about her but I really don’t. She is a villain in this story. Maybe not the main one but a villain nonetheless. She killed a lot of potential braves and did it willingly. The fact that she was betrayed by her own faction doesn’t change the fact that she did it, but for some reason the writer portrays her as a tragic hero. Lazy AF.Mora Chester - saint of the mountain, seriously how many saints does a show need? She’s the head of an organisation that keeps tabs on all the saints. She’s knowledgeable about the saints and their powers, apart from Fremy, who is a new creation. Her powers allow her to cast her voice, control earth and augment her physical abilities. She’s also the only one who can control, to an extent, Chamo.Chamo Rosso - You know the trope of creepy little kids being the most psychotic and powerful? Yeah, You guessed it. This is it. Chamo is a 14 year old (although she looks to be 10) saint of the swamp. Despite having a pretty weird title and powers she’s a real powerhouse. She is able to summon and control creatures to do her biddings. She’s also a little psycho, being just too willing to torture someone even though there isn’t any real need for that.Fremy and Hans have a healthy amount of fear when it comes to fighting her, but she’s more than willing to follow Mora’s instructions.Hans Humpty - despite having the most annoying manner, he’s my favourite character in this coterie. Clever, knowledgeable, intelligent and an extremely skilled fighter. He developed his own fighting style inspired by cats and has an annoying pattern of speech when he sometimes uses cat noises. Similar to what You can see in some romcoms when a girl is trying to be cute. In his case it’s just creepy and unsettling, but I want to believe that was the point. He’s a good judge of character, seeing right through Fremy and her feelings. His also logical, analytical and methodical and the only reason why he isn’t the one who solves the case is some plot bullshit and the fact the show would be over in 6 episodes.Now let’s get to the writing. Which… isn’t all that good.First episode is just one big infodump. The characters talk about things that are common knowledge in their world but for some reason (ok, we all know it’s for the viewers) they have to verbalise everything. It’s so dumb and inorganic it almost made me facepalm. We have a narrative opening sequence. Why not use that and give more and more common knowledge info to the viewers?The main problem is that the show sets up a mystery (who is the 7th brave) and despite characters solving it at the end the SAME GODDAMN PROBLEM REMAINS, only now there is a new 7th brave. I know about reusing plot points but god damn it, this is just lazy and undermines the whole mystery aspect of the show. You just replace one piece in the same systemWhat’s worse, the clues for solving the mystery aren’t shown at the right time. Most are shown only after the characters solved parts of it. There are some but not many and despite Hans providing a solid logic, the only reason why this show is so long is plot armour of the main cast and the fact the writer wanted a more convoluted resolve.I guess I’ve seen worse mystery shows with even less to work with but in this case there is a different problem. I solved the mystery the next episode that it was introduced, but despite having the right answer I did it with none of the elements the characters used to solve it. That tells me the mystery itself was an afterthought and the writer had no idea how to wrap it up in a logical way.Another problem is that most of the cast is useless and contributes nothing. If they weren’t there nothing would change really. They are used just to pad out time and introduce drama that isn’t necessary or even properly resolved.I honestly can’t recommend this to anyone who enjoys mysteries, because this one is pretty pathetic, and I can’t recommend this to those who like action because the action in this is just generic and a lot resolved with a bootleg talk-no-jutsu. - a self proclaimed “strongest man on earth”.
